15910,this study introduces a new approach for the investigation of infections after an accidental ingestion of contaminated floodwater the concept of expected annual probability of infection eapi is introduced and implemented in an infection risk model approach by combining a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra with the four steps in flood risk assessment two groups and exposure paths are considered adults wading in floodwater and small children swimming playing in floodwater the study area is located in ghana west africa even though ghana is one of the most urbanized countries in africa it has significant problems with water resources management and public health while cholera is classified as endemic in accra the natural and human made characteristics of the capital makes it prone to flooding the results of the eapi approach show that on one hand the concentration of pathogens in floodwater and thus the risk of infection decreases with the increase of the flood magnitude on the other hand larger floods can spread the pathogens further from the point source threatening populations previously not identified as at risk by small scale floods the concept of eapi is demonstrated for cholera but it can be extended to other waterborne diseases and also different pathways of exposure requiring minimal adaptations for future applications better estimation of eapi key components and improvement points are discussed and recommendations given for all the assessment steps keywords flood risk analysis expected annual probability of infection v cholerae infection diseases urban floods 1 introduction heavy rain has a great potential to cause disruptions to the water supply networks mengel et al 2014 tutu et al 2019 and urban drainage systems leading people to drink water from untrusted sources and exposed to contaminated water sewage overflow can contaminate rivers lakes and other water sources commonly used for drinking bathing or other activities mengel et al 2014 particularly the wastewater from pit toilets and latrines can contaminate drinking and bathing water sources with faeces it is well documented that epidemic of waterborne diseases such as cholera often occur after heavy rains mengel et al 2014 thus floods can worsen the cholera spread and infections significantly here we introduce a new method compatible with a flood risk assessment approach to estimate the risk of a population being infected by v cholera the cholera agent after possible exposure to floodwater since the 1990s when the european union commission started requiring health assessments when public health could be affected by new infrastructure and construction plans scott samuel 1996 the number of health impact assessments hia has been steadily increasing lhachimi et al 2012 nevertheless it has been recognized that the hia terminology is still inconsistent veerman 2007 and that hia can be used for a variety of topics and contexts kemm 2005 as a result there is still no agreement on a unified methodology and each setting requires a different perspective and methodology kemm 2005 veerman 2007 hia with focus on urban floods is still at an early stage there exists no standard methodology or framework for quantitative and or qualitative assessment of hazards and health risks at the quantification step siculaba 2015 analysing the impact of floods on public health is a particular challenge firstly the spatial variation makes each assessment unique and secondly the heterogeneity of populations behavior of individuals and host factors makes it diverse thirdly and perhaps most complex is the temporal variation in exposures which includes not only the variation of infectious diseases along the decades but also the varying nature and intensity of a persons exposure to microbial hazards over their lifetime thomas 2009 the hia process illustrated in fig 1 is based on six core steps leading to the hia report stakeholders and policymakers receive the report with the findings and recommendations and finally the decisions and health outcome are monitored and the hia evaluated veerman 2007 the health risk assessment step hra in the hia also known as the effect analysis veerman 2007 or appraisal stage fehr et al 2014 allows for the analysis of health outcomes and the distribution of health impacts among different population groups siculaba 2015 veerman 2007 hra is the basic component of an hia framework often used to analyse public health risks and to derive strategies to mitigate risks and improve public health quality spickett et al 2010 usepa 2012 the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is a risk assessment approach to evaluate the risks and consequences to the population following exposure to microbial hazards where the probability of infection with a disease is the most important health outcome haas et al 2014 qmra can be used to assess the risk of existing and simulated planned scenarios and it is used worldwide by researchers scientist and national institutions worldwide to assess health risks associated with public exposure to contaminated water sources qmra follows the health risk assessment procedures described by the european commission 2000 and u s environmental protection agency usepa 2014 2012 which include the following main steps hazard identification exposure assessment dose response assessment and risk characterization european commission 2000 haas et al 2014 flood risk management has improved in recent decades but still little is known about the impacts of floods on human health as urban flooding and its health consequences have been ignored or underestimated in the recent decades rui et al 2018 in general more attention is paid to manage microbial contamination of surface waters because they are usually used for recreational activities however as a higher load of pathogens is found in floodwater ten veldhuis et al 2010 and thus there is a higher probability of infection it makes sense to establish and or improve guidelines to limit the exposure of the population to floodwater and to create awareness of the possible consequences tutu et al 2019 this aligns with accra s 2019 resilient strategy to help strengthen the city s ability to respond to among others emergency health situations including addressing sdg 3 good health and well being and sdg 6 clean water and sanitation the difficulty however is that there is still no standard or common approach to health risk in relation to flood exposure particularly in assessing the risk of infection there are many definitions of risk in the literature some authors refer to the result of the probability of infection model as risk of infection e g de man et al 2014 mark et al 2015 yomwan et al 2012 while others refer to it as probability of infection fewtrell 2011 nguyen et al 2017 van bijnen et al 2018 this paper investigates a method for assessing the risk of infection by v cholerae after an accidental ingestion of contaminated floodwater the concept of expected annual probability of infection eapi is introduced by integrating the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra into a flood risk assessment approach the aim is to build consensus in the flood risk community when dealing with health impacts due to contamination unlike previous studies the developed eapi keeps the four steps in the flood risk assessment intact and can thus be easily integrated in a more holistic flood management approach kranjac berisavljevic et al 2019 2 study area and data ghana is one of the most urbanized countries in the african continent mansour and esseku 2017 similar to other sub saharan african countries its urban settlements face substantial problems regarding high population density sanitation and drinking water supply afriyie and ferber 2018 mansour and esseku 2017 in accra the capital of ghana migration from the countryside to the city has been fuelled by a sense of optimism economic growth and political stability this resulted in an increase in overcrowded low income areas with poor basic infrastructure and hygiene practices peprah et al 2015 as a consequence accra suffers a high level of environmental contamination gretsch et al 2016 finkelstein 1996 and waterborne diseases in 2014 ghana recorded its worse cholera outbreak of 28 000 cases and 243 deaths and accra was the most affected mireku gyimah et al 2018 dzotsi et al 2018 donkor and mehmet 2019 cholera a disease associated with poor sanitation conditions and hygiene practices is considered endemic in accra and impacts heavily low income areas songsore 2017 the alajo district in accra ghana fig 2 is selected for this study because it is located in a flood prone area that is inundated accra metropolitan assembly and un habitat 2013 amoako and boamah 2015 owusu twum and abubakari 2019 peprah et al 2015 and has registered cases of cholera in the recent past joshua 2016 cholera cases are often registered in areas near water bodies as these are the main reservoir for the pathogen joshua 2016 and can be exacerbated by flooding during the rainy season as flooding in accra occurs every year asumadu sarkodie et al 2015 aggravated by uncontrolled and improper waste disposal in a unplanned lowland area songsore 2017 the literature suggests that cholera in alajo will continue to threaten the health and wellbeing of the population which as stated above is counterproductive to achieving of sdgs 3 and 6 alajo has an area of 1 8 km2 and around 44044 inhabitants ghana statistical service 2014 residents have mixed socio economic status robb et al 2017 and the area is classified as a third class income zone by accra metropolitan assembly owusu twum and abubakari 2019 alajo is part of the odaw river catchment characterized by great built up areas and the majority of the streams are channelized rain et al 2011 fig 3 illustrates examples of the drainage system in alajo there are large open sewers robb et al 2017 that are known to receive great amounts of solid waste especially from the population that cannot afford to pay for solid waste collection and disposal abraham and aniapam 2016 participants from abraham and aniapam 2016 survey also indicated that disposing of human waste in sewers is a common practice in addition around 20 of households in alajo discharge the wastewater into open drains due to inadequate access to sanitation facilities and services robb et al 2017 the accumulation of waste in the open sewers often leads to its blockage and thus to local flooding abraham and aniapam 2016 as the drains are heavily contaminated with pathogens they can pose a threat to the population in alajo tutu et al 2019 3 methods 3 1 risk of infection 3 1 1 from expected annual damage ead to expected annual probability of infection eapi in this study we propose to integrate the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra into the flood risk assessment to estimate the expected annual probability of infection eapi in a first step qmra is used to assess the probability of infection and in a second step their results are included in a risk assessment framework to enable the estimation of the eapi fig 4 in flood risk assessment the risk is equal to the product of the likelihood of an event exceeding a given threshold flood hazard and its negative impacts disse et al 2020 as the adverse impacts are the consequences of a flood event the probability of infection derived from qmra can be considered as one of the adverse health effects of the flood i e the impact the risk of infection is therefore the relationship between the flood likelihood and the probability of infection when assessing flood risk the risk can be conceptualised using four graphs fig 5 a graph a shows the relationship between the exceedance probability and the return period graph b shows the simplified relationship between the flooded area and the flood return period graph c shows the vulnerability to damages from flooding graph d relates the exceedance probability and the flood damage consequences the blue area under the risk curve represents the expected annual damage ead the ead represents the mean value of the damages over years and can be estimated by integrating the risk curve the risk curve also known as damage curve results from the relation between the exceedance probability t r year flood and the damage x p r 1 ead x 0 1 x p r d p r following this concept the eapi by v cholerae could be estimated from the relation between the exceedance probability and the probability of infection health impact fig 5 b shows the steps for assessing the risk of infection following a flood risk assessment procedure hazard exposure to pathogen in floodwater vulnerability to infection risk of infection and how the eapi is estimated graph a shows the relationship between the exceedance probability and concentration of pathogens in the floodwater graph b shows the simplified relationship between the dose ingested number of pathogens and the concentration of pathogen in floodwater graph c shows the estimated probability of infection as a function of the amount of pathogens ingested dose graph d relates the exceedance probability and the health damage probability of infection the area under the risk curve represents the eapi for a population exposed to contaminated floodwater 3 1 2 workflow for estimation of the eapi fig 6 shows a general overview of the workflow proposed in this study the workflow starts with the hazard estimation section 3 2 which includes the estimation of the initial pathogen concentration at the sources of contamination i e drains rivers flood hazard and the pathogens concentration in the floodwater afterwards the exposure to pathogens is estimated section 3 3 here it is defined how the population is exposed to the contaminated water and the volume ingested according to the exposure route using the estimated pathogen concentration and the volume of pathogens ingested the dose can be obtained finally the eapi can be quantified section 3 5 based on the probability of infection section 3 4 3 2 hazard 3 2 1 pathogen identification initial concentration when estimating the initial pathogen concentration it is assumed that the pathogens in the drains in alajo are constant see fig 3 the source of pathogen load is believed to be from toilet discharge robb et al 2017 waste disposal from humans and open defecation abraham and aniapam 2016 in the absence of real measurements a constant concentration value of 10 4 v cholerae 100ml is assumed for the open drains this value falls within the concentration range of v cholerae measured by mark et al 2015 in dry and wet weather in a slum area of dhaka bangladesh 3 2 2 flood hazard and concentration of v cholerae in floodwater flood events were hydrodynamic simulated with a 2d numerical model details are given in section 3 6 professor ahadzie from the kwame nkrumah university of science and technology ghana provided the necessary input data for the flood simulation including digital elevation model dem rainfall intensities and land use for the simulations a digital elevation model of 20m resolution is used rainfall intensity is corrected for infiltration through the use of the soil conservation service scs curve number method due to model complexity and in order to optimize computation efforts the 2d flood model is run separately for the alajo neighbourhood fig 2 all inflows accounting for the whole catchment upstream contribution are previously estimated using a full scale version of the 2d model of the entire catchment and added as hydrographs to the initial condition files as such a considerably more efficient model is built for the alajo area enabling the simulation of the pathogens inside the study area to be more efficient to estimate the concentration and transport of v cholerae in surface floodwater the advection dispersion equation ade module in p dwave is activated with this module p dwave computed not only the water depth and flow velocity but allowed the drains water and surface runoff mixture quality analysis in function of time and space 3 3 exposure to pathogens in floodwater 3 3 1 exposure route in this step information about the population exposed is gathered which included how the population can get in contact with the pathogen exposure to flood contaminated water may happen in different ways including oral ingestion inhalation of aerosols from contaminated water or use of utensils washed in dirty water and intensities sales ortells and medema 2014 in this study two typical exposure pathways are considered adults wading in floodwater and small children swimming or playing in floodwater this is supported by several authors that stated the significant difference in the probability of infection between adults and children i e andersen 2015 fuhrimann et al 2016 haas et al 2014 hammond and mark 2014 nguyen et al 2017 3 3 2 volume of floodwater ingested the volume of water ingested applied for the health risk assessment are shown in table 1 in this study the assumed mean values of ingested volume for each exposed group are 0 0031 ml for adults wading in floodwater and 37 12 ml for small children swimming playing in floodwater table 1 illustrates the probability density functions pdf and parameters of the volumes of floodwater ingested per exposed group 3 3 3 dose the dose represents the number of microorganisms ingested by a host within an exposure haas et al 2014 teunis et al 1996 assuming that the amount ingested in a single exposure and the concentration of microorganisms in water are statistically independent the dose can be estimated by 2 d c v in which c is the mean concentration of pathogens in the water and v is the mean consumption of water per exposure route in this study the dose used in the infection probability model is calculated using the estimated pathogen concentration value for each grid point as described in section 3 2 and the assumed mean volume ingested for the two pathways i e v 0 0031 ml for adults and v 37 12 ml for small children 3 4 vulnerability to infection probability of infection in this step the probability of infection is estimated using the information obtained in the previous steps to achieve it a dose response model is applied the dose response model aims to establish a mathematical relationship between the dose any non negative number and the probability of an adverse effect infection sickness etc in the exposed population haas et al 2014 usepa 2012 in other words it is the result of the ingestion of a certain amount of microorganisms teunis et al 1996 the probability of infection is however not only dependent on the concentration of pathogens ingested but also on whether the pathogen succeeds in colonizing the host this can result from individual differences for example malnourished children are more susceptible to infection family income hygiene habits and personal skin health status also impact the occurrence of infection in this study we focus on the probability of infection which is the first sign of exposure to a pathogen and not on the development of symptoms and illness teunis et al 1996 for an infection to occur a microorganism must survive in the host assuming that the microorganism has r probability of causing an infection the probability of infection p inf after exposition to j microorganisms can be described as follows according to teunis et al 1996 3 p inf j k 1 j p s u r k j k 1 j j k r k 1 r j k where p s u r k j is the survival probability of k microorganisms after ingestion of j microorganisms a simple exponential model can be used to quantify the individual probability of infection assuming that a minimum number of organisms have survived in the host to cause infection and that the microorganisms are randomly distributed poisson haas et al 2014 beta poisson models are generally used when the probability r is not constant teunis et al 1996 only few cysts or virions of the pathogen can already cause infection andersen 2015 or when the survival rate of the microorganism is influenced by different pathogens sterk et al 2008 the probability of infection can be expressed as 4 p i n f 1 1 d β α where d is the dose and with β α the above equation is used to estimate the probability of infection after ingestion of v cholerae as this model was the best fit in some experiments such as in cash et al 1974 and fao who 2005 and has also been applied in a number of studies i e hammond and mark 2014 mark et al 2015 the beta distribution parameters values of α 0 169 and β 2305 are used following mark et al 2015 3 5 expected annual probability of infection eapi the expected annual probability of infection eapi results from the integral over the exceedance probability and the probability of infection calculated in section 3 4 the probability of a flood event flood hazard can be expressed by the return period t r t r is the average time of occurrence of two events of the same magnitude foudi and osés eraso 2014 since the return period is a measure of the frequency of an event it can be interpreted as the reciprocal of the probability of occurrence of a flood in one year foudi and osés eraso 2014 5 t r 1 p r where p r is the exceedance probability the eapi is the result of a trapezoidal integration of each grid point of the probability of infection estimated per flood return period and the probability of exceedance the general trapezoidal integration for non uniform spacing between pair of points is represented as 6 eapi x a b 1 2 n 1 n x n 1 x n f x n f x n 1 where a x 1 x 2 x n x n 1 b and x n 1 x n is the spacing between each consecutive pair of points 3 6 p dwave parallel diffusive wave model 3 6 1 hydrodinamic component the flood inundation model used in this study is the parallel diffusive wave p dwave this is an explicit first order finite volume scheme the inertial terms are neglected in the 2d shallow water equations the equations are 7 dh dt uh r 8 g

given by 10 u h 2 3 s wx 2 s wy 2 1 4 n where s wx d h z dx is the water level gradient in x direction s wy d h z dy is the water level gradient in y direction further details and results in benchmark tests can be found in leandro et al 2014 3 6 2 concentration and transport component to estimate the concentration and transport of v cholerae in surface floodwater the advection dispersion equation ade module is implemented in p dwave the advection dispersion equation is expressed as follows mark et al 2015 11 t hc x uhc y vhc x h d x c x y h d y c y in which c is the concentration pathogens ml u and v are the horizontal velocity components x and y directions obtained in each time step of the simulation m s h is the water depth obtained in each time step of the simulation m and d x and d y are the dispersion coefficients x and y directions 0 01 and 0 01 m2 s the initial concentration values of v cholerae used in the advection diffusion equation is described in section 3 2 considering the short time span in which the events take place no decay growth of the pathogen is taken into account 4 results 4 1 flood hazard and concentration of v cholerae in floodwater in the hazard step the flood event and the transport and dilution of v cholerae in the floodwater is estimated fig 7 illustrates the maximum concentration of pathogens in the flood inundation area for the different flood return periods considered in this study a higher flood return period displays a larger inundation area when compared to an event with lower magnitude nevertheless when comparing the concentration of v cholerae in the lower part of the neighborhood confluence of the rivers odaw and onyasia the pattern changes a lower concentration of pathogens is seen for larger flood return periods 4 2 exposure to pathogens in floodwater after the application of the water level threshold section 3 3 to the flood hazard simulation the dose is calculated the dose is calculated for each point of the grid it is exemplary shown here for a single point locate at the centre of the study area fig 8 shows the relation between the concentration of v cholerae in the floodwater and the dose ingested for the two exposure pathways i e adults wading in floodwater and small children swimming playing in floodwater 4 3 vulnerability to infection with the dose calculated in the previous section the probability of infection for the two exposure pathways adults wading in floodwater and small children swimming playing in floodwater can be estimated for each grid table 2 summarizes the mean probability of infection value for the nine flood return periods considered in the study fig 9 shows the probability of infection for the point selected for analysis for the two pathways 4 4 expected annual probability of infection eapi in this study nine different return periods 2 5 10 25 50 100 250 500 and 1000 year are used which many authors consider as sufficient to describe a risk curve foudi and osés eraso 2014 ward et al 2011 the eapi is estimated in this study for the entire alajo neighborhood in order to consider the spatial differences nevertheless one point at the centre of the area is also selected to observe closely the influence of the different return periods in the concentration of pathogens estimation and thus in the probability of infection fig 10 illustrates the trapezoidal integration to determine the eapi obtained from the multidimensional array created to store the probability of infection for each flood return period fig 11 illustrates the expected annual probability of infection by v cholerae for the population in alajo accra after being exposed to the floodwater the maps show higher values in red in the upper part of the neighborhood close to drains while lower values are seen in the lower part in blue especially along the rivers odaw and onyasia and in their confluence for which dilution effects become more evident fig 11 b table 3 summarises the main statistics by comparing the maps and observing the statistics it is possible to see that small children have a higher expected annual probability of infection than adults by having a closer look at d graphs it can be observed that for the flood of 2 5 10 25 and 50 years return period there is no probability of getting infected as no floodwater reached the location or at least the water level is below the threshold set nevertheless from a flood return period of 100 years there is a high peak of probability of infection which decreases with the increase of the flood magnitude at this point the open drains burst its banks hence a peak is reached after dilution of the pathogens with increase in flood magnitude takes place and probability of infection decreases 5 discussion 5 1 hazard similar behavior of the distribution of pathogen concentrations in flooded waters in relation to the inundation areas with different return periods was also observed by kazama et al 2012 the authors illustrated the distribution of the risk estimated based on the concentration of pathogens decreasing with the increase of flood magnitude in our study we observe additionally that the spread of the concentration further away from the point sources often represent a threat to areas that were not previously thought as vulnerable fig 7 5 2 exposure to pathogens in floodwater fig 8 shows that there is a relation between the concentration of v cholerae in the floodwater and the dose ingested it can be observed that the greater the concentration of pathogens the greater is the dose number of v cholerae which can be ingested the assessment of the exposure of the populations is still very subjective and depends on many assumptions unfortunately a standard approach to assess the exposure to microorganisms in floodwater does not exist in the literature for low income countries like ghana andersen 2015 in this study the volume of floodwater ingested used for the two pathways is based on literature studies from high income countries namely on the work of schets et al 2011 and dorevitch et al 2011 the former estimates the volume of water swallowed by swimmers in fresh water seawater and swimming pools and the latter on the volume ingested by common limited contact water during recreation activities 5 3 vulnerability to infection in the vulnerability of infection step it is possible to observe the relation between the number of pathogens ingested dose and the probability of infection fig 9 in the literature authors usually did not state which flood return period was considered in the study for the estimation of the probability of getting infected by v cholerae mark et al 2015 making it difficult to compare it to the results obtained in this study fig 9 shows nevertheless very clearly that the greater the dose ingested the higher is the probability of being infected 5 4 risk of infection the risk of the alajo s population being infected is particularly high near the drainage network fig 11 however for large events the transport of pathogens takes place and others areas previously not affected can become also at risk figs 12 and 13 show the eapi estimated by combining a qmra with the four steps in flood risk assessment nevertheless because of the lack of available surveillance data and epidemiological studies it is not possible to validate the results of this study nor to estimate the contribution of direct exposure to floodwater to the cholera cases while andersen 2015 points out the low number of health assessments which validate the results sterk et al 2008 also affirms that epidemiological studies are limited because it involve high costs e g laboratory tests and are resource intense particularly in the aftermath of floods similar patterns of risk of infection were observed between adults and small children fig 11 and table 3 by other authors sterk et al 2008 ten veldhuis et al 2010 mark et al 2015 even when different pathogens are investigated the average observed risk of infection for children is higher than compared to adults this is because it is often assumed that children have a higher ingestion of water in the exposure assessment step as they usually are in closer contact with possible sources of infection when playing running or swimming in flooded waters 5 5 uncertainty sources limitations and recommendations several points in the hazard assessment steps can be improved first the concentration of v cholerae was assumed to be uniformly distributed along the drains however pathogens are more often distributed heterogeneously in the environment usepa 2012 second the initial concentration of pathogen was based on literature values to increase the reliability in the estimations direct sampling of the contamination sources is advised ten veldhuis et al 2010 nevertheless this procedure also has drawbacks for example it requires good planning process it entails higher costs can be deemed unsafe and it is still prone to errors during the measuring process de man et al 2014 schmidt and emelko 2011 additionally external sources of pathogens could be considered pathogen loads from upper catchment may be transported further downstream and affect the concentrations of the pathogens in our particular study area gretsch et al 2016 affirms that as drains in accra usually do not cross between neighborhoods the contamination from drains overflow is primarily locally bounded hence we do not expect this issue to be an important source of uncertainty in our study the p dwave showed to be a good tool for estimating the concentration of pathogens in floodwater with the inclusion of the advection diffusion module however improvements in the concentration estimation could be explored such as the inclusion of the growth or the decay of pathogen this should become of particular relevance if one desires to reassess the eapi after the occurrence of the flood event e g 2 or 3 days another point that can be improved is related with exposure it is worth noting that an infection will develop to an illness depending on the host conditions such as the health preconditions i e genetics life stage nutrition and immunity haas et al 2014 prüss üstün et al 2003 usepa 2012 thus it is important to gather information about populations behavior and characteristics to avoid overestimation of infections haas et al 2014 further uncertainty stems from the estimation of the probability of infection the beta distribution parameters used in this study is based on clinical trials with controlled water samples ideally a dose response assessment should be done for each population of concern however it can be resource consuming and still remains a source of uncertainties as experiments are carried with a narrow population group usepa 2012 finally it should also be mentioned that the results of the expected annual probability of infection estimated could not be compared with other studies few studies e g mark et al 2015 calculated the probability of becoming infected by v cholerae following the ingestion of floodwater thus the eapi estimated in this study need necessarily to be interpreted with caution as mentioned earlier other sources of pathogens beside direct ingestion should be included for a comprehensive assessment of cholera risk alajo contains slum areas which makes the population to be exposed to several other environmental risk factors joshua 2016 mark et al 2015 kusimi and yeboah 2019 drinking water sources can become contaminated during flooding or by extraction of polluted shallow groundwater or even by handling of water transportation mengel et al 2014 furthermore piped water represents a threat to public health failures in the water treatment process occur and water can become contaminated in the distribution network itself through the intrusion of pollution in the pipes machdar et al 2013 6 conclusions this study introduced a new concept for investigating the probability of infection of a population once exposed to contaminated floodwater termed the expected annual probability of infection eapi the eapi results from the combination of the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra and the four steps in flood risk assessment the infection risk model approach for estimating the eapi was demonstrated for v cholerae for the population in alajo accra ghana it was found that the risk of infection for adults wading in floodwater is considerably lower than for small children swimming playing in floodwater is it was also observed that the concentration of pathogens in floodwater decreases with the increase of the flood magnitude on one hand flood events need to be large enough for water to spill out of the drains and flood contaminating the neighboring areas on the other hand once this tipping point is found larger floods will spread the pathogens further away from the point source and at the same time reduce the concentration of pathogens by the effect of dilution the infection risk model developed in this study can be used additionally for a range of other waterborne infection diseases and for different pathways of exposure requiring only minimal adaptations the 2d parallel diffusive wave model p dwave with the advection dispersion equation ade module was overall a good tool to estimate the pathogen s concentration spread through the floodwater in alajo in terms of spatial variability by including the probability of infection equation into the flood model disaster management authorities are also able to monitor the vulnerable areas in real time this can help in focusing emergency actions in those areas and reduce the impact cause by outbreaks the cholera infection risk modeling introduced here add scientific evidence that can help to support future policies these can lead to substantiated increase of the community s awareness about the local risks and help in building community resilience within a flood risk management approach to cholera in the infected areas furthermore priority areas can be identified based on the geographical distribution of the risk of infection and on scientific decision making at different scales of intervention prediction of cholera infections and outbreaks is still challenging it is dependant and greatly influenced not only by local environmental but also by social characteristics in this study it was discussed that the current health risk models involve many assumptions and carry many uncertainties in all assessment steps although the cholera infection risk estimated in this study assumed that the pathogen hazard comes from contaminated floodwater it is well known that the population in alajo are exposed daily to other possible v cholerae sources contaminated drinking water and food issues of inadequate sanitation hygienic behavior and waste and wastewater management in the area also contribute to the risk of infection accra needs to invest in its basic urban water infrastructure and in sustainable management practices if it wishes to reduce the risk of the population in alajo to be repeatedly infected by v cholerae coming from contaminated floodwater this study therefore makes an important contribution to achieving these aims by developing a tool that can help authorities to plan and prioritise measures to counter the risk of infection it is thus believed it aligns with addressing the global sdgs and contributes to the improvement of public health and well being and reduction of the burden of infectious diseases declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
15910,this study introduces a new approach for the investigation of infections after an accidental ingestion of contaminated floodwater the concept of expected annual probability of infection eapi is introduced and implemented in an infection risk model approach by combining a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra with the four steps in flood risk assessment two groups and exposure paths are considered adults wading in floodwater and small children swimming playing in floodwater the study area is located in ghana west africa even though ghana is one of the most urbanized countries in africa it has significant problems with water resources management and public health while cholera is classified as endemic in accra the natural and human made characteristics of the capital makes it prone to flooding the results of the eapi approach show that on one hand the concentration of pathogens in floodwater and thus the risk of infection decreases with the increase of the flood magnitude on the other hand larger floods can spread the pathogens further from the point source threatening populations previously not identified as at risk by small scale floods the concept of eapi is demonstrated for cholera but it can be extended to other waterborne diseases and also different pathways of exposure requiring minimal adaptations for future applications better estimation of eapi key components and improvement points are discussed and recommendations given for all the assessment steps keywords flood risk analysis expected annual probability of infection v cholerae infection diseases urban floods 1 introduction heavy rain has a great potential to cause disruptions to the water supply networks mengel et al 2014 tutu et al 2019 and urban drainage systems leading people to drink water from untrusted sources and exposed to contaminated water sewage overflow can contaminate rivers lakes and other water sources commonly used for drinking bathing or other activities mengel et al 2014 particularly the wastewater from pit toilets and latrines can contaminate drinking and bathing water sources with faeces it is well documented that epidemic of waterborne diseases such as cholera often occur after heavy rains mengel et al 2014 thus floods can worsen the cholera spread and infections significantly here we introduce a new method compatible with a flood risk assessment approach to estimate the risk of a population being infected by v cholera the cholera agent after possible exposure to floodwater since the 1990s when the european union commission started requiring health assessments when public health could be affected by new infrastructure and construction plans scott samuel 1996 the number of health impact assessments hia has been steadily increasing lhachimi et al 2012 nevertheless it has been recognized that the hia terminology is still inconsistent veerman 2007 and that hia can be used for a variety of topics and contexts kemm 2005 as a result there is still no agreement on a unified methodology and each setting requires a different perspective and methodology kemm 2005 veerman 2007 hia with focus on urban floods is still at an early stage there exists no standard methodology or framework for quantitative and or qualitative assessment of hazards and health risks at the quantification step siculaba 2015 analysing the impact of floods on public health is a particular challenge firstly the spatial variation makes each assessment unique and secondly the heterogeneity of populations behavior of individuals and host factors makes it diverse thirdly and perhaps most complex is the temporal variation in exposures which includes not only the variation of infectious diseases along the decades but also the varying nature and intensity of a persons exposure to microbial hazards over their lifetime thomas 2009 the hia process illustrated in fig 1 is based on six core steps leading to the hia report stakeholders and policymakers receive the report with the findings and recommendations and finally the decisions and health outcome are monitored and the hia evaluated veerman 2007 the health risk assessment step hra in the hia also known as the effect analysis veerman 2007 or appraisal stage fehr et al 2014 allows for the analysis of health outcomes and the distribution of health impacts among different population groups siculaba 2015 veerman 2007 hra is the basic component of an hia framework often used to analyse public health risks and to derive strategies to mitigate risks and improve public health quality spickett et al 2010 usepa 2012 the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is a risk assessment approach to evaluate the risks and consequences to the population following exposure to microbial hazards where the probability of infection with a disease is the most important health outcome haas et al 2014 qmra can be used to assess the risk of existing and simulated planned scenarios and it is used worldwide by researchers scientist and national institutions worldwide to assess health risks associated with public exposure to contaminated water sources qmra follows the health risk assessment procedures described by the european commission 2000 and u s environmental protection agency usepa 2014 2012 which include the following main steps hazard identification exposure assessment dose response assessment and risk characterization european commission 2000 haas et al 2014 flood risk management has improved in recent decades but still little is known about the impacts of floods on human health as urban flooding and its health consequences have been ignored or underestimated in the recent decades rui et al 2018 in general more attention is paid to manage microbial contamination of surface waters because they are usually used for recreational activities however as a higher load of pathogens is found in floodwater ten veldhuis et al 2010 and thus there is a higher probability of infection it makes sense to establish and or improve guidelines to limit the exposure of the population to floodwater and to create awareness of the possible consequences tutu et al 2019 this aligns with accra s 2019 resilient strategy to help strengthen the city s ability to respond to among others emergency health situations including addressing sdg 3 good health and well being and sdg 6 clean water and sanitation the difficulty however is that there is still no standard or common approach to health risk in relation to flood exposure particularly in assessing the risk of infection there are many definitions of risk in the literature some authors refer to the result of the probability of infection model as risk of infection e g de man et al 2014 mark et al 2015 yomwan et al 2012 while others refer to it as probability of infection fewtrell 2011 nguyen et al 2017 van bijnen et al 2018 this paper investigates a method for assessing the risk of infection by v cholerae after an accidental ingestion of contaminated floodwater the concept of expected annual probability of infection eapi is introduced by integrating the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra into a flood risk assessment approach the aim is to build consensus in the flood risk community when dealing with health impacts due to contamination unlike previous studies the developed eapi keeps the four steps in the flood risk assessment intact and can thus be easily integrated in a more holistic flood management approach kranjac berisavljevic et al 2019 2 study area and data ghana is one of the most urbanized countries in the african continent mansour and esseku 2017 similar to other sub saharan african countries its urban settlements face substantial problems regarding high population density sanitation and drinking water supply afriyie and ferber 2018 mansour and esseku 2017 in accra the capital of ghana migration from the countryside to the city has been fuelled by a sense of optimism economic growth and political stability this resulted in an increase in overcrowded low income areas with poor basic infrastructure and hygiene practices peprah et al 2015 as a consequence accra suffers a high level of environmental contamination gretsch et al 2016 finkelstein 1996 and waterborne diseases in 2014 ghana recorded its worse cholera outbreak of 28 000 cases and 243 deaths and accra was the most affected mireku gyimah et al 2018 dzotsi et al 2018 donkor and mehmet 2019 cholera a disease associated with poor sanitation conditions and hygiene practices is considered endemic in accra and impacts heavily low income areas songsore 2017 the alajo district in accra ghana fig 2 is selected for this study because it is located in a flood prone area that is inundated accra metropolitan assembly and un habitat 2013 amoako and boamah 2015 owusu twum and abubakari 2019 peprah et al 2015 and has registered cases of cholera in the recent past joshua 2016 cholera cases are often registered in areas near water bodies as these are the main reservoir for the pathogen joshua 2016 and can be exacerbated by flooding during the rainy season as flooding in accra occurs every year asumadu sarkodie et al 2015 aggravated by uncontrolled and improper waste disposal in a unplanned lowland area songsore 2017 the literature suggests that cholera in alajo will continue to threaten the health and wellbeing of the population which as stated above is counterproductive to achieving of sdgs 3 and 6 alajo has an area of 1 8 km2 and around 44044 inhabitants ghana statistical service 2014 residents have mixed socio economic status robb et al 2017 and the area is classified as a third class income zone by accra metropolitan assembly owusu twum and abubakari 2019 alajo is part of the odaw river catchment characterized by great built up areas and the majority of the streams are channelized rain et al 2011 fig 3 illustrates examples of the drainage system in alajo there are large open sewers robb et al 2017 that are known to receive great amounts of solid waste especially from the population that cannot afford to pay for solid waste collection and disposal abraham and aniapam 2016 participants from abraham and aniapam 2016 survey also indicated that disposing of human waste in sewers is a common practice in addition around 20 of households in alajo discharge the wastewater into open drains due to inadequate access to sanitation facilities and services robb et al 2017 the accumulation of waste in the open sewers often leads to its blockage and thus to local flooding abraham and aniapam 2016 as the drains are heavily contaminated with pathogens they can pose a threat to the population in alajo tutu et al 2019 3 methods 3 1 risk of infection 3 1 1 from expected annual damage ead to expected annual probability of infection eapi in this study we propose to integrate the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra into the flood risk assessment to estimate the expected annual probability of infection eapi in a first step qmra is used to assess the probability of infection and in a second step their results are included in a risk assessment framework to enable the estimation of the eapi fig 4 in flood risk assessment the risk is equal to the product of the likelihood of an event exceeding a given threshold flood hazard and its negative impacts disse et al 2020 as the adverse impacts are the consequences of a flood event the probability of infection derived from qmra can be considered as one of the adverse health effects of the flood i e the impact the risk of infection is therefore the relationship between the flood likelihood and the probability of infection when assessing flood risk the risk can be conceptualised using four graphs fig 5 a graph a shows the relationship between the exceedance probability and the return period graph b shows the simplified relationship between the flooded area and the flood return period graph c shows the vulnerability to damages from flooding graph d relates the exceedance probability and the flood damage consequences the blue area under the risk curve represents the expected annual damage ead the ead represents the mean value of the damages over years and can be estimated by integrating the risk curve the risk curve also known as damage curve results from the relation between the exceedance probability t r year flood and the damage x p r 1 ead x 0 1 x p r d p r following this concept the eapi by v cholerae could be estimated from the relation between the exceedance probability and the probability of infection health impact fig 5 b shows the steps for assessing the risk of infection following a flood risk assessment procedure hazard exposure to pathogen in floodwater vulnerability to infection risk of infection and how the eapi is estimated graph a shows the relationship between the exceedance probability and concentration of pathogens in the floodwater graph b shows the simplified relationship between the dose ingested number of pathogens and the concentration of pathogen in floodwater graph c shows the estimated probability of infection as a function of the amount of pathogens ingested dose graph d relates the exceedance probability and the health damage probability of infection the area under the risk curve represents the eapi for a population exposed to contaminated floodwater 3 1 2 workflow for estimation of the eapi fig 6 shows a general overview of the workflow proposed in this study the workflow starts with the hazard estimation section 3 2 which includes the estimation of the initial pathogen concentration at the sources of contamination i e drains rivers flood hazard and the pathogens concentration in the floodwater afterwards the exposure to pathogens is estimated section 3 3 here it is defined how the population is exposed to the contaminated water and the volume ingested according to the exposure route using the estimated pathogen concentration and the volume of pathogens ingested the dose can be obtained finally the eapi can be quantified section 3 5 based on the probability of infection section 3 4 3 2 hazard 3 2 1 pathogen identification initial concentration when estimating the initial pathogen concentration it is assumed that the pathogens in the drains in alajo are constant see fig 3 the source of pathogen load is believed to be from toilet discharge robb et al 2017 waste disposal from humans and open defecation abraham and aniapam 2016 in the absence of real measurements a constant concentration value of 10 4 v cholerae 100ml is assumed for the open drains this value falls within the concentration range of v cholerae measured by mark et al 2015 in dry and wet weather in a slum area of dhaka bangladesh 3 2 2 flood hazard and concentration of v cholerae in floodwater flood events were hydrodynamic simulated with a 2d numerical model details are given in section 3 6 professor ahadzie from the kwame nkrumah university of science and technology ghana provided the necessary input data for the flood simulation including digital elevation model dem rainfall intensities and land use for the simulations a digital elevation model of 20m resolution is used rainfall intensity is corrected for infiltration through the use of the soil conservation service scs curve number method due to model complexity and in order to optimize computation efforts the 2d flood model is run separately for the alajo neighbourhood fig 2 all inflows accounting for the whole catchment upstream contribution are previously estimated using a full scale version of the 2d model of the entire catchment and added as hydrographs to the initial condition files as such a considerably more efficient model is built for the alajo area enabling the simulation of the pathogens inside the study area to be more efficient to estimate the concentration and transport of v cholerae in surface floodwater the advection dispersion equation ade module in p dwave is activated with this module p dwave computed not only the water depth and flow velocity but allowed the drains water and surface runoff mixture quality analysis in function of time and space 3 3 exposure to pathogens in floodwater 3 3 1 exposure route in this step information about the population exposed is gathered which included how the population can get in contact with the pathogen exposure to flood contaminated water may happen in different ways including oral ingestion inhalation of aerosols from contaminated water or use of utensils washed in dirty water and intensities sales ortells and medema 2014 in this study two typical exposure pathways are considered adults wading in floodwater and small children swimming or playing in floodwater this is supported by several authors that stated the significant difference in the probability of infection between adults and children i e andersen 2015 fuhrimann et al 2016 haas et al 2014 hammond and mark 2014 nguyen et al 2017 3 3 2 volume of floodwater ingested the volume of water ingested applied for the health risk assessment are shown in table 1 in this study the assumed mean values of ingested volume for each exposed group are 0 0031 ml for adults wading in floodwater and 37 12 ml for small children swimming playing in floodwater table 1 illustrates the probability density functions pdf and parameters of the volumes of floodwater ingested per exposed group 3 3 3 dose the dose represents the number of microorganisms ingested by a host within an exposure haas et al 2014 teunis et al 1996 assuming that the amount ingested in a single exposure and the concentration of microorganisms in water are statistically independent the dose can be estimated by 2 d c v in which c is the mean concentration of pathogens in the water and v is the mean consumption of water per exposure route in this study the dose used in the infection probability model is calculated using the estimated pathogen concentration value for each grid point as described in section 3 2 and the assumed mean volume ingested for the two pathways i e v 0 0031 ml for adults and v 37 12 ml for small children 3 4 vulnerability to infection probability of infection in this step the probability of infection is estimated using the information obtained in the previous steps to achieve it a dose response model is applied the dose response model aims to establish a mathematical relationship between the dose any non negative number and the probability of an adverse effect infection sickness etc in the exposed population haas et al 2014 usepa 2012 in other words it is the result of the ingestion of a certain amount of microorganisms teunis et al 1996 the probability of infection is however not only dependent on the concentration of pathogens ingested but also on whether the pathogen succeeds in colonizing the host this can result from individual differences for example malnourished children are more susceptible to infection family income hygiene habits and personal skin health status also impact the occurrence of infection in this study we focus on the probability of infection which is the first sign of exposure to a pathogen and not on the development of symptoms and illness teunis et al 1996 for an infection to occur a microorganism must survive in the host assuming that the microorganism has r probability of causing an infection the probability of infection p inf after exposition to j microorganisms can be described as follows according to teunis et al 1996 3 p inf j k 1 j p s u r k j k 1 j j k r k 1 r j k where p s u r k j is the survival probability of k microorganisms after ingestion of j microorganisms a simple exponential model can be used to quantify the individual probability of infection assuming that a minimum number of organisms have survived in the host to cause infection and that the microorganisms are randomly distributed poisson haas et al 2014 beta poisson models are generally used when the probability r is not constant teunis et al 1996 only few cysts or virions of the pathogen can already cause infection andersen 2015 or when the survival rate of the microorganism is influenced by different pathogens sterk et al 2008 the probability of infection can be expressed as 4 p i n f 1 1 d β α where d is the dose and with β α the above equation is used to estimate the probability of infection after ingestion of v cholerae as this model was the best fit in some experiments such as in cash et al 1974 and fao who 2005 and has also been applied in a number of studies i e hammond and mark 2014 mark et al 2015 the beta distribution parameters values of α 0 169 and β 2305 are used following mark et al 2015 3 5 expected annual probability of infection eapi the expected annual probability of infection eapi results from the integral over the exceedance probability and the probability of infection calculated in section 3 4 the probability of a flood event flood hazard can be expressed by the return period t r t r is the average time of occurrence of two events of the same magnitude foudi and osés eraso 2014 since the return period is a measure of the frequency of an event it can be interpreted as the reciprocal of the probability of occurrence of a flood in one year foudi and osés eraso 2014 5 t r 1 p r where p r is the exceedance probability the eapi is the result of a trapezoidal integration of each grid point of the probability of infection estimated per flood return period and the probability of exceedance the general trapezoidal integration for non uniform spacing between pair of points is represented as 6 eapi x a b 1 2 n 1 n x n 1 x n f x n f x n 1 where a x 1 x 2 x n x n 1 b and x n 1 x n is the spacing between each consecutive pair of points 3 6 p dwave parallel diffusive wave model 3 6 1 hydrodinamic component the flood inundation model used in this study is the parallel diffusive wave p dwave this is an explicit first order finite volume scheme the inertial terms are neglected in the 2d shallow water equations the equations are 7 dh dt uh r 8 g

tests can be found in leandro et al 2014 3 6 2 concentration and transport component to estimate the concentration and transport of v cholerae in surface floodwater the advection dispersion equation ade module is implemented in p dwave the advection dispersion equation is expressed as follows mark et al 2015 11 t hc x uhc y vhc x h d x c x y h d y c y in which c is the concentration pathogens ml u and v are the horizontal velocity components x and y directions obtained in each time step of the simulation m s h is the water depth obtained in each time step of the simulation m and d x and d y are the dispersion coefficients x and y directions 0 01 and 0 01 m2 s the initial concentration values of v cholerae used in the advection diffusion equation is described in section 3 2 considering the short time span in which the events take place no decay growth of the pathogen is taken into account 4 results 4 1 flood hazard and concentration of v cholerae in floodwater in the hazard step the flood event and the transport and dilution of v cholerae in the floodwater is estimated fig 7 illustrates the maximum concentration of pathogens in the flood inundation area for the different flood return periods considered in this study a higher flood return period displays a larger inundation area when compared to an event with lower magnitude nevertheless when comparing the concentration of v cholerae in the lower part of the neighborhood confluence of the rivers odaw and onyasia the pattern changes a lower concentration of pathogens is seen for larger flood return periods 4 2 exposure to pathogens in floodwater after the application of the water level threshold section 3 3 to the flood hazard simulation the dose is calculated the dose is calculated for each point of the grid it is exemplary shown here for a single point locate at the centre of the study area fig 8 shows the relation between the concentration of v cholerae in the floodwater and the dose ingested for the two exposure pathways i e adults wading in floodwater and small children swimming playing in floodwater 4 3 vulnerability to infection with the dose calculated in the previous section the probability of infection for the two exposure pathways adults wading in floodwater and small children swimming playing in floodwater can be estimated for each grid table 2 summarizes the mean probability of infection value for the nine flood return periods considered in the study fig 9 shows the probability of infection for the point selected for analysis for the two pathways 4 4 expected annual probability of infection eapi in this study nine different return periods 2 5 10 25 50 100 250 500 and 1000 year are used which many authors consider as sufficient to describe a risk curve foudi and osés eraso 2014 ward et al 2011 the eapi is estimated in this study for the entire alajo neighborhood in order to consider the spatial differences nevertheless one point at the centre of the area is also selected to observe closely the influence of the different return periods in the concentration of pathogens estimation and thus in the probability of infection fig 10 illustrates the trapezoidal integration to determine the eapi obtained from the multidimensional array created to store the probability of infection for each flood return period fig 11 illustrates the expected annual probability of infection by v cholerae for the population in alajo accra after being exposed to the floodwater the maps show higher values in red in the upper part of the neighborhood close to drains while lower values are seen in the lower part in blue especially along the rivers odaw and onyasia and in their confluence for which dilution effects become more evident fig 11 b table 3 summarises the main statistics by comparing the maps and observing the statistics it is possible to see that small children have a higher expected annual probability of infection than adults by having a closer look at d graphs it can be observed that for the flood of 2 5 10 25 and 50 years return period there is no probability of getting infected as no floodwater reached the location or at least the water level is below the threshold set nevertheless from a flood return period of 100 years there is a high peak of probability of infection which decreases with the increase of the flood magnitude at this point the open drains burst its banks hence a peak is reached after dilution of the pathogens with increase in flood magnitude takes place and probability of infection decreases 5 discussion 5 1 hazard similar behavior of the distribution of pathogen concentrations in flooded waters in relation to the inundation areas with different return periods was also observed by kazama et al 2012 the authors illustrated the distribution of the risk estimated based on the concentration of pathogens decreasing with the increase of flood magnitude in our study we observe additionally that the spread of the concentration further away from the point sources often represent a threat to areas that were not previously thought as vulnerable fig 7 5 2 exposure to pathogens in floodwater fig 8 shows that there is a relation between the concentration of v cholerae in the floodwater and the dose ingested it can be observed that the greater the concentration of pathogens the greater is the dose number of v cholerae which can be ingested the assessment of the exposure of the populations is still very subjective and depends on many assumptions unfortunately a standard approach to assess the exposure to microorganisms in floodwater does not exist in the literature for low income countries like ghana andersen 2015 in this study the volume of floodwater ingested used for the two pathways is based on literature studies from high income countries namely on the work of schets et al 2011 and dorevitch et al 2011 the former estimates the volume of water swallowed by swimmers in fresh water seawater and swimming pools and the latter on the volume ingested by common limited contact water during recreation activities 5 3 vulnerability to infection in the vulnerability of infection step it is possible to observe the relation between the number of pathogens ingested dose and the probability of infection fig 9 in the literature authors usually did not state which flood return period was considered in the study for the estimation of the probability of getting infected by v cholerae mark et al 2015 making it difficult to compare it to the results obtained in this study fig 9 shows nevertheless very clearly that the greater the dose ingested the higher is the probability of being infected 5 4 risk of infection the risk of the alajo s population being infected is particularly high near the drainage network fig 11 however for large events the transport of pathogens takes place and others areas previously not affected can become also at risk figs 12 and 13 show the eapi estimated by combining a qmra with the four steps in flood risk assessment nevertheless because of the lack of available surveillance data and epidemiological studies it is not possible to validate the results of this study nor to estimate the contribution of direct exposure to floodwater to the cholera cases while andersen 2015 points out the low number of health assessments which validate the results sterk et al 2008 also affirms that epidemiological studies are limited because it involve high costs e g laboratory tests and are resource intense particularly in the aftermath of floods similar patterns of risk of infection were observed between adults and small children fig 11 and table 3 by other authors sterk et al 2008 ten veldhuis et al 2010 mark et al 2015 even when different pathogens are investigated the average observed risk of infection for children is higher than compared to adults this is because it is often assumed that children have a higher ingestion of water in the exposure assessment step as they usually are in closer contact with possible sources of infection when playing running or swimming in flooded waters 5 5 uncertainty sources limitations and recommendations several points in the hazard assessment steps can be improved first the concentration of v cholerae was assumed to be uniformly distributed along the drains however pathogens are more often distributed heterogeneously in the environment usepa 2012 second the initial concentration of pathogen was based on literature values to increase the reliability in the estimations direct sampling of the contamination sources is advised ten veldhuis et al 2010 nevertheless this procedure also has drawbacks for example it requires good planning process it entails higher costs can be deemed unsafe and it is still prone to errors during the measuring process de man et al 2014 schmidt and emelko 2011 additionally external sources of pathogens could be considered pathogen loads from upper catchment may be transported further downstream and affect the concentrations of the pathogens in our particular study area gretsch et al 2016 affirms that as drains in accra usually do not cross between neighborhoods the contamination from drains overflow is primarily locally bounded hence we do not expect this issue to be an important source of uncertainty in our study the p dwave showed to be a good tool for estimating the concentration of pathogens in floodwater with the inclusion of the advection diffusion module however improvements in the concentration estimation could be explored such as the inclusion of the growth or the decay of pathogen this should become of particular relevance if one desires to reassess the eapi after the occurrence of the flood event e g 2 or 3 days another point that can be improved is related with exposure it is worth noting that an infection will develop to an illness depending on the host conditions such as the health preconditions i e genetics life stage nutrition and immunity haas et al 2014 prüss üstün et al 2003 usepa 2012 thus it is important to gather information about populations behavior and characteristics to avoid overestimation of infections haas et al 2014 further uncertainty stems from the estimation of the probability of infection the beta distribution parameters used in this study is based on clinical trials with controlled water samples ideally a dose response assessment should be done for each population of concern however it can be resource consuming and still remains a source of uncertainties as experiments are carried with a narrow population group usepa 2012 finally it should also be mentioned that the results of the expected annual probability of infection estimated could not be compared with other studies few studies e g mark et al 2015 calculated the probability of becoming infected by v cholerae following the ingestion of floodwater thus the eapi estimated in this study need necessarily to be interpreted with caution as mentioned earlier other sources of pathogens beside direct ingestion should be included for a comprehensive assessment of cholera risk alajo contains slum areas which makes the population to be exposed to several other environmental risk factors joshua 2016 mark et al 2015 kusimi and yeboah 2019 drinking water sources can become contaminated during flooding or by extraction of polluted shallow groundwater or even by handling of water transportation mengel et al 2014 furthermore piped water represents a threat to public health failures in the water treatment process occur and water can become contaminated in the distribution network itself through the intrusion of pollution in the pipes machdar et al 2013 6 conclusions this study introduced a new concept for investigating the probability of infection of a population once exposed to contaminated floodwater termed the expected annual probability of infection eapi the eapi results from the combination of the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra and the four steps in flood risk assessment the infection risk model approach for estimating the eapi was demonstrated for v cholerae for the population in alajo accra ghana it was found that the risk of infection for adults wading in floodwater is considerably lower than for small children swimming playing in floodwater is it was also observed that the concentration of pathogens in floodwater decreases with the increase of the flood magnitude on one hand flood events need to be large enough for water to spill out of the drains and flood contaminating the neighboring areas on the other hand once this tipping point is found larger floods will spread the pathogens further away from the point source and at the same time reduce the concentration of pathogens by the effect of dilution the infection risk model developed in this study can be used additionally for a range of other waterborne infection diseases and for different pathways of exposure requiring only minimal adaptations the 2d parallel diffusive wave model p dwave with the advection dispersion equation ade module was overall a good tool to estimate the pathogen s concentration spread through the floodwater in alajo in terms of spatial variability by including the probability of infection equation into the flood model disaster management authorities are also able to monitor the vulnerable areas in real time this can help in focusing emergency actions in those areas and reduce the impact cause by outbreaks the cholera infection risk modeling introduced here add scientific evidence that can help to support future policies these can lead to substantiated increase of the community s awareness about the local risks and help in building community resilience within a flood risk management approach to cholera in the infected areas furthermore priority areas can be identified based on the geographical distribution of the risk of infection and on scientific decision making at different scales of intervention prediction of cholera infections and outbreaks is still challenging it is dependant and greatly influenced not only by local environmental but also by social characteristics in this study it was discussed that the current health risk models involve many assumptions and carry many uncertainties in all assessment steps although the cholera infection risk estimated in this study assumed that the pathogen hazard comes from contaminated floodwater it is well known that the population in alajo are exposed daily to other possible v cholerae sources contaminated drinking water and food issues of inadequate sanitation hygienic behavior and waste and wastewater management in the area also contribute to the risk of infection accra needs to invest in its basic urban water infrastructure and in sustainable management practices if it wishes to reduce the risk of the population in alajo to be repeatedly infected by v cholerae coming from contaminated floodwater this study therefore makes an important contribution to achieving these aims by developing a tool that can help authorities to plan and prioritise measures to counter the risk of infection it is thus believed it aligns with addressing the global sdgs and contributes to the improvement of public health and well being and reduction of the burden of infectious diseases declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

have been widely applied to remove refractory organic contaminants due to their efficiency and environmental friendliness for organic contaminated soil remediation sun et al 2020b zhou et al 2019 among them despite being widely applied to form non selective hydroxyl radicals oh e 2 8 v sun et al 2020a the application of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is limited due to the requirement of acidic conditions to prevent iron sludge precipitation bokare and choi 2014 yuan et al 2011 besides pds is relatively stable low in price and high in active ingredients ike et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 which could be activated by various methods matzek and carter 2016 wacławek et al 2017 specifically heat fan et al 2015 uv irradiation lau et al 2007 electrochemical systems yuan et al 2014 transition metal activation e g fe mn co ag et al anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 liu et al 2016 moghaddam et al 2014 and base activation furman et al 2010 are the ordinary approaches for accelerating pds activation among them the homogenous process via transition metal activating pds to degrade organic contaminants is universal silver ion ag is the most efficient for activating pds among many metal ions e g ce2 co2 and fe2 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 the detailed reaction of metal activating pds can be concluded in eq 1 however other metal ions e g zn2 mn2 and cu2 are generally inefficient homogenous activators in pds activation anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 1 m n s 2 o 8 2 m n 1 so 4 so 4 2 however cu ⅱ solid displayed a much higher activity towards pds compared to cu ⅱ ion cu2 for instance copper oxide activated pds much faster than cu2 at various ph values liang et al 2013 similar degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol by cuo pds was also reported which suggested a surface activation pds mechanism rather than hydroxyl radical or sulfate radical du et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 besides the complexation of cu2 with ligands was reported to be another way to enhance the reactivity of cu2 isaka 1957 pecht et al 1967 the complexation of cu2 with 1 10 phenanthroline or histamine noticeably enhanced the degradation of hydroquinone mandal et al 2005 also cefalexin was utilized as a complexation to favor electron transfer from cu ii solid to pds to generate cu iii chen et al 2019 furthermore in previous research cuo loaded on hexagonal boron nitride was utilized to activate pds and the active complexes formed on the surface dominated the bisphenol a bpa degradation oh et al 2020 in addition being bound with co 3 2 hco 3 cu ⅱ solid can be more easily activated by oxidants wang et al 2022 for instance previous study demonstrated that cu2 was reported to activate h2o2 to degrade acetaminophen in the presence of bicarbonate hco 3 zhang et al 2021 however researches on pds activation via cu2 in the presence of hco 3 are still lacking calcite is the most common carbonate mineral in the surface and underground environment which is considered to be an effective stabilizer for restoring acidic soils rehman et al 2017 generally it was utilized to adsorb heavy metals such as cu ⅱ cd ⅱ zn ⅱ and co ⅱ gomez del rio et al 2004 lee et al 2005 besides calcite has huge potential in activating pds to degrade organic pollutants in the presence of cu2 due to releasing bicarbonate but there are very few studies on activating pds to our best knowledge herein the performance of cu2 calcite pds to degrade sdz is investigated detailly in this study the purposes of this work are 1 to verify the synergistic effect of cu2 and calcite to degrade sdz via pds activation 2 to investigate the influence of parameters on the sdz degradation and the reaction mechanism 3 to explore sdz degradation pathway in the cu2 calcite pds system based on the results of uplc esi ms ms 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the natural high purity calcite more than 99 according to xrf results table s1 with typical xrd reflections fig s1a was collected from qingyang county anhui province china and provided by qingyang institute for industrial minerals meanwhile the massive micron scale structure of calcite was observed fig s1c d all chemicals were of analytical grade unless otherwise noted acetonitrile methanol and other reagents employed in detection were hplc grade and obtained from tedia company inc usa other reagents such as tert butanol tba p benzoquinone p bq l histidine and various target contaminants e g sulfadiazine sodium sdz 98 benzoic acid ba 99 anisole as 99 and nitrobenzene nb 99 were obtained from the aladdin reagent database inc shanghai china 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone temp was purchased from tci chemical industry shanghai sodium persulfate 98 was purchased from zhiyuan chemical reagent co ltd tianjin china during the experiment process ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm was used for preparing solutions 2 2 experiment procedure and analysis methods the degradation experiments were carried out in a 500 ml erlenmeyer flask with a 150 ml solution a multichannel magnetic mixer was employed to control the same mixing speed of different reactors the ph values of the solution 0 1 was adjusted by 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh and then measured by a phs 25 ph meter shanghai inesa scientific instrument co ltd china then calcite cu2 ions cucl2 and pds were introduced as soon as possible at a pre set interval a certain amount of solution was collected and filtered through a 0 22 μm filter the concentrations of pollutants and cu2 were determined by hplc and atomic absorption spectroscopy wys2200 china respectively the concentration of organic compounds was measured by hplc ultimate u3000 thermofisher america with an ods2 column 150 mm 4 6 mm specific detection methods for organics were collected by table s2 and the total organic carbon toc and inorganic carbon ic concentration of the solution was measured using a multi n c 3000 system the pds concentration was detected through the way reported by the previous study liang et al 2008 then ecological structure activity relationships program ecosar version 2 0 usepa was used to evaluate the biological toxicity fish daphnia and green algae were used as probe organisms the lc50 the concentration with 50 fish and daphnia death after 96 and 48 h of exposure respectively ec50 the concentration with 50 growth inhibition for green algae after 96 h of exposure and chronic toxicity values chv were applied to predict their toxicity respectively notably the lowest estimated values were chosen for further analysis if the chemical substance with multiple functional groups 2 3 characterization methods for electron paramagnetic resonance epr studies temp was selected as spin trapping agents and the samples were analyzed on a jeol jes fa200 epr spectrometer 300 k 9 063 ghz x band the microwave power employed was 1 mw sweep width ranged from 319 3 to 329 3 mt modulation frequency and modulation amplitudes were 100 khz and 0 35 mt respectively the x ray diffraction xrd spectrum of calcite was performed on an x ray diffractometer the valence of elements on the calcite surface was analyzed by an x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps the morphology of calcite was analyzed by a scanning electron microscope the chemical composition of calcite was measured on an x ray fluorescence spectrometer with rh radiation xrf surface functional groups of calcite were analyzed by an atr ftir cv curves and chronoamperometry test were carried out in an electrochemical analyzer the intermediates were analyzed by uhplc esi ms ms the detailed instrument information was shown in table s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary experiment for the sake of investigating the degradation performance of cu2 calcite pds system sulfadiazine sdz was selected as the model pollutant and the degradation results were illustrated in fig 1 sdz was relatively stable in pds alone calcite alone calcite pds and calcite cu2 systems indicating that both the adsorption of sdz by calcite and the oxidation of sdz by pds could be ignored fig 1a in the presence of both pds and cu2 the degradation of sdz was not significantly indicating that the cu2 alone could hardly activate pds to degrade pollutants the previous study also reported similar results that cu2 alone barely activated pds to degrade bpa wang et al 2020b however the addition of calcite significantly enhanced the sdz degradation with nearly 100 degradation efficiency in 1 h indicating that the cu2 calcite pds system would effectively degrade sdz simultaneously the concentration of cu2 decreased in the presence of calcite by approximately 40 in 1 h while the decrease was less than 10 in the absence of calcite fig 1b it meant that cu2 was converted into cu ⅱ solid in the existence of calcite and the latter exhibited a higher activity to activate pds than the former then the total organic carbon toc removal results exhibited that nearly 50 toc was removed in the cu2 calcite pds system fig s2 indicating that the mineralization of sdz was not complete and a certain amount of organic intermediate compound remained in the solution furthermore fig s3 depicted the pds decomposition in the different systems cu2 and calcite had little effect on the pds decomposition which was consistent with previous degradation performance fig 1 additionally the consumption of pds was obvious when cu2 and calcite existed at the same time implying that the synergistic effect between cu2 and calcite promoted the decomposition of pds which further promoted the degradation of sdz fig 1b 3 2 the effect of initial ph values fig 2 a depicted the effect of initial ph values 3 9 on sdz degradation in the cu2 pds calcite system regardless of initial ph values the degradation rate was similar and the eventual ph values after degradation were all close to 7 it was contributed to the excellent role of calcite in buffering the solution ph values the introduction of pds caused the decrease of solution ph values due to the acidogenic effects of pds fig 2b eqs 2 and 3 xiao et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 then the ph values gradually increased and were eventually stabilized under near neutral conditions which was due to the release of bi carbonate anions from calcite therefore different initial ph values had little influence on the sdz degradation implying that cu2 calcite pds system had good ph adaptability and could be applied for water treatment over a wide range of ph values 2 h 2 o s 2 o 8 2 h so 4 so 4 2 o 2 3 o h so 4 so 4 2 oh moreover to understand the role of ph values in degradation different volumes of 5 m sodium hydroxide instead of calcite were added fig 2c depicted the variation of ph values when different volumes of 5 m naoh solution were introduced as excepted the cu2 naoh pds system also experienced a process in which the ph value first dropped and then rose in a short period and the final stable ph value was proportional to the volume of naoh added then fig 2d illustrated a certain concentration of naoh that could not activate pds to degrade sdz in the presence of cu2 although it might reach a higher ph value than the cu2 calcite pds system meanwhile the cu2 concentration also decreased and was almost undetectable in the cu2 naoh pds system fig s4 it implied that the cu ⅱ solid namely cu oh 2 had a lower pds activation performance compared to cu ⅱ solid formed in the presence of calcite fig 2d in other words calcite played a vital role not only in maintaining the solution ph values but also releasing carbonate anions to convert cu2 into a special cu ⅱ solid and then enhanced sdz degradation via pds activation 3 3 identification of the working species 3 3 1 probing radicals sulfate radical and or hydroxyl radical was usually considered as the major radical during the pds activation firstly ethanol etoh and tert butanol tba were utilized as radical scavengers for sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals respectively fig 3 a and b since etoh could effectively eliminate both so 4 and oh kso4 etoh 4 3 107 m 1 s 1 k oh etoh 1 8 109 m 1 s 1 while tba quenched oh k oh etoh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 better than quenched so 4 kso4 etoh 4 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 oh et al 2020 wang et al 2020a 100 mm of etoh and tba had almost similar negligible inhibition in the degradation of sdz indicating that both so 4 and oh were not the dominant active species in the cu2 calcite pds system fig 3a and b meanwhile when using dmpo as the spin trapping agent the dmpooh adduct with the intensity of 1 2 2 1 in esr spectra was not observed in our system fig s6a it also meant that both so 4 and oh were not generated in our system however 1 m tba had a more significant inhibition on sdz degradation compared to 1 m etoh which was different from previous studies on the degradation by the radical pathway chen et al 2020 sun et al 2021 wang et al 2021 that was because tba was a weak scavenger on cu ⅲ kcu ⅲ tba 1 0 0 2 107 m 1 s 1 xing et al 2018 therefore the radicals were not responsible for the degradation of sdz in cu2 calcite pds system and cu ⅲ maybe was responsible for the degradation 3 3 2 probing singlet oxygen previous studies had reported that the 1o2 was generated during the pds activation in which o 2 was an important intermediate species and it easily attacked electron rich pollutants clennan and pace 2005 also o 2 was reported that played a key role in metal redox therefore p benzoquinone p bq was utilized as a scavenger due to the high reactivity with o 2 ko2 p bq 0 9 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 dai et al 2017 and l histidine and furfuryl alcohol ffa were classic quenchers for 1o2 k1o2 l his tidine 3 2 107 m 1 s 1 k 1o2 ffa 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2017 fig 3c exhibited that the removal of sdz was inhibited by about 20 in 1 h despite the presence of 1 mm p bq indicating that o 2 played a minor contribution to the sdz degradation therefore it might play a certain role in cu redox fig 3d illustrated that 1 mm l histidine almost completely inhibited the sdz degradation in 2 h while 1 mm ffa slightly inhibited sdz degradation in 2 h however the inhibition of l histidine was not used as direct evidence to prove that 1o2 was the major ros in the system since l histidine can easily form a complex with cu2 fig s5 which blocked the generation of cu ⅱ solid that was to say the inhibition caused by l histidine was not due to the quenching of 1o2 therefore it was preliminarily speculated that 1o2 played a limited role in degradation according to the inhibition of ffa in comparison with l histidine the addition of other scavengers did not seriously hinder the solidification process of cu2 thereby the role of other scavengers shown in fig 3 was trustworthy meanwhile the esr spectrum indicated that the similar three lines signal 1 1 1 of tempn adducts αg 16 9 g appeared in the cu2 pds and cu2 calcite pds system fig s6b however the cu2 pds system only weakly degraded sdz fig 1b indicating that the generation of 1o2 was not the main reason for sdz degradation 3 3 3 probing cu ⅲ it was reported that solid cu ⅲ cu ⅱ 2 3 v had a higher redox potential than both fe ⅵ fe ⅲ 2 2 v and soluble cu3 cu2 1 7 v liu et al 2021 besides the major contribution of cu ⅲ to organic degradation during the cu ii h2o2 oxidation was reported under neutral and alkaline conditions xing et al 2018 however cu ⅲ was difficult to be verified due to its instability wang et al 2020a accordingly periodate was utilized as a scavenger to survey the contribution of cu ⅲ to sdz degradation as seen in fig 3e in the presence of 1 mm periodate the sdz degradation was about 70 in 2 h then the sdz has different degrees of degradation in the calcite pds and calcite periodate system and the removal of sdz was due to the co oxidation of both pds and periodate he et al 2021 however it was nearly no difference regardless of whether the cu2 presented indicating that the role of cu2 was nearly sheltered therefore it could be concluded that the cu ⅲ was the major reactive species in the cu2 calcite pds system furthermore the chemical probe method was employed to further verify the main ros in the system specifically the cu2 calcite pds system and calcite pds system were utilized to degrade 0 1 mm benzoic acid ba anisole as and nitrobenzene nb solution separately since as had a similar reaction rate constant with both radicals k oh as 5 4 109 m 1 s 1 kso4 as 4 9 109 m 1 s 1 while nb had a much higher reaction rate constant with oh than so 4 k oh nb 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 kso4 nb 106 m 1 s 1 nb and as were commonly used as probes to distinguish the contributions of oh and so 4 chen et al 2020 furman et al 2011 fig s7a and b depicted the little differences of nb and as degradation between the calcite pds and cu2 calcite pds system indicating that both oh and so 4 were not the main ros in cu2 calcite pds system which was consistent with our previous observation in section 3 3 1 additionally ba was reported as a chemical probe of oh and so 4 k oh ba 4 2 109 m 1 s 1 kso4 ba 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 zhou et al 2021 while recent studies reported that ba can also react with cu ⅲ feng et al 2017 wang et al 2020b zhang et al 2021 fig s7c illustrated that ba was degraded obviously when cu2 was introduced implying that cu ⅲ played a role in degradation therefore cu ⅲ should be the main reactive species in the cu2 calcite pds system this conclusion was also consistent with scavenger results 3 4 the activation mechanism of pds in the cu2 calcite pds system to investigate the role of calcite different concentration of sodium bicarbonate instead of calcite was added into the system as shown in fig 4 a and b the sdz degradation and the variation of cu2 concentration in the cu2 bicarbonate pds were similar to the cu2 calcite pds the results suggested that the function of calcite not only provided co 3 2 to form cu ⅱ solid with higher activity on pds activation but also maintained ph values section 3 2 meanwhile fig s8 illustrated that the distribution of cu ii species was analyzed according to the previous data including ic concentration fig s2 and ph values change fig 2b with the visual minteq 3 1 computer program it can be seen that cuco3 was the major species above 50 during the degradation process accompanied by a small amount of cu2 and cuoh less than 20 therefore it can be preliminarily speculated that cuco3 plays an important role in pds activation as active species which is consistent with previous studies about h2o2 activation cheng et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 then the calcite after reaction 2 h was collected and characterized by a variety of analytical techniques the crystal structure of calcite before and after the reaction was analyzed by xrd despite the reflections of calcite being obvious fig s9a the newborn reflections of cu oh 2 and cuco3 were also observed fig s9b hadj mokhtar et al 2015 wang et al 2019b fig s9c illustrated the atr ftir spectra of the calcite before and after the reaction among them the absorption bands at around 850 and 711 cm 1 were ascribed to calcite falini et al 1996 however the cu ⅱ solid content was too low to directly visualize the difference in the ftir profile before and after the reaction therefore ftir subtractive spectroscopy was used to compare the calcite before and after the reaction fig s9d the peaks at about 3450 and 1620 cm 1 were assigned to oh of stretching mode and bending mode respectively the bands at around 1370 and 870 cm 1 were assigned to the cu carbonates complex and carbonates respectively wang et al 2019b wu et al 2011 these results suggested that cu based carbonates and hydroxides formed in the calcite after the reaction which was further confirmed by the results of the xps then fig s10 showed that the c 1 s spectra were composed of caco3 289 4 ev landis et al 1984 and adventitious carbon 284 8 ev oh et al 2020 also the o 1 s spectra was composed of ca o 531 3 ev wanger et al 1980 and c o 531 9 ev fig s11 li et al 2020 the decrease of the peak intensity was ascribed to the dissolution of calcite moreover fig 5 displayed the xps spectra of cu species 2p3 2 on the surface of calcite before and after the reaction firstly no peaks of cu were observed on the surface of fresh calcite which provided agreement with xrf results fig 5a secondly the spectra of calcite after the reaction with cu2 alone without pds were illustrated in fig 5b simultaneously the peaks of 932 9 933 9 and 935 ev were attributed to cu oh 2 peng et al 2016 cuo ertl et al 1980 and cuco3 wagner et al 1979 respectively implying that the addition of cu2 was transferred into solid phase then the spectra of calcite after the reaction with cu2 and pds were illustrated in fig 5c clearly the peaks located at 932 9 and 934 5 ev were attributed to cu ⅱ and cu ⅲ respectively liu et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 this result proved that the cu ⅱ solid converted to cu ⅲ during the reaction process which is accompanied by the pds activation and sdz degradation subsequently fig s12 depicted the s 2p xps spectra for calcite before and after the reaction the peaks located at 168 7 and 170 1 ev represent s in sodium sulfate naso4 and calcium sulfate caso4 respectively wang et al 2019a yu et al 1990 compared with the fresh calcite and the calcite reacted with cu2 the new peak of s was caused by the decomposition of adsorbed pds during the reaction process furthermore the cycle voltammetry cv curves were exhibited in fig s13a used calcite with cu ⅱ showed a higher current density compared with fresh calcite without cu ⅱ strongly suggesting that and the presence of cu2 enhanced the redox potential and the electron transfer rate of bare calcite huang et al 2021 this finding was also consistent with the report that the incorporation of cu ⅱ in adsorbent based biochar pan et al 2021 a chronoamperometry test was carried out to further explore the charge transfer and the results were depicted in fig s13b when cu2 were added at 100 s the current output remained unchanged in contrast when pds and sdz were introduced at 200 and 300 s respectively the current output significantly changed however the addition of pds and sdz resulted in a weak current change without cu2 this result revealed that cu ⅱ solid played a vital role in the electron transfer process and the change in the valence state of cu ⅱ was the main cause of electron transfer based on the mentioned results the proposed degradation mechanism of this system is shown as follows firstly the added cu2 was converted into active cu ⅱ solid with the presence of calcite mainly cuco3 meanwhile calcite also maintained slightly alkaline conditions of the solution which facilitated the formation of cu ⅲ to promote sdz degradation then the cu ⅱ solid was oxidized by s 2 o 8 2 to generate cu ⅲ eq 4 chen et al 2019 ma et al 2020 and the generated cu ⅲ could be reduced by o 2 or pds to form cu ⅱ eq 5 du et al 2017 liu et al 2021 subsequently cu ⅲ played a more important role in degrading organic contaminants in cu2 pds calcite system and it was reduced to cu ⅱ to activate pds again eq 6 4 cu ii s 2 o 8 2 cu iii so 4 so 4 2 5 cu iii o 2 s 2 o 8 2 cu ii o 2 so 4 2 6 cu iii organic pollutants cu ii products 3 5 effect of the main variables on degradation 3 5 1 effect of cu2 concentration fig 6 a and b depicted the effect of cu2 concentrations from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l on the sdz degradation and the variation of cu2 concentration of note the cu2 concentration was set based on the indicator in china s sewage discharge lower than 1 0 mg l the sdz degradation efficiency in 2 h increased from 60 to nearly 100 as the cu2 concentration increased from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l the reason is that more cu2 caused more cu ⅱ solid which could generate more active cu ⅲ to degrade sdz 3 5 2 effect of pds concentration fig 6c and d displayed the effect of pds dosage from 2 to 20 mm on the sdz degradation and the change of cu2 concentration different pds concentrations had a limited impact on the sdz degradation it proved that the dominant factor in the degradation of sdz was cu ⅲ and the role of pds was only to oxidize cu ⅱ instead of generating reactive species like hydroxyl radicals or sulfate radicals however when the initial pds concentration increased to 20 mm the degradation of sdz in the first 5 min was inhibited due to the acidogenic effects of pds eq 2 more pds caused the solution to be more acidic which inhibited the generation of cu ⅱ solid 3 5 3 effect of anions concentration inorganic anions were regarded as a negative factor during pds activation process fig s14 illustrated the effect of cl and h 2 po 4 concentration on the sdz degradation low concentration of cl 1 and 10 mm weakly inhibited the degradation of sdz while high concentrations 100 mm had a certain inhibition on sdz degradation the inhibition of the high concentration of cl was mainly due to the complexation of cu2 with cl to inhibit the formation of cu ii solids thereby reducing the generation of cu ⅲ and the degradation of sdz then the addition of phosphate slightly inhibited the sdz degradation which was maybe due to the complexation with cu2 and then reduce the reactivity of cu ⅱ solid lin et al 2004 3 6 reusability and practical applicability of calcite to investigate the reusability of calcite the calcite recovered by centrifugation separation and drying was added into the next cycle with 10 mm pds and 1 mg l cu2 fig s15 there was no change in the degradation efficiency in the 2nd cycle and a slight fall in the 3rd cycle while a significant decrease in the 4th cycle it was thought to be caused by the dissolution of calcite then to demonstrate the applicability of our system we collected natural waters such as hubing lake nanfei river and tap water and their compositions were shown in table s4 fig s16 exhibited that the sdz degradation in 30 min decreased from 97 to 90 83 and 95 in hubing lake nanfei river and tap water respectively meanwhile sdz degradation was eventually to 100 in 2 h in different water bodies implying that cu2 calcite pds system would be applied to a variety of complex water bodies 3 7 intermediate products analysis and toxicity evaluation the sdz degradation was monitored with a uplc ms ms system and the ms results were illustrated in figs s17 and s18 on the basis of identified intermediates detailed pathways for sdz removal were proposed in fig 7 the parent compound with an m z of 251 was easy to be hydroxylated and its products had an m z of 268 product a this process was also proved by the previous study feng et al 2016 also so2 extrusion was a common intermediate during the sulfonamides degradation sun et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 in this study an intermediate product b with an m z of 187 was found which was 64 lower than sdz m z 251 then product b was transformed into product c m z 201 through 1o2 oxidation according to our previous study sun et al 2021 which was also consistent with the contribution of 1o2 we mentioned in section 3 3 2 n o bond was not stable and easily fell off to generate product d with an m z of 171 then the cn bond in the pyrimidine ring was easy to be cleavage and the product e m z 138 was obtained chen et al 2021 additionally the direct cleavage of the s n bond was another pathway during the sdz degradation in the pds based system zhou et al 2016 that was proved by the detection of 2 aminopyridine g m z 96 and 4 hydro sulfonyl aniline f m z 158 the aniline in product f was oxidized and fell off to form product i m z 141 at the same time the generated aniline after so2 extrusion was hydroxylated to generate the product j with an m z of 109 the lack of ms information for aniline was due to its easy oxidization in pds oxidation systems anotai et al 2011 sun et al 2021 then product j was eventually transformed into product k namely maleic acid m z 116 feng et al 2016 li et al 2005 as for the pyridine ring in product g it could be opened during the oxidation as evidenced by the product l m z 104 and m m z 99 generation then product l could be further oxidized to generate product n m z 88 and o m z 70 and eventually generate low molecules and inorganic ions table s5 exhibited the toxicity of sdz and its intermediate products which was predicted by the ecosar program the acute toxic levels of sdz and its intermediates were assessed according to the european union criteria i e extremely toxic 1 mg l toxic 1 10 mg l harmful 10 100 mg l and harmless 100 mg l and the chronic toxic levels were classified according to the chinese hazard chemical evaluation guidelines hj ti 154 2004 i e extremely toxic 0 1 mg l toxic 0 1 1 mg l harmful 1 10 mg l and harmless 10 mg l different colors were utilized to distinguish the degree of toxicity the daphnia was most sensitive to sdz and its intermediates the toxicity of a d m n were similar to that of sdz the products b f g j o had higher toxicity to daphnia while the products e h i k l had lower toxicity some intermediates e g f g and j were classified as toxic indicating that these generated intermediates had higher risk than sdz itself this on the other hand proved the selectivity of cu ⅲ and would not completely mineralize the parent pollutants thus the sdz degradation in this system might require further mineralization and detoxification 4 conclusion this study investigated the sdz degradation via the cu2 calcite pds system results suggested that low concentrations of cu2 and calcite synergistically degrade sdz via pds activation also the cu2 calcite pds system had a certain adaptability to ph and anions according to the scavenger results and esr analysis the major reactive species was cu ⅲ which was generated by cu ⅱ via electron transfer additionally combined with xrd atr ftir cv curves and xps analysis calcite played an important role in transforming cu2 into cu ⅱ solid cuco3 which generates cu ⅲ via pds activation besides calcite also had the effect of buffering the ph value making the ph value of the system close to neutral after the reaction compared to other cu based materials the cu2 calcite pds system showed a significantly environmentally friendly characteristic by utilizing the naturally existing cu2 in the water body and ubiquitous calcite in the subsurface to exert an efficient degradation effect also different synthetic wastewater e g tap water hubing lake nanfei river had little effect on the sdz degradation in the cu2 calcite pds system moreover the toxicity prediction by ecosar showed that the toxicity of most intermediates was decreased compared with the parent sdz this work is of great significance to the comprehensive utilization of natural calcite and provides a new insight into the application of pollution free minerals such as calcite to organic pollutants treatment considering the abundant existence of calcite it can be used not only as a material in water treatment but also as an important process in groundwater in situ chemical oxidation isco declaration of competing interest the

15911,a system of cu2 calcite pds was constructed to degrade sulfadiazine sdz different from the traditional cu mediated activation a low concentration of cu2 that met drinking water standards 1 mg l transformed into cu ⅱ solid in the presence of calcite and then enhanced the degradation of sdz via pds activation over a ph range from 3 to 9 according to scavenger and chemical probe experiments cu ⅲ rather than radicals hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals and singlet oxygen was the predominant reactive species which was responsible for the degradation of sdz based on the results of xrd atr ftir and cv curves et al cuco3 was the main complex with high reactivity for pds activation to form cu ⅲ moreover detailed degradation pathways of sulfadiazine were proposed according to the uplc esi ms ms and their toxicity was predicted by ecosar besides the real water matrix would not seriously affect the degradation of sdz in the cu2 calcite pds system in summary this study reveals a new insight into the synergistic effect of cu2 and calcite on the sdz degradation and promotes an understanding of the environmental benefits of natural calcite graphical abstract image graphical abstract

have been widely applied to remove refractory organic contaminants due to their efficiency and environmental friendliness for organic contaminated soil remediation sun et al 2020b zhou et al 2019 among them despite being widely applied to form non selective hydroxyl radicals oh e 2 8 v sun et al 2020a the application of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is limited due to the requirement of acidic conditions to prevent iron sludge precipitation bokare and choi 2014 yuan et al 2011 besides pds is relatively stable low in price and high in active ingredients ike et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 which could be activated by various methods matzek and carter 2016 wacławek et al 2017 specifically heat fan et al 2015 uv irradiation lau et al 2007 electrochemical systems yuan et al 2014 transition metal activation e g fe mn co ag et al anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 liu et al 2016 moghaddam et al 2014 and base activation furman et al 2010 are the ordinary approaches for accelerating pds activation among them the homogenous process via transition metal activating pds to degrade organic contaminants is universal silver ion ag is the most efficient for activating pds among many metal ions e g ce2 co2 and fe2 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 the detailed reaction of metal activating pds can be concluded in eq 1 however other metal ions e g zn2 mn2 and cu2 are generally inefficient homogenous activators in pds activation anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 1 m n s 2 o 8 2 m n 1 so 4 so 4 2 however cu ⅱ solid displayed a much higher activity towards pds compared to cu ⅱ ion cu2 for instance copper oxide activated pds much faster than cu2 at various ph values liang et al 2013 similar degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol by cuo pds was also reported which suggested a surface activation pds mechanism rather than hydroxyl radical or sulfate radical du et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 besides the complexation of cu2 with ligands was reported to be another way to enhance the reactivity of cu2 isaka 1957 pecht et al 1967 the complexation of cu2 with 1 10 phenanthroline or histamine noticeably enhanced the degradation of hydroquinone mandal et al 2005 also cefalexin was utilized as a complexation to favor electron transfer from cu ii solid to pds to generate cu iii chen et al 2019 furthermore in previous research cuo loaded on hexagonal boron nitride was utilized to activate pds and the active complexes formed on the surface dominated the bisphenol a bpa degradation oh et al 2020 in addition being bound with co 3 2 hco 3 cu ⅱ solid can be more easily activated by oxidants wang et al 2022 for instance previous study demonstrated that cu2 was reported to activate h2o2 to degrade acetaminophen in the presence of bicarbonate hco 3 zhang et al 2021 however researches on pds activation via cu2 in the presence of hco 3 are still lacking calcite is the most common carbonate mineral in the surface and underground environment which is considered to be an effective stabilizer for restoring acidic soils rehman et al 2017 generally it was utilized to adsorb heavy metals such as cu ⅱ cd ⅱ zn ⅱ and co ⅱ gomez del rio et al 2004 lee et al 2005 besides calcite has huge potential in activating pds to degrade organic pollutants in the presence of cu2 due to releasing bicarbonate but there are very few studies on activating pds to our best knowledge herein the performance of cu2 calcite pds to degrade sdz is investigated detailly in this study the purposes of this work are 1 to verify the synergistic effect of cu2 and calcite to degrade sdz via pds activation 2 to investigate the influence of parameters on the sdz degradation and the reaction mechanism 3 to explore sdz degradation pathway in the cu2 calcite pds system based on the results of uplc esi ms ms 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the natural high purity calcite more than 99 according to xrf results table s1 with typical xrd reflections fig s1a was collected from qingyang county anhui province china and provided by qingyang institute for industrial minerals meanwhile the massive micron scale structure of calcite was observed fig s1c d all chemicals were of analytical grade unless otherwise noted acetonitrile methanol and other reagents employed in detection were hplc grade and obtained from tedia company inc usa other reagents such as tert butanol tba p benzoquinone p bq l histidine and various target contaminants e g sulfadiazine sodium sdz 98 benzoic acid ba 99 anisole as 99 and nitrobenzene nb 99 were obtained from the aladdin reagent database inc shanghai china 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone temp was purchased from tci chemical industry shanghai sodium persulfate 98 was purchased from zhiyuan chemical reagent co ltd tianjin china during the experiment process ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm was used for preparing solutions 2 2 experiment procedure and analysis methods the degradation experiments were carried out in a 500 ml erlenmeyer flask with a 150 ml solution a multichannel magnetic mixer was employed to control the same mixing speed of different reactors the ph values of the solution 0 1 was adjusted by 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh and then measured by a phs 25 ph meter shanghai inesa scientific instrument co ltd china then calcite cu2 ions cucl2 and pds were introduced as soon as possible at a pre set interval a certain amount of solution was collected and filtered through a 0 22 μm filter the concentrations of pollutants and cu2 were determined by hplc and atomic absorption spectroscopy wys2200 china respectively the concentration of organic compounds was measured by hplc ultimate u3000 thermofisher america with an ods2 column 150 mm 4 6 mm specific detection methods for organics were collected by table s2 and the total organic carbon toc and inorganic carbon ic concentration of the solution was measured using a multi n c 3000 system the pds concentration was detected through the way reported by the previous study liang et al 2008 then ecological structure activity relationships program ecosar version 2 0 usepa was used to evaluate the biological toxicity fish daphnia and green algae were used as probe organisms the lc50 the concentration with 50 fish and daphnia death after 96 and 48 h of exposure respectively ec50 the concentration with 50 growth inhibition for green algae after 96 h of exposure and chronic toxicity values chv were applied to predict their toxicity respectively notably the lowest estimated values were chosen for further analysis if the chemical substance with multiple functional groups 2 3 characterization methods for electron paramagnetic resonance epr studies temp was selected as spin trapping agents and the samples were analyzed on a jeol jes fa200 epr spectrometer 300 k 9 063 ghz x band the microwave power employed was 1 mw sweep width ranged from 319 3 to 329 3 mt modulation frequency and modulation amplitudes were 100 khz and 0 35 mt respectively the x ray diffraction xrd spectrum of calcite was performed on an x ray diffractometer the valence of elements on the calcite surface was analyzed by an x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps the morphology of calcite was analyzed by a scanning electron microscope the chemical composition of calcite was measured on an x ray fluorescence spectrometer with rh radiation xrf surface functional groups of calcite were analyzed by an atr ftir cv curves and chronoamperometry test were carried out in an electrochemical analyzer the intermediates were analyzed by uhplc esi ms ms the detailed instrument information was shown in table s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary experiment for the sake of investigating the degradation performance of cu2 calcite pds system sulfadiazine sdz was selected as the model pollutant and the degradation results were illustrated in fig 1 sdz was relatively stable in pds alone calcite alone calcite pds and calcite cu2 systems indicating that both the adsorption of sdz by calcite and the oxidation of sdz by pds could be ignored fig 1a in the presence of both pds and cu2 the degradation of sdz was not significantly indicating that the cu2 alone could hardly activate pds to degrade pollutants the previous study also reported similar results that cu2 alone barely activated pds to degrade bpa wang et al 2020b however the addition of calcite significantly enhanced the sdz degradation with nearly 100 degradation efficiency in 1 h indicating that the cu2 calcite pds system would effectively degrade sdz simultaneously the concentration of cu2 decreased in the presence of calcite by approximately 40 in 1 h while the decrease was less than 10 in the absence of calcite fig 1b it meant that cu2 was converted into cu ⅱ solid in the existence of calcite and the latter exhibited a higher activity to activate pds than the former then the total organic carbon toc removal results exhibited that nearly 50 toc was removed in the cu2 calcite pds system fig s2 indicating that the mineralization of sdz was not complete and a certain amount of organic intermediate compound remained in the solution furthermore fig s3 depicted the pds decomposition in the different systems cu2 and calcite had little effect on the pds decomposition which was consistent with previous degradation performance fig 1 additionally the consumption of pds was obvious when cu2 and calcite existed at the same time implying that the synergistic effect between cu2 and calcite promoted the decomposition of pds which further promoted the degradation of sdz fig 1b 3 2 the effect of initial ph values fig 2 a depicted the effect of initial ph values 3 9 on sdz degradation in the cu2 pds calcite system regardless of initial ph values the degradation rate was similar and the eventual ph values after degradation were all close to 7 it was contributed to the excellent role of calcite in buffering the solution ph values the introduction of pds caused the decrease of solution ph values due to the acidogenic effects of pds fig 2b eqs 2 and 3 xiao et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 then the ph values gradually increased and were eventually stabilized under near neutral conditions which was due to the release of bi carbonate anions from calcite therefore different initial ph values had little influence on the sdz degradation implying that cu2 calcite pds system had good ph adaptability and could be applied for water treatment over a wide range of ph values 2 h 2 o s 2 o 8 2 h so 4 so 4 2 o 2 3 o h so 4 so 4 2 oh moreover to understand the role of ph values in degradation different volumes of 5 m sodium hydroxide instead of calcite were added fig 2c depicted the variation of ph values when different volumes of 5 m naoh solution were introduced as excepted the cu2 naoh pds system also experienced a process in which the ph value first dropped and then rose in a short period and the final stable ph value was proportional to the volume of naoh added then fig 2d illustrated a certain concentration of naoh that could not activate pds to degrade sdz in the presence of cu2 although it might reach a higher ph value than the cu2 calcite pds system meanwhile the cu2 concentration also decreased and was almost undetectable in the cu2 naoh pds system fig s4 it implied that the cu ⅱ solid namely cu oh 2 had a lower pds activation performance compared to cu ⅱ solid formed in the presence of calcite fig 2d in other words calcite played a vital role not only in maintaining the solution ph values but also releasing carbonate anions to convert cu2 into a special cu ⅱ solid and then enhanced sdz degradation via pds activation 3 3 identification of the working species 3 3 1 probing radicals sulfate radical and or hydroxyl radical was usually considered as the major radical during the pds activation firstly ethanol etoh and tert butanol tba were utilized as radical scavengers for sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals respectively fig 3 a and b since etoh could effectively eliminate both so 4 and oh kso4 etoh 4 3 107 m 1 s 1 k oh etoh 1 8 109 m 1 s 1 while tba quenched oh k oh etoh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 better than quenched so 4 kso4 etoh 4 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 oh et al 2020 wang et al 2020a 100 mm of etoh and tba had almost similar negligible inhibition in the degradation of sdz indicating that both so 4 and oh were not the dominant active species in the cu2 calcite pds system fig 3a and b meanwhile when using dmpo as the spin trapping agent the dmpooh adduct with the intensity of 1 2 2 1 in esr spectra was not observed in our system fig s6a it also meant that both so 4 and oh were not generated in our system however 1 m tba had a more significant inhibition on sdz degradation compared to 1 m etoh which was different from previous studies on the degradation by the radical pathway chen et al 2020 sun et al 2021 wang et al 2021 that was because tba was a weak scavenger on cu ⅲ kcu ⅲ tba 1 0 0 2 107 m 1 s 1 xing et al 2018 therefore the radicals were not responsible for the degradation of sdz in cu2 calcite pds system and cu ⅲ maybe was responsible for the degradation 3 3 2 probing singlet oxygen previous studies had reported that the 1o2 was generated during the pds activation in which o 2 was an important intermediate species and it easily attacked electron rich pollutants clennan and pace 2005 also o 2 was reported that played a key role in metal redox therefore p benzoquinone p bq was utilized as a scavenger due to the high reactivity with o 2 ko2 p bq 0 9 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 dai et al 2017 and l histidine and furfuryl alcohol ffa were classic quenchers for 1o2 k1o2 l his tidine 3 2 107 m 1 s 1 k 1o2 ffa 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2017 fig 3c exhibited that the removal of sdz was inhibited by about 20 in 1 h despite the presence of 1 mm p bq indicating that o 2 played a minor contribution to the sdz degradation therefore it might play a certain role in cu redox fig 3d illustrated that 1 mm l histidine almost completely inhibited the sdz degradation in 2 h while 1 mm ffa slightly inhibited sdz degradation in 2 h however the inhibition of l histidine was not used as direct evidence to prove that 1o2 was the major ros in the system since l histidine can easily form a complex with cu2 fig s5 which blocked the generation of cu ⅱ solid that was to say the inhibition caused by l histidine was not due to the quenching of 1o2 therefore it was preliminarily speculated that 1o2 played a limited role in degradation according to the inhibition of ffa in comparison with l histidine the addition of other scavengers did not seriously hinder the solidification process of cu2 thereby the role of other scavengers shown in fig 3 was trustworthy meanwhile the esr spectrum indicated that the similar three lines signal 1 1 1 of tempn adducts αg 16 9 g appeared in the cu2 pds and cu2 calcite pds system fig s6b however the cu2 pds system only weakly degraded sdz fig 1b indicating that the generation of 1o2 was not the main reason for sdz degradation 3 3 3 probing cu ⅲ it was reported that solid cu ⅲ cu ⅱ 2 3 v had a higher redox potential than both fe ⅵ fe ⅲ 2 2 v and soluble cu3 cu2 1 7 v liu et al 2021 besides the major contribution of cu ⅲ to organic degradation during the cu ii h2o2 oxidation was reported under neutral and alkaline conditions xing et al 2018 however cu ⅲ was difficult to be verified due to its instability wang et al 2020a accordingly periodate was utilized as a scavenger to survey the contribution of cu ⅲ to sdz degradation as seen in fig 3e in the presence of 1 mm periodate the sdz degradation was about 70 in 2 h then the sdz has different degrees of degradation in the calcite pds and calcite periodate system and the removal of sdz was due to the co oxidation of both pds and periodate he et al 2021 however it was nearly no difference regardless of whether the cu2 presented indicating that the role of cu2 was nearly sheltered therefore it could be concluded that the cu ⅲ was the major reactive species in the cu2 calcite pds system furthermore the chemical probe method was employed to further verify the main ros in the system specifically the cu2 calcite pds system and calcite pds system were utilized to degrade 0 1 mm benzoic acid ba anisole as and nitrobenzene nb solution separately since as had a similar reaction rate constant with both radicals k oh as 5 4 109 m 1 s 1 kso4 as 4 9 109 m 1 s 1 while nb had a much higher reaction rate constant with oh than so 4 k oh nb 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 kso4 nb 106 m 1 s 1 nb and as were commonly used as probes to distinguish the contributions of oh and so 4 chen et al 2020 furman et al 2011 fig s7a and b depicted the little differences of nb and as degradation between the calcite pds and cu2 calcite pds system indicating that both oh and so 4 were not the main ros in cu2 calcite pds system which was consistent with our previous observation in section 3 3 1 additionally ba was reported as a chemical probe of oh and so 4 k oh ba 4 2 109 m 1 s 1 kso4 ba 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 zhou et al 2021 while recent studies reported that ba can also react with cu ⅲ feng et al 2017 wang et al 2020b zhang et al 2021 fig s7c illustrated that ba was degraded obviously when cu2 was introduced implying that cu ⅲ played a role in degradation therefore cu ⅲ should be the main reactive species in the cu2 calcite pds system this conclusion was also consistent with scavenger results 3 4 the activation mechanism of pds in the cu2 calcite pds system to investigate the role of calcite different concentration of sodium bicarbonate instead of calcite was added into the system as shown in fig 4 a and b the sdz degradation and the variation of cu2 concentration in the cu2 bicarbonate pds were similar to the cu2 calcite pds the results suggested that the function of calcite not only provided co 3 2 to form cu ⅱ solid with higher activity on pds activation but also maintained ph values section 3 2 meanwhile fig s8 illustrated that the distribution of cu ii species was analyzed according to the previous data including ic concentration fig s2 and ph values change fig 2b with the visual minteq 3 1 computer program it can be seen that cuco3 was the major species above 50 during the degradation process accompanied by a small amount of cu2 and cuoh less than 20 therefore it can be preliminarily speculated that cuco3 plays an important role in pds activation as active species which is consistent with previous studies about h2o2 activation cheng et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 then the calcite after reaction 2 h was collected and characterized by a variety of analytical techniques the crystal structure of calcite before and after the reaction was analyzed by xrd despite the reflections of calcite being obvious fig s9a the newborn reflections of cu oh 2 and cuco3 were also observed fig s9b hadj mokhtar et al 2015 wang et al 2019b fig s9c illustrated the atr ftir spectra of the calcite before and after the reaction among them the absorption bands at around 850 and 711 cm 1 were ascribed to calcite falini et al 1996 however the cu ⅱ solid content was too low to directly visualize the difference in the ftir profile before and after the reaction therefore ftir subtractive spectroscopy was used to compare the calcite before and after the reaction fig s9d the peaks at about 3450 and 1620 cm 1 were assigned to oh of stretching mode and bending mode respectively the bands at around 1370 and 870 cm 1 were assigned to the cu carbonates complex and carbonates respectively wang et al 2019b wu et al 2011 these results suggested that cu based carbonates and hydroxides formed in the calcite after the reaction which was further confirmed by the results of the xps then fig s10 showed that the c 1 s spectra were composed of caco3 289 4 ev landis et al 1984 and adventitious carbon 284 8 ev oh et al 2020 also the o 1 s spectra was composed of ca o 531 3 ev wanger et al 1980 and c o 531 9 ev fig s11 li et al 2020 the decrease of the peak intensity was ascribed to the dissolution of calcite moreover fig 5 displayed the xps spectra of cu species 2p3 2 on the surface of calcite before and after the reaction firstly no peaks of cu were observed on the surface of fresh calcite which provided agreement with xrf results fig 5a secondly the spectra of calcite after the reaction with cu2 alone without pds were illustrated in fig 5b simultaneously the peaks of 932 9 933 9 and 935 ev were attributed to cu oh 2 peng et al 2016 cuo ertl et al 1980 and cuco3 wagner et al 1979 respectively implying that the addition of cu2 was transferred into solid phase then the spectra of calcite after the reaction with cu2 and pds were illustrated in fig 5c clearly the peaks located at 932 9 and 934 5 ev were attributed to cu ⅱ and cu ⅲ respectively liu et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 this result proved that the cu ⅱ solid converted to cu ⅲ during the reaction process which is accompanied by the pds activation and sdz degradation subsequently fig s12 depicted the s 2p xps spectra for calcite before and after the reaction the peaks located at 168 7 and 170 1 ev represent s in sodium sulfate naso4 and calcium sulfate caso4 respectively wang et al 2019a yu et al 1990 compared with the fresh calcite and the calcite reacted with cu2 the new peak of s was caused by the decomposition of adsorbed pds during the reaction process furthermore the cycle voltammetry cv curves were exhibited in fig s13a used calcite with cu ⅱ showed a higher current density compared with fresh calcite without cu ⅱ strongly suggesting that and the presence of cu2 enhanced the redox potential and the electron transfer rate of bare calcite huang et al 2021 this finding was also consistent with the report that the incorporation of cu ⅱ in adsorbent based biochar pan et al 2021 a chronoamperometry test was carried out to further explore the charge transfer and the results were depicted in fig s13b when cu2 were added at 100 s the current output remained unchanged in contrast when pds and sdz were introduced at 200 and 300 s respectively the current output significantly changed however the addition of pds and sdz resulted in a weak current change without cu2 this result revealed that cu ⅱ solid played a vital role in the electron transfer process and the change in the valence state of cu ⅱ was the main cause of electron transfer based on the mentioned results the proposed degradation mechanism of this system is shown as follows firstly the added cu2 was converted into active cu ⅱ solid with the presence of calcite mainly cuco3 meanwhile calcite also maintained slightly alkaline conditions of the solution which facilitated the formation of cu ⅲ to promote sdz degradation then the cu ⅱ solid was oxidized by s 2 o 8 2 to generate cu ⅲ eq 4 chen et al 2019 ma et al 2020 and the generated cu ⅲ could be reduced by o 2 or pds to form cu ⅱ eq 5 du et al 2017 liu et al 2021 subsequently cu ⅲ played a more important role in degrading organic contaminants in cu2 pds calcite system and it was reduced to cu ⅱ to activate pds again eq 6 4 cu ii s 2 o 8 2 cu iii so 4 so 4 2 5 cu iii o 2 s 2 o 8 2 cu ii o 2 so 4 2 6 cu iii organic pollutants cu ii products 3 5 effect of the main variables on degradation 3 5 1 effect of cu2 concentration fig 6 a and b depicted the effect of cu2 concentrations from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l on the sdz degradation and the variation of cu2 concentration of note the cu2 concentration was set based on the indicator in china s sewage discharge lower than 1 0 mg l the sdz degradation efficiency in 2 h increased from 60 to nearly 100 as the cu2 concentration increased from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l the reason is that more cu2 caused more cu ⅱ solid which could generate more active cu ⅲ to degrade sdz 3 5 2 effect of pds concentration fig 6c and d displayed the effect of pds dosage from 2 to 20 mm on the sdz degradation and the change of cu2 concentration different pds concentrations had a limited impact on the sdz degradation it proved that the dominant factor in the degradation of sdz was cu ⅲ and the role of pds was only to oxidize cu ⅱ instead of generating reactive species like hydroxyl radicals or sulfate radicals however when the initial pds concentration increased to 20 mm the degradation of sdz in the first 5 min was inhibited due to the acidogenic effects of pds eq 2 more pds caused the solution to be more acidic which inhibited the generation of cu ⅱ solid 3 5 3 effect of anions concentration inorganic anions were regarded as a negative factor during pds activation process fig s14 illustrated the effect of cl and h 2 po 4 concentration on the sdz degradation low concentration of cl 1 and 10 mm weakly inhibited the degradation of sdz while high concentrations 100 mm had a certain inhibition on sdz degradation the inhibition of the high concentration of cl was mainly due to the complexation of cu2 with cl to inhibit the formation of cu ii solids thereby reducing the generation of cu ⅲ and the degradation of sdz then the addition of phosphate slightly inhibited the sdz degradation which was maybe due to the complexation with cu2 and then reduce the reactivity of cu ⅱ solid lin et al 2004 3 6 reusability and practical applicability of calcite to investigate the reusability of calcite the calcite recovered by centrifugation separation and drying was added into the next cycle with 10 mm pds and 1 mg l cu2 fig s15 there was no change in the degradation efficiency in the 2nd cycle and a slight fall in the 3rd cycle while a significant decrease in the 4th cycle it was thought to be caused by the dissolution of calcite then to demonstrate the applicability of our system we collected natural waters such as hubing lake nanfei river and tap water and their compositions were shown in table s4 fig s16 exhibited that the sdz degradation in 30 min decreased from 97 to 90 83 and 95 in hubing lake nanfei river and tap water respectively meanwhile sdz degradation was eventually to 100 in 2 h in different water bodies implying that cu2 calcite pds system would be applied to a variety of complex water bodies 3 7 intermediate products analysis and toxicity evaluation the sdz degradation was monitored with a uplc ms ms system and the ms results were illustrated in figs s17 and s18 on the basis of identified intermediates detailed pathways for sdz removal were proposed in fig 7 the parent compound with an m z of 251 was easy to be hydroxylated and its products had an m z of 268 product a this process was also proved by the previous study feng et al 2016 also so2 extrusion was a common intermediate during the sulfonamides degradation sun et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 in this study an intermediate product b with an m z of 187 was found which was 64 lower than sdz m z 251 then product b was transformed into product c m z 201 through 1o2 oxidation according to our previous study sun et al 2021 which was also consistent with the contribution of 1o2 we mentioned in section 3 3 2 n o bond was not stable and easily fell off to generate product d with an m z of 171 then the cn bond in the pyrimidine ring was easy to be cleavage and the product e m z 138 was obtained chen et al 2021 additionally the direct cleavage of the s n bond was another pathway during the sdz degradation in the pds based system zhou et al 2016 that was proved by the detection of 2 aminopyridine g m z 96 and 4 hydro sulfonyl aniline f m z 158 the aniline in product f was oxidized and fell off to form product i m z 141 at the same time the generated aniline after so2 extrusion was hydroxylated to generate the product j with an m z of 109 the lack of ms information for aniline was due to its easy oxidization in pds oxidation systems anotai et al 2011 sun et al 2021 then product j was eventually transformed into product k namely maleic acid m z 116 feng et al 2016 li et al 2005 as for the pyridine ring in product g it could be opened during the oxidation as evidenced by the product l m z 104 and m m z 99 generation then product l could be further oxidized to generate product n m z 88 and o m z 70 and eventually generate low molecules and inorganic ions table s5 exhibited the toxicity of sdz and its intermediate products which was predicted by the ecosar program the acute toxic levels of sdz and its intermediates were assessed according to the european union criteria i e extremely toxic 1 mg l toxic 1 10 mg l harmful 10 100 mg l and harmless 100 mg l and the chronic toxic levels were classified according to the chinese hazard chemical evaluation guidelines hj ti 154 2004 i e extremely toxic 0 1 mg l toxic 0 1 1 mg l harmful 1 10 mg l and harmless 10 mg l different colors were utilized to distinguish the degree of toxicity the daphnia was most sensitive to sdz and its intermediates the toxicity of a d m n were similar to that of sdz the products b f g j o had higher toxicity to daphnia while the products e h i k l had lower toxicity some intermediates e g f g and j were classified as toxic indicating that these generated intermediates had higher risk than sdz itself this on the other hand proved the selectivity of cu ⅲ and would not completely mineralize the parent pollutants thus the sdz degradation in this system might require further mineralization and detoxification 4 conclusion this study investigated the sdz degradation via the cu2 calcite pds system results suggested that low concentrations of cu2 and calcite synergistically degrade sdz via pds activation also the cu2 calcite pds system had a certain adaptability to ph and anions according to the scavenger results and esr analysis the major reactive species was cu ⅲ which was generated by cu ⅱ via electron transfer additionally combined with xrd atr ftir cv curves and xps analysis calcite played an important role in transforming cu2 into cu ⅱ solid cuco3 which generates cu ⅲ via pds activation besides calcite also had the effect of buffering the ph value making the ph value of the system close to neutral after the reaction compared to other cu based materials the cu2 calcite pds system showed a significantly environmentally friendly characteristic by utilizing the naturally existing cu2 in the water body and ubiquitous calcite in the subsurface to exert an efficient degradation effect also different synthetic wastewater e g tap water hubing lake nanfei river had little effect on the sdz degradation in the cu2 calcite pds system moreover the toxicity prediction by ecosar showed that the toxicity of most intermediates was decreased compared with the parent sdz this work is of great significance to the comprehensive utilization of natural calcite and provides a new insight into the application of pollution free minerals such as calcite to organic pollutants treatment considering the abundant existence of calcite it can be used not only as a material in water treatment but also as an important process in groundwater in situ chemical oxidation isco declaration of competing interest the

15912,permanganate mn vii is widely used as a mild oxidant in water treatment however the reaction rates of some emerging contaminants with mn vii are extremely low in this study benzoquinone bq a redox mediator with the important component in dissolved organic matter dom enhanced the oxidation of bisphenol a bpa by mn vii in a wide ph range of 4 0 10 0 the redox cycle of bq would produce semiquinone radicals which could act as ligands to stabilize the formed mn iii in the system to promote the oxidation of bpa notably the presence of bq might promote the formation of mno2 a novel mechanism was proposed that singlet oxygen 1o2 mn iii ligands mn iii l and in situ formed mno2 were the main contributors to accelerate bpa degradation in the mn vii bq system under acidic conditions the in situ formed mno2 involved in the redox reaction and part of the mn iv was reduced to mn iii indicating that the electron transfer of bq promoted the formation of active mn species and enhanced the mn vii oxidation performance semiquinone radicals generated by bq transformation would couple with the hydrogen substitution products of bpa to inhibit bpa self coupling and promote the ring opening reactions of bpa mn vii bq had better effect in raw water than in pure water indicating that the mn vii bq system has high potential for practical application this study provided insights into the role of dom in enhancing the mn vii oxidation in water treatment graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords permanganate benzoquinone bq bisphenol a bpa redox mediator mechanism 1 introduction recently the occurrence of organic emerging contaminants ecs in the aqueous environment such as endocrine disrupting chemicals pesticides and pharmaceuticals has attracted attention due to their potential threats to the ecosystems gao et al 2021 chen et al 2016 however conventional water treatment processes often exhibit unsatisfactory removal rates of ecs rosenfeldt and linden 2004 therefore various processes such as biological method xie et al 2011 adsorption qian et al 2018 and advanced oxidation processes aops pelaez et al 2012 bu et al 2021 have been developed to enhance the removal of ecs in which the permanganate mn vii oxidation process is widely used due to its easy availability stability and negligible formation of halogenated by products waldemer and tratnyek 2006 li et al 2021 in addition mn vii is also used in the pre oxidation process of raw water to control odor and other pollutants xie et al 2013 jeong et al 2017 mn vii can easily react with organic pollutants containing electron rich moieties jiang et al 2012 but has the low reaction rates with certain ecs gao et al 2014 therefore research on enhancing the oxidation efficiency and applicability of mn vii has been gradually developed including bisulfite sun et al 2015 graphite peng et al 2021 ultraviolet uv guo et al 2018 ozone liang et al 2018 and organic redox mediators orms shi et al 2020 xu et al 2017 song et al 2015 the reactivity of mn vii can be enhanced mainly by the production of intermediate manganese species such as mn iii and mn iv and or reactive oxygen species e g hydroxyl radicals and 1o2 guo et al 2018 li et al 2021 however the roles of intermediate manganese species and reactive oxygen species in mn vii oxidation were still complex and need to be further explored natural orms e g hydroquinone hq jiang et al 2015 benzoquinone bq xu et al 2019 and catechol song et al 2021 have attracted considerable attention because they contain phenolic co or noh groups that have been confirmed to be the characteristic components of dom zhou et al 2015 among them bq is one of the important functional groups of humic substance and dom in the natural environment and can act as electron shuttles in biological and chemical reactions newman and kolter 2000 zhou et al 2021 wang et al 2020a the reactivity of bq is related to its redox cycle process including reduction to produce semiquinone radicals sq or sequential reduced to form hydroquinone hq scheme s1 walpen et al 2018 brose and james 2010 a previous study has found that bq can activate the persulfate ps mainly through its redox cycle to produce semiquinone radicals leading to the activation of ps to generate sulfate radicals so4 fang et al 2013 moreover recent studies have also reported that bq can promote the oxidation of organic pollutants by mn vii zhou et al 2021 xu et al 2018 several mechanisms have been proposed for bq enhanced mn vii system it has been reported that mn iii and 1o2 played major roles in accelerating levofloxacin degradation by mn vii in presence of bq at neutral conditions xu et al 2018 another study has shown that bq can promote the production of mno2 to effectively catalyze mn vii for the removal of pollutants at ph 5 7 zhou et al 2021 it can be seen that bq has different effects on the degradation of organic pollutants by mn vii and the role active species e g intermediate mn and or reactive oxygen species involved in mn vii bq system has not been systematically investigated therefore considering that bq is one of the common functional groups in dom and would involve in the mn vii pre oxidation process it is necessary to clarify the mechanism of the mn vii bq system the results will help to understand the complex role of dom in the degradation of ecs in natural water during mn vii pre oxidation process in this study bpa was used as the target organic compound and bq was used as the model electron transfer mediator to explore the synergistic enhancement mechanism in the mn vii bq system the effects of bq concentration and initial ph on bpa degradation were evaluated the reactive oxygen species and mn species in the reaction system were determined bpa degradation pathways in the mn vii bq system were explored new insights into the mechanism of the mn vii bq system and the role of bq were proposed moreover the effect of ha as the major organic component in natural water in the mn vii bq system was explored and the degradation efficiency of six ecs was explored for evaluating the applicability of the mn vii bq system in raw water the results could provide theoretical guidance for the application of mn vii oxidation in water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents bisphenol a bpa and potassium

sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 manganese sulfate mnso4 potassium pyrophosphate pp furfuryl alcohol ffa and humic acid ha were obtained from sigma aldrich usa permanganate mn vii manganese dioxide mno2 sodium tetraborate sulfuric acid h2so4 and sodium hydroxide naoh were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china methanol meoh and acetonitrile of hplc grade were purchased from j t baker usa all solutions were prepared with milli q water with conductivity 18 2 mω cm millipore usa raw water was from a reservoir in shanghai china and stored at 4 c before use the parameters were presented in table s1 2 2 experimental procedures all experiments were conducted in 200 ml glass beakers with continuously magnetic stirring during the reaction at ambient temperature 20 1 c batch experiments were started by adding the stock mn vii solution 10 mm into the reaction solutions containing bpa 5 μm in the presence or absence of bq the initial ph of the reaction system was adjusted by trace amount of naoh or h2so4 solution the buffers were 10 mm borate for ph 7 0 10 0 or acetate for ph 4 0 6 0 with negligible effect on permanganate degradation of contaminants jiang et al 2009 results confirmed that there was negligible change of ph value during the whole reaction process samples were withdrawn at regular time intervals and quenched with excess sodium thiosulfate before analysis moreover tba and ffa were used as quenchers for hydroxyl radicals oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 respectively potassium pyrophosphate pp was used to stabilize mn iii mn iii ligands were synthesized based on previous studies jiang et al 2010 after the reaction the suspended solids in the solution were collected and dried for further characterization 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of bpa and other organic compounds were quantified by using an ultra performance liquid chromatograph uplc waters usa equipped with an xterra ms c18 column 5 μm 2 1 250 mm waters and a uv detector further details about the mobile phase and detector wavelength were provided in table s2 in supporting information si the spectral changes of the solution during the reaction were analyzed

zeiss merlin compact and an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds oxford x max were used to detect the formed mno2 intermediate in the mn vii bq system x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo scientific was used to examine the variation of the chemical state of the formed mno2 intermediate the degradation intermediates of bpa were identified by using a acquity uplc system waters usa equipped with a sq detector 2 mass spectrometer sqd2 waters usa an acquity uplc csh c18 column 1 7 μm 2 1 50 mm waters usa was used for analyte separation detailed information is shown in text s1 3 results and discussions 3 1 degradation kinetics of bpa in the mn vii bq system the degradation of bpa in mn vii alone bq alone and mn vii bq systems was investigated as shown in fig 1 a the degradation of bpa was negligible in the bq alone system about 62 bpa was degraded in the mn vii alone system notably the degradation efficiency of bpa significantly increased to 99 5 in the mn vii bq system suggesting that other active species might be generated in the mn vii bq system to achieve high efficiencies in bpa degradation moreover the effect of bq concentration on the pseudo first order rate constant k obs min 1 of bpa degradation was further studied fig 1 b the k obs for bpa degradation increased about 5 fold from 0 0486 to 0 2544 min 1 when the bq concentration increased from 0 to 10 μm however the degradation rate of bpa was inhibited when bq concentration further increased to 15 μm this might be due to excessive bq would consume the active species in the system or excessive intermediates would be self quenched xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 results exhibited that the bq concentration of 5 0 μm achieved the satisfactory degradation efficiency of bpa as 99 5 in 20 min moreover the removal rate of toc could reach 12 4 in the mn vii bq system after 20 min fig s1 therefore the bq concentration of 5 0 μm was selected for further experiments on the other hand the effect of initial ph on the degradation of bpa was explored in the mn vii alone and mn vii bq systems respectively as shown in figs 2 a and s2 the degradation of bpa in both systems was ph dependent the k obs of bpa degradation in the mn vii bq system was higher than that in the mn vii alone system at the ph range of 4 0 to 10 0 indicating that the enhancement effect of the mn vii bq system was also applicable in a wide ph range in mn vii alone system the k obs of bpa degradation increased with increasing ph from 4 0 to 10 0 fig 2 b the reaction rates between bpa and mn vii increased significantly at ph 9 0 and 10 0 which were close to the pk a 9 6 10 2 of bpa and the results are consistent with those in previous studies du et al 2012 jiang et al 2014 a similar phenomenon was observed for bpa degradation in the mn vii bq system as the ph increased from 6 0 to 10 0 the k obs of bpa degradation increased from 0 2392 to 1 299 min 1 which can be ascribed to the ph dependent effect of bpa speciation the dissociated bpa was more susceptible to mn vii oxidation due to the stronger electron donating ability of the hydroxyl groups after deprotonation jiang et al 2010 it is well known that the in situ formed mno2 during the activation of mn vii has a catalytic effect in the oxidation process zhang et al 2021 however mno2 is ineffective in removing pollutants under alkaline conditions lin et al 2009 therefore there might be due to the reason that some intermediates formed in the mn vii bq system play an important role reductant or catalyst in promoting the entire reaction in addition the degradation efficiency of bpa at ph 4 0 is higher than that at ph 5 0 and 6 0 which might be due to the high h concentration in acidic conditions would promote the formation of semiquinone radical in the mn vii bq system has a positive effect on the reaction xu et al 2017 the enhancement mechanism of the reaction system was further explored and discussed in the following sections 3 2 mechanism of the mn vii bq system the redox cycle of bq reduced by electrons to form semiquinone radicals can occur spontaneously in the natural environment scheme s1 vitaly et al 1999 studies have shown that o2 was the natural oxidation product of semiquinone radicals sq in the redox cycle of quinone groups and would rapidly disproportionate in water to generate oh eqs 1 and 2 yuan et al 2013 therefore identifying the active species in the system is essential for further clarifying the mechanism of bpa degradation in the mn vii bq system 1 o2 h2o ho2 oh 2 ho2 h2o h2o2 oh the results in the previous section have shown that excessive bq would slightly inhibit the degradation of bpa fig 1 b because bq can also act as a scavenger of o2 the excessive concentration of bq would consume o2 and inhibit the formation of other reactive species tba was used as a scavenger of oh to determine its contribution k oh tba 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 in the mn vii bq system zhou et al 2015 as shown in fig 3 a a certain inhibitory effect on the degradation of bpa was observed with the dosage of 2 mm tba as the concentration of tba further increased to 5 mm the degradation efficiency of bpa decreased from 99 5 to 83 2 indicating that the presence of oh in the system had slightly contribution to the degradation of pollutants however the addition of tba cannot completely inhibit the reaction indicating that there are still other active species in the mn vii bq system it has been reported that o2 can also act as a precursor to produce singlet oxygen 1o2 eq 3 cheng et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 a previous study has reported that mn iii can react with sq to produce 1o2 in the presence of oxygen eq 4 xu et al 2018 therefore to further explore the reactive species of the reaction system ffa has been used as the scavenger to confirm the presence of 1o2 with a reaction rate constant of 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 zhou et al 2015 as shown in fig 3 b with the addition of ffa at the concentrations of 2 and 5 mm the degradation efficiency of bpa decreased to 78 6 and 63 8 respectively indicating that 1o2 was generated and act as a contributor to bpa degradation in the mn vii bq system in addition dissolved oxygen do usually plays an important role in the generation of 1o2 and its effect on bpa degradation was thus evaluated the degradation rate of bpa was inhibited in the solution purging with nitrogen fig s3 indicating that do was involved in generation of 1o2 so as to affect the reaction system 3 o2 2h2o 1o2 h2o2 2oh 4 mn iii sq 2o2 mn ii bq 1o2 o2 in addition due to the multivalent characteristics of manganese in the natural environment previous studies have found that mn species including mn ii mn iii and mn iv were the main active species in the mn vii mediated oxidation system jiang et al 2009 it has been reported that mn vii can be reduced to mn ii in the presence of bq and mn ii would then react with bq to produce mn iii and sq scheme 1 xu et al 2018 mn iii always plays an important role in mn vii based reaction systems jiang et al 2009 however soluble mn iii was unstable and would rapidly disproportionate to mn iv and mn ii rather than involved in the oxidation of pollutants in the presence of ligands mn iii can be stabilized to form mn iii ligand mn iii l and then involved in the oxidation of pollutants pp was used as the ligand stabilize the formed mn iii to verify its role as shown in fig 4 the addition of pp significantly enhanced the degradation efficiency of bpa indicating that mn iii l significantly accelerated the oxidation of bpa in the mn vii bq system the acceleration effect was weakened with increasing pp concentration because the presence of low concentrations of ligands increased the exposure of mn iii to enhance the oxidation performance however the reactivity of mn iii will decrease with increasing ligand concentration resulting in weakened oxidation performance jiang et al 2010 li et al 2021 in addition it has been reported that the formed sq during the reaction can act as ligand to stabilize mn iii through the oh to form mn iii l scheme 1 xu et al 2018 previous studies have also reported that the mn iii l as a potent oxidant would be involved in the oxidation of phenolics by mn vii gao et al 2018 jiang et al 2009 wang et al 2020b in order to further determine the mechanism of the reaction system the degradation of bpa by mn iii l was investigated as shown in fig s4 the degradation efficiency of bpa is significantly enhanced by mn iii l indicating that mn iii l played an important role in the mn vii bq system in addition mn vii reacted with bq to produce mn ii and then mn ii continued to react with bq to produce mn iii and sq scheme 1 and in the presence of ligand sq mn ii will also react with mn vii to produce mn iii l jiang et al 2010 as shown in fig s5 the addition of mn ii into the mn vii bq system also accelerated bpa removal efficiency this was similar to the results of jiang et al 2009 indicating that the addition of mn ii could react with mn vii and bq to rapidly produce mn iii which accelerated the removal of bpa in order to further confirm the active mn species the solutions in different systems after 10 min reaction were evaluated using a uv vis and the scan results were displayed in fig s6 a the slight decay of mn vii at 525 nm and the formation of colloidal mno2 at 300 to 400 nm were observed in the mn vii bpa and mn vii bq systems jiang et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 it can be found that the decay of mn vii was significantly accelerated and the generation of mn iv was largely increased in the mn vii bq bpa system fig s6 a this can be attributed to the rapid reaction of mn vii with bq to produce active mn species and then part of mn iii will disproportionate to mn iv resulting in the increase of mn iv additionally bq bpa and oxidized intermediates also resulted in more mn vii consumption and more mn iv generation as the reaction time increased mn vii continuously reduced leading to increasing generation of mn iv fig s6 b suspended solids formed in the mn vii bq bpa system during the reaction process fig s7 which were collected and characterized the sem images of the formed solids showed agglomerated morphology and the eds spectra confirmed the presence of o and mn elements in a ratio about 2 1 fig s8 indicating that the formed suspended solids might be mno2 it has been reported that the in situ generated mno2 can promote the oxidation efficiency by mn vii but the effect can be weakened with the increase of ph song et al 2019 guo et al 2021 therefore we further used xps to analyze the surface composition of the collected mno2 and the results were displayed in fig 5 the fitted peaks at 641 5 and 642 8 ev were the binding peaks of mn iii and mn iv with the contents of 24 7 and 75 3 respectively dong et al 2019 huang et al 2017 indicating that the formed mno2 involved in the redox reaction and part of the mn iv was reduced to mn iii at ph 6 0 the role of mno2 in the mn vii bq system was further evaluated it can be found that the addition of mno2 significantly accelerated the degradation of bpa fig s9 indicating that mno2 also played an important role in the mn vii bq system in summary the mechanism of bpa oxidation by mn vii bq reaction system was proposed in scheme 1 firstly mn vii reacted rapidly with bq to produce mn ii and mn ii continued to react with bq to generate mn iii and sq mn iii was unstable and easily disproportionated into mn ii and mn iv the presence of bq enhanced the production of mn iv promoting the oxidation of bpa under weak acidic conditions zhou et al 2021 in addition the reaction of mn iii with sq can produce 1o2 and also regenerate bq and mn ii 1o2 played an important role in bpa degradation moreover sq can act as a ligand for mn iii and in the presence of ligands mn ii can react with mn vii to produce mn iii l which accelerated the degradation of bpa 3 3 degradation pathways of bpa in the mn vii bq system in order to better understand the enhancement mechanism of bpa degradation in the mn vii bq system the transformation products tps were analyzed with the detailed information of the tps presented in table s3 and accordingly the possible degradation pathways were proposed in fig 6 first bpa will be attacked in the reaction system and undergo hydrogen abstract reaction to form phenoxy radical tp3 which was easily interchangeable with other forms tp1 and tp2 through resonance jiang et al 2014 subsequently based on the detected intermediates three possible degradation pathways were proposed including hydroxylation and ring opening pathway i β scission pathway ii and coupling process with semiquinone radical pathway iii in pathway i the ortho position of the benzene ring was attacked through hydroxylation to form hydroxylated bpa tp4 tp4 was further dehydrogenated to form quinones tp5 followed by the ring opening reaction to form carboxyl groups tp6 and further decarboxylation and ring opening this pathway is consistent with previous reports shi et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 moreover β scission is also one of the pathways of bpa fragmentation it is reported that the intermediate tp1 will be transformed into cationic products tp8 not been detected and radical products tp9 via β scission tp10 was a substituted product of tp8 could be detected in the reaction system in this study therefore there might be a β scission process in the degradation of bpa fig 6 lin et al 2009 previous studies have reported that there are coupling processes in the degradation of bpa which usually include co coupling and cc coupling shi et al 2020 zhang and huang 2005 the semiquinone radicals formed in the mn vii bq system can easily couple with the hydrogen substitution products tp2 of bpa via co coupling to form tp12 which can further enolize to form tp13 pathway iii the presence of semiquinone radicals in the reaction system could inhibit the self coupling of bpa which could promote the degradation of bpa compared with the oxidation of bpa in the mn vii alone system in a previous study shi et al 2020 more small molecule organics such as hydroxylation products and ring opening products were detected in the mn vii bq system in this study fig 6 the results are consistent with that of toc removal rate in fig s1 indicating that the presence of bq could enhance mn vii oxidation of pollutants 3 4 effects of water constituents on bpa degradation by mn vii bq as one of the main components of natural organic matter humic acid ha is commonly found in the aquatic environment and has been proven to promote mn vii oxidation of pollutant there have been some reports regarding ha accelerating mn vii oxidation of pollutants and the main active species include low valence mn and free radicals sun et al 2021 due to the abundant phenolic and quinone groups ha can also act as a redox mediator in the reaction song et al 2021 the effect of ha on the removal of bpa in the mn vii bq system was evaluated as shown in fig s10 the degradation efficiency of bpa also increased in the mn vii bq system as the concentration of ha increased from 0 to 2 0 mg c l indicating that the presence of ha can enhance the degradation of pollutants in the mn vii bq system previous studies also reported that ha at low concentration tend to promote phenolics oxidation by mn vii he et al 2010 jiang et al 2012 li et al 2021 however the degradation efficiency of bpa did not increase significantly as the ha concentration further increased this may be due to the competition of ha with pollutants for the consumption of oxidants and reactive species previous studies have also reported that higher concentrations of ha or nom would inhibit the oxidation of phenols amines by mn vii which was mainly attributed to the competitive consumption of mn vii and active species by ha or nom li et al 2021 yang et al 2018 the application performance of mn vii alone and mn vii bq systems in real water has also been evaluated in this study raw water was selected from a reservoir in shanghai china and the water quality parameters were analyzed and summarized in table s1 as shown in fig 7 the degradation efficiency of bpa in the raw water was higher than that in pure water in both mn vii alone and mn vii bq systems which is consistent with the experimental results of adding ha in the pure water condition fig s10 the presence of dissolved organic matter dom in the real water can act as electronic shuttles so as to enhance the oxidation of pollutants in the mn vii and mn vii bq systems indicating that the mn vii bq system has the potential to be applied to complex water matrices in addition a series of ecs e g ihx ipm smx 2 4 dcp hq and cbz were selected to verify the broad application of the mn vii bq system for pollutants degradation as shown in fig 8 compared to mn vii oxidation alone the mn vii bq system exhibited higher removal efficiency for the ecs with different functional groups especially for those with phenolic structures however the removal efficiency of iodinated contrast matters icms such as iox and ipm was minorly improved which might be due to the stable structure of icm with low reactivity ye et al 2014 in addition cbz could be rapidly oxidized by mn vii via electrophilic attack on olefinic group in the central heterocyclic ring hu et al 2009 resulting in its excellent degradation efficiency in both mn vii and mn vii bq systems the results imply that the mn vii bq system has high potential for the treatment of organic pollutants in real water considering that bq was also an organic pollutant the removal of bq in the reaction system was also investigated as shown in fig s11 bq slightly degraded in the first 5 min of the reaction remained stable and the removal efficiency of bq was 15 2 in the mn vii bq system this was due to the fact that mn vii could react with bq to generate mn ii and oxidized products at the beginning of the reaction eq 5 and then the formed mn ii reacted with bq to generate semiquinone radicals sq and mn iii eq 6 resulting in the decrease of bq johnson and tebo 2008 xu et al 2018 however the consumption of bq during the reaction did not lead to its higher removal efficiency there might be some pathways involved in the system to convert bq oxidation products back to bq it has been reported that oxygen involved in the redox cycle of bq to regenerate bq eq 7 jiang et al 2015 wang et al 2020a and the formed mn iii during the reaction could react with sq to produce bq in the presence of oxygen eq 4 as shown in fig s11 the degradation efficiency of bq increased to 24 4 in the solution purging with nitrogen the results indicated that bq as an electron shuttle enhanced the removal of pollutants by mn vii and bq itself can also be partially degraded after the reaction which is similar to that reported in previous studies wang et al 2020a li et al 2022 5 mn vii bq mn ii oxidation products 6 mn ii bq h2o mn iii sq 7 sq o2 bq ho2 4 conclusion this study provided new insights into the mechanism of pollutant degradation in the mn vii bq system which showed high efficiency on bpa degradation in a wide ph range of 4 0 10 0 this study has thoroughly explored the reaction mechanism of bpa in the mn vii bq system and clarified the important role of 1o2 mn iii l and the in situ formed mno2 in accelerating the degradation of bpa mn vii would react rapidly with bq to produce mn ii and mn ii continued to react with bq to generate mn iii and sq in addition the reaction of mn iii with sq can produce 1o2 and also regenerate bq and mn ii 1o2 played an important role in bpa degradation sq can act as a ligand for mn iii in the presence of ligands mn ii could react with mn vii to produce mn iii l which accelerated the degradation of bpa bq might promote the production of mno2 which could accelerate the degradation of bpa under acidic conditions in addition the semiquinone radicals produced by the redox cycle of bq could inhibit the self coupling of bpa and promote its mineralization the addition of a small amount of ha could also promote the reaction and the mn vii bq system has better performance in real water than in pure water compared with mn vii oxidation alone the mn vii bq system exhibited higher removal efficiencies for ecs with different functional groups although mn vii bq has a certain improvement in the removal efficiency of organic contaminants with different functional groups the application of this method needs to be further explored due to the selectivity of the oxidant and the unknown toxicity of the intermediates in general

15912,permanganate mn vii is widely used as a mild oxidant in water treatment however the reaction rates of some emerging contaminants with mn vii are extremely low in this study benzoquinone bq a redox mediator with the important component in dissolved organic matter dom enhanced the oxidation of bisphenol a bpa by mn vii in a wide ph range of 4 0 10 0 the redox cycle of bq would produce semiquinone radicals which could act as ligands to stabilize the formed mn iii in the system to promote the oxidation of bpa notably the presence of bq might promote the formation of mno2 a novel mechanism was proposed that singlet oxygen 1o2 mn iii ligands mn iii l and in situ formed mno2 were the main contributors to accelerate bpa degradation in the mn vii bq system under acidic conditions the in situ formed mno2 involved in the redox reaction and part of the mn iv was reduced to mn iii indicating that the electron transfer of bq promoted the formation of active mn species and enhanced the mn vii oxidation performance semiquinone radicals generated by bq transformation would couple with the hydrogen substitution products of bpa to inhibit bpa self coupling and promote the ring opening reactions of bpa mn vii bq had better effect in raw water than in pure water indicating that the mn vii bq system has high potential for practical application this study provided insights into

introduction recently the occurrence of organic emerging contaminants ecs in the aqueous environment such as endocrine disrupting chemicals pesticides and pharmaceuticals has attracted attention due to their potential threats to the ecosystems gao et al 2021 chen et al 2016 however conventional water treatment processes often exhibit unsatisfactory removal rates of ecs rosenfeldt and linden 2004 therefore various processes such as biological method xie et al 2011 adsorption qian et al 2018 and advanced oxidation processes aops pelaez et al 2012 bu et al 2021 have been developed to enhance the

li et al 2021 in addition mn vii is also used in the pre oxidation process of raw water to control odor and other pollutants xie et al 2013 jeong et al 2017 mn vii can easily react with organic pollutants containing electron rich moieties jiang et al 2012 but has the low reaction rates with certain ecs gao et al 2014 therefore research on enhancing the oxidation efficiency and applicability of mn vii has been gradually developed including bisulfite sun et al 2015 graphite peng et al 2021 ultraviolet uv guo et al 2018 ozone liang et al 2018 and organic redox mediators orms shi et al 2020 xu et al 2017 song et al 2015 the reactivity of mn vii can be enhanced mainly by the production of intermediate manganese species such as mn iii and mn iv and or reactive oxygen species e g hydroxyl radicals and 1o2 guo et al 2018 li et al 2021 however the roles of intermediate manganese species and reactive oxygen species in mn vii oxidation were still complex and need to be further explored natural orms e g hydroquinone hq jiang et al 2015 benzoquinone bq xu et al 2019 and catechol song et al 2021 have attracted considerable attention because they contain phenolic co or noh groups that

intermediate mn and or reactive oxygen species involved in mn vii bq system has not been systematically investigated therefore considering that bq is one of the common functional groups in dom and

major organic component in natural water in the mn vii bq system was explored and the degradation efficiency of six ecs was explored for evaluating the applicability of the mn vii bq system in raw water the results could provide theoretical guidance for the application of mn vii oxidation in water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents bisphenol a bpa and potassium

presented in table s1 2 2 experimental procedures all experiments were conducted in 200 ml glass beakers with continuously magnetic stirring during the reaction at ambient temperature 20 1 c batch experiments were started by adding the stock mn vii solution 10 mm into the reaction solutions containing bpa 5 μm in the presence or absence of bq the initial ph of the reaction system was adjusted by trace amount of naoh or h2so4 solution the buffers were 10 mm borate for ph 7 0 10 0 or acetate for ph 4 0 6 0 with negligible effect on permanganate degradation of contaminants jiang et al 2009 results confirmed that there was negligible change of ph value during the whole reaction process samples were withdrawn at regular time intervals and quenched with excess sodium thiosulfate before analysis moreover tba and ffa were used as quenchers for hydroxyl radicals oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 respectively potassium pyrophosphate pp was used to stabilize mn iii mn iii ligands were synthesized based on previous studies jiang et al 2010 after the reaction the suspended solids in the solution were collected and dried for further characterization 2 3 analytical methods the

text s1 3 results and discussions 3 1 degradation kinetics of bpa in the mn vii bq system the degradation of bpa in mn vii alone bq alone and mn vii bq systems was investigated as shown in fig 1 a the degradation of bpa was negligible in the bq alone system about 62 bpa was degraded in the mn vii alone system notably the degradation efficiency of bpa significantly increased to 99 5 in the mn vii bq system suggesting that other active species might be generated in the mn vii bq system to achieve high efficiencies in bpa degradation moreover the effect of bq concentration on the pseudo first order rate constant k obs min 1 of bpa degradation was further studied fig 1 b the k obs for bpa degradation increased about 5 fold from 0 0486 to 0 2544 min 1 when the bq concentration increased from 0 to 10 μm however the degradation rate of bpa was inhibited when bq concentration further increased to 15 μm this might be due to excessive bq would consume the active species in the system or excessive intermediates would be self quenched xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 results exhibited that the bq concentration of 5 0 μm achieved the satisfactory degradation efficiency of bpa as 99 5 in 20 min moreover the removal rate of toc could reach 12 4 in the mn vii bq system after 20 min fig s1 therefore the bq concentration of 5 0 μm was selected for further experiments on the other hand the effect of initial ph on the degradation of bpa was explored in the mn vii alone and mn vii bq systems respectively as shown in figs 2 a and s2 the degradation of bpa in both systems was ph dependent the k obs of bpa degradation in the mn vii bq system was higher than that in the mn vii alone system at the ph range of 4 0 to 10 0 indicating that the enhancement effect of the mn vii bq system was also applicable in a wide ph range in mn vii alone system the k obs of bpa degradation increased with increasing ph from 4 0 to 10 0 fig 2 b the reaction rates between bpa and mn vii increased significantly at ph 9 0 and 10 0 which were close to the pk a 9 6 10 2 of bpa and the results are consistent with those in previous studies du et al 2012 jiang et al 2014 a similar phenomenon was observed for bpa degradation in the mn vii bq system as the ph increased from 6 0 to 10 0 the k obs of bpa degradation increased from 0 2392 to 1 299 min 1 which can be ascribed to the ph dependent effect of bpa speciation the dissociated bpa was more susceptible to mn vii oxidation due to the stronger electron donating ability of the hydroxyl groups after deprotonation jiang et al 2010 it is well known that the in situ formed mno2 during the activation of mn vii has a catalytic effect in the oxidation process zhang et al 2021 however mno2 is ineffective in removing pollutants under alkaline conditions lin et al 2009 therefore there might be due to the reason that some intermediates formed in the mn vii bq system play an important role reductant or catalyst in promoting the entire reaction in addition the degradation efficiency of bpa at ph 4 0 is higher than that at ph 5 0 and 6 0 which might be due to the high h concentration in acidic conditions would promote the formation of semiquinone radical in the mn vii bq system has a positive effect on the reaction xu et al 2017 the enhancement mechanism of the reaction system was further explored and discussed in the following sections 3 2 mechanism of the mn vii bq system the redox cycle of bq reduced by electrons to form semiquinone radicals can occur spontaneously in the natural environment scheme s1 vitaly et al 1999 studies have shown that o2 was the natural oxidation product of semiquinone radicals sq in the redox cycle of quinone groups and would rapidly disproportionate in water to generate oh eqs 1 and 2 yuan et al 2013 therefore identifying the active species in the system is essential for further clarifying the mechanism of bpa degradation in the mn vii bq system 1 o2 h2o ho2 oh 2 ho2 h2o h2o2 oh the results in the previous section have shown that excessive bq would slightly inhibit the degradation of bpa fig 1 b because bq can also act as a scavenger of o2 the excessive concentration of bq would consume o2 and inhibit the formation of other reactive species tba was used as a scavenger of oh to determine its contribution k oh tba 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 in the mn vii bq system zhou et al 2015 as shown in fig 3 a a certain inhibitory effect on the degradation of bpa was observed with the dosage of 2 mm tba as the concentration of tba further increased to 5 mm the degradation efficiency of bpa decreased from 99 5 to 83 2 indicating that the presence of oh in the system had slightly contribution to the degradation of pollutants however the addition of tba cannot completely inhibit the reaction indicating that there are still other active species in the mn vii bq system it has been reported that o2 can also act as a precursor to produce singlet oxygen 1o2 eq 3 cheng et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 a previous study has reported that mn iii can react with sq to produce 1o2 in the presence of oxygen eq 4 xu et al 2018 therefore to further explore the reactive species of the reaction system ffa has been used as the scavenger to confirm the presence of 1o2 with a reaction rate constant of 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 zhou et al 2015 as shown in fig 3 b with the addition of ffa at the concentrations of 2 and 5 mm the degradation efficiency of bpa decreased to 78 6 and 63 8 respectively indicating that 1o2 was generated and act as a contributor to bpa degradation in the mn vii bq system in addition dissolved oxygen do usually plays an important role in the generation of 1o2 and its effect on bpa degradation was thus evaluated the degradation rate of bpa was inhibited in the solution purging with nitrogen fig s3 indicating that do was involved in generation of 1o2 so as to affect the reaction system 3 o2 2h2o 1o2 h2o2 2oh 4 mn iii sq 2o2 mn ii bq 1o2 o2 in addition due to the multivalent characteristics of manganese in the natural environment previous studies have found that mn species including mn ii mn iii and mn iv were the main active species in the mn vii mediated oxidation system jiang et al 2009 it has been reported that mn vii can be reduced to mn ii in the presence of bq and mn ii would then react with bq to produce mn iii and sq scheme 1 xu et al 2018 mn iii always plays an important role in mn vii based reaction systems jiang et al 2009 however soluble mn iii was unstable and would rapidly disproportionate to mn iv and mn ii rather than involved in the oxidation of pollutants in the presence of ligands mn iii can be stabilized to form mn iii ligand mn iii l and then involved in the oxidation of pollutants pp was used as the ligand stabilize the formed mn iii to verify its role as shown in fig 4 the addition of pp significantly enhanced the degradation efficiency of bpa indicating that mn iii l significantly accelerated the oxidation of bpa in the mn vii bq system the acceleration effect was weakened with increasing pp concentration because the presence of low concentrations of ligands increased the exposure of mn iii to enhance the oxidation performance however the reactivity of mn iii will decrease with increasing ligand concentration resulting in weakened oxidation performance jiang et al 2010 li et al 2021 in addition it has been reported that the formed sq during the reaction can act as ligand to stabilize mn iii through the oh to form mn iii l scheme 1 xu et al 2018 previous studies have also reported that the mn iii l as a potent oxidant would be involved in the oxidation of phenolics by mn vii gao et al 2018 jiang et al 2009 wang et al 2020b in order to further determine the mechanism of the reaction system the degradation of bpa by mn iii l was investigated as shown in fig s4 the degradation efficiency of bpa is significantly enhanced by mn iii l indicating that mn iii l played an important role in the mn vii bq system in addition mn vii reacted with bq to produce mn ii and then mn ii continued to react with bq to produce mn iii and sq scheme 1 and in the presence of ligand sq mn ii will also react with mn vii to produce mn iii l jiang et al 2010 as shown in fig s5 the addition of mn ii into the mn vii bq system also accelerated bpa removal efficiency this was similar to the results of jiang et al 2009 indicating that the addition of mn ii could react with mn vii and bq to rapidly produce mn iii which accelerated the removal of bpa in order to further confirm the active mn species the solutions in different systems after 10 min reaction were evaluated using a uv vis and the scan results were displayed in fig s6 a the slight decay of mn vii at 525 nm and the formation of colloidal mno2 at 300 to 400 nm were observed in the mn vii bpa and mn vii bq systems jiang et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 it can be found that the decay of mn vii was significantly accelerated and the generation of mn iv was largely increased in the mn vii bq bpa system fig s6 a this can be attributed to the rapid reaction of mn vii with bq to produce active mn species and then part of mn iii will disproportionate to mn iv resulting in the increase of mn iv additionally bq bpa and oxidized intermediates also resulted in more mn vii consumption and more mn iv generation as the reaction time increased mn vii continuously reduced leading to increasing generation of mn iv fig s6 b suspended solids formed in the mn vii bq bpa system during the reaction process fig s7 which were collected and characterized the sem images of the formed solids showed agglomerated morphology and the eds spectra confirmed the presence of o and mn elements in a ratio about 2 1 fig s8 indicating that the formed suspended solids might be mno2 it has been reported that the in situ generated mno2 can promote the oxidation efficiency by mn vii but the effect can be weakened with the increase of ph song et al 2019 guo et al 2021 therefore we further used xps to analyze the surface composition of the collected mno2 and the results were displayed in fig 5 the fitted peaks at 641 5 and 642 8 ev were the binding peaks of mn iii and mn iv with the contents of 24 7 and 75 3 respectively dong et al 2019 huang et al 2017 indicating that the formed mno2 involved in the redox reaction and part of the mn iv was reduced to mn iii at ph 6 0 the role of mno2 in the mn vii bq system was further evaluated it can be found that the addition of mno2 significantly accelerated the degradation of bpa fig s9 indicating that mno2 also played an important role in the mn vii bq system in summary the mechanism of bpa oxidation by mn vii bq reaction system was proposed in scheme 1 firstly mn vii reacted rapidly with bq to produce mn ii and mn ii continued to react with bq to generate mn iii and sq mn iii was unstable and easily disproportionated into mn ii and mn iv the presence of bq enhanced the production of mn iv promoting the oxidation of bpa under weak acidic conditions zhou et al 2021 in addition the reaction of mn iii with sq can produce 1o2 and also regenerate bq and mn ii 1o2 played an important role in bpa degradation moreover sq can act as a ligand for mn iii and in the presence of ligands mn ii can react with mn vii to produce mn iii l which accelerated the degradation of bpa 3 3 degradation pathways of bpa in the mn vii bq system in order to better understand the enhancement mechanism of bpa degradation in the mn vii bq system the transformation products tps were analyzed with the detailed information of the tps presented in table s3 and accordingly the possible degradation pathways were proposed in fig 6 first bpa will be attacked in the reaction system and undergo hydrogen abstract reaction to form phenoxy radical tp3 which was easily interchangeable with other forms tp1 and tp2 through resonance jiang et al 2014 subsequently based on the detected intermediates three possible degradation pathways were proposed including hydroxylation and ring opening pathway i β scission pathway ii and coupling process with semiquinone radical pathway iii in pathway i the ortho position of the benzene ring was attacked through hydroxylation to form hydroxylated bpa tp4 tp4 was further dehydrogenated to form quinones tp5 followed by the ring opening reaction to form carboxyl groups tp6 and further decarboxylation and ring opening this pathway is consistent with previous reports shi et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 moreover β scission is also one of the pathways of bpa fragmentation it is reported that the intermediate tp1 will be transformed into cationic products tp8 not been detected and radical products tp9 via β scission tp10 was a substituted product of tp8 could be detected in the reaction system in this study therefore there might be a β scission process in the degradation of bpa fig 6 lin et al 2009 previous studies have reported that there are coupling processes in the degradation of bpa which usually include co coupling and cc coupling shi et al 2020 zhang and huang 2005 the semiquinone radicals formed in the mn vii bq system can easily couple with the hydrogen substitution products tp2 of bpa via co coupling to form tp12 which can further enolize to form tp13 pathway iii the presence of semiquinone radicals in the reaction system could inhibit the self coupling of bpa which could promote the degradation of bpa compared with the oxidation of bpa in the mn vii alone system in a previous study shi et al 2020 more small molecule organics such as hydroxylation products and ring opening products were detected in the mn vii bq system in this study fig 6 the results are consistent with that of toc removal rate in fig s1 indicating that the presence of bq could enhance mn vii oxidation of pollutants 3 4 effects of water constituents on bpa degradation by mn vii bq as one of the main components of natural organic matter humic acid ha is commonly found in the aquatic environment and has been proven to promote mn vii oxidation of pollutant there have been some reports regarding ha accelerating mn vii oxidation of pollutants and the main active species include low valence mn and free radicals sun et al 2021 due to the abundant phenolic and quinone groups ha can also act as a redox mediator in the reaction song et al 2021 the effect of ha on the removal of bpa in the mn vii bq system was evaluated as shown in fig s10 the degradation efficiency of bpa also increased in the mn vii bq system as the concentration of ha increased from 0 to 2 0 mg c l indicating that the presence of ha can enhance the degradation of pollutants in the mn vii bq system previous studies also reported that ha at low concentration tend to promote phenolics oxidation by mn vii he et al 2010 jiang et al 2012 li et al 2021 however the degradation efficiency of bpa did not increase significantly as the ha concentration further increased this may be due to the competition of ha with pollutants for the consumption of oxidants and reactive species previous studies have also reported that higher concentrations of ha or nom would inhibit the oxidation of phenols amines by mn vii which was mainly attributed to the competitive consumption of mn vii and active species by ha or nom li et al 2021 yang et al 2018 the application performance of mn vii alone and mn vii bq systems in real water has also been evaluated in this study raw water was selected from a reservoir in shanghai china and the water quality parameters were analyzed and summarized in table s1 as shown in fig 7 the degradation efficiency of bpa in the raw water was higher than that in pure water in both mn vii alone and mn vii bq systems which is consistent with the experimental results of adding ha in the pure water condition fig s10 the presence of dissolved organic matter dom in the real water can act as electronic shuttles so as to enhance the oxidation of pollutants in the mn vii and mn vii bq systems indicating that the mn vii bq system has the potential to be applied to complex water matrices in addition a series of ecs e g ihx ipm smx 2 4 dcp hq and cbz were selected to verify the broad application of the mn vii bq system for pollutants degradation as shown in fig 8 compared to mn vii oxidation alone the mn vii bq system exhibited higher removal efficiency for the ecs with different functional groups especially for those with phenolic structures however the removal efficiency of iodinated contrast matters icms such as iox and ipm was minorly improved which might be due to the stable structure of icm with low reactivity ye et al 2014 in addition cbz could be rapidly oxidized by mn vii via electrophilic attack on olefinic group in the central heterocyclic ring hu et al 2009 resulting in its excellent degradation efficiency in both mn vii and mn vii bq systems the results imply that the mn vii bq system has high potential for the treatment of organic pollutants in real water considering that bq was also an organic pollutant the removal of bq in the reaction system was also investigated as shown in fig s11 bq slightly degraded in the first 5 min of the reaction remained stable and the removal efficiency of bq was 15 2 in the mn vii bq system this was due to the fact that mn vii could react with bq to generate mn ii and oxidized products at the beginning of the reaction eq 5 and then the formed mn ii reacted with bq to generate semiquinone radicals sq and mn iii eq 6 resulting in the decrease of bq johnson and tebo 2008 xu et al 2018 however the consumption of bq during the reaction did not lead to its higher removal efficiency there might be some pathways involved in the system to convert bq oxidation products back to bq it has been reported that oxygen involved in the redox cycle of bq to regenerate bq eq 7 jiang et al 2015 wang et al 2020a and the formed mn iii during the reaction could react with sq to produce bq in the presence of oxygen eq 4 as shown in fig s11 the degradation efficiency of bq increased to 24 4 in the solution purging with nitrogen the results indicated that bq as an electron shuttle enhanced the removal of pollutants by mn vii and bq itself can also be partially degraded after the reaction which is similar to that reported in previous studies wang et al 2020a li et al 2022 5 mn vii bq mn ii oxidation products 6 mn ii bq h2o mn iii sq 7 sq o2 bq ho2 4 conclusion this study provided new insights into the mechanism of pollutant degradation in the mn vii bq system which showed high efficiency on bpa degradation in a wide ph range of 4 0 10 0 this study has thoroughly explored the reaction mechanism of bpa in the mn vii bq system and clarified the important role of 1o2 mn iii l and the in situ formed mno2 in accelerating the degradation of bpa mn vii would react rapidly with bq to produce mn ii and mn ii continued to react with bq to generate mn iii and sq in addition the reaction of mn iii with sq can produce 1o2 and also regenerate bq and mn ii 1o2 played an important role in bpa degradation sq can act as a ligand for mn iii in the presence of ligands mn ii could react with mn vii to produce mn iii l which accelerated the degradation of bpa bq might promote the production of mno2 which could accelerate the degradation of bpa under acidic conditions in addition the semiquinone radicals produced by the redox cycle of bq could inhibit the self coupling of bpa and promote its mineralization the addition of a small amount of ha could also promote the reaction and the mn vii bq system has better performance in real water than in pure water compared with mn vii oxidation alone the mn vii bq system exhibited higher removal efficiencies for ecs with different functional groups although mn vii bq has a certain improvement in the removal efficiency of organic contaminants with different functional groups the application of this method needs to be further explored due to the selectivity of the oxidant and the unknown toxicity of the intermediates in general understanding the interaction mechanism of bq and mn vii helps to better clarify the role of dom in the mn vii oxidation system during water treatment declaration of competing interest the authors

phototrophic bacteria ppb cultures has not been studied and its understanding is critical for proper process modelling and reactor design especially for scaled systems this work evaluated the effect of different biomass concentrations reactor configurations wastewater matrices and growth conditions on the attenuation extent of near infra red nir and ultraviolet visible uv vis light spectra the results show that increased biomass concentrations lead to higher light attenuation and that ppb absorb both vis and nir wavelengths with both fractions of the spectrum being equally absorbed at biomass concentrations above 1 000 g cod m 3 a flat plate configuration showed less attenuation compared with cylindrical reactors illuminated from the top representative for open ponds neither a complex wastewater matrix nor the presence of polyhydroxyalkanoates under nutrient limited conditions affected light attenuation significantly the pigment concentration both bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids however had a strong effect with significant attenuation in the presence of pigments attenuation predictions using the lambert beer law excluding scattering and the schuster model including scattering indicated that light scattering had a minimal effect a proposed mathematical model based on the lambert beer law and a monod function for light requirements allowed effective prediction of the kinetics of photoheterotrophic growth this resulted in a half saturation coefficient of 4 6 w m 2 finally the results showed that in dense outdoor ppb cultures 1 000 g cod m 3

value added products such as polyhydroxyalkanoates phas carotenoids or biomass e g as single cell protein scp or fertilizer to balance the overall costs capson tojo et al 2020 under anaerobic illuminated conditions ppb biomass is generated via anoxygenic photosynthesis enabling the simultaneous assimilation of organics nitrogen and phosphorus from waste streams via photoheterotrophic growth thanks to their ability to use light as energy source ppb biomass yields in terms of cod removed close to unity can be achieved which maximises the recovery potentials while minimising dissipative resource losses e g as co2 n2 or metal bound p ppb transform light energy into chemical energy via light harvesting complexes lhc and reaction centres lhcs are composed of bacteriochlorophylls bchls and a range of carotenoids ppb utilise bchls for energy harvesting with dominant absorbence wavelengths at over 800 900 nm within the near infrared nir spectrum over 700 nm saer and blankenship 2017 ppb have accessory absorption capabilities in the visible vis range around 400 700 nm due to the presence of several carotenoids which enable electron transfer to bchls canniffe and hunter 2014 the utilisation of nir wavelengths by ppb avoids the growth of other photosynthetic microbes e g algae and cyanobacteria in nir illuminated systems which enables effective selection and enrichment of ppb hülsen et al 2018a 2014 madigan et al 2011 despite the advantages of phototrophic processes their inherent dependence on light also constitutes the main limiting factor in any engineered phototrophic system acién fernández et al 1997 naderi et al 2017 in the case of ppb artificial illumination in large scale systems appears economically prohibitive and natural illumination with sunlight is the logical alternative capson tojo et al 2020 where an efficient light supply is even more crucial as light availability cannot be controlled therefore studying light attenuation and distribution within the reactors as well as its accurate mathematical modelling are critical for a proper reactor design and operation molina grima et al 1999 decades of research have defined and partly solved the problems related to light availability in microalgae cultures posten 2009 while ppb technology can profit from algae research this knowledge cannot be directly transferred to ppb pbrs one obvious difference between algae and ppb systems is caused by the higher water selective absorption of nir light see for example braun and smirnov 2020 compared to vis wavelengths used by algae at similar light paths e g reactor width or water column depending on the design the ppb reactor will a priori have substantially less usable light than an equivalent microalgal system as ppb preferentially use nir wavelengths as energy source a recent study has indeed shown that although ppb can also use vis wavelengths they capability for doing so is limited meaning that they still depend on nir light availability to grow efficiently yu et al 2022 ppb reactors laboratory scale units have also been reported to operate at higher biomass concentrations compared to traditional hraps 1 0 vs 0 5 gbiomass l 1 which is expected to amplify shading effects and nir attenuation via light absorption by pigments acién fernández et al 1997 capson tojo et al 2020 robles et al 2020b wágner et al 2018 several other aspects such as the cultivation strategy e g pbr vs open pond anaerobic vs aerobic or mixing strategy reactor geometry e g affecting light scattering media complexity e g secondary instead of tertiary treatment and pigment concentration can affect light attenuation pigments concentration in ppb and thus potentially light attenuation by biomass is impacted by oxygen which can be present either via active aeration or turbulent mixing or passive oxygen transfer surface diffusion oxidative conditions which can result from the presence of oxygen are known to inhibit the expression of most genes coding for lhc and reaction centre complexes gregor and klug 1999 sganga and bauer 1992 zhu et al 1986 which ultimately suppresses photoheterotrophic growth and results in pigment loss capson tojo et al 2021 due to these differences compared to algal systems the study of light attenuation and distribution within ppb reactors as well as its accurate mathematical modelling are critical for proper reactor design and operation several models have described this for algal systems and they can also be applied for nir behaviour the most widely applied model to represent light attenuation is the lambert beer equation acién fernández et al 1997 marsullo et al 2015 ruiz martínez et al 2016 this model can accurately represent light absorption in the reactors due to biomass and pigments however it accounts for light scattering as energy loss via absorption neglecting the scattering of light by solids and it has been found to lead to considerable errors in dense concentrated microalgae cultures acién fernández et al 1997 wágner et al 2018 an option to account for light scattering is the schuster s model adapted for cyanobacteria cultures by cornet et al 1992 in addition empirical hyperbolic models have also been applied to model attenuation in microalgae cultures achieving accurate predictions of the light distributions acién fernández et al 1997 naderi et al 2017 although other algorithms exist such as those based on radiate transfer equations pilon et al 2011 the models presented above are generally considered as the best options in terms of accuracy simplicity compromise naderi et al 2017 the most relevant mechanistic model describing ppb growth for resource recovery from wastewater is the photo anaerobic model panm presented in puyol et al 2017 light attenuation is not considered in this model and the effect of light intensity is modelled following a type i approach béchet et al 2013 assuming that the incident light intensity on the reactor wall is constant through the entire reactor volume a recent model for hydrogen production with ppb included light attenuation but the conditions were different to those found in resource recovery applications anye cho et al 2021 moreover no experiments were conducted to estimate the relevant parameters light intensity throughout the culture was not measured and parameter estimation was performed for a combination of light related parameters while light attenuation and distribution have been extensively studied for microalgal cultures acién fernández et al 1997 béchet et al 2013 naderi et al 2017 ruiz martínez et al 2016 wágner et al 2018 this is missing for ppb therefore the objective of this work is to determine the influence of relevant factors on light attenuation in ppb based systems more precisely light attenuation was studied under different i reactor configurations ii biomass concentrations iii wastewater matrices iv growth conditions and v pigment contents in addition different mathematical models to describe light attenuation were compared to identify the most accurate option experiments were also performed to determine the minimum light intensities allowing effective ppb growth finally the panm has been modified to consider the impact of light attenuation on ppb growth 2 material and methods 2 1 ppb enrichments and growth media ppb were enriched from pre settled domestic wastewater characteristics shown in table s1 under anaerobic illuminated conditions in a 2 l schott bottle following the procedure described in hülsen et al 2014 once the typical purple colour was observed indication for the presence of bchl and carotenoids after around 7 days 5 sequential dilutions were carried out to further enrich ppb using ormerod media ormerod et al 1961 at a 1 4 inoculation ratio and with a batch length of 3 4 days the enrichment volume increased with each dilution obtaining eventually 30 l of enriched ppb culture placed in three separate 10 l schott bottles these cultures of 10 l each were used for the experiments described below sections 2 1 1 2 1 3 2 1 1 further enrichment and ppb up concentration to further increase the ppb concentrations in the enrichments the three 10 l bottles were re fed three times each as fed batch at the start of each fed batch cycle with a duration of 3 4 days the reactors were spiked with 300 mg cod l 1 of glacial acetic acid and with the corresponding amounts of micro macro nutrients in ormerod media to further increase the biomass concentration two of the 10 l bottles were centrifuged 10 min at 3500 rpm using an allegra x 12 centrifuge beckman coulter and the concentrated fraction was then mixed with the remaining 10 l enrichment magnetic mixing was provided at 200 rpm over 2 h to ensure homogeneity this resulted in an up concentrated enrichment that allowed to test the attenuation effect at high total solids ts concentrations the initial biomass concentration in the resulting concentrated enrichment was 2463 g cod m 3 1 6 g vss l 1 vss being volatile suspended solids this enrichment was used to generate sequential dilutions at lower ts contents from x2 to x32 dilutions 2 1 2 effect of pigments on light attenuation this experiment was designed to evaluate the impact of the presence absence of pigments on light attenuation and to assess the attenuation caused by the biomass itself e g light absorption shading scattering etc to produce a pigment free ppb culture or with minimum pigment contents a 10 l ppb enrichment the x4 dilution from the concentrated enrichment described above was used as inoculum for a non illuminated continuously aerated enrichment fed with ormerod media as described before and at a 1 4 inoculation ratio the batch lasted for 3 days after which the typical purple colour had disappeared air was provided using a fine bubble aerator 60 cm rubber black air diffuser effosola china and an air compressor tetra whisper 60 air pump 50 l h 1 tetra germany total carotenoids and bchl contents were measured to confirm the pigment loss we note that the resulting culture consisted of a mixture of ppb and aerobic heterotrophs see capson tojo et al 2021 for typical microbial communities after aeration 2 1 3 effect of pha on light attenuation a final enrichment was carried out to determine the impact of nutrient depleted or excess cod growth conditions on the light attenuation effect mostly due to accumulation of pha granules within the cells which might affect light passage for this purpose the x4 dilution from the previous up concentrated enrichment section 2 1 1 was used as inoculum for a pha accumulating experiment 1 4 inoculation ratio working volume of 10 l to maximise pha accumulation three sequential batch enrichment cycles were carried out as follows i the cycle was started with a modified ormerod media with reduced nh4 n supply from 107 mg n l 1 in regular ormerod to 30 mg n l 1 to ensure nh4 n consumption at the end of this phase ii after 2 days the enrichment was fed with extra cod as acetic acid 500 mg l 1 to favour pha accumulation under n limiting conditions iii on day 3 nh4 n was added at 30 mg l 1 to select for pha accumulating organisms under cod limiting conditions iv on day 6 the cycle was stopped and the process was repeated using the resulting enrichment as inoculum at a 1 4 inoculation ratio for comparison purposes a control reactor was carried out fed with regular ormerod media samples were taken at the end of the enrichments for determining the pha contents 2 1 4 light attenuation in a real wastewater matrix to evaluate the influence of the wastewater matrix on the attenuation effect in ppb cultures compared to the synthetic media used in the previous experiments the effluent from a continuous demonstration scale ppb flat plate reactor treating poultry processing wastewater poultry wastewater treatment effluent pwwte was also used in attenuation tests at three different dilutions x2 x4 and x8 an extensive characterisation of the pwwte can be found in table s1 2 2 experimental setup for attenuation assessment to test the impact of reactor geometry on light attenuation and to represent both open ponds and flat plate reactors the following three configurations were tested i cylindrical reactor illuminated from the top working volume of 6 l inner and outer diameters of 16 and 17 cm respectively and a height of 32 cm ii cylindrical reactor illuminated from the top working volume of 3 l inner and outer diameters of 7 and 8 cm respectively and a height of 81 5 cm iii flat plate reactor illuminated from one side 60 41 20 cm lxhxw working volume of 10 l wall thickness of 1 5 cm all the reactors were made of perspex and light input from any direction other than the one desired was blocked the cylindrical reactors were sprayed with black paint on the sides and bottom and the flat plate was covered with black plastic foam on the bottom and all other sides but the one illuminated the top was covered with a black high density polyethylene cover pictures of the three reactors are given in the supplementary material figure s1 illumination was provided with a 150 w fluorescence lamp nelson portable flood light unfiltered light distribution of 17 below 700 nm 15 at 700 800 nm 20 at 800 900 nm and 48 at 900 1000 nm measured with a stellarnet blue wave spectrometer to measure nir specific light intensities the illuminated sections of the reactors were covered with ultraviolet visible uv vis absorbing foil nd 1 2 299 transformation tubes to measure full spectrum light intensities the foil was simply removed the uv vis fraction of the measured light was determined by subtracting the filtered photon flux density pfd µmol m 2 s 1 consisting mostly of nir light 98 1 of incident light above 700 nm from the full spectrum pfd total incident light intensities on the liquid surface or the reactor wall ranged between 1000 and 1400 µmol m 2 s 1 600 800 w m 2 common values for outdoors light irradiation kandilli and ulgen 2008 this illumination strategy was followed because it represents the conditions found in outdoors ppb enriched reactors hülsen et al 2022b the pfd was determined using a submersible sq 620 extended range pfd sensor with a resolution of 0 1 µmol m 2 s 1 measuring pfd from 340 to 1050 nm coupled to an at 100 µcache bluetooth micro logger apogee instruments inc usa to measure the pfd at different depths in the reactors the base of the sensor was attached to custom made horizontal plastic supports fixed to two magnets aqua one floating magnet glass cleaner aqua one australia qld australia which allowed to vary the depth of the sensor in the case of the flat plate the distances from the light source were modified by placing the sensor on the base of a vertical metallic rod fixed with a horizontal clamp to an external horizontal support that could be moved see figure s2 for pictures of the experimental set up for pfd measurement to ensure proper mixing of the biomass in the system and to prevent settling of solids the reactor content was mixed between each pfd measurement using a fine bubble aerator 60 cm rubber black air diffuser effosola china coupled to an air compressor tetra whisper 60 air pump 50 l per hour tetra germany the accuracy of the experimental set up was tested via repeating one of the tests obtaining almost identical attenuation curves and statistically equal attenuation coefficients p value 0 005 figure s3 2 3 determination of the minimum light intensity allowing efficient photoheterotrophy experiments were carried out to estimate the minimum light intensity required for effective photoheterotrophic growth to minimise attenuation results from batch experiments using 12 well microplates costar in vitro technologies pty ltd australia illuminated at different light intensities from 0 to 80 w m 2 were used to estimate the kinetic parameters of monod functions for substrate uptake each well had a working volume of 6 9 ml and was filled with a mixture of ppb enriched inoculum and ormerod media as described in section 2 1 oxygen exposure was limited by covering the completely filled wells with a transparent plastic film non permeable to oxygen once filled the microplates were placed inside custom built closed plastic boxes the bottoms of the boxes were equipped with nir specific light emitting diodes led strips infrared 850 nm ir led waveform lighting vancouver usa which illuminated the wells only the nir spectrum was considered because enriched ppb reactors are selectively illuminated with this light to allow ppb enrichment capson tojo et al 2020 the boxes were placed inside a thermo scientific maxq400 benchtop orbital shaker thermo fisher scientific ma usa which was used for mixing at 150 rpm and for temperature control 25 27 c a custom built dimmer was used to control the light intensities in the microplates the concentrations of soluble cod scod nh4 n and po4 3 p were followed by wet analyses every 2 3 h wells were sacrificed for this purpose the biomass growth was estimated from optical density od measurements a more precise description of the microplate setup can be found in grassino et al 2022 the maximum specific uptake rate km was estimated by minimization of the residual sum of squares using the function lsqnonlin in matlab matlab r2018b the mathworks inc natick ma 95 confidence intervals were calculated using the function nlparci a value of the half saturation constant ks of 20 mg cod l 1 was assumed puyol et al 2017 the biomass yield y was assumed as 1 g codbiomass g codconsumed 1 puyol et al 2017 biomass decay was considered in the model using a first rate decay constant of 0 09 d 1 puyol et al 2017 the resulting kinetic parameters were used as criteria to identify efficient photoheterotrophic growth batstone et al 2002 henze et al 2000 jeppsson et al 2006 the dependence of km on light intensity was modelled according to a monod substrate saturation function puyol et al 2017 of the form 1 k m i k m i a v e k i i a v e where km i is the specific uptake rate at a given light intensity d 1 km is the maximum specific uptake rate d 1 iave is the average light intensity w m 2 and ki is the half saturation coefficient for light w m 2 parameter uncertainty was assessed as described in batstone et al 2003 2 4 modelling light attenuation in ppb based systems 2 4 1 tested models to represent light attenuation in ppb based systems the light attenuation due to biomass pigments is commonly represented by the lambert beer law eq 2 2 i z i 0 e k a z x p b where iz is the light intensity µmol m 2 s 1 at depth z m i0 is the incident light intensity µmol m 2 s 1 ka is the attenuation coefficient m2 g 1 and xpb is the biomass concentration g cod m 3 despite its wide application the lambert beer law has been deemed as non appropriate for high biomass concentrations mostly because it lumps scattering with absorption considering scattering only as a process resulting in energy loss amongst the models considering light scattering the schuster s law eq 3 is the most popular 3 i z i 0 4 α 1 α 2 e δ z x p b 1 α 2 e δ z x p b being 4 α e a e a e s 5 δ e a e a e s where iz is the light intensity µmol m 2 s 1 at depth z m i0 is the incident light intensity µmol m 2 s 1 xpb is the biomass concentration g cod m 3 ea is the absorption coefficient equivalent to ka if no scattering occurs m2 g 1 and es is the scattering coefficient 0 if no scattering occurs m2 g 1 another option to model light attenuation is the hyperbolic empirical equation acién fernández et al 1997 naderi et al 2017 6 i z i 0 e k a z x p b 7 k a a t m a x k a t x p b where iz is the light intensity µmol m 2 s 1 at depth z m i0 is the incident light intensity µmol m 2 s 1 k a is the apparent attenuation coefficient m2 g 1 xpb is the biomass concentration g cod m 3 atmax is the maximum attenuation observed m 1 and kat is an empirical constant g cod m 3 the coefficients corresponding to eqs 2 7 were estimated for different biomass concentrations 0 2463 g cod m 3 enrichment conditions reactors and growth media as previously the coefficients were calculated via minimization of the sum of squares the coefficient of determination r2 was used to compare between models 2 4 2 implementing light attenuation in mechanistic models for ppb growth the equation from section 2 4 1 providing the best iz prediction was included in the mechanistic panm presented in puyol et al 2017 based on a system of ordinary differential equations and algebraic equations using the inhibition function and the kinetic parameters obtained from section 2 3 the model was improved to consider light attenuation at different biomass concentrations and a more realistic value for the light half saturation coefficient ki matlab was used for the simulations in the modified panm once the attenuation effect was accurately predicted the average light intensity in the growth media along the reactor was calculated according to eq 8 béchet et al 2013 ruiz martínez et al 2016 wágner et al 2016 8 i a v e 1 l 0 l i z d z where iave is the average light intensity w m 2 l is the total light path length m e g pond depth or flat plate width iz is the light intensity at each length step w m 2 and dz the different length steps m assuming a properly mixed homogeneous system eq 8 can represent accurately the average light that reaches each single bacterium for unit compatibility with previous models and general measuring equipment the resulting light intensities were converted into power density w m 2 according to the average energy of different spectrum fractions different wavelengths for the overall spectrum a conversion factor of 2 02 µmol j 1 assuming a fraction of 45 of photosynthetically active radiation par in the broad light spectrum and a nir fraction of 49 was used for the vis fraction a factor of 4 57 µmol j 1 was applied and for nir wavelengths the value was 7 52 µmol j 1 mavi and tupper 2004 these conversions factors imply that for an equivalent pfd the power density of nir wavelengths is almost halved compared to that of vis light experimental datasets from photoheterotrophic tests from capson tojo et al 2021 were used for validating the modified panm the experiments consisted of batch tests in triplicate carried out in 250 ml schott bottles the reactors were fed with domestic wastewater and spiked with acetic acid at 500 mg cod l 1 to provide a readily available source of organics and to optimise the cod n p ratio of the media the tests were started with 250 ml of a 1 4 vol vol mixture of enriched

07 g codbiomass g codremoved 1 and with scod n p uptake ratios of 100 10 11 2 6 3 5 values typical for photoheterotrophic growth capson tojo et al 2020 hülsen et al 2014 lu et al 2019 the absorption spectra figure s4 further confirmed phototrophic growth with the characteristic absorption peaks of ppb cultures and indicating the presence of lhcs capson tojo et al 2021 okubo et al 2006 saer and blankenship 2017 the characteristic purple colour of the enrichments also showed the generation of pigments figure s5 the analysis of the microbial communities confirmed that ppb were dominant with a relative abundance of 70 over 50 of the total ppb being rhodopseudomonas pseudopalustris figure s6 the characteristics of the produced biomass were also common for enriched ppb systems with a cod vss ratio of 1 6 0 2 g cod g vss 1 90 vss tss ratio and carotenoid and bchl contents of 6 6 0 5 g g codbiomass 1 and 7 1 1 0 g g codbiomass 1 respectively hülsen et al 2018a 2014 3 2 light attenuation in ppb cultures 3 2 1 effect of biomass concentration on light attenuation in different reactor configurations the intensity of both nir and uv vis fractions of the light spectra decreased at increasing light path lengths increased distance from the light source in all tested reactor configurations at increasing biomass concentrations the attenuation effect was more pronounced fig 1 shows the attenuation curves for the tests in the 6 l cylindrical reactor where light intensities decreased substantially for every additional cm the light travelled with no detectable nir light at depths of only 5 cm for the most concentrated enrichment 2463 g cod m 3 the obtained curves in the 3 l cylindrical reactor and the flat plate reactor were similar to those shown in fig 1 figure s7 due to a more pronounced nir light attenuation when compared to uv vis light a negative trend in the nir fraction was observed at increasing depths in dilute cultures biomass concentrations of 0 469 g cod m 3 fig 1c higher nir attenuation in reactors with low biomass concentrations can be explained by the absorption of nir wavelengths by water itself mostly due to fundamental oh stretching vibrations confirmed by the curves with pure water see curves at 0 mg l 1 in fig 1 and figure s7 bertie and lan 1996 this is highly relevant for ppb reactor design considering that ppb utilise nir light via bchl to grow photoheterotrophically saer and blankenship 2017 interestingly at high biomass concentrations 1000 g cod m 3 the decrease in nir fraction with depth was not observed fig 1c as the measured nir fraction remained relatively constant at increased path lengths for all the tests at biomass concentrations above 1000 g cod m 3 see figs 1 s7 s9 and s10 this suggests that ppb biomass also absorbed considerable proportions of uv vis light this is either due to absorbence of vis light by carotenoids or due to the absorbence of uv by conjugated systems preferentially to nir this effect became more relevant at increased biomass concentrations and implies that for practical purposes both nir and uv vis spectra will be absorbed equally as biomass concentrations above 1 0 g codbiomass l 1 are commonly encountered in ppb mediated systems capson tojo et al 2020 the attenuation coefficients from the lambert beer equation ka were calculated for all tests fig 2 shows a decrease of the attenuation coefficients at higher biomass concentrations which is in agreement with results for other phototrophic organisms such as microalgae acién fernández et al 1997 wágner et al 2018 the obtained ka values all fall within the range of those reported for microalgae systems at similar biomass concentrations after conversion to m2 g cod 1 for comparison purposes see fig 2b wágner et al 2018 it must be mentioned that this ka values correspond to the lumped light absorption by both the solution and the biomass to predict the light attenuation and include this in ppb models the dependence of the attenuation coefficients on the biomass concentrations was mathematically represented a power function was used for this purpose 9 k a a x p b b where ka is the attenuation coefficient m2 g cod 1 xpb is the biomass concentration g cod m 3 and a m5 g 2 and b are empirical parameters the results are presented in fig 2 and table 1 the defined power functions were able to precisely reproduce the observed behaviours with r2 values over 0 990 as the empirical coefficients were significantly different between the top illuminated cylindrical and the side illuminated flat plate reactor we recommend using the coefficients from the 6 l reactor for cylindrical configurations or ponds not significantly different to those for the 3 l reactor but with higher r2 values and smaller confidence intervals and those from the flat plate reactor for pbrs the results from a global fit combining data from all the reactors aiming at finding a single equation resulted in considerably higher confidence intervals and lower r2 values therefore we recommend using reactor specific coefficients an exponential decay relationship as presented in wágner et al 2018 was also tested and did not provide an effective fit compared with the power law model see figure s8 and table s2 for the results of the exponential fit the different attenuation behaviours between the reactor configurations can be observed in fig 2 and table 2 where the ka values are presented the ka values confirmed that the nir light attenuation was higher compared to uv vis light attenuation in all reactors especially at biomass concentrations 469 g cod m 3 see table s3 for ka values for uv vis light the differences between the attenuation coefficients of nir and uv vis light decreased with increasing biomass concentrations figure s9 further confirming the uv vis light absorption by ppb biomass at biomass concentrations above 1000 g cod m 3 ka values for nir light were generally similar to ka values of uv vis light e g 0 0028 0 0041 m2 g cod 1 at 2463 g cod m 3 for nir wavelengths and 0 0022 0 0037 m2 g cod 1 for uv vis light the reactor geometry and illumination mode via top or side also affected the light attenuation while the values for the cylindrical reactors with volumes of 3 and 6 l were similar overlapping curves in fig 2 the coefficients for the flat plate were lower for any tested biomass concentration which means that light was less attenuated at low biomass concentrations 469 g cod m 3 this can be explained by light reflection from the bottom and walls of the reactor as the width of the flat plate reactor was shorter than the depth of the cylindrical reactors see section 2 2 this also explains why some ka values were lower in the 6 l reactor when compared to the 3 l at least at concentrations below 469 g cod m 3 see table 2 it must be considered that this effect would not be observed in large scale ponds nevertheless this explanation does not apply to high biomass concentrations 1067 g cod m 3 as light was fully attenuated before reaching the reactor wall opposed to the illuminated source see figs 1 and s7 another potential explanation is an enhanced light distribution due to scattering refraction and diffraction in the perspex wall of the flat plate side illumination which did not occur in the top illuminated cylinders as they were not covered with a perspex lid to simulate an open pond several other factors can explain the lower light attenuation in the flat plate reactor such as a more even light distribution or a higher light capture efficiency de vree et al 2015 we note that additional tests with a 1 5 cm thick perspex sheet over the flat plate reactor wall total thickness of 2 5 cm were performed to simulate a thicker reactor wall the results showed that increasing the wall thickness did not significantly affect the observed attenuation curves or the ka values results not shown the differences between the reactors configurations are more obvious when looking at the effective attenuation coefficients defined as ka xpb wágner et al 2018 as a consequence of increased light attenuation the effective attenuation coefficients increased at higher biomass concentrations fig 3 nevertheless the values were always lower for the flat plate reactor regardless of the biomass concentration or the region of the light spectrum tested more research must be carried to elucidate the precise reasons behind this finding 3 2 2 effect of wastewater matrix and growing conditions on light attenuation the results corresponding to the experiments performed to evaluate the impact of additional factors other than the biomass concentration itself on light attenuation in ppb cultures are shown in fig 4 amongst the tested factors i e wastewater matrix pha content and presence of pigments the single one that had a significant impact on light attenuation was the presence of pigments i e bchl and carotenoids the impact of the wastewater matrix was studied using the effluent from a continuous demonstration scale ppb flat plate reactor treating poultry processing wastewater poultry wastewater treatment effluent pwwte in the 6 l cylindrical reactor the corresponding ka values presented in figs 4a b show that the attenuation effect was practically identical between synthetic media and pwwte despite the considerable quantity of solids contained in the wastewater table s1 see table s4 for the corresponding attenuation coefficients for different models this was also observed when comparing a ppb culture with increased pha contents grown under nutrient deficiency with a control grown with full nutrient supply the corresponding pha contents were 113 35 mg pha g vssbiomass 1 in the pha enriched culture and 35 11 g pha g vssbiomass 1 in the nutrient supplied control figure s10 the ka curves for the pha enriched culture figs 4c d show that higher pha contents within the biomass did not affect light attenuation attenuation curves and ka values can be found in figure s11 and table s4 these results are highly relevant when considering that most of the research on ppb application to date has been carried out for hydrogen production under nutrient limitations commonly n which results in simultaneous pha accumulation within the cells capson tojo et al 2020 ghimire et al 2015 in addition as the concentrations of pigments were not significantly different between the pha enriched culture and the control reactor see figure s10 this experiment also served to confirm that unlike microalgae do with chlorophylls ppb do not consume bchl as n source under nutrient deprived conditions wágner et al 2018 this is highly relevant as pigments such as bchl have a considerable impact on light attenuation indeed as opposed to the pwwte and the pha tests the presence of pigments i e carotenoids and bchls did affect light attenuation after suppressing pigment synthesis and reducing their concentrations by oxidation via continuous aeration as in capson tojo et al 2021 from 5 68 to 6 63 mg carotenoids g codbiomass 1 and 5 8 7 1 mg bchl g codbiomass 1 in anaerobic enrichments to 0 45 0 08 mg carotenoids g codbiomass 1 and 0 52 0 06 bchl mg g codbiomass 1 after aeration see figure s10 the ka values were basically halved in the non pigmented culture figs 4e f the different light attenuation behaviour between the anaerobic pigmented enrichments and the non pigmented culture becomes even more evident when looking at the corresponding effective attenuation coefficients ka xpb shown in figure s12 the impact of the pigment concentration on the ka values further suggests that light absorption by pigmented biomass rather than scattering is the major factor affecting light attenuation the attenuation curves and ka values for these tests are shown in figure s13 and table s4 in summary both the pwwte and the pha enriched tests suggest that the parameters presented in tables 1 and 2 can be extrapolated to represent light attenuation in real applications using complex wastewaters and or under conditions prone to induce pha accumulation this does not apply to colourless ppb cultures e g aerated and grown under oxidative conditions as the pigment content was the only variable amongst the tested that significantly affected the extent of light attenuation for all the tests presented above the corresponding effective attenuation coefficients further confirmed the obtained results see figure s12 3 3 modelling light availability in ppb cultures 3 3 1 selecting a simple light attenuation model for enriched ppb cultures three different modelling approaches i e lambert beer law schuster s law and a hyperbolic empirical equation were tested to find the option that allowed the best prediction of light attenuation in enriched ppb cultures the results for nir wavelengths in the three reactor configurations tested using cultures grown on synthetic media are shown in table 2 results for uv vis wavelengths can be found in table s3 and those for the pwwte the pha enriched culture and the pigment free test from section 3 2 2 are presented in table s4 the performance of the three tested models was the same at all tested conditions same r2 values the first conclusion to draw from this is that light scattering did not affect light attenuation in the reactors the facts that the values of ka from lambert beer were at all the conditions equal to ea from the schuster s law and that the es values term accounting for light scattering were basically always zero all values below 10 3 and most below 10 6 confirm that scattering had little or no impact in any of the tests performed this is in agreement with the results from the non pigmented tests confirming that light absorption by cells not refraction or scattering was the predominant mechanism affecting attenuation this lack of scattering is opposed to most of the literature on microalgae where light scattering was found to have a significant effect of light attenuation and where the application of the lambert beer law has been found to lead to considerable errors in dense concentrated microalgae cultures acién fernández et al 1997 naderi et al 2017 wágner et al 2018 multiple reasons can explain the different behaviour in ppb cultures including the absence of bubbles no aeration a more efficient light utilisation higher energy dissipation as heat smaller cell sizes and or higher pigments contents using the empirical hyperbolic equation did not improve the prediction performance either in addition the value of atmax with a confidence interval of 0 thus defining the model was equal to ka xpb the effective attenuation coefficient derived from the lambert beer law in all the tested conditions suggesting that the lambert beer equation was able to predict the light attenuation to the same extent as the hyperbolic equation overall we recommend the use of the lambert beer law to model light attenuation in enriched ppb cultures as light absorption by pigmented biomass is the main attenuation mechanism and therefore using another model did not result in any advantage the resulting models were able to predict both nir light and uv vis light attenuations accurately r2 over 0 965 and 0 850 respectively interestingly the performance of the model decreased at low biomass concentrations see figure s14 with much better prediction capacities at concentrations above 500 g codbiomass m 3 r2 0 994 for nir spectrum and 0 980 for uv vis which are frequently found in ppb systems capson tojo et al 2020 hülsen et al 2018a this is again related to the fact that the lambert beer law can only account for light absorption due to biomass and thus at low biomass concentrations its prediction capabilities are jeopardised as light absorption due to biomass loses relevance 3 3 2 panm modification light modelling in mechanistic models for ppb growth batch tests performed in anaerobic microplates were used to estimate the photoheterotrophic uptake rates at different light intensities see figure s15 for the experimental data the corresponding values of km i are presented in fig 5 together with a monod function eq 1 fit to the data to predict the impact of light intensity on the photoheterotrophic uptake rates the corresponding values of km and ki are 2 65 0 98 g cod g cod 1 d 1 and 4 58 7 40 w m 2 the maximum km value obtained is in agreement with the one used in the panm 2 65 0 98 vs 2 37 0 40 g cod g cod 1 d 1 nevertheless the half saturation coefficient for light intensity allowing an uptake rate equal to 50 of the maximum ki differs considerably while the value from our curve is 4 58 7 40 w m 2 puyol et al 2017 used a ki of 88 w m 2 in the panm a value that was gathered from the literature the study where this value was taken from evaluated the effect of light intensity on hydrogen production and 88 w m 2 was the lowest tested intensity uyar et al 2007 although the authors reported a decrease in hydrogen production at 88 w m 2 when compared to higher intensities accurate ki estimation would have required tests at lower intensities in addition the experimental design used did not account for light attenuation it must be mentioned that the panm did not address the topic of light delivery in detail in addition the ki value used in the panm 88 w m 2 was low enough to result in a process not limited by light excluding attenuation they assumed that the incident light intensity of 200 250 w m 2 was constant throughout the whole reactor volume the obtained uptake rates at low light intensities are also in agreement with values previously reported at 1 4 3 0 w m 2 of 1 37 g cod g cod 1 d 1 dalaei et al 2020 the mechanistic panm from puyol et al 2017 was modified to include the uptake rates and the monod function defined above using iave as light available for the biomass as well as the lambert beer equation obtained from the experiments using the flat plate reactor results from photoheterotrophic batch experiments capson tojo et al 2021 were used for model validation both the simulation and the experimental results are presented in fig 6 these show that the modified panm was able to accurately predict photoheterotrophic ppb growth considering scod inorganic n in and inorganic p ip uptake the values of the parameters used for the simulations can be found in table s5 the petersen matrix for this model is the same as the one reported in puyol et al 2017 and is therefore not presented here fig 6 also shows the light intensity at different depths in the modelled reactors for various batch times i e biomass concentrations it can be observed that photoheterotrophic growth would have been limited considerably if a ki of 88 w m 2 had been assumed meaning that the kinetic constants previously used in the panm could not have represented the observed behaviour if attenuation had been considered it has to be mentioned that compared to the panm the nitrogen and phosphorus contents in the biomass had to be modified to accurately predict the in and ip profiles from 0 086 g n g codbiomass 1 and 0 015 g p g codbiomass 1 to 0 065 g n g codbiomass 1 and 0 010 g p g codbiomass 1 the higher modelled final concentrations for in and ip compared to the experimental results see fig 6 might be simply due to a slight overestimation of the biomass decay rates in the panm due to the impact of the carotenoids and bchl concentrations on light attenuation the possibility to include pigments as a state variable in the model could be considered as in wágner et al 2018 which could be particularly interesting in aerated reactors as dissolved oxygen impacts pigment availability this was not considered in this work since the detailed analysis of ppb pigments is not available and the overall concentrations are uniform under anaerobic conditions therefore attenuation will depend mostly on biomass concentration we note that very low illumination intensities might increase the pigment contents but that these conditions would not be practical for wastewater treatment resource recovery purposes other than carotenoid production finally although the incident total light in the modelled indoor tests was lower than those used to estimate the attenuation coefficients 120 vs 600 800 w m 2 the influence of the incident light has been reported to be insignificant for attenuation purposes particularly when the light source is distant from the illuminated surface or at high biomass concentrations naderi et al 2017 the accurate modelling results confirmed the applicability of the used light attenuation functions 3 4 implications for industrial application the results presented here show that light attenuation is a critical factor to be considered in ppb systems depending mostly on the biomass concentration and the light path and therefore the reactor design attenuation might lead to an insufficient light supply limiting effective photoheterotrophic growth of ppb compared to other phototrophs such as microalgae the attenuation coefficients are similar for ppb at a given biomass concentration nevertheless it has to be considered that ppb reactors are expected to work at higher concentrations than microalgal systems which will amplify the attenuation effect typical biomass concentrations in microalgae ponds treating wastewater rarely exceed 200 600 mg vss l 1 even when biomass retention is implemented robles et al 2020a 2020b wágner et al 2018 since the biomass yield of ppb is around 1 g codbiomass g codremoved 1 the biomass concentration in the reactors depends mostly on the concentration of biodegradable cod in the wastewater which is commonly over 1 5 2 0 g cod l 1 e g in agri industrial wastewaters resulting in biomass concentrations over 1 0 g vss l 1 capson tojo et al 2020 hülsen et al 2018b in addition nir light absorption by water at low biomass concentration will also increase the attenuation effect in ppb systems e g for domestic wastewater treatment maximising the treatment capacities and the biomass production rates is crucial to balance the high capital costs associated with outdoors ppb reactors capson tojo et al 2020 this makes it imperative to provide optimal conditions for ppb growth with uptake rates close to the maximum values a light distribution allowing an effective photoheterotrophic growth is essential therefore well designed reactors ponds must provide sufficient light along the light path allowing effective ppb growth throughout the system to minimize dark zones fig 7 shows an example of maximum dimensions i e pond depth or flat plate width that a ppb cultivation system could have to support 15 w m 2 in all the reactor volume 15 w m 2 was around the lowest intensity allowing maximum uptake rates see fig 5 under an illumination of 400 w m 2 nir fraction considered as a common value at zenith during winter months in sub tropical areas kandilli and ulgen 2008 the results show that the maximum depth of a pond working above 500 g codbiomass m 3 is below 5 cm while a vertical flat plate reactor could have a thickness of around 10 cm mainly due to the 2 sided illumination these data suggest that common pond depths applied for microalgae systems e g over 20 30 cm should not be extrapolated to ppb cultures as no light would be available in most of the pond volume at these depths these values are in agreement with recent results from an open ppb pond showing that a 10 cm deep raceway performed better than a system with a depth of 20 cm alloul et al 2021 heavy competition with non phototrophic microbes would be expected in deep ponds especially when considering that ppb systems are primed for raw wastewater secondary rather than tertiary treatment with sufficient cod minimising non illuminated areas is a key factor in ppb based systems as the nir phototrophic capabilities are the main competitive advantage of ppb allowing their enrichment as photoautotrophy in microalgae flat plate pbrs have recently been proposed as a promising option hülsen et al 2022a 2022b nevertheless as pbrs are more expensive than open ponds fully detailed economic analyses must be carried out before selecting one alternative over the other our results imply very large surfaces in ponds even larger than for microalgae at optimum water depths e g 5 cm ponds would require very large surfaces and land areas which in turn would increase oxygen diffusion further disturbing the photoheterotrophic metabolism and increasing the competitiveness of common aerobic heterotrophs capson tojo et al 2021 the alternative e g using common hrap depths of around 30 cm can be expected to result in a very diverse microbial population where ppb might not be dominant due to the lack of light throughout most of the system this would be indicated by low scod n p ratios and low biomass yields however in terms of oxygen diffusion this might be a better alternative as 5 cm deep ppb ponds might fail due to ppb outcompetition by faster growing common aerobic heterotrophs especially if paddlewheel mixing is provided thus increasing oxygen diffusion capson tojo et al 2021 research should be carried out regarding optimal design for ponds specific for ppb continuing the work presented in alloul et al 2021 other than design and modelling purposes the findings presented here are also relevant for process optimisation an example is the application of biomass retention in ppb reactors to increase the treatment capacities and volumetric production rates this alternative has been previously applied increasing significantly the biomass concentrations in the reactors and the treatment performances cerruti et al 2020 hülsen et al 2016 stegman et al 2021 the results presented here show that the attenuation effect is increased at high biomass concentrations which might hinder the application of biomass retention methods unless the light path is optimised nevertheless the asymptotic behaviour of the ka values at biomass concentrations over 1 5 2 0 g codbiomass l 1 see fig 2 suggests that further increases in the biomass contents might not require significantly lower light path lengths to allow efficient photoheterotrophic operation 4 conclusions ppb biomass attenuated both uv vis and nir wavelengths with an increasing fraction of uv vis at higher biomass concentrations at concentrations above 1000 mg codbiomass l 1 600 g vs m 3 the attenuation of both spectral bands was approximately equal light attenuation depended on the reactor configuration with a square rectangular cross section attenuating less than a cylindrical cross section attenuation was not impacted by the complexity of the wastewater matrix or by the presence of pha but the concentration of pigments both bchl and carotenoids had a strong effect likely related to their functionality as part of light harvesting complexes scattering had a minimal impact as assessed by use of the lambert beer equation vs alternative models including light scattering a proposed mathematical model based on the lambert beer law and a monod function for light requirements allowed effective representation of the kinetics of anaerobic photoheterotrophic growth the estimated half saturation coefficient for illumination was 4 6 w m 2 indicating that non incident irradiation can be an effective light source the predicted nir light penetration in outdoor ppb systems with biomass concentrations 1 0 g l

phototrophic bacteria ppb cultures has not been studied and its understanding is critical for proper process modelling and reactor design especially for scaled systems this work evaluated the effect of different biomass concentrations reactor configurations wastewater matrices and growth conditions on the attenuation extent of near infra red nir and ultraviolet visible uv vis light spectra the results show that increased biomass concentrations lead to higher light attenuation and that ppb absorb both vis and nir wavelengths with both fractions of the spectrum being equally absorbed at biomass concentrations above 1 000 g cod m 3 a flat plate configuration showed less attenuation compared with cylindrical reactors illuminated from the top representative for open ponds neither a complex wastewater matrix nor the presence of polyhydroxyalkanoates under nutrient limited conditions affected light attenuation significantly the pigment concentration both bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids however had a strong effect with significant attenuation in the presence of pigments attenuation predictions using the lambert beer law excluding scattering and the schuster model including scattering indicated that light scattering had a minimal effect a proposed mathematical model based on the lambert beer law and a monod function for light requirements allowed effective prediction of the kinetics of photoheterotrophic growth this resulted in a half saturation coefficient of 4 6 w m 2 finally the results showed that in dense outdoor ppb cultures 1 000 g cod m 3

value added products such as polyhydroxyalkanoates phas carotenoids or biomass e g as single cell protein scp or fertilizer to balance the overall costs capson tojo et al 2020 under anaerobic illuminated conditions ppb biomass is generated via anoxygenic photosynthesis enabling the simultaneous assimilation of organics nitrogen and phosphorus from waste streams via photoheterotrophic growth thanks to their ability to use light as energy source ppb biomass yields in terms of cod removed close to unity can be achieved which maximises the recovery potentials while minimising dissipative resource losses e g as co2 n2 or metal bound p ppb transform light energy into chemical energy via light harvesting complexes lhc and reaction centres lhcs are composed of bacteriochlorophylls bchls and a range of carotenoids ppb utilise bchls for energy harvesting with dominant absorbence wavelengths at over 800 900 nm within the near infrared nir spectrum over 700 nm saer and blankenship 2017 ppb have accessory absorption capabilities in the visible vis range around 400 700 nm due to the presence of several carotenoids which enable electron transfer to bchls canniffe and hunter 2014 the utilisation of nir wavelengths by ppb avoids the growth of other photosynthetic microbes e g algae and cyanobacteria in nir illuminated systems which enables effective selection and enrichment of ppb hülsen et al 2018a 2014 madigan et al 2011 despite the advantages of phototrophic processes their inherent dependence on light also constitutes the main limiting factor in any engineered phototrophic system acién fernández et al 1997 naderi et al 2017 in the case of ppb artificial illumination in large scale systems appears economically prohibitive and natural illumination with sunlight is the logical alternative capson tojo et al 2020 where an efficient light supply is even more crucial as light availability cannot be controlled therefore studying light attenuation and distribution within the reactors as well as its accurate mathematical modelling are critical for a proper reactor design and operation molina grima et al 1999 decades of research have defined and partly solved the problems related to light availability in microalgae cultures posten 2009 while ppb technology can profit from algae research this knowledge cannot be directly transferred to ppb pbrs one obvious difference between algae and ppb systems is caused by the higher water selective absorption of nir light see for example braun and smirnov 2020 compared to vis wavelengths used by algae at similar light paths e g reactor width or water column depending on the design the ppb reactor will a priori have substantially less usable light than an equivalent microalgal system as ppb preferentially use nir wavelengths as energy source a recent study has indeed shown that although ppb can also use vis wavelengths they capability for doing so is limited meaning that they still depend on nir light availability to grow efficiently yu et al 2022 ppb reactors laboratory scale units have also been reported to operate at higher biomass concentrations compared to traditional hraps 1 0 vs 0 5 gbiomass l 1 which is expected to amplify shading effects and nir attenuation via light absorption by pigments acién fernández et al 1997 capson tojo et al 2020 robles et al 2020b wágner et al 2018 several other aspects such as the cultivation strategy e g pbr vs open pond anaerobic vs aerobic or mixing strategy reactor geometry e g affecting light scattering media complexity e g secondary instead of tertiary treatment and pigment concentration can affect light attenuation pigments concentration in ppb and thus potentially light attenuation by biomass is impacted by oxygen which can be present either via active aeration or turbulent mixing or passive oxygen transfer surface diffusion oxidative conditions which can result from the presence of oxygen are known to inhibit the expression of most genes coding for lhc and reaction centre complexes gregor and klug 1999 sganga and bauer 1992 zhu et al 1986 which ultimately suppresses photoheterotrophic growth and results in pigment loss capson tojo et al 2021 due to these differences compared to algal systems the study of light attenuation and distribution within ppb reactors as well as its accurate mathematical modelling are critical for proper reactor design and operation several models have described this for algal systems and they can also be applied for nir behaviour the most widely applied model to represent light attenuation is the lambert beer equation acién fernández et al 1997 marsullo et al 2015 ruiz martínez et al 2016 this model can accurately represent light absorption in the reactors due to biomass and pigments however it accounts for light scattering as energy loss via absorption neglecting the scattering of light by solids and it has been found to lead to considerable errors in dense concentrated microalgae cultures acién fernández et al 1997 wágner et al 2018 an option to account for light scattering is the schuster s model adapted for cyanobacteria cultures by cornet et al 1992 in addition empirical hyperbolic models have also been applied to model attenuation in microalgae cultures achieving accurate predictions of the light distributions acién fernández et al 1997 naderi et al 2017 although other algorithms exist such as those based on radiate transfer equations pilon et al 2011 the models presented above are generally considered as the best options in terms of accuracy simplicity compromise naderi et al 2017 the most relevant mechanistic model describing ppb growth for resource recovery from wastewater is the photo anaerobic model panm presented in puyol et al 2017 light attenuation is not considered in this model and the effect of light intensity is modelled following a type i approach béchet et al 2013 assuming that the incident light intensity on the reactor wall is constant through the entire reactor volume a recent model for hydrogen production with ppb included light attenuation but the conditions were different to those found in resource recovery applications anye cho et al 2021 moreover no experiments were conducted to estimate the relevant parameters light intensity throughout the culture was not measured and parameter estimation was performed for a combination of light related parameters while light attenuation and distribution have been extensively studied for microalgal cultures acién fernández et al 1997 béchet et al 2013 naderi et al 2017 ruiz martínez et al 2016 wágner et al 2018 this is missing for ppb therefore the objective of this work is to determine the influence of relevant factors on light attenuation in ppb based systems more precisely light attenuation was studied under different i reactor configurations ii biomass concentrations iii wastewater matrices iv growth conditions and v pigment contents in addition different mathematical models to describe light attenuation were compared to identify the most accurate option experiments were also performed to determine the minimum light intensities allowing effective ppb growth finally the panm has been modified to consider the impact of light attenuation on ppb growth 2 material and methods 2 1 ppb enrichments and growth media ppb were enriched from pre settled domestic wastewater characteristics shown in table s1 under anaerobic illuminated conditions in a 2 l schott bottle following the procedure described in hülsen et al 2014 once the typical purple colour was observed indication for the presence of bchl and carotenoids after around 7 days 5 sequential dilutions were carried out to further enrich ppb using ormerod media ormerod et al 1961 at a 1 4 inoculation ratio and with a batch length of 3 4 days the enrichment volume increased with each dilution obtaining eventually 30 l of enriched ppb culture placed in three separate 10 l schott bottles these cultures of 10 l each were used for the experiments described below sections 2 1 1 2 1 3 2 1 1 further enrichment and ppb up concentration to further increase the ppb concentrations in the enrichments the three 10 l bottles were re fed three times each as fed batch at the start of each fed batch cycle with a duration of 3 4 days the reactors were spiked with 300 mg cod l 1 of glacial acetic acid and with the corresponding amounts of micro macro nutrients in ormerod media to further increase the biomass concentration two of the 10 l bottles were centrifuged 10 min at 3500 rpm using an allegra x 12 centrifuge beckman coulter and the concentrated fraction was then mixed with the remaining 10 l enrichment magnetic mixing was provided at 200 rpm over 2 h to ensure homogeneity this resulted in an up concentrated enrichment that allowed to test the attenuation effect at high total solids ts concentrations the initial biomass concentration in the resulting concentrated enrichment was 2463 g cod m 3 1 6 g vss l 1 vss being volatile suspended solids this enrichment was used to generate sequential dilutions at lower ts contents from x2 to x32 dilutions 2 1 2 effect of pigments on light attenuation this experiment was designed to evaluate the impact of the presence absence of pigments on light attenuation and to assess the attenuation caused by the biomass itself e g light absorption shading scattering etc to produce a pigment free ppb culture or with minimum pigment contents a 10 l ppb enrichment the x4 dilution from the concentrated enrichment described above was used as inoculum for a non illuminated continuously aerated enrichment fed with ormerod media as described before and at a 1 4 inoculation ratio the batch lasted for 3 days after which the typical purple colour had disappeared air was provided using a fine bubble aerator 60 cm rubber black air diffuser effosola china and an air compressor tetra whisper 60 air pump 50 l h 1 tetra germany total carotenoids and bchl contents were measured to confirm the pigment loss we note that the resulting culture consisted of a mixture of ppb and aerobic heterotrophs see capson tojo et al 2021 for typical microbial communities after aeration 2 1 3 effect of pha on light attenuation a final enrichment was carried out to determine the impact of nutrient depleted or excess cod growth conditions on the light attenuation effect mostly due to accumulation of pha granules within the cells which might affect light passage for this purpose the x4 dilution from the previous up concentrated enrichment section 2 1 1 was used as inoculum for a pha accumulating experiment 1 4 inoculation ratio working volume of 10 l to maximise pha accumulation three sequential batch enrichment cycles were carried out as follows i the cycle was started with a modified ormerod media with reduced nh4 n supply from 107 mg n l 1 in regular ormerod to 30 mg n l 1 to ensure nh4 n consumption at the end of this phase ii after 2 days the enrichment was fed with extra cod as acetic acid 500 mg l 1 to favour pha accumulation under n limiting conditions iii on day 3 nh4 n was added at 30 mg l 1 to select for pha accumulating organisms under cod limiting conditions iv on day 6 the cycle was stopped and the process was repeated using the resulting enrichment as inoculum at a 1 4 inoculation ratio for comparison purposes a control reactor was carried out fed with regular ormerod media samples were taken at the end of the enrichments for determining the pha contents 2 1 4 light attenuation in a real wastewater matrix to evaluate the influence of the wastewater matrix on the attenuation effect in ppb cultures compared to the synthetic media used in the previous experiments the effluent from a continuous demonstration scale ppb flat plate reactor treating poultry processing wastewater poultry wastewater treatment effluent pwwte was also used in attenuation tests at three different dilutions x2 x4 and x8 an extensive characterisation of the pwwte can be found in table s1 2 2 experimental setup for attenuation assessment to test the impact of reactor geometry on light attenuation and to represent both open ponds and flat plate reactors the following three configurations were tested i cylindrical reactor illuminated from the top working volume of 6 l inner and outer diameters of 16 and 17 cm respectively and a height of 32 cm ii cylindrical reactor illuminated from the top working volume of 3 l inner and outer diameters of 7 and 8 cm respectively and a height of 81 5 cm iii flat plate reactor illuminated from one side 60 41 20 cm lxhxw working volume of 10 l wall thickness of 1 5 cm all the reactors were made of perspex and light input from any direction other than the one desired was blocked the cylindrical reactors were sprayed with black paint on the sides and bottom and the flat plate was covered with black plastic foam on the bottom and all other sides but the one illuminated the top was covered with a black high density polyethylene cover pictures of the three reactors are given in the supplementary material figure s1 illumination was provided with a 150 w fluorescence lamp nelson portable flood light unfiltered light distribution of 17 below 700 nm 15 at 700 800 nm 20 at 800 900 nm and 48 at 900 1000 nm measured with a stellarnet blue wave spectrometer to measure nir specific light intensities the illuminated sections of the reactors were covered with ultraviolet visible uv vis absorbing foil nd 1 2 299 transformation tubes to measure full spectrum light intensities the foil was simply removed the uv vis fraction of the measured light was determined by subtracting the filtered photon flux density pfd µmol m 2 s 1 consisting mostly of nir light 98 1 of incident light above 700 nm from the full spectrum pfd total incident light intensities on the liquid surface or the reactor wall ranged between 1000 and 1400 µmol m 2 s 1 600 800 w m 2 common values for outdoors light irradiation kandilli and ulgen 2008 this illumination strategy was followed because it represents the conditions found in outdoors ppb enriched reactors hülsen et al 2022b the pfd was determined using a submersible sq 620 extended range pfd sensor with a resolution of 0 1 µmol m 2 s 1 measuring pfd from 340 to 1050 nm coupled to an at 100 µcache bluetooth micro logger apogee instruments inc usa to measure the pfd at different depths in the reactors the base of the sensor was attached to custom made horizontal plastic supports fixed to two magnets aqua one floating magnet glass cleaner aqua one australia qld australia which allowed to vary the depth of the sensor in the case of the flat plate the distances from the light source were modified by placing the sensor on the base of a vertical metallic rod fixed with a horizontal clamp to an external horizontal support that could be moved see figure s2 for pictures of the experimental set up for pfd measurement to ensure proper mixing of the biomass in the system and to prevent settling of solids the reactor content was mixed between each pfd measurement using a fine bubble aerator 60 cm rubber black air diffuser effosola china coupled to an air compressor tetra whisper 60 air pump 50 l per hour tetra germany the accuracy of the experimental set up was tested via repeating one of the tests obtaining almost identical attenuation curves and statistically equal attenuation coefficients p value 0 005 figure s3 2 3 determination of the minimum light intensity allowing efficient photoheterotrophy experiments were carried out to estimate the minimum light intensity required for effective photoheterotrophic growth to minimise attenuation results from batch experiments using 12 well microplates costar in vitro technologies pty ltd australia illuminated at different light intensities from 0 to 80 w m 2 were used to estimate the kinetic parameters of monod functions for substrate uptake each well had a working volume of 6 9 ml and was filled with a mixture of ppb enriched inoculum and ormerod media as described in section 2 1 oxygen exposure was limited by covering the completely filled wells with a transparent plastic film non permeable to oxygen once filled the microplates were placed inside custom built closed plastic boxes the bottoms of the boxes were equipped with nir specific light emitting diodes led strips infrared 850 nm ir led waveform lighting vancouver usa which illuminated the wells only the nir spectrum was considered because enriched ppb reactors are selectively illuminated with this light to allow ppb enrichment capson tojo et al 2020 the boxes were placed inside a thermo scientific maxq400 benchtop orbital shaker thermo fisher scientific ma usa which was used for mixing at 150 rpm and for temperature control 25 27 c a custom built dimmer was used to control the light intensities in the microplates the concentrations of soluble cod scod nh4 n and po4 3 p were followed by wet analyses every 2 3 h wells were sacrificed for this purpose the biomass growth was estimated from optical density od measurements a more precise description of the microplate setup can be found in grassino et al 2022 the maximum specific uptake rate km was estimated by minimization of the residual sum of squares using the function lsqnonlin in matlab matlab r2018b the mathworks inc natick ma 95 confidence intervals were calculated using the function nlparci a value of the half saturation constant ks of 20 mg cod l 1 was assumed puyol et al 2017 the biomass yield y was assumed as 1 g codbiomass g codconsumed 1 puyol et al 2017 biomass decay was considered in the model using a first rate decay constant of 0 09 d 1 puyol et al 2017 the resulting kinetic parameters were used as criteria to identify efficient photoheterotrophic growth batstone et al 2002 henze et al 2000 jeppsson et al 2006 the dependence of km on light intensity was modelled according to a monod substrate saturation function puyol et al 2017 of the form 1 k m i k m i a v e k i i a v e where km i is the specific uptake rate at a given light intensity d 1 km is the maximum specific uptake rate d 1 iave is the average light intensity w m 2 and ki is the half saturation coefficient for light w m 2 parameter uncertainty was assessed as described in batstone et al 2003 2 4 modelling light attenuation in ppb based systems 2 4 1 tested models to represent light attenuation in ppb based systems the light attenuation due to biomass pigments is commonly represented by the lambert beer law eq 2 2 i z i 0 e k a z x p b where iz is the light intensity µmol m 2 s 1 at depth z m i0 is the incident light intensity µmol m 2 s 1 ka is the attenuation coefficient m2 g 1 and xpb is the biomass concentration g cod m 3 despite its wide application the lambert beer law has been deemed as non appropriate for high biomass concentrations mostly because it lumps scattering with absorption considering scattering only as a process resulting in energy loss amongst the models considering light scattering the schuster s law eq 3 is the most popular 3 i z i 0 4 α 1 α 2 e δ z x p b 1 α 2 e δ z x p b being 4 α e a e a e s 5 δ e a e a e s where iz is the light intensity µmol m 2 s 1 at depth z m

concentrations 0 2463 g cod m 3 enrichment conditions reactors and growth media as previously the coefficients were calculated via minimization of the sum of squares the coefficient of determination r2 was used to compare between models 2 4 2 implementing light attenuation in mechanistic models for ppb growth the equation from section 2 4 1 providing the best iz prediction was included in the mechanistic panm presented in puyol et al 2017 based on a system of ordinary differential equations and algebraic equations using the inhibition function and the kinetic parameters obtained from section 2 3 the model was improved to consider light attenuation at different biomass concentrations and a more realistic value for the light half saturation coefficient ki matlab was used for the simulations in the modified panm once the attenuation effect was accurately predicted the average light intensity in the growth media along the reactor was calculated according to eq 8 béchet et al

the light intensity at each length step w m 2 and dz the different length steps m assuming a properly mixed homogeneous system eq 8 can represent accurately the average light that reaches each single bacterium for unit compatibility with previous models and general measuring equipment the resulting light intensities were converted into power density w m 2 according to the average energy of different spectrum fractions different wavelengths for the overall spectrum a conversion factor of 2 02 µmol j 1 assuming a fraction of 45 of photosynthetically active radiation par in the broad light spectrum and a nir fraction of 49 was used for the vis fraction a factor of 4 57 µmol j 1 was applied and for nir wavelengths the value was 7 52 µmol j 1 mavi and tupper 2004 these conversions factors imply that for an equivalent pfd the power density of nir wavelengths is almost halved compared to that of vis light experimental datasets from photoheterotrophic tests from capson tojo et al 2021

ppb cultures 3 2 1 effect of biomass concentration on light attenuation in different reactor configurations the intensity of both nir and uv vis fractions of the light spectra decreased at increasing light path lengths increased distance from the light source in all tested reactor configurations at increasing biomass concentrations the attenuation effect was more pronounced fig 1 shows the attenuation curves for the tests in the 6 l cylindrical reactor where light intensities decreased substantially for every additional cm the light travelled with no detectable nir light at depths of only 5 cm for the most concentrated enrichment 2463 g cod m 3 the obtained curves in the 3 l cylindrical reactor and the flat plate reactor were similar to those shown in fig 1 figure s7 due to a more pronounced nir light attenuation when compared to uv vis light a negative trend in the nir fraction was observed at increasing depths in dilute cultures biomass concentrations of 0 469 g cod m 3 fig 1c higher nir attenuation in reactors with low biomass concentrations can be explained by the absorption of nir wavelengths by water itself mostly due to fundamental oh stretching vibrations confirmed by the curves with pure water see curves at 0 mg l 1 in fig 1 and figure s7 bertie and lan 1996 this is highly relevant for ppb reactor design considering that ppb utilise nir light via bchl to grow photoheterotrophically saer and blankenship 2017 interestingly at high biomass concentrations 1000 g cod m 3 the decrease in nir fraction with depth was not observed fig 1c as the measured nir fraction remained relatively constant at increased path lengths for all the tests at biomass concentrations above 1000 g cod m 3 see figs 1 s7 s9 and s10 this suggests that ppb biomass also absorbed considerable proportions of uv vis light this is either due to absorbence of vis light by carotenoids or due to the absorbence of uv by conjugated systems preferentially to nir this effect became more relevant at increased biomass concentrations and implies that for practical purposes both nir and uv vis spectra will be absorbed equally as biomass concentrations above 1 0 g codbiomass l 1 are commonly encountered in ppb mediated systems capson tojo et al 2020 the attenuation coefficients from the lambert beer equation ka were calculated for all tests fig 2 shows a decrease of the attenuation coefficients at higher biomass concentrations which is in agreement with results for other phototrophic organisms such as microalgae acién fernández et al 1997 wágner et al 2018 the obtained ka values all fall within the range of those reported for microalgae systems at similar biomass concentrations after conversion to m2 g cod 1 for comparison purposes see fig 2b wágner et al 2018 it must be mentioned that this ka values correspond to the lumped light absorption by both the solution and the biomass to predict the light attenuation and include this in ppb models the dependence of the attenuation coefficients on the biomass concentrations was mathematically represented a power function was used for this purpose 9 k a a x p b b where ka is the attenuation coefficient m2 g cod 1 xpb is the biomass concentration g cod m 3 and a m5 g 2 and b are empirical parameters the results are presented in fig 2 and table 1 the defined power functions were able to precisely reproduce the observed behaviours with r2 values over 0 990 as the empirical coefficients were significantly different between the top illuminated cylindrical and the side illuminated flat plate reactor we recommend using the coefficients from the 6 l reactor for cylindrical configurations or ponds not significantly different to those for the 3 l reactor but with higher r2 values and smaller confidence intervals and those from the flat plate reactor for pbrs the results from a global fit combining data from all the reactors aiming at finding a single equation resulted in considerably higher confidence intervals and lower r2 values therefore we recommend using reactor specific coefficients an exponential decay relationship as presented in wágner et al 2018 was also tested and did not provide an effective fit compared with the power law model see figure s8 and table s2 for the results of the exponential fit the different attenuation behaviours between the reactor configurations can be observed in fig 2 and table 2 where the ka values are presented the ka values confirmed that the nir light attenuation was higher compared to uv vis light attenuation in all reactors especially at biomass concentrations 469 g cod m 3 see table s3 for ka values for uv vis light the differences between the attenuation coefficients of nir and uv vis light decreased with increasing biomass concentrations figure s9 further confirming the uv vis light absorption by ppb biomass at biomass concentrations above 1000 g cod m 3 ka values for nir light were generally similar to ka values of uv vis light e g 0 0028 0 0041 m2 g cod 1 at 2463 g cod m 3 for nir wavelengths and 0 0022 0 0037 m2 g cod 1 for uv vis light the reactor geometry and illumination mode via top or side also affected the light attenuation while the values for the cylindrical reactors with volumes of 3 and 6 l were similar overlapping curves in fig 2 the coefficients for the flat plate were lower for any tested biomass concentration which means that light was less attenuated at low biomass concentrations 469 g cod m 3 this can be explained by light reflection from the bottom and walls of the reactor as the width of the flat plate reactor was shorter than the depth of the cylindrical reactors see section 2 2 this also explains why some ka values were lower in the 6 l reactor when compared to the 3 l at least at concentrations below 469 g cod m 3 see table 2 it must be considered that this effect would not be observed in large scale ponds nevertheless this explanation does not apply to high biomass concentrations 1067 g cod m 3 as light was fully attenuated before reaching the reactor wall opposed to the illuminated source see figs 1 and s7 another potential explanation is an enhanced light distribution due to scattering refraction and diffraction in the perspex wall of the flat plate side illumination which did not occur in the top illuminated cylinders as they were not covered with a perspex lid to simulate an open pond several other factors can explain the lower light attenuation in the flat plate reactor such as a more even light distribution or a higher light capture efficiency de vree et al 2015 we note that additional tests with a 1 5 cm thick perspex sheet over the flat plate reactor wall total thickness of 2 5 cm were performed to simulate a thicker reactor wall the results showed that increasing the wall thickness did not significantly affect the observed attenuation curves or the ka values results not shown the differences between the reactors configurations are more obvious when looking at the effective attenuation coefficients defined as ka xpb wágner et al 2018 as a consequence of increased light attenuation the effective attenuation coefficients increased at higher biomass concentrations fig 3 nevertheless the values were always lower for the flat plate reactor regardless of the biomass concentration or the region of the light spectrum tested more research must be carried to elucidate the precise reasons behind this finding 3 2 2 effect of wastewater matrix and growing conditions on light attenuation the results corresponding to the experiments performed to evaluate the impact of additional factors other than the biomass concentration itself on light attenuation in ppb cultures are shown in fig 4 amongst the tested factors i e wastewater matrix pha content and presence of pigments the single one that had a significant impact on light attenuation was the presence of pigments i e bchl and carotenoids the impact of the wastewater matrix was studied using the effluent from a continuous demonstration scale ppb flat plate reactor treating poultry processing wastewater poultry wastewater treatment effluent pwwte in the 6 l cylindrical reactor the corresponding ka values presented in figs 4a b show that the attenuation effect was practically identical between synthetic media and pwwte despite the considerable quantity of solids contained in the wastewater table s1 see table s4 for the corresponding attenuation coefficients for different models this was also observed when comparing a ppb culture with increased pha contents grown under nutrient deficiency with a control grown with full nutrient supply the corresponding pha contents were 113 35 mg pha g vssbiomass 1 in the pha enriched culture and 35 11 g pha g vssbiomass 1 in the nutrient supplied control figure s10 the ka curves for the pha enriched culture figs 4c d show that higher pha contents within the biomass did not affect light attenuation attenuation curves and ka values can be found in figure s11 and table s4 these results are highly relevant when considering that most of the research on ppb application to date has been carried out for hydrogen production under nutrient limitations commonly n which results in simultaneous pha accumulation within the cells capson tojo et al 2020 ghimire et al 2015 in addition as the concentrations of pigments were not significantly different between the pha enriched culture and the control reactor see figure s10 this experiment also served to confirm that unlike microalgae do with chlorophylls ppb do not consume bchl as n source under nutrient deprived conditions wágner et al 2018 this is highly relevant as pigments such as bchl have a considerable impact on light attenuation indeed as opposed to the pwwte and the pha tests the presence of pigments i e carotenoids and bchls did affect light attenuation after suppressing pigment synthesis and reducing their concentrations by oxidation via continuous aeration as in capson tojo et al 2021 from 5 68 to 6 63 mg carotenoids g codbiomass 1 and 5 8 7 1 mg bchl g codbiomass 1 in anaerobic enrichments to 0 45 0 08 mg carotenoids g codbiomass 1 and 0 52 0 06 bchl mg g codbiomass 1 after aeration see figure s10 the ka values were basically halved in the non pigmented culture figs 4e f the different light attenuation behaviour between the anaerobic pigmented enrichments and the non pigmented culture becomes even more evident when looking at the corresponding effective attenuation coefficients ka xpb shown in figure s12 the impact of the pigment concentration on the ka values further suggests that light absorption by pigmented biomass rather than scattering is the major factor affecting light attenuation the attenuation curves and ka values for these tests are shown in figure s13 and table s4 in summary both the pwwte and the pha enriched tests suggest that the parameters presented in tables 1 and 2 can be extrapolated to represent light attenuation in real applications using complex wastewaters and or under conditions prone to induce pha accumulation this does not apply to colourless ppb cultures e g aerated and grown under oxidative conditions as the pigment content was the only variable amongst the tested that significantly affected the extent of light attenuation for all the tests presented above the corresponding effective attenuation coefficients further confirmed the obtained results see figure s12 3 3 modelling light availability in ppb cultures 3 3 1 selecting a simple light attenuation model for enriched ppb cultures three different modelling approaches i e lambert beer law schuster s law and a hyperbolic empirical equation were tested to find the option that allowed the best prediction of light attenuation in enriched ppb cultures the results for nir wavelengths in the three reactor configurations tested using cultures grown on synthetic media are shown in table 2 results for uv vis wavelengths can be found in table s3 and those for the pwwte the pha enriched culture and the pigment free test from section 3 2 2 are presented in table s4 the performance of the three tested models was the same at all tested conditions same r2 values the first conclusion to draw from this is that light scattering did not affect light attenuation in the reactors the facts that the values of ka from lambert beer were at all the conditions equal to ea from the schuster s law and that the es values term accounting for light scattering were basically always zero all values below 10 3 and most below 10 6 confirm that scattering had little or no impact in any of the tests performed this is in agreement with the results from the non pigmented tests confirming that light absorption by cells not refraction or scattering was the predominant mechanism affecting attenuation this lack of scattering is opposed to most of the literature on microalgae where light scattering was found to have a significant effect of light attenuation and where the application of the lambert beer law has been found to lead to considerable errors in dense concentrated microalgae cultures acién fernández et al 1997 naderi et al 2017 wágner et al 2018 multiple reasons can explain the different behaviour in ppb cultures including the absence of bubbles no aeration a more efficient light utilisation higher energy dissipation as heat smaller cell sizes and or higher pigments contents using the empirical hyperbolic equation did not improve the prediction performance either in addition the value of atmax with a confidence interval of 0 thus defining the model was equal to ka xpb the effective attenuation coefficient derived from the lambert beer law in all the tested conditions suggesting that the lambert beer equation was able to predict the light attenuation to the same extent as the hyperbolic equation overall we recommend the use of the lambert beer law to model light attenuation in enriched ppb cultures as light absorption by pigmented biomass is the main attenuation mechanism and therefore using another model did not result in any advantage the resulting models were able to predict both nir light and uv vis light attenuations accurately r2 over 0 965 and 0 850 respectively interestingly the performance of the model decreased at low biomass concentrations see figure s14 with much better prediction capacities at concentrations above 500 g codbiomass m 3 r2 0 994 for nir spectrum and 0 980 for uv vis which are frequently found in ppb systems capson tojo et al 2020 hülsen et al 2018a this is again related to the fact that the lambert beer law can only account for light absorption due to biomass and thus at low biomass concentrations its prediction capabilities are jeopardised as light absorption due to biomass loses relevance 3 3 2 panm modification light modelling in mechanistic models for ppb growth batch tests performed in anaerobic microplates were used to estimate the photoheterotrophic uptake rates at different light intensities see figure s15 for the experimental data the corresponding values of km i are presented in fig 5 together with a monod function eq 1 fit to the data to predict the impact of light intensity on the photoheterotrophic uptake rates the corresponding values of km and ki are 2 65 0 98 g cod g cod 1 d 1 and 4 58 7 40 w m 2 the maximum km value obtained is in agreement with the one used in the panm 2 65 0 98 vs 2 37 0 40 g cod g cod 1 d 1 nevertheless the half saturation coefficient for light intensity allowing an uptake rate equal to 50 of the maximum ki differs considerably while the value from our curve is 4 58 7 40 w m 2 puyol et al 2017 used a ki of 88 w m 2 in the panm a value that was gathered from the literature the study where this value was taken from evaluated the effect of light intensity on hydrogen production and 88 w m 2 was the lowest tested intensity uyar et al 2007 although the authors reported a decrease in hydrogen production at 88 w m 2 when compared to higher intensities accurate ki estimation would have required tests at lower intensities in addition the experimental design used did not account for light attenuation it must be mentioned that the panm did not address the topic of light delivery in detail in addition the ki value used in the panm 88 w m 2 was low enough to result in a process not limited by light excluding attenuation they assumed that the incident light intensity of 200 250 w m 2 was constant throughout the whole reactor volume the obtained uptake rates at low light intensities are also in agreement with values previously reported at 1 4 3 0 w m 2 of 1 37 g cod g cod 1 d 1 dalaei et al 2020 the mechanistic panm from puyol et al 2017 was modified to include the uptake rates and the monod function defined above using iave as light available for the biomass as well as the lambert beer equation obtained from the experiments using the flat plate reactor results from photoheterotrophic batch experiments capson tojo et al 2021 were used for model validation both the simulation and the experimental results are presented in fig 6 these show that the modified panm was able to accurately predict photoheterotrophic ppb growth considering scod inorganic n in and inorganic p ip uptake the values of the parameters used for the simulations can be found in table s5 the petersen matrix for this model is the same as the one reported in puyol et al 2017 and is therefore not presented here fig 6 also shows the light intensity at different depths in the modelled reactors for various batch times i e biomass concentrations it can be observed that photoheterotrophic growth would have been limited considerably if a ki of 88 w m 2 had been assumed meaning that the kinetic constants previously used in the panm could not have represented the observed behaviour if attenuation had been considered it has to be mentioned that compared to the panm the nitrogen and phosphorus contents in the biomass had to be modified to accurately predict the in and ip profiles from 0 086 g n g codbiomass 1 and 0 015 g p g codbiomass 1 to 0 065 g n g codbiomass 1 and 0 010 g p g codbiomass 1 the higher modelled final concentrations for in and ip compared to the experimental results see fig 6 might be simply due to a slight overestimation of the biomass decay rates in the panm due to the impact of the carotenoids and bchl concentrations on light attenuation the possibility to include pigments as a state variable in the model could be considered as in wágner et al 2018 which could be particularly interesting in aerated reactors as dissolved oxygen impacts pigment availability this was not considered in this work since the detailed analysis of ppb pigments is not available and the overall concentrations are uniform under anaerobic conditions therefore attenuation will depend mostly on biomass concentration we note that very low illumination intensities might increase the pigment contents but that these conditions would not be practical for wastewater treatment resource recovery purposes other than carotenoid production finally although the incident total light in the modelled indoor tests was lower than those used to estimate the attenuation coefficients 120 vs 600 800 w m 2 the influence of the incident light has been reported to be insignificant for attenuation purposes particularly when the light source is distant from the illuminated surface or at high biomass concentrations naderi et al 2017 the accurate modelling results confirmed the applicability of the used light attenuation functions 3 4 implications for industrial application the results presented here show that light attenuation is a critical factor to be considered in ppb systems depending mostly on the biomass concentration and the light path and therefore the reactor design attenuation might lead to an insufficient light supply limiting effective photoheterotrophic growth of ppb compared to other phototrophs such as microalgae the attenuation coefficients are similar for ppb at a given biomass concentration nevertheless it has to be considered that ppb reactors are expected to work at higher concentrations than microalgal systems which will amplify the attenuation effect typical biomass concentrations in microalgae ponds treating wastewater rarely exceed 200 600 mg vss l 1 even when biomass retention is implemented robles et al 2020a 2020b wágner et al 2018 since the biomass yield of ppb is around 1 g codbiomass g codremoved 1 the biomass concentration in the reactors depends mostly on the concentration of biodegradable cod in the wastewater which is commonly over 1 5 2 0 g cod l 1 e g in agri industrial wastewaters resulting in biomass concentrations over 1 0 g vss l 1 capson tojo et al 2020 hülsen et al 2018b in addition nir light absorption by water at low biomass concentration will also increase the attenuation effect in ppb systems e g for domestic wastewater treatment maximising the treatment capacities and the biomass production rates is crucial to balance the high capital costs associated with outdoors ppb reactors capson tojo et al 2020 this makes it imperative to provide optimal conditions for ppb growth with uptake rates close to the maximum values a light distribution allowing an effective photoheterotrophic growth is essential therefore well designed reactors ponds must provide sufficient light along the light path allowing effective ppb growth throughout the system to minimize dark zones fig 7 shows an example of maximum dimensions i e pond depth or flat plate width that a ppb cultivation system could have to support 15 w m 2 in all the reactor volume 15 w m 2 was around the lowest intensity allowing maximum uptake rates see fig 5 under an illumination of 400 w m 2 nir fraction considered as a common value at zenith during winter months in sub tropical areas kandilli and ulgen 2008 the results show that the maximum depth of a pond working above 500 g codbiomass m 3 is below 5 cm while a vertical flat plate reactor could have a thickness of around 10 cm mainly due to the 2 sided illumination these data suggest that common pond depths applied for microalgae systems e g over 20 30 cm should not be extrapolated to ppb cultures as no light would be available in most of the pond volume at these depths these values are in agreement with recent results from an open ppb pond showing that a 10 cm deep raceway performed better than a system with a depth of 20 cm alloul et al 2021 heavy competition with non phototrophic microbes would be expected in deep ponds especially when considering that ppb systems are primed for raw wastewater secondary rather than tertiary treatment with sufficient cod minimising non illuminated areas is a key factor in ppb based systems as the nir phototrophic capabilities are the main competitive advantage of ppb allowing their enrichment as photoautotrophy in microalgae flat plate pbrs have recently been proposed as a promising option hülsen et al 2022a 2022b nevertheless as pbrs are more expensive than open ponds fully detailed economic analyses must be carried out before selecting one alternative over the other our results imply very large surfaces in ponds even larger than for microalgae at optimum water depths e g 5 cm ponds would require very large surfaces and land areas which in turn would increase oxygen diffusion further disturbing the photoheterotrophic metabolism and increasing the competitiveness of common aerobic heterotrophs capson tojo et al 2021 the alternative e g using common hrap depths of around 30 cm can be expected to result in a very diverse microbial population where ppb might not be dominant due to the lack of light throughout most of the system this would be indicated by low scod n p ratios and low biomass yields however in terms of oxygen diffusion this might be a better alternative as 5 cm deep ppb ponds might fail due to ppb outcompetition by faster growing common aerobic heterotrophs especially if paddlewheel mixing is provided thus increasing oxygen diffusion capson tojo et al 2021 research should be carried out regarding optimal design for ponds specific for ppb continuing the work presented in alloul et al 2021 other than design and modelling purposes the findings presented here are also relevant for process optimisation an example is the application of biomass retention in ppb reactors to increase the treatment capacities and volumetric production rates this alternative has been previously applied increasing significantly the biomass concentrations in the reactors and the treatment performances cerruti et al 2020 hülsen et al 2016 stegman et al 2021 the results presented here show that the attenuation effect is increased at high biomass concentrations which might hinder the application of biomass retention methods unless the light path is optimised nevertheless the asymptotic behaviour of the ka values at biomass concentrations over 1 5 2 0 g codbiomass l 1 see fig 2 suggests that further increases in the biomass contents might not require significantly lower light path lengths to allow efficient photoheterotrophic operation 4 conclusions ppb biomass attenuated both uv vis and nir wavelengths with an increasing fraction of uv vis at higher biomass concentrations at concentrations above 1000 mg codbiomass l 1 600 g vs m 3 the attenuation of both spectral bands was approximately equal light attenuation depended on the reactor configuration with a square rectangular cross section attenuating less than a cylindrical cross section attenuation was not impacted by the complexity of the wastewater matrix or by the presence of pha but the concentration of pigments both bchl and carotenoids had a strong effect likely related to their functionality as part of light harvesting complexes scattering had a minimal impact as assessed by use of the lambert beer equation vs alternative models including light scattering a proposed mathematical model based on the lambert beer law and a monod function for light requirements allowed effective representation of the kinetics of anaerobic photoheterotrophic growth the estimated half saturation coefficient for illumination was 4 6 w m 2 indicating that non incident irradiation can be an effective light source the predicted nir light penetration in outdoor ppb systems with biomass concentrations 1 0 g l

15914,flushing is cost effective for mitigating sediments and constraining environmental problems in sewer systems previous mathematical models are almost exclusively built upon simplified governing equations evoking the assumptions of slow bed evolution and sediment transport capacity of which the applicability remains open to question here a 1d coupled non capacity model is presented for non uniform sediment transport in sewer flushing channels as adapted from recently established shallow water hydro sediment morphodynamic models for fluvial processes the present model is tested for an experimental flushing case in paris s des coteaux catchment system the computational results agree with observed data more closely than those of a previous decoupled capacity model while the differences between decoupled and capacity models and the present coupled non capacity model are minor for flushing processes of short durations they are more pronounced for sustained long duration flushing processes physically the adaptation of suspended sediments to capacity regime cannot be fulfilled quickly though bedload sediments can adapt to capacity regime instantly also the bed deformation rate is comparable to its counterpart of the flow depth therefore coupled non capacity modelling is suggested for general applications to sewer flushing channels of which the computing

experimental investigations of sewer sediment transport in the last few decades including full scale field observations bong et al 2016 and laboratory experiments campisano et al 2008 shirazi et al 2014 early investigations have identified that there are three main categories of causes affecting sediment transport efficiency a hydraulic parameters of flushing e g initial energy and flow induced shear stress guo et al 2004 yang et al 2019 b geometric characteristics of the channel e g cross section longitudinal slope and hydraulic roughness safari aksoy 2021 and c properties of the sediment e g median particle size and sediment thickness campisano et al 2004 these field and laboratory studies have focused on sediment transport capacity against shear stress or incipient motion velocity for flushing design based on hydraulic and sediment conditions lange and wichern 2013 safari et al 2018 montes et al 2021 however minimal attention has been paid to the influence of sediment characteristics i e sediment size and its distribution on scouring processes non uniform sediment transport by rapidly varied flow conditions occurring during sewer flushing has so far remained poorly understood shahsavari et al 2017 to increase awareness of the processes outlined it is inspiring that a field experiment was conducted in paris to investigate the feasibility of installing flushing technology in the combined sewer network shahsavari et al 2017 a large combined sewage trunk prone to sedimentation was chosen as a pilot channel to analyze flow and sediment processes in a full scale flushing experiment analytical results emphasize the importance of non uniform sediments and their size distribution on erosion or deposition processes providing a typical case for modelling and assessing the flushing effectiveness of sewers campisano et al 2019 hydrodynamic models have been developed to resolve unsteady flows and sediment transport in sewers vasconcelos wright 2007 leon et al 2010 kerger et al 2011 bousso et al 2013 jia et al 2021 while turbulent flows in sewer pipes exhibit highly complex three dimensional structures as recently resolved via large eddy simulations liu et al 2022a 2022b and direct numerical simulations brosda manhart 2022 previous models for sewer systems have been exclusively confined to one dimensional popularly the traditional saint venant equations along with the exner based equation for uniform campisano et al 2013 shirazi et al 2014 and non uniform campisano et al 2019 sediments have been successfully applied to resolve the spatial and temporal distributions of sediment at the scale of the sewer network further existing models for flow and sediment in sewer systems suffer from two major limitations on the one hand previous sewer models are physically decoupled exclusively neglecting mass exchange between flow and bed vasconcelos wright 2007 campisano et al 2013 on the other hand sediment transport is presumed to be equal to nominal capacity zhang and xie 1993 wu et al 2007 determined using local at a cross section flow conditions campisano et al 2019 in general the concept of sediment transport capacity may not be applicable because flows are usually unsteady and non uniform in contrast to models for sewer systems shallow water hydro sediment morphodynamic shsm models for alluvial rivers have witnessed significant developments over the last two decades or so succinctly there have been advancements from traditional uncoupled to coupled models cao et al 2004 from depth averaged single layer to double layer averaged models cao et al 2015 li et al 2013 2021b from quasi single phase to two phase models li et al 2021b notably shsm models are physically coupled explicitly incorporating the flow sediment bed interactions cao et al 2017 this hierarchy of models is generally applicable to unsteady flow non uniform and non capacity sediment transport and bed evolution in alluvial rivers they have seen wide applications such as fluvial processes in the yangtze river hu et al 2019 2021 and fen river ni et al 2021 dam break floods over erodible beds cao et al 2004 reservoir turbidity currents cao et al 2015 debris flows li et al 2018 landslide generated waves li et al 2019 and barrier lake formation and outburst flood li et al 2021b two fundamental physical issues are involved in formulating mathematical river models on the one hand sediments move in two distinct and yet interchangeable modes i e bedload and suspended load depending on the intensity of flow turbulence and sediment properties wu et al 2007 safari et al 2018 it has been revealed that in alluvial rivers the adaptation of bedload sediments to a capacity regime can be fulfilled quickly and thus a capacity model is approximately applicable cao et al 2011 cao et al 2016 but the adaptation of suspended sediment transport to a capacity regime requires a relatively long time and space cao et al 2007 and therefore non capacity model is warranted on the other hand when bed deformation rate is not negligible compared to that of flow depth the effect of bed deformation on the flow is considerable and accordingly coupled modelling is essential unfortunately understanding these two issues has remained missing for sewer systems the present work sets out to develop a coupled one dimensional 1d model for flow and non capacity sediment transport in sewers systems as extended from recently developed models for fluvial processes the model is tested against observed data from a field flushing case in the des coteaux catchment in paris france shahsavari et al 2017 in comparison with the model by campisano et al 2019 also a decoupled non capacity model a coupled capacity model and a decoupled capacity model are evaluated against the field case and a designed case of long duration thereby flagging out the applicability of coupled non capacity modelling paradigm 2 mathematical models consider cross section averaged 1d sewer flow in a compound channel over a mobile bed comprising n size classes d i denotes the diameter of i th size of sediments where subscript i 1 2 n as shown in fig 1 we consider sediment laden flow over a mobile bed involving a four layer structure a suspended load layer a bedload layer an active layer and a substrate layer hirano 1971 the active layer is conceptual in which sediment exchange occurs only across its upper interface with the flow five primary variables are to be solved i e cross sectional flow area a discharge q depth averaged size specific sediment concentration c i bed elevation z b and surface sediment composition f a i which denotes the volume fraction of the k th size of sediment in the active layer 2 1 coupled non capacity model 2 1 1 governing equations under the framework of shallow water hydro sediment morphodynamics models cao et al 2017 the governing equations for non sediment transport are derived from the complete conservation laws in fluid dynamics including the mass and momentum conservation equations for water sediment mixture flow the size specific mass conservation equations for the sediments the total mass conservation equations for the bed evolution and the size specific mass conservation equations for the sediment in the active layer they can be written as 1 a t q x b s e i b w d i 1 p 2 q

sediment concentration for non uniform sediment transport the widely used active layer formulation proposed by hirano 1971 i e eq 5 is adopted to resolve the change of bed surface sediment composition wu wang 2007 according to hoey and ferguson 1994 the thickness of active layer δ 2 d 90 where d 90 is the particle size at which 90 of the sediment are finer ξ b and f i i are the elevation and the fraction of the i th size sediment at the bottom boundary of the active layer respectively the present model is physically coupled explicitly incorporating interactions between the water flow sediment transport and bed evolution the first term on the right hand side rhs of eq 1 represents the mass exchange between flow and erodible bed and the last term of eq 2 represents the corresponding momentum transfer these terms reflect the complete physical phenomenon that sediment in turn affects flow moreover the present model is non capacity which explicitly states the time and space dimensions required for sediment transport and bed aggradation to be represented through the mass conservation equation i e eq 4 it should be noted that the capacity model is only conditionally acceptable when the adaptation of sediments to the capacity regime can be fulfilled quickly moreover it remains challenging to determine whether the impacts of delayed adaptation of sediment transport in sewer flow are insignificant 2 1 2 model closures a set of relationships have to be introduced to close the governing equations including the determination of bed friction momentum correction coefficient the velocity discrepancy coefficient between sediment and mixture flow sediment exchange fluxes and the fraction of the i th size sediment in the interface between active and substrate layers the friction

5 θ i 0 047 0 047 where θ i u 2 s g d i is the size specific shields parameter with the specific gravity of sediment s ρ s ρ w ρ w u is the bed shear velocity in general the velocity of bedload sediment is usually lower than the flow velocity represented by the coefficient β s i smaller than unity greimann et al 2008 cao et al 2011 in contrast the value of β s i for suspended sediment is set equal to unity because the average transport velocity is almost the same as the flow velocity physically the deposition and entrainment fluxes for non uniform sediment transport can be estimated by a deterministic approach 14 d i α i ω i c i 15 e i α i ω i c e i where ω i is the size specific settling velocity calculated by the formula of zhang and xie 1993 α i is an empirical parameter specified

incipient motion of non uniform sediments coarse grains are more likely to be entrained than in the uniform case because they have more access to the flow conversely finer grains are harder to be entrained because they are more likely to be hidden behind or between coarse grains which is known as the hiding and exposure effect so far most studies on non uniform sediment transport rates have introduced a correction factor i e f i to modify existing uniform sediment transport equations parker 1991a 1991b 17 f i f a i d i f a j d j the size specific suspended load and bedload transport rate

in non uniform bed material wu et al 2000 it is necessary to note that the sediment entrainment flux vanishes where the bed is made of rigid material e g steel or concrete and is locally non erodible the following relation is employed to evaluate f i i hoey and ferguson 1994 20 f i i f s i ξ t 0 ϕ c i c 1 ϕ f a i ξ t 0 where f s i is the fraction of the i th size sediment in the substrate layer ϕ

when bed aggrades i e ξ t 0 the determination of f i i relies on the fraction f a i in the active layer and sediment concentration in the context of sediment transport mechanics the rouse number z also called suspension index is usually used to divide suspended load and bed load 21 z ω κ u where κ is the von karman constant for clear water flow κ 0 4 physically the rouse number represents the effect of gravity against the effect of turbulent diffusion wu 2007 when the rouse number is larger than about 2 5 sediment moves mainly as bedload 2 1 3 numerical methods the complete set of the

where λ max max u g a b w is the maximum celerity and c r is the courant number after variables are updated at each time step it is physically justified because bed deformation is solely determined by the local entrainment and deposition fluxes the sediment composition in the substrate layer is also updated following updating the sediment composition in the active layer in the substrate layer the sediment is assumed to be well mixed the updating procedure of the substrate sediment composition can be classified into two cases i e bed aggradation and degradation with a detailed description of

order runge kutta method 2 2 comparisons with existing models according to the governing equations the various types of models can be summarized in table 1 a coupled non capacity model that employs the complete equations is denoted as cncm a decoupled non capacity model is denoted as dncm a coupled capacity model is referred to as ccm and a decoupled capacity model as dcm the decoupled non capacity model dncm is simplified from the cncm by neglecting the feedback effect of bed deformation on the flow which should be approximately applicable if bed deformation is significantly slower than the flow depth changes specifically the term on the rhs of eq 1 and the third and fourth terms on the rhs of eq 2 are ignored the governing equations of the dncm can be solved using the numerical algorithm for cncm as described in subsection 2 1 3 however it is noted that neglecting the contribution of mass exchange with the bed to mass conservation of the sediment laden flow may lead to collapse of the decoupled model in some extreme cases such as dam break floods over erodible sediment beds cao et al 2004 2017 in a capacity model the size specific sediment concentration c i is presumed to be always equal to the nominal transport capacity c e i determined by the local flow and bed conditions i e eq 16 thus the mass conservation given by eq 3 is no longer necessary therefore the governing equations of a coupled capacity model cao et al 2016 are 27 a t q x a s t 28 q t x β 0 q 2 a g i 1 g a s 0 s f g i 2 g i 1 ρ s ρ w ρ c i x u ρ 0 ρ ρ a s t 29 t 1 p a s a c t x a u c t 0 30 1 p δ f a i h c i t 1 p f i i η t h u c i x 0 the governing equations eqs 27 30 can be solved numerically in the same manner as those of non capacity models an explicit finite volume discretization with the simplified hllc approximate riemann solver is also deployed to solve the eqs 27 28 it is worth noting that eqs 29 30 need to be solved directly using the finite difference methods as cao et al 2016 31 a s k m 1 a s k m a c t k m 1 a c t k m 1 p δ t a u c i k 1 m a u c i k 1 m 2 δ x 1 p 0 32 δ f a i k m 1 δ f a i k m h c i k m 1 h c i k m 1 p f i i k δ k m 1 δ k m δ t δ t a u c i k 1 m a u c i k 1 m 2 δ x 1 p in contrast to the ccm the dcm ignores the term on the rhs of eq 27 and the third and fourth terms on the rhs of eq 28 the model of campisano et al 2019 for unsteady flow and non uniform sediment transport is essentially a dcm which evokes the assumptions of very slow bed evolution and sediment transport capacity the applicability of the three simplified models dncm ccm and dcm is to be evaluated in the following 3 modelling study case 3 1 site of study the field flushing experiment was conducted at the collecteur des coteaux a well known combined collector in paris s sewage system shahsavari et al 2017 during the dry season this sewer has an average flow of roughly 0 35 m3 s 1 the sewer pipe considered for the flushing test is 1 1 km long with an average longitudinal slope at the bottom of the pipeline of about 0 09 and the section is characterized by a component cross section maximum height 3 15 m full width 2 40 m with a central wedge shaped channel and side walkways as shown in fig 2 the upstream section features various undulating regions with several reverse slopes because of the low flow the main channel is prone to sedimentation issues resulting in a small quantity of sediment deposition a few tens of centimetres a motorized fan gate with a spiked weir was installed at s 0 defined as 50 m upstream of the gate i e s 50 is the pipe inlet this gate pass was initially intended to regulate combined overflows during storm occurrences since the gate can keep a high amount of water about 8 000 m3 in the upstream pipe flushing tests were carried out in this pipe at the downstream end of the channel s 1050 a free fall diversion structure conveys the flow to a sediment capture chamber specific equipment consisting of doppler velocimetry and ultrasonic probes were used to monitor the hydraulic properties which were installed upstream sections s 50 and s 5 and downstream sections s 5 s 50 and s 100 the gates shahsavari et al 2017 sediment transport during flushing was directly observed by underwater cameras installed on both sides of the pipe the height and volume of sediment before bf and after af flushing were measured using radar sonar scanning techniques in addition a sediment sampling campaign was conducted before and after the flushing test to analyze the evolution of sediment size distribution induced by flushing twenty and 17 samples were collected throughout the channel in bf and af respectively fig 2 table 2 shows sediment size distributions relative to segments upstream and downstream of s 500 in the experiment bf this experimental flushing test consists of two phases first the gate was closed to store the upstream flow from the intercepted dry weather then when the maximum storage level was reached 2 15 m behind the gate the flushing water was released with the sudden opening of the gate the adequate flushing time was about 5 hours and the total volume released by the flushing water was estimated to be close to 8000 m3 further details on the experimental setup and monitoring methods used can be found in shahsavari et al 2017 3 2 model setup the coupled non capacity sediment transport model is applied to an approximately 5 hours flushing experiment in the paris sewer to evaluate its capability the calculation domain is chosen from 50 m upstream s 50 to 1050 m downstream s 1050 of the gate a uniform spatial step δ x 1 m is used following shahsavari 2018 and the time step is specified by c r 0 65 along with empiricism which always ensures stability ten particle size groups including sand and gravel with a diameter ranging from 0 0625 mm to 40 mm are used to simulate sediment sorting and transport in the active and substrate layers the values of other standard parameters are ρ s 2317 kg m 3 ρ w 1000 kg m 3 and p 0 41 based on the experimentally measured the local manning roughness n m is set to be 0 020 with reference to campisano et al 2019 in which it is not distinguished from the overall cross sectional roughness the empirical coefficient α and modification coefficient σ are all set to be 1 0 most of the parameters used e g cross section geometry sediment size distribution and so on can be directly obtained from the experimental measurement data for the initial conditions in particular the simulation takes the hydraulic conditions before flushing as the initial conditions based on the experimental measurements the water level before the flushing gate is 2 15 m and about 0 5 m downstream of the gate from which the initial flow discharge can be estimated as 0 35 m3 s 1 shahsavari 2018 in addition the initial bed sand gradation was obtained by linear interpolation of the sediment samples 20 in total collected during the bf processes table 2 the model s boundary conditions include inlet and outlet boundary conditions the inflow hydrograph q t recorded at the channel inlet s 50 was used during the experiment to define the boundary conditions upstream in addition the upstream boundary conditions also require the sediment transport capacity equation to determine the q s t depending on the local flow conditions the downstream boundary is given as the measured water level process at s 1050 here the model performance is evaluated based on two conventional metrics the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 and the coefficient of determination r 2 the metric nse is used to assess the predictive power of the model the metric r 2 is an excellent indicator of the correlation between projections and observations the closer the metric nse or r 2 is to 1 the higher the accuracy is 33 nse 1 k 1 n η k sim η k obs 2 k 1 n η k obs η obs 2 34 r 2 k 1 n η k obs η obs η k sim η sim 2 k 1 n η k obs η obs 2 k 1 n η k sim η sim 2 where η k sim are simulated data for spatial or time step k η k obs are observed data for spatial or time step k η sim is the simulated mean value η obs is the observed mean value n is the number of pairs of the observations 4 results and discussion 4 1 test of the non capacity transport model in this subsection the results of the present coupled non capacity sediment transport model cncm are evaluated against observed data from a flushing experiment conducted at the collecteur des coteaux in paris sewage system in addition the results of the decoupled capacity model of campisano et al 2019 are presented for comparison with the present cncm the flow discharge q and water depth h simulated by the cncm are compared with the experimental values recorded in the flushing tests at the three monitored sections as shown in fig 3 there is a good agreement between the simulated and experimental results at sections s 5 upstream of the gate s 5 and s 50 downstream of the gate also the cncm reflects the flow recession phase well although the model performs slightly worse initially the cncm correctly reproduces the sudden drop in water level from 2 15 m to 1 5 m at s 5 associated with dam break flood and rapid rise in water level from 0 5 m to 1 5 m at s 5 and s 50 caused by the propagation of the scour wave downstream the metrics of nse and r 2 between the simulated and observed flow depth and discharge is illustrated in table 3 while the computed results of both the present cncm and the model of campisano et al 2019 agree with the experimental data rather well the present cncm appears to perform appreciably better than campisano et al 2019 although the results fig 3 show that the cncm and campisano et al 2019 have similar performance in predicting flow discharge and water depth the two models differ significantly in reproducing the evolution of sediments fig 4 shows the longitudinal profile of bed deposits at the end of flushing indicating that the cncm performs better than campisano et al 2019 in solving the changes in erodible beds in particular the cncm better reproduces the deposit depths e g the upstream part of the channel before section s 450 and erosion segments e g s 500 s 650 and s 750 s 850 fairly good agreement between simulated and experimental sediment depths is achieved in the segments immediately downstream of the gates between s 150 and s 200 and between s 960 and s 980 where experimental sediment peaks were not correctly predicted by the cncm and campisano et al 2019 the deviations of the two models from the experimental data are illustrated by an nse of 0 4883 and 0 4478 for the cncm and campisano et al 2019 respectively the present cncm and campisano et al 2019 also yield reliable results in predicting the potential of flushing cleaning efficiency as shown in table 4 the cncm results show that the total amount of sediment flushed away from the downstream section of the gates between s 0 and s 1050 is 5 82 m3 difference between initial sediment of 27 09 m3 and final sediment of 21 27 m3 this value is larger than 5 29 m3 obtained by the field experiment shahsavari et al 2017 with relative error 10 02 in comparison campisano et al 2019 yielded a total volume of sediment removed by scour of 4 32 m3 with relative error 18 33 fig 5 shows the cumulated volume of sediment deposits due to the cncm and campisano et al 2019 for d 0 9 mm 0 9 mm d 2 mm 2 mm d 4 2 mm and d 4 2 mm both the cncm and campisano et al 2019 achieved results for sediment sizes with d 4 2 mm in fairly good agreement with observed data especially for the sediment with 2 mm d 4 2 mm the results of both models are in good agreement with the observed values however for fine grained sediment the deviation is relatively large because the ability of suspended sediment to reach capacity regime is overestimated as in the capacity model of campisano et al 2019 table 5 shows the statistical performance metrics for the cumulated volume of size specific sediment deposits for d 4 2 mm the performances of the cncm and campisano et al 2019 are virtually equivalent in terms of the metric r 2 but the cncm performs considerably better than campisano et al 2019 as far as the metric nse is concerned for d 4 2 mm the cncm gives reliable simulation results compared with observed data whilst it is noted that campisano et al 2019 do not give the cumulated volume of sediment for d 4 2 mm fundamentally the improved performances of the cncm over campisano et al 2019 is attributed to the decoupling and capacity assumption embedded in campisano et al 2019 and potentially the distinct numerical schemes used to solve the governing equations of both models 4 2 sensitivity to model parameters sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the effects of model parameters on the results in the cncm specifically three parameters local manning roughness n m empirical coefficient α and modification coefficient σ are tuned the local manning roughness n m is tuned by 0 005 from the value of 0 020 the coefficient α is tuned by 50 based on the value of 1 0 and the modification coefficient σ is doubled or halved on the value of 1 0 figs 6 8 illustrate the corresponding results it is demonstrated that the local manning roughness n m is the parameter influencing the hydrodynamics processes the most while the empirical coefficient α and modification coefficient σ have a considerable effect on the flow sediment exchange rate and the evolution of the sediment deposits as shown in fig 6 the water depth hydrograph is more sensitive to the local manning roughness than the flow discharge hydrograph the larger the local manning coefficient n m is the more pronounced the water level lift is the empirical coefficient α and the modification coefficient σ have a similar effect on flow sediment interaction i e the larger the coefficient the more violent the sediment scour and the greater the amount of bed evaluation as shown in figs 7 and 8 the sensitivity analysis facilitates understanding of the extent to which the empirical model parameters may affect the results in this connection it is essential to note that the 1d shsm model has recently been extended to address uncertainties arising from various sources li et al 2021a 2022 the emerging models are expected to provide enhanced quantification of the uncertainty of shallow water sediment flows over erodible beds 4 3 non capacity versus capacity coupled versus decoupled modelling 4 3 1 for field flushing experiment of shahsavari et al 2017 the three simplified models dncm ccm and dcm listed in table 1 are applied to the field experiment of shahsavari et al 2017 to investigate their performances in general for this particular flushing test of relatively short duration the three simplified models give results essentially equivalent to those of the cncm in satisfactory agreement with observed data this is clear in the discharge and water depth hydrographs shown in fig 9 it is thus implied that the assumptions of capacity transport and slow bed evolution are reasonable for this specific flushing case in this connection decoupled and capacity models are approximately applicable such as campaniso et al 2019 4 3 2 for designed sustained flushing in the field flushing experiment of shahsavari et al 2017 the flushing time was five hours and the flow discharge sharply reduced from a maximum of 3 9 m3 s 1 to 1 0 m3 s 1 after about 1 5 hours essentially this flushing case is characterized by weak bed deformation aggradation and degradation and short duration to reveal what would happen for flushing featuring strong bed deformation a sustained long duration flushing test is here with designed and investigated using the four models in table 1 except for the inflow conditions all are the same as those described in section 3 1 as per shahsavari et al 2017 the designed continuous flushing duration is set to last for 12 hours the inlet flow discharge is maintained at 3 0 m3 s 1 throughout the flushing processes and the inlet sediment concentration vanishes in addition a free outflow boundary is considered in order to be as consistent as possible with actual conditions the initial conditions of models are compatible with the initial requirements of exact measurements in subsection 3 2 fig 10 illustrates the longitudinal profile of bed deposits in the first 500 m due to the four models as downstream the first 500 m sediment deposits are indiscernible it is seen from fig 10 that the differences between the results of non capacity and capacity models either coupled or decoupled are considerable the results of coupled and uncoupled models either non capacity or capacity exhibit appreciable differences which nevertheless are less than the differences between capacity and non capacity models the afore stated finding concerning the differences between capacity and non capacity models and between coupled and decoupled models holds for the differences in terms of flow depth hydrographs fig 11 and the total amount of sediment that is transported through a cross section s 500 fig 12 the effects of the decoupling and capacity assumptions on flow discharge hydrographs are essentially negligible fig 11a c e fig 13 shows the constituent contributions of the three terms to water sediment flow mass conservation eq 1 where at qx and ast indicate the first and second terms on the lhs and the term on the rhs of eq 1 respectively perfect mass conservation occurs if the residual rm satisfies rm at qx ast 0 as shown in fig 13 the magnitude of ast is by no means negligible as compared to at therefore coupled modelling is warranted further the cumulated volumes of size specific sediment deposits from the four models fig 14 indicate that the differences between non capacity and capacity models become more pronounced as sediment size becomes finer and vice versa this actually arises from the distinct adaptation behaviour of suspended and bed loads both involved in this case as the rouse number varies widely from below 1 0 to far above 5 0 not shown following cao et al 2011 2016 for fluvial processes to elucidate the adaptation of differently sized sediments to capacity the computed sediment concentration from the cncm are compared against the nominal capacity c e i determined using local flow conditions fig 15 at selected sections s 50 s 100 s 200 and s 500 it can be seen that the sediment concentration generally deviates from the nominal capacity and the finer the sediment particle size the larger the deviation on the other hand with sediment exchange with the bed along the sewer the size specific sediment concentration will gradually approach nominal capacity it is also shown that the capacity of fine grain sediment will be restored slowly while the coarse grain sediment can reach the capacity regime more quickly physically the adaptation of sediment transport is determined by the sediment exchange rate with the bed surface and flow bedload normally coarse sediment exchange with the bed is usually much faster than that for the suspended load normally finer and the contribution by sediment laden flow to suspended transport is comparatively weak because β 1 for suspended transport wu 2007 greimann et al 2008 the present computational results in this concern for the sewer processes echo the finding for fluvial processes cao et al 2016 therefore it is characterized that non capacity models should be used not only for fluvial processes but also for sewer systems 4 3 3 flushing management practically it is interesting to probe into how and whether sediment deposits in sewer systems can completely flushed away the present modeling study facilitates an effective approach to solving this issue here two 48 hour continuous flushing cases are investigated using the four models summarized in table 1 in which the inlet flow discharge is maintained at 3 0 m3 s 1 and 4 5 m3 s 1 respectively fig 16 illustrates the cumulated volume of sediment deposits calculated by the four models it is shown that flushing can effectively carry sediment away from the channel and the higher the inlet flow discharge the more the sediment deposits carried away most notably the four models yield disparate processes of the residual sediment deposits though the final amount of residual sediment deposits depends primarily on the inlet flushing discharge the capacity models ccm and dcm overestimate the sediment transport rates leading to overcalculation of the flushing rate as compared against the cncm on the contrary decoupling in dncm ensures underestimation of the flushing rate in comparison with the cncm 4 3 4 computing efficiency a dell precision t7920 workstation with an intel xeon silver 4214 cpu is employed to run the four mathematical models as summarized in table 1 the computing time of each model is scaled by that of the cncm leading to a parameter of the relative computing time t r as given in table 6 it is shown that for the 5 hour field flushing experiment of shahsavari et al 2017 the time cost of cncm is discernibly longer than the other three simplified models less than 10 yet for the 48 hour designed case the computing times of the four models are essentially the same accordingly the cncm is recommended for general applications which is physically better based than the other three models in this regard with parallel computing techniques and acceleration strategies hu et al 2019 mathematical modeling for flow sediment bed processes in not only alluvial rivers but sewer systems should become more and more attractive 5 conclusions a coupled non capacity model cncm is presented for flow and non uniform sediment transport in sewer systems adapted from recently established shallow water hydro sediment morphodynamic models for fluvial processes the present cncm is tested against a field flushing experiment in paris s des coteaux catchment system shahsavari et al 2017 the computational results agree well with observed data appreciably more closely than a decoupled capacity model campisano et al 2019 indeed for a flushing process of short duration and weak bed deformation the differences between decoupled capacity models and the present coupled non capacity model are minor however they are more pronounced for sustained long duration flushing processes physically the adaptation of suspended sediments to capacity regime cannot be fulfilled quickly though bedload sediments can adapt to capacity regime instantly also the bed deformation rate is comparable to its counterpart of the flow depth consequently a coupled non capacity modelling paradigm is suggested for general applications to flushing in sewer systems just as for fluvial processes declaration of competing interest the

15914,flushing is cost effective for mitigating sediments and constraining environmental problems in sewer systems previous mathematical models are almost exclusively built upon simplified governing equations evoking the assumptions of slow bed evolution and sediment transport capacity of which the applicability remains open to question here a 1d coupled non capacity model is presented for non uniform sediment transport in sewer flushing channels as adapted from recently established shallow water hydro sediment morphodynamic models for fluvial processes the present model is tested for an experimental flushing case in paris s des coteaux catchment system the computational results agree with observed data more closely than those of a previous decoupled capacity model while the differences between decoupled and capacity models and the present coupled non capacity model are minor for flushing processes of short durations they are more pronounced for sustained long duration flushing processes physically the adaptation of suspended sediments to capacity regime cannot be fulfilled quickly though bedload sediments can adapt to capacity regime instantly also the bed deformation rate is comparable to its counterpart of the flow depth therefore coupled non capacity modelling is suggested for general applications to sewer flushing channels of which the computing cost is essentially equivalent to simplified models built upon decoupling and capacity assumptions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewer flushing coupled modelling non uniform sediment non capacity sediment transport 1 introduction floods the most common natural catastrophe have become a major hazard to lives and property in cities due to global climate change rapid urbanization and rising population westra et al 2014 undrr 2019 wmo 2021 with the increased frequency and intensity of floods a well designed stormwater drainage system is vital in resisting urban flooding martin and vanrolleghem 2014 mignot et al 2019 however sediments in drainage networks significantly influence hydraulic characteristics leading to lower flow capacity and excessive sewer overflows gent et al 1996 campisano et al 2013 safari and aksoy 2021 flushing has been currently considered a valuable and cost effective method to remove deposited sediments shirazi et al 2014 shahsavari et al 2017 yang et al 2019 the sediment transport induced by flushing waves is a complicated and interactive process safari et al 2015 involving water flows and flow induced morphological changes which influence flows in turn similar to fluvial processes cao et al 2017 therefore an enhanced understanding of flow and sediment transport in sewer systems is urgently needed there have been experimental investigations of sewer sediment transport in the last few decades including full scale field observations bong et al 2016 and laboratory experiments campisano et al 2008 shirazi et al 2014 early investigations have identified that there are three main categories of causes affecting sediment transport efficiency a hydraulic parameters of flushing e g initial energy and flow induced shear stress guo et al 2004 yang et al 2019 b geometric characteristics of the channel e g cross section longitudinal slope and hydraulic roughness safari aksoy 2021 and c properties of the sediment e g median particle size and sediment thickness campisano et al 2004 these field and laboratory studies have focused on sediment transport capacity against shear stress or incipient motion velocity for flushing design based on hydraulic and sediment conditions lange and wichern 2013 safari et al 2018 montes et al 2021 however minimal attention has been paid to the influence of sediment characteristics i e sediment size and its distribution on scouring processes non uniform sediment transport by rapidly varied flow conditions occurring during sewer flushing has so far remained poorly understood shahsavari et al 2017 to increase awareness of the processes outlined it is inspiring that a field experiment was conducted in paris to investigate the feasibility of installing flushing technology in the combined sewer network shahsavari et al 2017 a large combined sewage trunk prone to sedimentation was chosen as a pilot channel to analyze flow and sediment processes in a full scale flushing experiment analytical results emphasize the importance of non uniform sediments and their size distribution on erosion or deposition processes providing a typical case for modelling and assessing the flushing effectiveness of sewers campisano et al 2019 hydrodynamic models have been developed to resolve unsteady flows and sediment transport in sewers vasconcelos wright 2007 leon et al 2010 kerger et al 2011 bousso et al 2013 jia et al 2021 while turbulent flows in sewer pipes exhibit highly complex three dimensional structures as recently resolved via large eddy simulations liu et al 2022a 2022b and direct numerical simulations brosda manhart 2022 previous models for sewer systems have been exclusively confined to one dimensional popularly the traditional saint venant equations along with the exner based equation for uniform campisano et al 2013 shirazi et al 2014 and non uniform campisano et al 2019 sediments have been successfully applied to resolve the spatial and temporal distributions of sediment at the scale of the sewer network further existing models for flow and sediment in sewer systems suffer from two major limitations on the one hand previous sewer models are physically decoupled exclusively neglecting mass exchange between flow and bed vasconcelos wright 2007 campisano et al 2013 on the other hand sediment transport is presumed to be equal to nominal capacity zhang and xie 1993 wu et al 2007 determined using local at a cross section flow conditions campisano et al 2019 in general the concept of sediment transport capacity may not be applicable because flows are usually unsteady and non uniform in contrast to models for sewer systems shallow water hydro sediment morphodynamic shsm models for alluvial rivers have witnessed significant developments over the last two decades or so succinctly there have been advancements from traditional uncoupled to coupled models cao et al 2004 from depth averaged single layer to double layer averaged models cao et al 2015 li et al 2013 2021b from quasi single phase to two phase models li et al 2021b notably shsm models are physically coupled explicitly incorporating the flow sediment bed interactions cao et al 2017 this hierarchy of models is generally applicable to unsteady flow non uniform and non capacity sediment transport and bed evolution in alluvial rivers they have seen wide applications such as fluvial processes in the yangtze river hu et al 2019 2021 and fen river ni et al 2021 dam break floods over erodible beds cao et al 2004 reservoir turbidity currents cao et al 2015 debris flows li et al 2018 landslide generated waves li et al 2019 and barrier lake formation and outburst flood li et al 2021b two fundamental physical issues are involved in formulating mathematical river models on the one hand sediments move in two distinct and yet interchangeable modes i e bedload and suspended load depending on the intensity of flow turbulence and sediment properties wu et al 2007 safari et al 2018 it has been revealed that in alluvial rivers the adaptation of bedload sediments to a capacity regime can be fulfilled quickly and thus a capacity model is approximately applicable cao et al 2011 cao et al 2016 but the adaptation of suspended sediment transport to a capacity regime requires a relatively long time and space cao et al 2007 and therefore non capacity model is warranted on the other hand when bed deformation rate is not negligible compared to that of flow depth the effect of bed deformation on the flow is considerable and accordingly coupled modelling is essential unfortunately understanding these two issues has remained missing for sewer systems the present work sets out to develop a coupled one dimensional 1d model for flow and non capacity sediment transport in sewers systems as extended from recently developed models for fluvial processes the model is tested against observed data from a field flushing case in the des coteaux catchment in paris france shahsavari et al 2017 in comparison with the model by campisano et al 2019 also a decoupled non capacity model a coupled capacity model and a decoupled capacity model are evaluated against the field case and a designed case of long duration thereby flagging out the applicability of coupled non capacity modelling paradigm 2 mathematical models consider cross section averaged 1d sewer flow in a compound channel over a mobile bed comprising n size classes d i denotes the diameter of i th size of sediments where subscript i 1 2 n as shown in fig 1 we consider sediment laden flow over a mobile bed involving a four layer structure a suspended load layer a bedload layer an active layer and a substrate layer hirano 1971 the active layer is conceptual in which sediment exchange occurs only across its upper interface with the flow five primary variables are to be solved i e cross sectional flow area a discharge q depth averaged size

model 2 1 1 governing equations under the framework of shallow water hydro sediment morphodynamics models cao et al 2017 the governing equations for non sediment transport are derived from the complete conservation laws in fluid dynamics including the mass and momentum conservation equations for water sediment mixture flow the size specific mass conservation equations for the sediments the total mass conservation equations for the bed evolution and the size specific mass conservation equations for the sediment in the active layer they can be written as 1 a t q x b s e i b w d i 1 p 2 q

wu wang 2007 according to hoey and ferguson 1994 the thickness of active layer δ 2 d 90 where d 90 is the particle size at which 90 of the sediment are finer ξ b and f i i are the elevation and the fraction of the i th size sediment at the bottom boundary of the active layer respectively the present model is physically coupled explicitly incorporating interactions between the water flow sediment transport and bed evolution the first term on the right hand side rhs of eq 1 represents the mass exchange between flow and erodible bed and the last term of eq 2 represents the corresponding momentum transfer these terms reflect the complete physical phenomenon that sediment in turn affects flow moreover the present model is non capacity which explicitly states the time and space dimensions required for sediment transport and bed aggradation to be represented through the mass conservation equation i e eq 4 it should be noted that the capacity model is only conditionally acceptable when the adaptation of sediments to the capacity regime can be fulfilled quickly moreover it remains challenging to determine whether the impacts of delayed adaptation of sediment transport in sewer flow are insignificant 2 1 2 model closures a set of relationships have to be introduced to close the governing equations including the determination of bed friction momentum correction coefficient the

sediment is usually lower than the flow velocity represented by the coefficient β s i smaller than unity greimann et al 2008 cao et al 2011 in contrast the value of β s i for suspended sediment is set equal to unity because the average transport velocity is almost the same as the flow velocity physically the deposition and entrainment fluxes for non uniform sediment transport can be estimated by a deterministic approach 14 d i α i ω i c i 15 e i α i ω i c e i where ω i is the size specific settling velocity calculated by the formula of zhang and xie 1993 α i is an empirical parameter specified

incipient motion of non uniform sediments coarse grains are more likely to be entrained than in the uniform case because they have more access to the flow conversely finer grains are harder to be entrained because they are more likely to be hidden behind or between coarse grains which is known as the hiding and exposure effect so far most studies on non uniform sediment transport rates have introduced a correction factor i e f i to modify existing uniform sediment transport equations parker 1991a 1991b 17 f i f a i d i f a j d j the size specific suspended load and bedload transport rate

in non uniform bed material wu et al 2000 it is necessary to note that the sediment entrainment flux vanishes where the bed is made of rigid material e g steel or concrete and is locally non erodible the following relation is employed to evaluate f i i hoey and ferguson 1994 20 f i i f s i ξ t 0 ϕ c i c 1 ϕ f a i ξ t 0 where f s i is the fraction of the i th size sediment in the substrate layer ϕ

effect of gravity against the effect of turbulent diffusion wu 2007 when the rouse number is larger than about 2 5 sediment moves mainly as bedload 2 1 3 numerical methods the complete set of the

where λ max max u g a b w is the maximum celerity and c r is the courant number after variables are updated at each time step it is physically justified because bed deformation is solely determined by the local entrainment and deposition fluxes the sediment composition in the substrate layer is also updated following updating the sediment composition in the active layer in the substrate layer the sediment is assumed to be well mixed the updating procedure of the substrate sediment composition can be classified into two cases i e bed aggradation and degradation with a detailed description of

the complete equations is denoted as cncm a decoupled non capacity model is denoted as dncm a coupled capacity model is referred to as ccm and a decoupled capacity model as dcm the decoupled non capacity model dncm is simplified from the cncm by neglecting the feedback effect of bed deformation on the flow which should be approximately applicable if bed deformation is significantly slower than the flow depth changes specifically the term on the rhs of eq 1 and the third and fourth terms on the rhs of eq 2 are ignored the governing equations of the dncm can be solved using the numerical algorithm for cncm as described in subsection 2 1 3 however it is noted that neglecting the contribution of mass exchange with the bed to mass conservation of the sediment laden flow may lead to collapse of the decoupled model in some extreme cases such as dam break floods over erodible sediment beds cao et al 2004 2017 in a capacity model the size specific sediment concentration c i is presumed to be always equal to the nominal transport capacity c e i determined by the local flow and bed conditions i e eq 16 thus the mass conservation given by eq 3 is no longer necessary therefore the governing equations of a coupled capacity model cao et al 2016 are 27 a t q x a s t 28 q t x β 0 q 2 a g i 1 g a s 0 s f g i 2 g i 1 ρ s ρ w ρ c i x u ρ 0 ρ ρ a s t 29 t 1 p a s a c t x a u c t 0

uniform sediment transport is essentially a dcm which evokes the assumptions of very slow bed evolution and sediment transport capacity the applicability of the three simplified models dncm ccm and dcm is to be evaluated in the following 3 modelling study case 3 1 site of study the field flushing experiment was conducted at the collecteur des coteaux a well known combined collector in paris s sewage system shahsavari et al 2017 during the dry season this sewer has an average flow of roughly 0 35 m3 s 1 the sewer pipe considered for the flushing test is 1 1 km long with an average longitudinal slope at the bottom of the pipeline of about 0 09 and the section is characterized by a component cross section maximum height 3 15 m full width 2 40 m with a central wedge shaped channel and side walkways as shown in fig 2 the upstream section features various undulating regions with several reverse slopes because of the low flow the main channel is prone to sedimentation issues resulting in a small quantity of sediment deposition a few tens of centimetres a motorized fan gate with a spiked weir was installed at s 0 defined as 50 m upstream of the gate i e s 50 is the pipe inlet this gate pass was initially intended to regulate combined overflows during storm occurrences since the gate can keep a high amount of water about 8 000 m3 in the upstream pipe flushing tests were carried out in this pipe at the downstream end of the channel s 1050 a free fall diversion structure conveys the flow to a sediment capture chamber specific equipment consisting of doppler velocimetry and ultrasonic probes were used to monitor the hydraulic properties which were installed upstream sections s 50 and s 5 and downstream sections s 5 s 50 and s 100 the gates shahsavari et al 2017 sediment transport during flushing was directly observed by underwater cameras installed on both sides of the pipe the height and volume of sediment before bf and after af flushing were measured using radar sonar scanning techniques in addition a sediment sampling campaign was conducted before and after the flushing test to analyze the evolution of sediment size distribution induced by flushing twenty and 17 samples were collected throughout the channel in bf and af respectively fig 2 table 2 shows sediment size distributions relative to segments upstream and downstream of s 500 in the experiment bf this experimental flushing test consists of two phases first the gate was closed to store the upstream flow from the intercepted dry weather then when the maximum storage level was reached 2 15 m behind the gate the flushing water was released with the sudden opening of the gate the adequate flushing time was about 5 hours and the total volume released by the flushing water was estimated to be close to 8000 m3 further details on the experimental setup and monitoring methods used can be found in shahsavari et al 2017 3 2 model setup the coupled non capacity sediment transport model is applied to an approximately 5 hours flushing experiment in the paris sewer to evaluate its capability the calculation domain is chosen from 50 m upstream s 50 to 1050 m downstream s 1050 of the gate a uniform spatial step δ x 1 m is used following shahsavari 2018 and the time step is specified by c r 0 65 along with empiricism which always ensures stability ten particle size groups including sand and gravel with a diameter ranging from 0 0625 mm to 40 mm are used to simulate sediment sorting and transport in the active and substrate layers the values of other standard parameters are ρ s 2317 kg m 3 ρ w 1000 kg m 3 and p 0 41 based on the experimentally measured the local manning roughness n m is set to be 0 020 with reference to campisano et al 2019 in which it is not distinguished from the overall cross sectional roughness the empirical coefficient α and modification coefficient σ are all set to be 1 0 most of the parameters used e g cross section geometry sediment size distribution and so on can be directly obtained from the experimental measurement data for the initial conditions in particular the simulation takes the hydraulic conditions before flushing as the initial conditions based on the experimental measurements the water level before the flushing gate is 2 15 m and about 0 5 m downstream of the gate from which the initial flow discharge can be estimated as 0 35 m3 s 1 shahsavari 2018 in addition the initial bed sand gradation was obtained by linear interpolation of the sediment samples 20 in total collected during the bf processes table 2 the model s boundary conditions include inlet and outlet boundary conditions the inflow hydrograph q t recorded at the channel inlet s 50 was used during the experiment to define the boundary conditions upstream in addition the upstream boundary conditions also require the sediment transport capacity equation to determine the q s t depending on the local flow conditions the downstream boundary is given as the measured water level process at s 1050 here the model performance is evaluated based on two conventional metrics the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 and the coefficient of determination r 2 the metric nse is used to assess the predictive power of the model the metric r 2 is an excellent indicator of the correlation between projections and observations the closer the metric nse or r 2 is to 1 the higher the accuracy is 33 nse 1 k 1 n η k sim η k obs 2 k 1 n η k obs η obs 2 34 r 2 k 1 n η k obs η obs η k sim η sim 2 k 1 n η k obs η obs 2

transport model cncm are evaluated against observed data from a flushing experiment conducted at the collecteur des coteaux in paris sewage system in addition the results of the decoupled capacity model of campisano et al 2019 are presented for comparison with the present cncm the flow discharge q and water depth h simulated by the cncm are compared with the experimental values recorded in the flushing tests at the three monitored sections as shown in fig 3 there is a good agreement between the simulated and experimental results at sections s 5 upstream of the gate s 5 and s 50 downstream of the gate also the cncm reflects the flow recession phase well although the model performs slightly worse initially the cncm correctly reproduces the sudden drop in water level from 2 15 m to 1 5 m at s 5 associated with dam break flood and rapid rise in water level from 0 5 m to 1 5 m at s 5 and s 50 caused by the propagation of the scour wave downstream the metrics of nse and r 2 between the simulated and observed flow depth and discharge is illustrated in table 3 while the computed results of both the present cncm and the model of campisano et al 2019 agree with the experimental data rather well the present cncm appears to perform appreciably better than campisano et al 2019 although the results fig 3 show that the cncm and campisano et al 2019 have similar performance in predicting flow discharge and water depth the two models differ significantly in reproducing the evolution of sediments fig 4 shows the longitudinal profile of bed deposits at the end of flushing indicating that the cncm performs better than campisano et al 2019 in solving the changes in erodible beds in particular the cncm better reproduces the deposit depths e g the upstream part of the channel before section s 450 and erosion segments e g s 500 s 650 and s 750 s 850 fairly good agreement between simulated and experimental sediment depths is achieved in the segments immediately downstream of the gates between s 150 and s 200 and between s 960 and s 980 where experimental sediment peaks were not correctly predicted by the cncm and campisano et al 2019 the deviations of the two models from the experimental data are illustrated by an nse of 0 4883 and 0 4478 for the cncm and campisano et al 2019 respectively the present cncm and campisano et al 2019 also yield reliable results in predicting the potential of flushing cleaning efficiency as shown in table 4 the cncm results show that the total amount of sediment flushed away from the downstream section of the gates between s 0 and s 1050 is 5 82 m3 difference between initial sediment of 27 09 m3 and final sediment of 21 27 m3 this value is larger than 5 29 m3 obtained by the field experiment shahsavari et al 2017 with relative error 10 02 in comparison campisano et al 2019 yielded a total volume of sediment removed by scour of 4 32 m3 with relative error 18 33 fig 5 shows the cumulated volume of sediment deposits due to the cncm and campisano et al 2019 for d 0 9 mm 0 9 mm d 2 mm 2 mm d 4 2 mm and d 4 2 mm both the cncm and campisano et al 2019 achieved results for sediment sizes with d 4 2 mm in fairly good agreement with observed data especially for the sediment with 2 mm d 4 2 mm the results of both models are in good agreement with the observed values however for fine grained sediment the deviation is relatively large because the ability of suspended sediment to reach capacity regime is overestimated as in the capacity model of campisano et al 2019 table 5 shows the statistical performance metrics for the cumulated volume of size specific sediment deposits for d 4 2 mm the performances of the cncm and campisano et al 2019 are virtually equivalent in terms of the metric r 2 but the cncm performs considerably better than campisano et al 2019 as far as the metric nse is concerned for d 4 2 mm the cncm gives reliable simulation results compared with observed data whilst it is noted that campisano et al 2019 do not give the cumulated volume of sediment for d 4 2 mm fundamentally the improved performances of the cncm over campisano et al 2019 is attributed to the decoupling and capacity assumption embedded in campisano et al 2019 and potentially the distinct numerical schemes used to solve the governing equations of both models 4 2 sensitivity to model parameters sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the effects of model parameters on the results in the cncm specifically three parameters local manning roughness n m empirical coefficient α and modification coefficient σ are tuned the local manning roughness n m is tuned by 0 005 from the value of 0 020 the coefficient α is tuned by 50 based on the value of 1 0 and the modification coefficient σ is doubled or halved on the value of 1 0 figs 6 8 illustrate the corresponding results it is demonstrated that the local manning roughness n m is the parameter influencing the hydrodynamics processes the most while the empirical coefficient α and modification coefficient σ have a considerable effect on the flow sediment exchange rate and the evolution of the sediment deposits as shown in fig 6 the water depth hydrograph is more sensitive to the local manning roughness than the flow discharge hydrograph the larger the local manning coefficient n m is the more pronounced the water level lift is the empirical coefficient α and the modification coefficient σ have a similar effect on flow sediment interaction i e the larger the coefficient the more violent the sediment scour and the greater the amount of bed evaluation as shown in figs 7 and 8 the sensitivity analysis facilitates understanding of the extent to which the empirical model parameters may affect the results in this connection it is essential to note that the 1d shsm model has recently been extended to address uncertainties arising from various sources li et al 2021a 2022 the emerging models are expected to provide enhanced quantification of the uncertainty of shallow water sediment flows over erodible beds 4 3 non capacity versus capacity coupled versus decoupled modelling 4 3 1 for field flushing experiment of shahsavari et al 2017 the three simplified models dncm ccm and dcm listed in table 1 are applied to the field experiment of shahsavari et al 2017 to investigate their performances in general for this particular flushing test of relatively short duration the three simplified models give results essentially equivalent to those of the cncm in satisfactory agreement with observed data this is clear in the discharge and water depth hydrographs shown in fig 9 it is thus implied that the assumptions of capacity transport and slow bed evolution are reasonable for this specific flushing case in this connection decoupled and capacity models are approximately applicable such as campaniso et al 2019 4 3 2 for designed sustained flushing in the field flushing experiment of shahsavari et al 2017 the flushing time was five hours and the flow discharge sharply reduced from a maximum of 3 9 m3 s 1 to 1 0 m3 s 1 after about 1 5 hours essentially this flushing case is characterized by weak bed deformation aggradation and degradation and short duration to reveal what would happen for flushing featuring strong bed deformation a sustained long duration flushing test is here with designed and investigated using the four models in table 1 except for the inflow conditions all are the same as those described in section 3 1 as per shahsavari et al 2017 the designed continuous flushing duration is set to last for 12 hours the inlet flow discharge is maintained at 3 0 m3 s 1 throughout the flushing processes and the inlet sediment concentration vanishes in addition a free outflow boundary is considered in order to be as consistent as possible with actual conditions the initial conditions of models are compatible with the initial requirements of exact measurements in subsection 3 2 fig 10 illustrates the longitudinal profile of bed deposits in the first 500 m due to the four models as downstream the first 500 m sediment deposits are indiscernible it is seen from fig 10 that the differences between the results of non capacity and capacity models either coupled or decoupled are considerable the results of coupled and uncoupled models either non capacity or capacity exhibit appreciable differences which nevertheless are less than the differences between capacity and non capacity models the afore stated finding concerning the differences between capacity and non capacity models and between coupled and decoupled models holds for the differences in terms of flow depth hydrographs fig 11 and the total amount of sediment that is transported through a cross section s 500 fig 12 the effects of the decoupling and capacity assumptions on flow discharge hydrographs are essentially negligible fig 11a c e fig 13 shows the constituent contributions of the three terms to water sediment flow mass conservation eq 1 where at qx and ast indicate the first and second terms on the lhs and the term on the rhs of eq 1 respectively perfect mass conservation occurs if the residual rm satisfies rm at qx ast 0 as shown in fig 13 the magnitude of ast is by no means negligible as compared to at therefore coupled modelling is warranted further the cumulated volumes of size specific sediment deposits from the four models fig 14 indicate that the differences between non capacity and capacity models become more pronounced as sediment size becomes finer and vice versa this actually arises from the distinct adaptation behaviour of suspended and bed loads both involved in this case as the rouse number varies widely from below 1 0 to far above 5 0 not shown following cao et al 2011 2016 for fluvial processes to elucidate the adaptation of differently sized sediments to capacity the computed sediment concentration from the cncm are compared against the nominal capacity c e i determined using local flow conditions fig 15 at selected sections s 50 s 100 s 200 and s 500 it can be seen that the sediment concentration generally deviates from the nominal capacity and the finer the sediment particle size the larger the deviation on the other hand with sediment exchange with the bed along the sewer the size specific sediment concentration will gradually approach nominal capacity it is also shown that the capacity of fine grain sediment will be restored slowly while the coarse grain sediment can reach the capacity regime more quickly physically the adaptation of sediment transport is determined by the sediment exchange rate with the bed surface and flow bedload normally coarse sediment exchange with the bed is usually much faster than that for the suspended load normally finer and the contribution by sediment laden flow to suspended transport is comparatively weak because β 1 for suspended transport wu 2007 greimann et al 2008 the present computational results in this concern for the sewer processes echo the finding for fluvial processes cao et al 2016 therefore it is characterized that non capacity models should be used not only for fluvial processes but also for sewer systems 4 3 3 flushing management practically it is interesting to probe into how and whether sediment deposits in sewer systems can completely flushed away the present modeling study facilitates an effective approach to solving this issue here two 48 hour continuous flushing cases are investigated using the four models summarized in table 1 in which the inlet flow discharge is maintained at 3 0 m3 s 1 and 4 5 m3 s 1 respectively fig 16 illustrates the cumulated volume of sediment deposits calculated by the four models it is shown that flushing can effectively carry sediment away from the channel and the higher the inlet flow discharge the more the sediment deposits carried away most notably the four models yield disparate processes of the residual sediment deposits though the final amount of residual sediment deposits depends primarily on the inlet flushing discharge the capacity models ccm and dcm overestimate the sediment transport rates leading to overcalculation of the flushing rate as compared against the cncm on the contrary decoupling in dncm ensures underestimation of the flushing rate in comparison with the cncm 4 3 4 computing efficiency a dell precision t7920 workstation with an intel xeon silver 4214 cpu is employed to run the four mathematical models as summarized in table 1 the computing time of each model is scaled by that of the cncm leading to a parameter of the relative computing time t r as given in table 6 it is shown that for the 5 hour field flushing experiment of shahsavari et al 2017 the time cost of cncm is discernibly longer than the other three simplified models less than 10 yet for the 48 hour designed case the computing times of the four models are essentially the same accordingly the cncm is recommended for general applications which is physically better based than the other three models in this regard with parallel computing techniques and acceleration strategies hu et al 2019 mathematical modeling for flow sediment bed processes in not only alluvial rivers but sewer systems should become more and more attractive 5 conclusions a coupled non capacity model cncm is presented for flow and non uniform sediment transport in sewer systems adapted from recently established shallow water hydro sediment morphodynamic models for fluvial processes the present cncm is tested against a field flushing experiment in paris s des coteaux catchment system shahsavari et al 2017 the computational results agree well with observed data appreciably more closely than a decoupled capacity model campisano et al 2019 indeed for a flushing process of short duration and weak bed deformation the differences between decoupled capacity models and the present coupled non capacity model are minor however they are more pronounced for sustained long duration flushing processes physically the adaptation of suspended sediments to capacity regime cannot be fulfilled quickly though bedload sediments can adapt to capacity regime instantly also the bed deformation rate is comparable to its counterpart of the flow depth consequently a coupled non capacity modelling paradigm is suggested for general applications to flushing in sewer systems just as for fluvial processes declaration of competing interest the
