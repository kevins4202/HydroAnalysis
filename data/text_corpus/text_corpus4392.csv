21960,large propeller lateral loads may be generated under oblique flow condition which is critical to the safety of stern tube bearing of a ship in the present study the effect of oblique flow on propeller lateral loads is numerically investigated based on urans method coupled with sst k ω turbulent model and sliding mesh method an 82 000 dwt bulk carrier with a single right handed screw is computed both open water and behind hull conditions are simulated for a range of drift angles from 20 to 20 the lateral loads in open water increase with the drift angle increasing in a slightly non linear trend however the behind hull results are quite different from that in open water at behind hull conditions the horizontal loads monotonously non linearly increase as the drift angle increases while the vertical loads peak at the 5 deg drift angle corresponding to the transverse flow coming from the portside in large drift angles the behind hull lateral loads reach a larger percentage of the axial loads compared with the open water results scale effect is also investigated by simulating the behind hull flows with three scales it is revealed that the increase in scales causes a slight decrease on the horizontal loads independently of drift angles while it causes a remarkable increase and decrease on the vertical components for positive and negative drift angles respectively keywords propeller lateral loads oblique flow urans scale effects thrust eccentricity 1 introduction traditionally the design of a marine propeller only considers straight sailing conditions where the propulsive loads thrust and torque are the main concern however propellers may operate in oblique flow in case the ship is performing a maneuver or encounters transverse currents or winds oblique flows affect not only the propeller propulsive performance but also the lateral loads the latter is the major source of the stern bearing load and it may exceed the design value when the drift angle is large and thus leads to a failure of the shaft system amini and steen 2011 experimentally show that the shaft bearing loads induced by the propeller lateral loads in oblique flow can reach three times larger than that caused only by the propeller weight recently the demand to understand the propeller lateral loads in oblique flow is strong especially for ships of which the shaft systems need to be optimized there have been some studies on the hydrodynamic performance of propellers in oblique flow many of them are focused on open water condition such as dubbioso et al 2013 2014 yao 2015 wang et al 2017 hou and hu 2018 etc these works revealed the increase of propeller loads in oblique flows and identified the important role of drift angle large lateral loads are observed from their results at large drift angles suggesting the necessity of taking into account propeller lateral loads in shaft system designs however in practice propellers operate at behind hull conditions where the inflow is complicated by the hull s wake according to xing et al 2012 nominal wakes are strongly affected by oblique flows thus the variations in the behind hull propeller lateral loads caused by oblique flows are expected to be more complicated therefore the oblique flow effect under behind hull conditions gains much interest in recent years ortolani et al 2015a 2015b experimentally investigated the in plane loads of a twin screw ship in oblique flow during maneuvering motions it was found that oblique flows can cause bearing loads more critical for twin screws than for single screws and the outer and inner propellers have noticeably different variations in lateral loads the outer propeller operates nearly in a pure oblique flow whereas the inflow of the inner propeller is significantly affected by the wake of the hull and appendages for the same twin screw the differences in the propeller lateral loads between inner and outer propellers are further analyzed by dubbioso et al 2017 and muscari et al 2017a based on numerical simulations their results reveal that the inner propeller may generate a severe lateral loads even at a small drift angle muscari et al 2017b numerically analyzed the effects of the stern appendages of a twin screw ship on the lateral loads in oblique flow they give a detailed discussion of the propeller wake interaction in terms of the propeller lateral loads ortolani and dubbioso 2019 experimentally studied the propeller lateral loads in terms of single blade loads for steady turning maneuvering in which they show big differences on the single blade loads between inner and outer propellers the study of ortolani et al 2018 shows propeller lateral loads are more sensitive to cavitation than axial loads and cavitation at full scale can cause a considerable increment of lateral loads they also carried out a preliminary analysis of scale effects on the propeller loads based on semi empirical methods a pure oblique flow test was carried out by ortolani et al 2020a against a twin screw ship they gives an interesting discussion on the discrepancies between the results of pure oblique flow and free turning it is found the discrepancies are different between the windward and leeward propellers due to their different characteristics of inflows in another paper ortolani et al 2020b they analyzed in detail how the propeller inflow affects its loads in pure oblique flow condition based on boroscopic based stereo piv spiv tests lee et al 2017 investigated the bearing loads of a contra rotating propellers system in a turning maneuver it shows that the lateral loads reach their peak when the ship is near the yaw rate peak and the extreme loads are about three times larger than the static loads there are also few researches on single screw ships sun et al 2018 investigated kcs at pure oblique flow condition for drift angle varying from 10 to 10 their results show drift angles have significant effects on the magnitudes and unsteady fluctuations of both axial and lateral loads vartdal et al 2009 illustrated measured lateral loads in practical operations for several types of vessels including vlcc very large crude carrier container vessel and lng liquefied natural gas vessel their work shows that it is quite necessary to take into account the shaft bearing loads in shaft alignment analysis and that the analysis of shaft bearing loads is a case by case problem estimates of propeller lateral loads are fundamental to the calculation of stern tube bearing loads and the analysis of shaft system performance in oblique flow however at present the shaft system design still has to rely on crude estimates of shaft bearing loads due to the limited knowledge of propeller lateral loads the aim of this work is to gain a better understanding of the propeller lateral loads in oblique flow of single screw ships to achieve this an 82 000 dwt bulk carrier with a single right handed screw is investigated urans method combined with sst k ω turbulent model and sliding mesh method is adopted both open water and behind hull simulations are carried out at various drift angles cfd result at straight ahead condition is compared with experimental data for validations the oblique flow effect on the propeller lateral loads is analyzed the nominal wakes at the propeller plane at various drift angles are also computed to reveal the hull propeller interaction in oblique flows scale effects are of significant importance for full scale predictions the extrapolation of axial loads from model to real scale ship at straight ahead sailing can be performed simply based on ittc international towing tank conference procedures however there is currently no extrapolation method for the propeller lateral loads especially at oblique flow condition mainly due to the quite limited knowledge on this topic in this study the scale effect on the propeller lateral loads is for the first time investigated in detail the behind hull simulations are run in three scales varying from model scales to the full scale analysis emphasizes the variations in the propeller lateral loads and the single blade loads with the scale increasing 2 geometries of the ship and propeller the ship investigated in this work is a bulk carrier of 82 000 dead weight tonnage dwt propelled by a single screw the geometries of the ship and propeller are shown in fig 1 and table 1 summarizes the principal dimensions of them in full scale the ship has a full hull form and a low design speed of 14 5 kts corresponding to the froude number of 0 157 for a rotating propeller its loads consist of six components in three axis directions i e three forces and three bending moments the definitions of the forces and moments are illustrated in fig 2 the origin of the axis is located at the propeller center the axis of x y and z are oriented to the forward port side and vertical directions respectively to describe these loads in non dimensionlized forms the coefficients are defined as follow k t x t x ρ n 2 d 4 k t y t y ρ n 2 d 4 k t z t z ρ n 2 d 4 1 k q x q x ρ n 2 d 5 k q y q y ρ n 2 d 5 k q z q z ρ n 2 d 5 where t is the hydrodynamic force acting on the propeller q is the hydrodynamic bending moment acting on the propeller ρ is the water density n is the propeller rotation rate d is the diameter of propeller the advance ratio of propeller is defined as 2 j u 0 n d where u 0 is the magnitude of incoming flow 3 methodology 3 1 numerical method the flow generated by rotating propeller can be modeled by the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations which can be written in tensor for incompressible fluid as 3 u i x i 0 4 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i x j ρ u i u j f i where i and j are the coordinate components u denotes the velocity ρ is the fluid density μ is the viscosity of fluid p is the pressure f is the body force ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress term which can be closed based on turbulent model the solution of the flows in this work is based on a commercial cfd code star ccm which has been commonly used in the marine industry krasilnikov 2013 gaggero et al 2014 vaz et al 2015 ponkratov and zegos 2015 lee et al 2017 usta and korkut 2018 zhang et al 2019 and proven to be a reliable numerical tool for analysis of marine hydrodynamics finite volume method fvm is adopted in star ccm to discretize the governing equations to closure the governing equations a two equation turbulent model sst k ω is used in this work the sst k ω model combines the k ε and k ω models together making it quite suitable for simulating flows with separation and strong adverse pressure gradients some researches show that advance turbulence models such as detached eddy simulation des and large eddy simulation les give better prediction on the velocities and vortices in the wake of hull xing et al 2007 2012 nevertheless the differences between the advanced turbulence models and sst k ω in predicting the propeller forces and hull resistance may be limited see mofidi et al 2015 considering the high computational cost sst k ω is suitable for this study the pressure velocity coupling is based on the simplec algorithm a second order implicit scheme is used for temporal discretization and five inner iterations are set for each time step a second order upwind scheme is used for the convective term the free surface is captured based on volume of fluid vof method further details of the numerical approaches can be found in the star ccm manuals cd adapco 2014 3 2 computational domain and grid system the computational domain is a cylinder for the open water and a cube for the behind hull condition the dimensions of the computational domains are depicted in fig 3 to handle the propeller rotation the sliding mesh method is used the grid is generated based on so called trimmed cell method available in star ccm which is able to produce unstructured hexahedral grid figs 4 and 5 show the grid systems for the open water and behind hull simulations respectively multiple refinement levels are used near the hull and blades to achieve a reasonable mesh distribution the finest meshes are distributed along with the leading and trailing edges of the blades a wedged region is used to refining the grid in open water simulation with the aim to take into account the propeller wake deflection caused by the oblique flow in self propulsion the propeller wake is refined with three cubes around the ship in addition the grid is refined along the vertical direction in the vicinity of the free surface to capture the wave pattern better prism meshes are generated on the surfaces of the hull and blades to improve the boundary flow computation the layer numbers of the prism mesh are eight and twelve for the hull and blades respectively the thickness of the first layer cell is restricted to satisfy the criteria of y 40 for the hull and y 1 for the blades 4 grid sensitivity and validation to evaluate the grid sensitivity simulations are carried out with three grids coarse medium and fine detail information about the grids is shown in table 2 to validate the numerical simulation model tests were carried out at hamburgische schiffbau versuchsanstalt gmbh hsva fig 6 shows the photos of the ship model used in experiment the hull and rudder is made of wood the scale ratio from model to ship is λ 29 33 in order to trigger the turbulent flow around the hull two 60 mm sand stripe were fitted on the bow the propeller is made of aluminum both open water and self propulsion tests are carried out in towing tank of hsva for open water test the rotational speed of propeller is set as 22 9 revolutions per second rps fig 7 shows the open water characteristics obtained by the model test and cfd simulations with different grids a good agreement is observed between the experimental and numerical results for all the advance ratios considered though the thrust and torque at high advance ratios are slightly underestimated the results based on the three grids are quite close showing a low grid sensitivity the behind hull results with different grids are summarized in table 3 they are also compared with experimental data note that only the design speed is computed the propeller rotational speed in computation is set equal to the experimental measured data i e n 6 39 rps thus the ship in the simulation is not exactly at the self propulsion point since the skin friction correction sfc may be not equal to the expected one as we mainly focus on the propeller loads rather than the self propulsion factors it is appropriate to use the same propeller rotation speed as the experiment the rotation speed n 6 39 rps is also used in the following pure oblique flow simulations time step is set as δ t 1 300 n where n is the rotational speed of the propeller corresponding to a rotation angle of 1 2 in each time step to show the time step size is reasonable fig 8 gives a snapshot of the courant number on the blade surfaces it is seen the courant numbers are small on the most blade surface except in the vicinity of the leading edges where the maximum courant numbers amount to 2 at few cells nevertheless the courant numbers at the interfaces of the sliding meshes are lower than 1 implying the time step size used is acceptable the grid uncertainty in table 3 is defined as roache 1997 5 u g f s s 2 s 1 r g p 1 p ln r g ln r g r g s 2 s 1 s 3 s 2 where s 1 s 2 and s 3 correspond to the solutions with fine medium and coarse grids respectively r g is the refinement factor of grids fs is the safety factor whose value depends on the number of meshes used in sensitivity analysis fs is typically 1 25 when three or more meshes are used the agreement between the experimental and numerical results in table 3 is generally satisfactory though the cfd simulations underestimate the propeller loads and hull resistance the grid uncertainties of table 3 are acceptable the torque shows a less grid sensitivity with respect to the thrust and ship resistance the validations are only carried out for the straight ahead condition due to the lack of reliable experimental data for oblique flow it should be pointed out that the grid uncertainty in oblique flow conditions may be larger than in straight ahead condition since the hull s wake in obloquie flow is more complicated considering the grid sensitivities of the open water and behind hull results and the acceptable computational cost the medium grids are adopted for the following simulations of the oblique flow conditions 5 analysis of oblique flow effect in this section the effect of oblique flow on the propeller lateral loads is analyzed for open water and behind hull conditions to obtain the trend of the propeller lateral loads with the drift angle pure oblique flow simulation is carried out where the inclination of the inflow is implemented by imposing longitudinal and transverse velocities on the boundaries of the computational domain the components of the inflow are computed according to the drift angle see fig 9 for the sketch of the setup of the oblique flow condition where ϕ is the drift angle and u 0 is the magnitude of inflow which is obtained according to the advance ratio for open water and is equal to the design speed of ship for the behind hull condition u x is the longitudinal velocity and u y is the transverse velocity as seen u y 0 corresponds to the positive drift angle the pure oblique flow strategy allows to get insight to the variation trend of the propeller loads with drift angle thus is commonly adopted in oblique flow computations hou and hu 2018 wang et al 2017 dubbioso et al 2013 2014 gaggero et al 2019 sun et al 2018 a large range of drift angles are considered from 20 to 20 with an interval of 5 it should be pointed out that the ship will not keep its speed constant during a turning maneuver with the drift angle increasing in practice the ship speed as well as the propeller rotating speed will reduce increasingly when the drift angle is increasing thus a turning maneuver motion is substantially a transient flow simulating the turning behavior directly however is quite time consuming since it will take a long time for the ship to accomplish the whole turning while a small time step must be used to match the propeller rotation during the turning in this context the pure oblique flow considerably simplifies the simulation 5 1 open water simulations the flow fields are considered to be symmetric for positive and negative drift angles in open water condition and therefore only positive drift angles need to be considered in the open water simulations as the advance ratio at the design speed is around j 0 588 an advance ratio of j 0 6 is considered here as a typical loading condition fig 10 shows the hydrodynamic loads of the propeller in a function of drift angle it is seen that the propeller loads monotonously increases with the increase of drift angle and the variation in the propeller loads is slightly non linear especially for the axial loads it is also clear seen the lateral loads are the resultants of oblique flow since they are close to zero at straight ahead sailing the horizontal components are relatively larger compared with the vertical components and oriented to the same direction of the inflow the lateral moments amounts to a considerable percentage of the torques up to 40 at 20 deg drift angle the main reason causing the axial loads increase in oblique flow is that the axial inflow of the propeller decreases thus leading to a lower practical advance ratio the increments of the thrust and torque at the 20 deg drift angle are 12 0 and 9 1 with respect to those at the 0 deg drift angle this implies that the propeller can absorb more power while operating in oblique flow this is consistent with the findings of dubbioso et al 2013 2014 yao 2015 wang et al 2017 and hou and hu 2018 5 2 hull s nominal wake in oblique flow unlike open water where the inflow is uniform the inflow of a behind hull propeller is non uniform due to the wake generated by the hull therefore before analyzing the propeller loads at behind hull conditions it is necessary to gain insight into the effect of oblique flow on hull s wake this section focuses the hull s nominal wakes at the propeller plane at different drift angles like in the open water cases only positive drift angles are considered due to the symmetry of the flow field fig 11 shows the velocities at the propeller plane obtained numerically for various drift angles the wake at 0 deg drift angle has a hooklike shape pattern which is mainly caused by the bilge vortex and commonly observed in the case of full hull form bull 2005 xing et al 2007 in oblique flow the bilge vortex disappears on the upwind side and becomes larger and stronger on the leeward side fig 12 shows a 3d view of the vortex structure at 20 deg drift angle where the skeg vortices are also clearly observed the bilge vortex deflects evidently with the drift angle the high wake fraction low axial velocity region mainly concentrated from 10 to 12 o clock above the propeller center at 0 deg drift angle while it becomes weaker and deflected by the oblique flow it should be pointed out that the two equation turbulence model sst k ω may produce a weakened vortical field in oblique flow condition with respect to advanced turbulence models such as des and les however this work does not analyze the turbulence model sensitivity as its main focus is the variation of propeller loads with drift angle 5 3 behind hull simulations in this section the propeller lateral loads at behind hull condition are analyzed as the flow fields are no longer symmetric both positive and negative drift angles are computed the magnitude of the inflow is equal to the ship speed and the rotation speed of the propeller is fixed at n 6 39 rps consistent with the measured value of the experiment like the open water simulations a range of drift angles from 20 to 20 with an interval of 5 is computed it should be mentioned that the ship may be not at the exact self propulsion point in the behind hull computations as the oblique flow affects the propeller loads and ship resistance in realistic operative scenarios the ship speed propeller rps and drift angle interact with each other the relationship between them is quite complicated for instance the ship speed and propeller rps during a turning maneuvering will decrease remarkably with the drift angle increasing however the decrease of propeller rps is dependent on the propeller hydrodynamic loads and the power limitation of the engine therefore it is difficult to simulate the problem strictly consistent with realistic situations to simplify the problem the behind hull simulations are carried out at pure oblique flow condition where only the drift angle varies the design speed is considered as a typical speed for the bulk carrier computed the drift angles caused by side winds or currents will not be large at the design speed the range of 20 to 20 deg drift angles is considered to be able to cover most typical situations the behind hull hydrodynamic loads of the propeller at different drift angles are plotted in fig 13 and a comparison of the ratios of lateral loads to axial loads between open water and behind hull condition is given in fig 14 the variations in the behind hull lateral loads are much different from the open water results except the horizontal components are still in the same direction of the inflow the vertical loads show peaks at 5 deg drift angle while the variation of the horizontal components is strongly non linear the behind hull lateral moments are also considerable at large drift angles amounts to 47 of the torque for the 20 deg drift angle and 87 for the 20 deg drift angle much larger than that in open water this implies that the hull s wake effect must be taken into account in estimation of the shaft performance in oblique flow the horizontal moment is related to the load unbalance between the top and bottom halves of the propeller disk which however is affected by the transverse flow induced by the oblique flow to explain the mechanism pressure distributions on the blade surfaces are shown in fig 15 where the pressure coefficient c p is defined as 6 c p p p 0 1 2 ρ u 0 2 where p 0 is the static pressure it is seen in fig 15 that as the drift angle increases the blade load decreases when the blade is rotating below the propeller center but increases when it is rotating above the propeller center this phenomenon can also be clearly seen from the time histories of single blade thrusts in one revolution shown in fig 16 where the blade thrusts of 180 deg phase angle decrease remarkably with the drift angle increasing note that the phase angle of 0 corresponds to the twelve o clock position see fig 17 it is also seen from fig 16 that the oblique flow has a larger effect on the blade load below the propeller center than that above the propeller center and that the amplitudes of blade load fluctuation increase with the magnitude of drift angle increasing another difference in lateral moments between the open water and behind hull results is that a downwards bending moment is observed at the behind hull condition at the 0 deg drift angle this is due to the top bottom asymmetry of the inflow at the propeller plane see fig 11 a when the blade is passing through the high wake fraction region it is in a higher load therefore for the full hull forms which may results in strong wakes the bending moment at straight ahead conditions should also be taken into account in the shaft alignment computation in the design stage the vertical bending moment is related to the load unbalance between the left and right halves of the propeller disk which is a result of the tradeoff between the effects of the axial and tangential velocities in straight ahead sailing the attack angles of blades are larger on the starboard side as the tangential velocity of the starboard side is opposite to the blade rotation this results in a higher load on the starboard half of the disk than on the port side half leading to a positive vertical moment at 0 deg drift angle in oblique flow the asymmetric axial inflow also generates vertical moments at small negative drift angles the left right load unbalance is strengthened as the high wakes moves towards the starboard side different from the open water results the behind hull torques and thrusts show their peaks at the drift angle of 5 and the negative drift angles show generally larger axial loads compared with the positive drift angles the reason for the asymmetric axial load curves is that the existence of the hull weakens the oblique effect and its weakening effect is stronger above the propeller center than below the propeller center this can be seen from the tangential velocity distribution in fig 11 a similar asymmetry phenomenon is observed in the experimental results of amini and steen 2011 where the axial load curves of a podded propeller are asymmetric with respect to drift angles at push mode but symmetric on pull mode they contributed this to the effect of the strut fig 18 shows the wave patterns of three typical drift angles asymmetric kelvin waves are clearly seen however the wave elevations near the stern of the three cases are similar this is mainly because the propeller submergence at the design draft is deep that the interaction between the blades and free surface is negligible 5 4 thrust eccentricity analysis at oblique flow condition the center of propeller thrust force moves away from the propeller center due to lateral bending moments the thrust eccentricity is relevant to shaft alignment in this section the oblique flow effect on thrust eccentricity is analyzed here the shifting of the thrust force center is defined as 7 δ y q z t x δ z q y t x only the behind hull condition is considered here since the hull wake effect must be taken into account for thrust eccentricity analysis fig 19 illustrates the locations of the thrust center on the propeller disk in the percentage of the propeller diameter for different drift angles the eccentric phenomenon of the propeller thrust is evident even though at the straight sailing condition the thrust center is not at the propeller center due to the hull wake as seen in section 5 3 a considerable positive vertical bending moment is generated at the zero drift angle causing the thrust center move to the starboard side the oblique flow effect on the thrust center shifting is remarkable it is seen the thrust center location moves upward as the drift angle increases therefore the thrust center locates at the first quadrant for the positive drift angles while at the third quadrants for the larger negative drift angles 6 analysis of scale effect the effect of scale on hull s wakes and propeller axial loads has been investigated by castro et al 2011 wang et al 2015 and wang et al 2016 however it is still unknown how scales affect the lateral loads of a propeller in oblique flow for this the scale effect is analyzed in this section due to the lack of available data measured at full scale the strategy of the scale analysis is to perform the simulations with three scale ratios which consists of the model scale λ 29 33 a medium scale λ 15 and the full scale λ 1 by varying the scale ratio we can obtain the trend of the propeller lateral loads as the model scale has been discussed in section 5 only the scales of λ 15 and 1 need to be computed additionally to reduce the computational cost the drift angle is varied with a large interval of 10 the mesh refinements for the scales of λ 15 and 1 are similar to that at the model scale however the sizes of the surface mesh and boundary layer mesh on the hull and blades are adjusted according to reynolds number the cell numbers for the medium and full scale simulations are 8 12 million and 8 95 million respectively fig 20 shows the propeller loads at different scales and drift angles it is seen the axial loads are more sensitive to the drift angle at large scales than at the model scale at 0 deg drift angle the thrust and torque decrease as the scale increases similar phenomena are observed in castro et al 2011 and wang et al 2016 where the international container ship kcs is computed the reason for this is that the boundary layer is thinner in large scales than in the model scale fig 21 compares the axial velocities in the propeller disk between different scales the difference in the boundary layer thickness and wake factor is evident for the lateral loads the scale effects are different between the horizontal and vertical components the horizontal loads decrease as the scale increases independently of drift angle in contrast the variations in the vertical loads of fig 20 are strongly dependent on the drift angle with the scale increasing the vertical loads increase when the drift angle is positive while they decrease for negative drift angles at 0 deg drift angle the scale effect on vertical loads is quite slight this is because that the variation of scale does not affect the left right symmetry of the hull s wake though it has significant effects on the magnitude of the axial velocities see fig 21 fig 22 gives the time histories of single blade loads of the three scales in one revolution it can be seen that the scale effects vary with the blade phase angle the single blade load is sensitive to scales around the blade phase angles of 45 deg for negative drift angles and 45 deg i e 315 deg for positive drift angles fig 23 illustrates the thrust force centers at different scales and drift angles it shows the centers are more scattered with respect to the middle line plane in the full scale than in the model scale it is also seen the scale effect on thrust eccentricity is more evident at positive drift angles than at negative drift angles 7 conclusions the aim of this paper is to gain a better understanding of propeller lateral loads under oblique flow conditions to achieve this numerical simulations are carried out against a single screw bulk carrier in oblique flow the computed drift angle covers a range of 20 to 20 both open water and behind hull conditions are computed the difference between the open water and behind hull results and the underlying mechanism are analyzed in detail in addition scale effect is discussed by running the behind hull simulations with three scale ratios i e λ 29 33 15 and 1 the results show i the effect of oblique flow on the propeller lateral loads is large in open water the lateral loads increase with the increase of drift angle in a slightly non linear trend however the behind hull lateral loads show remarkably different trends for the horizontal and vertical components due to the effect of the hull s wake the horizontal loads increase monotonously and nonlinearly with the drift angle increasing whereas the vertical loads peak at the drift angle of 5 with respect to the open water results the lateral loads at behind hull condition can reach a larger percentage of the axial loads ii the oblique flow has larger effects on the blade loads in the bottom half of the propeller disk compared with the top half iii the scale effects on the horizontal and vertical loads are different specifically the horizontal loads slightly decrease as the scale increases independently of the drift angle however the vertical loads are sensitive to the scale at large drift angles as the scale increases the vertical loads increase at positive drift angles and decrease at negative drift angles declaration of competing interest we

21960,large propeller lateral loads may be generated under oblique flow condition which is critical to the safety of stern tube bearing of a ship in the present study the effect of oblique flow on propeller lateral loads is numerically investigated based on urans method coupled with sst k ω turbulent model and sliding mesh method an 82 000 dwt bulk carrier with a single right handed screw is computed both open water and behind hull conditions are simulated for a range of drift angles from 20 to 20 the lateral loads in open water increase with the drift angle increasing in a slightly non linear trend however the behind hull results are quite different from that in open water at behind hull conditions the horizontal loads monotonously non linearly increase as the drift angle increases while the vertical loads peak at the 5 deg drift angle corresponding to the transverse flow coming from the portside in large drift angles the behind hull lateral loads reach a larger percentage of the axial loads compared with the open water results scale effect is also investigated by simulating the behind hull flows with three scales it is revealed that the increase in scales causes a slight decrease on the horizontal loads independently of drift angles while it causes a remarkable increase and decrease on the vertical components for positive and negative drift angles respectively keywords propeller lateral loads oblique flow urans scale effects thrust eccentricity 1 introduction traditionally the design of a marine propeller only considers straight sailing conditions where the propulsive loads thrust and torque are the main concern however propellers may operate in oblique flow in case the ship is performing a maneuver or encounters transverse currents or winds oblique flows affect not only the propeller propulsive performance but also the lateral loads the latter is the major source of the stern bearing load and it may exceed the design value when the drift angle is large and thus leads to a failure of the shaft system amini and steen 2011 experimentally show that the shaft bearing loads induced by the propeller lateral loads in oblique flow can reach three times larger than that caused only by the propeller weight recently the demand to understand the propeller lateral loads in oblique flow is strong especially for ships of which the shaft systems need to be optimized there have been some studies on the hydrodynamic performance of propellers in oblique flow many of them are focused on open water condition such as dubbioso et al 2013 2014 yao 2015 wang et al 2017 hou and hu 2018 etc these works revealed the increase of propeller loads in oblique flows and identified the important role of drift angle large lateral loads are observed from their results at large drift angles suggesting the necessity of taking into account propeller lateral loads in shaft system designs however in practice propellers operate at behind hull conditions where the inflow is complicated by the hull s wake according to xing et al 2012 nominal wakes are strongly affected by oblique flows thus the variations in the behind hull propeller lateral loads caused by oblique flows are expected to be more complicated therefore the oblique flow effect under behind hull conditions gains much interest in recent years ortolani et al 2015a 2015b experimentally investigated the in plane loads of a twin screw ship in oblique flow during maneuvering motions it was found that oblique flows can cause bearing loads more critical for twin screws than for single screws and the outer and inner propellers have noticeably different variations in lateral loads the outer propeller operates nearly in a pure oblique flow whereas the inflow of the inner propeller is significantly affected by the wake of the hull and appendages for the same twin screw the differences in the propeller lateral loads between inner and outer propellers are further analyzed by dubbioso et al 2017 and muscari et al 2017a based on numerical simulations their results reveal that the inner propeller may generate a severe lateral loads even at a small drift angle muscari et al 2017b numerically analyzed the effects of the stern appendages of a twin screw ship on the lateral loads in oblique flow they give a detailed discussion of the propeller wake interaction in terms of the propeller lateral loads ortolani and dubbioso 2019 experimentally studied the propeller lateral loads in terms of single blade loads for steady turning maneuvering in which they show big differences on the single blade loads between inner and outer propellers the study of ortolani et al 2018 shows propeller lateral loads are more sensitive to cavitation than axial loads and cavitation at full scale can cause a considerable increment of lateral loads they also carried out a preliminary analysis of scale effects on the propeller loads based on semi empirical methods a pure oblique flow test was carried out by ortolani et al 2020a against a twin screw ship they gives an interesting discussion on the discrepancies between the results of pure oblique flow and free turning it is found the discrepancies are different between the windward and leeward propellers due to their different characteristics of inflows in another paper ortolani et al 2020b they analyzed in detail how the propeller inflow affects its loads in pure oblique flow condition based on boroscopic based stereo piv spiv tests lee et al 2017 investigated the bearing loads of a contra rotating propellers system in a turning maneuver it shows that the lateral loads reach their peak when the ship is near the yaw rate peak and the extreme loads are about three times larger than the static loads there are also few researches on single screw ships sun et al 2018 investigated kcs at pure oblique flow condition for drift angle varying from 10 to 10 their results show drift angles have significant effects on the magnitudes and unsteady fluctuations of both axial and lateral loads vartdal et al 2009 illustrated measured lateral loads in practical operations for several types of vessels including vlcc very large crude carrier container vessel and lng liquefied natural gas vessel their work shows that it is quite necessary to take into account the shaft bearing loads in shaft alignment analysis and that the analysis of shaft bearing loads is a case by case problem estimates of propeller lateral loads are fundamental to the calculation of stern tube bearing loads and the analysis of shaft system performance in oblique flow however at present the shaft system design still has to rely on crude estimates of shaft bearing loads due to the limited knowledge of propeller lateral loads the aim of this work is to gain a better understanding of the propeller lateral loads in oblique flow of single screw ships to achieve this an 82 000 dwt bulk carrier with a single right handed screw is investigated urans method combined with sst k ω turbulent model and sliding mesh method is adopted both open water and behind hull simulations are carried out at various drift angles cfd result at straight ahead condition is compared with experimental data for validations the oblique flow effect on the propeller lateral loads is analyzed the nominal wakes at the propeller plane at various drift angles are also computed to reveal the hull propeller interaction in oblique flows scale effects are of significant importance for full scale predictions the extrapolation of axial loads from model to real scale ship at straight ahead sailing can be performed simply based on ittc international towing tank conference procedures however there is currently no extrapolation method for the propeller lateral loads especially at oblique flow condition mainly due to the quite limited knowledge on this topic in this study the scale effect on the propeller lateral loads is for the first time investigated in detail the behind hull simulations are run in three scales varying from model scales to the full scale analysis emphasizes the variations in the propeller lateral loads and the single blade loads with the scale increasing 2 geometries of the ship and propeller the ship investigated in this work is a bulk carrier of 82 000 dead weight tonnage dwt propelled by a single screw the geometries of the ship and propeller are shown in fig 1 and table 1 summarizes the principal dimensions of them in full scale the ship has a full hull form and a low design speed of 14 5 kts corresponding to the froude number of 0 157 for a rotating propeller its loads consist of six components in three axis directions i e three forces and three bending moments the definitions of the forces and moments are illustrated in fig 2 the origin of the axis is located at the propeller center the axis of x y and z are oriented to the forward port side and vertical directions respectively to describe these loads in non dimensionlized forms the coefficients are defined as follow k t x t x ρ n 2 d 4 k t y t y ρ n 2 d 4 k t z t z ρ n 2 d 4 1 k q x q x ρ n 2 d 5 k q y q y ρ n 2 d 5 k q z q z ρ n 2 d 5 where t is the hydrodynamic force acting on the propeller q is the hydrodynamic bending moment acting on the propeller ρ is the water density n is the propeller rotation rate d is the diameter of propeller the advance ratio of propeller is defined as 2 j u 0 n d where u 0 is the magnitude of incoming flow 3 methodology 3 1 numerical method the flow generated by rotating propeller can be modeled by the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations which can be written in tensor for incompressible fluid as 3 u i x i 0 4 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i x j ρ u i u j f i where i and j are the coordinate components u denotes the velocity ρ is the fluid density μ is the viscosity of fluid p is the pressure f is the body force ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress term which can be closed based on turbulent model the solution of the flows in this work is based on a commercial cfd code star ccm which has been commonly used in the marine industry krasilnikov 2013 gaggero et al 2014 vaz et al 2015 ponkratov and zegos 2015 lee et al 2017 usta and korkut 2018 zhang et al 2019 and proven to be a reliable numerical tool for analysis of marine hydrodynamics finite volume method fvm is adopted in star ccm to discretize the governing equations to closure the governing equations a two equation turbulent model sst k ω is used in this work the sst k ω model combines the k ε and k ω models together making it quite suitable for simulating flows with separation and strong adverse pressure gradients some researches show that advance turbulence models such as detached eddy simulation des and large eddy simulation les give better prediction on the velocities and vortices in the wake of hull xing et al 2007 2012 nevertheless the differences between the advanced turbulence models and sst k ω in predicting the propeller forces and hull resistance may be limited see mofidi et al 2015 considering the high computational cost sst k ω is suitable for this study the pressure velocity coupling is based on the simplec algorithm a second order implicit scheme is used for temporal discretization and five inner iterations are set for each time step a second order upwind scheme is used for the convective term the free surface is captured based on volume of fluid vof method further details of the numerical approaches can be found in the star ccm manuals cd adapco 2014 3 2 computational domain and grid system the computational domain is a cylinder for the open water and a cube for the behind hull condition the dimensions of the computational domains are depicted in fig 3 to handle the propeller rotation the sliding mesh method is used the grid is generated based on so called trimmed cell method available in star ccm which is able to produce unstructured hexahedral grid figs 4 and 5 show the grid systems for the open water and behind hull simulations respectively multiple refinement levels are used near the hull and blades to achieve a reasonable mesh distribution the finest meshes are distributed along with the leading and trailing edges of the blades a wedged region is used to refining the grid in open water simulation with the aim to take into account the propeller wake deflection caused by the oblique flow in self propulsion the propeller wake is refined with three cubes around the ship in addition the grid is refined along the vertical direction in the vicinity of the free surface to capture the wave pattern better prism meshes are generated on the surfaces of the hull and blades to improve the boundary flow computation the layer numbers of the prism mesh are eight and twelve for the hull and blades respectively the thickness of the first layer cell is restricted to satisfy the criteria of y 40 for the hull and y 1 for the blades 4 grid sensitivity and validation to evaluate the grid sensitivity simulations are carried out with three grids coarse medium and fine detail information about the grids is shown in table 2 to validate the numerical simulation model tests were carried out at hamburgische schiffbau versuchsanstalt gmbh hsva fig 6 shows the photos of the ship model used in experiment the hull and rudder is made of wood the scale ratio from model to ship is λ 29 33 in order to trigger the turbulent flow around the hull two 60 mm sand stripe were fitted on the bow the propeller is made of aluminum both open water and self propulsion tests are carried out in towing tank of hsva for open water test the rotational speed of propeller is set as 22 9 revolutions per second rps fig 7 shows the open water characteristics obtained by the model test and cfd simulations with different grids a good agreement is observed between the experimental and numerical results for all the advance ratios considered though the thrust and torque at high advance ratios are slightly underestimated the results based on the three grids are quite close showing a low grid sensitivity the behind hull results with different grids are summarized in table 3 they are also compared with experimental data note that only the design speed is computed the propeller rotational speed in computation is set equal to the experimental measured data i e n 6 39 rps thus the ship in the simulation is not exactly at the self propulsion point since the skin friction correction sfc may be not equal to the expected one as we mainly focus on the propeller loads rather than the self propulsion factors it is appropriate to use the same propeller rotation speed as the experiment the rotation speed n 6 39 rps is also used in the following pure oblique flow simulations time step is set as δ t 1 300 n where n is the rotational speed of the propeller corresponding to a rotation angle of 1 2 in each time step to show the time step size is reasonable fig 8 gives a snapshot of the courant number on the blade surfaces it is seen the courant numbers are small on the most blade surface except in the vicinity of the leading edges where the maximum courant numbers amount to 2 at few cells nevertheless the courant numbers at the interfaces of the sliding meshes are lower than 1 implying the time step size used is acceptable the grid uncertainty in table 3 is defined as roache 1997 5 u g f s s 2 s 1 r g p 1 p ln r g ln r g r g s 2 s 1 s 3 s 2 where s 1 s 2 and s 3 correspond to the solutions with fine medium and coarse grids respectively r g is the refinement factor of grids fs is the safety factor whose value depends on the number of meshes used in sensitivity analysis fs is typically 1 25 when three or more meshes are used the agreement between the experimental and numerical results in table 3 is generally satisfactory though the cfd simulations underestimate the propeller loads and hull resistance the grid uncertainties of table 3 are acceptable the torque shows a less grid sensitivity with respect to the thrust and ship resistance the validations are only carried out for the straight ahead condition due to the lack of reliable experimental data for oblique flow it should be pointed out that the grid uncertainty in oblique flow conditions may be larger than in straight ahead condition since the hull s wake in obloquie flow is more complicated considering the grid sensitivities of the open water and behind hull results and the acceptable computational cost the medium grids are adopted for the following simulations of the oblique flow conditions 5 analysis of oblique flow effect in this section the effect of oblique flow on the propeller lateral loads is analyzed for open water and behind hull conditions to obtain the trend of the propeller lateral loads with the drift angle pure oblique flow simulation is carried out where the inclination of the inflow is implemented by imposing longitudinal and transverse velocities on the boundaries of the computational domain the components of the inflow are computed according to the drift angle see fig 9 for the sketch of the setup of the oblique flow condition where ϕ is the drift angle and u 0 is the magnitude of inflow which is obtained according to the advance ratio for open water and is equal to the design speed of ship for the behind hull condition u x is the longitudinal velocity and u y is the transverse velocity as seen u y 0 corresponds to the positive drift angle the pure oblique flow strategy allows to get insight to the variation trend of the propeller loads with drift angle thus is commonly adopted in oblique flow computations hou and hu 2018 wang et al 2017 dubbioso et al 2013 2014 gaggero et al 2019 sun et al 2018 a large range of drift angles are considered from 20 to 20 with an interval of 5 it should be pointed out that the ship will not keep its speed constant during a turning maneuver with the drift angle increasing in practice the ship speed as well as the propeller rotating speed will reduce increasingly when the drift angle is increasing thus a turning maneuver motion is substantially a transient flow simulating the turning behavior directly however is quite time consuming since it will take a long time for the ship to accomplish the whole turning while a small time step must be used to match the propeller rotation during the turning in this context the pure oblique flow considerably simplifies the simulation 5 1 open water simulations the flow fields are considered to be symmetric for positive and negative drift angles in open water condition and therefore only positive drift angles need to be considered in the open water simulations as the advance ratio at the design speed is around j 0 588 an advance ratio of j 0 6 is considered here as a typical loading condition fig 10 shows the hydrodynamic loads of the propeller in a function of drift angle it is seen that the propeller loads monotonously increases with the increase of drift angle and the variation in the propeller loads is slightly non linear especially for the axial loads it is also clear seen the lateral loads are the resultants of oblique flow since they are close to zero at straight ahead sailing the horizontal components are relatively larger compared with the vertical components and oriented to the same direction of the inflow the lateral moments amounts to a considerable percentage of the torques up to 40 at 20 deg drift angle the main reason causing the axial loads increase in oblique flow is that the axial inflow of the propeller decreases thus leading to a lower practical advance ratio the increments of the thrust and torque at the 20 deg drift angle are 12 0 and 9 1 with respect to those at the 0 deg drift angle this implies that the propeller can absorb more power while operating in oblique flow this is consistent with the findings of dubbioso et al 2013 2014 yao 2015 wang et al 2017 and hou and hu 2018 5 2 hull s nominal wake in oblique flow unlike open water where the inflow is uniform the inflow of a behind hull propeller is non uniform due to the wake generated by the hull therefore before analyzing the propeller loads at behind hull conditions it is necessary to gain insight into the effect of oblique flow on hull s wake this section focuses the hull s nominal wakes at the propeller plane at different drift angles like in the open water cases only positive drift angles are considered due to the symmetry of the flow field fig 11 shows the velocities at the propeller plane obtained numerically for various drift angles the wake at 0 deg drift angle has a hooklike shape pattern which is mainly caused by the bilge vortex and commonly observed in the case of full hull form bull 2005 xing et al 2007 in oblique flow the bilge vortex disappears on the upwind side and becomes larger and stronger on the leeward side fig 12 shows a 3d view of the vortex structure at 20 deg drift angle where the skeg vortices are also clearly observed the bilge vortex deflects evidently with the drift angle the high wake fraction low axial velocity region mainly concentrated from 10 to 12 o clock above the propeller center at 0 deg drift angle while it becomes weaker and deflected by the oblique flow it should be pointed out that the two equation turbulence model sst k ω may produce a weakened vortical field in oblique flow condition with respect to advanced turbulence models such as des and les however this work does not analyze the turbulence model sensitivity as its main focus is the variation of propeller loads with drift angle 5 3 behind hull simulations in this section the propeller lateral loads at behind hull condition are analyzed as the flow fields are no longer symmetric both positive and negative drift angles are computed the magnitude of the inflow is equal to the ship speed and the rotation speed of the propeller is fixed at n 6 39 rps consistent with the measured value of the experiment like the open water simulations a range of drift angles from 20 to 20 with an interval of 5 is computed it should be mentioned that the ship may be not at the exact self propulsion point in the behind hull computations as the oblique flow affects the propeller loads and ship resistance in realistic operative scenarios the ship speed propeller rps and drift angle interact with each other the relationship between them is quite complicated for instance the ship speed and propeller rps during a turning maneuvering will decrease remarkably with the drift angle increasing however the decrease of propeller rps is dependent on the propeller hydrodynamic loads and the power limitation of the engine therefore it is difficult to simulate the problem strictly consistent with realistic situations to simplify the problem the behind hull simulations are carried out at pure oblique flow condition where only the drift angle varies the design speed is considered as a typical speed for the bulk carrier computed the drift angles caused by side winds or currents will not be large at the design speed the range of 20 to 20 deg drift angles is considered to be able to cover most typical situations the behind hull hydrodynamic loads of the propeller at different drift angles are plotted in fig 13 and a comparison of the ratios of lateral loads to axial loads between open water and behind hull condition is given in fig 14 the variations in the behind hull lateral loads are much different from the open water results except the horizontal components are still in the same direction of the inflow the vertical loads show peaks at 5 deg drift angle while the variation of the horizontal components is strongly non linear the behind hull lateral moments are also considerable at large drift angles amounts to 47 of the torque for the 20 deg drift angle and 87 for the 20 deg drift angle much larger than that in open water this implies that the hull s wake effect must be taken into account in estimation of the shaft performance in oblique flow the horizontal moment is related to the load unbalance between the top and bottom halves of the propeller disk which however is affected by the transverse flow induced by the oblique flow to explain the mechanism pressure distributions on the blade surfaces are shown in fig 15 where the pressure coefficient c p is defined as 6 c p p p 0 1 2 ρ u 0 2 where p 0 is the static pressure it is seen in fig 15 that as the drift angle increases the blade load decreases when the blade is rotating below the propeller center but increases when it is rotating above the propeller center this phenomenon can also be clearly seen from the time histories of single blade thrusts in one revolution shown in fig 16 where the blade thrusts of 180 deg phase angle decrease remarkably with the drift angle increasing note that the phase angle of 0 corresponds to the twelve o clock position see fig 17 it is also seen from fig 16 that the oblique flow has a larger effect on the blade load below the propeller center than that above the propeller center and that the amplitudes of blade load fluctuation increase with the magnitude of drift angle increasing another difference in lateral moments between the open water and behind hull results is that a downwards bending moment is observed at the behind hull condition at the 0 deg drift angle this is due to the top bottom asymmetry of the inflow at the propeller plane see fig 11 a when the blade is passing through the high wake fraction region it is in a higher load therefore for the full hull forms which may results in strong wakes the bending moment at straight ahead conditions should also be taken into account in the shaft alignment computation in the design stage the vertical bending moment is related to the load unbalance between the left and right halves of the propeller disk which is a result of the tradeoff between the effects of the axial and tangential velocities in straight ahead sailing the attack angles of blades are larger on the starboard side as the tangential velocity of the starboard side is opposite to the blade rotation this results in a higher load on the starboard half of the disk than on the port side half leading to a positive vertical moment at 0 deg drift angle in oblique flow the asymmetric axial inflow also generates vertical moments at small negative drift angles the left right load unbalance is strengthened as the high wakes moves towards the starboard side different from the open water results the behind hull torques and thrusts show their peaks at the drift angle of 5 and the negative drift angles show generally larger axial loads compared with the positive drift angles the reason for the asymmetric axial load curves is that the existence of the hull weakens the oblique effect and its weakening effect is stronger above the propeller center than below the propeller center this can be seen from the tangential velocity distribution in fig 11 a similar asymmetry phenomenon is observed in the experimental results of amini and steen 2011 where the axial load curves of a podded propeller are asymmetric with respect to drift angles at push mode but symmetric on pull mode they contributed this to the effect of the strut fig 18 shows the wave patterns of three typical drift angles asymmetric kelvin waves are clearly seen however the wave elevations near the stern of the three cases are similar this is mainly because the propeller submergence at the design draft is deep that the interaction between the blades and free surface is negligible 5 4 thrust eccentricity analysis at oblique flow condition the center of propeller thrust force moves away from the propeller center due to lateral bending moments the thrust eccentricity is relevant to shaft alignment in this section the oblique flow effect on thrust eccentricity is analyzed here the shifting of the thrust force center is defined as 7 δ y q z t x δ z q y t x only the behind hull condition is considered here since the hull wake effect must be taken into account for thrust eccentricity analysis fig 19 illustrates the locations of the thrust center on the propeller disk in the percentage of the propeller diameter for different drift angles the eccentric phenomenon of the propeller thrust is evident even though at the straight sailing condition the thrust center is not at the propeller center due to the hull wake as seen in section 5 3 a considerable positive vertical bending moment is generated at the zero drift angle causing the thrust center move to the starboard side the oblique flow effect on the thrust center shifting is remarkable it is seen the thrust center location moves upward as the drift angle increases therefore the thrust center locates at the first quadrant for the positive drift angles while at the third quadrants for the larger negative drift angles 6 analysis of scale effect the effect of scale on hull s wakes and propeller axial loads has been investigated by castro et al 2011 wang et al 2015 and wang et al 2016 however it is still unknown how scales affect the lateral loads of a propeller in oblique flow for this the scale effect is analyzed in this section due to the lack of available data measured at full scale the strategy of the scale analysis is to perform the simulations with three scale ratios which consists of the model scale λ 29 33 a medium scale λ 15 and the full scale λ 1 by varying the scale ratio we can obtain the trend of the propeller lateral loads as the model scale has been discussed in section 5 only the scales of λ 15 and 1 need to be computed additionally to reduce the computational cost the drift angle is varied with a large interval of 10 the mesh refinements for the scales of λ 15 and 1 are similar to that at the model scale however the sizes of the surface mesh and boundary layer mesh on the hull and blades are adjusted according to reynolds number the cell numbers for the medium and full scale simulations are 8 12 million and 8 95 million respectively fig 20 shows the propeller loads at different scales and drift angles it is seen the axial loads are more sensitive to the drift angle at large scales than at the model scale at 0 deg drift angle the thrust and torque decrease as the scale increases similar phenomena are observed in castro et al 2011 and wang et al 2016 where the international container ship kcs is computed the reason for this is that the boundary layer is thinner in large scales than in the model scale fig 21 compares the axial velocities in the propeller disk between different scales the difference in the boundary layer thickness and wake factor is evident for the lateral loads the scale effects are different between the horizontal and vertical components the horizontal loads decrease as the scale increases independently of drift angle in contrast the variations in the vertical loads of fig 20 are strongly dependent on the drift angle with the scale increasing the vertical loads increase when the drift angle is positive while they decrease for negative drift angles at 0 deg drift angle the scale effect on vertical loads is quite slight this is because that the variation of scale does not affect the left right symmetry of the hull s wake though it has significant effects on the magnitude of the axial velocities see fig 21 fig 22 gives the time histories of single blade loads of the three scales in one revolution it can be seen that the scale effects vary with the blade phase angle the single blade load is sensitive to scales around the blade phase angles of 45 deg for negative drift angles and 45 deg i e 315 deg for positive drift angles fig 23 illustrates the thrust force centers at different scales and drift angles it shows the centers are more scattered with respect to the middle line plane in the full scale than in the model scale it is also seen the scale effect on thrust eccentricity is more evident at positive drift angles than at negative drift angles 7 conclusions the aim of this paper is to gain a better understanding of propeller lateral loads under oblique flow conditions to achieve this numerical simulations are carried out against a single screw bulk carrier in oblique flow the computed drift angle covers a range of 20 to 20 both open water and behind hull conditions are computed the difference between the open water and behind hull results and the underlying mechanism are analyzed in detail in addition scale effect is discussed by running the behind hull simulations with three scale ratios i e λ 29 33 15 and 1 the results show i the effect of oblique flow on the propeller lateral loads is large in open water the lateral loads increase with the increase of drift angle in a slightly non linear trend however the behind hull lateral loads show remarkably different trends for the horizontal and vertical components due to the effect of the hull s wake the horizontal loads increase monotonously and nonlinearly with the drift angle increasing whereas the vertical loads peak at the drift angle of 5 with respect to the open water results the lateral loads at behind hull condition can reach a larger percentage of the axial loads ii the oblique flow has larger effects on the blade loads in the bottom half of the propeller disk compared with the top half iii the scale effects on the horizontal and vertical loads are different specifically the horizontal loads slightly decrease as the scale increases independently of the drift angle however the vertical loads are sensitive to the scale at large drift angles as the scale increases the vertical loads increase at positive drift angles and decrease at negative drift angles declaration of competing interest we

21961,acoustic bottom scattering is the main source of reverberation background in the shallow water environment backscattering characteristics of a sand and a mud bottom in the south yellow sea of china were compared the backscattering strength in the grazing angel range of 20 70 over a wide band 6 24 khz was measured employing an omnidirectional projector and an omnidirectional hydrophone for the sand site the backscattering strength enhances with the increase of grazing angle and has a high variation rate at large grazing angles 60 70 for the mud site it decreases with the grazing angle in the range of 50 70 a comparison of the data at different frequencies reveals that the backscattering strength in general slightly rises at the sand site while it somewhat declines at the mud site with the increase of frequency a fitting curve of lambert s law against the backscattering strength indicates that the measured data depart from lambert s law at large grazing angles fitted results of a scattering model based on that of jackson et al to the backscattering strength suggest that seafloor roughness scattering is the main scattering mechanism at low frequency 10 khz for the two sites while volume scattering from sediment heterogeneity is dominant at high frequency and large grazing angles for the mud site keywords acoustic scattering south yellow sea sand mud 1 introduction scattering strength is an intrinsic property of the seafloor however different sediment types and areas possess diverse acoustic scattering characteristics in the filed of acoustics the sediment types can be roughly divided into mud including clay and silt sand gravel and rock with the increase of the mean grain size there may be a 10 20 db contrast of bottom scattering strength even for the same sediment type in different areas stanic et al 1988 because of different environmental parameters e g the seafloor roughness in addition the frequency dependence of bottom scattering strength may be also distinct for different sediment types boehme et al 1985 bunchuk and zhitkovskii 1980 chotiros et al 1985 jackson et al 1986a stanic et al 1989 therefore it needs to investigate the characteristics of acoustic bottom scattering for different sediment types in a specified area characteristics of acoustic bottom scattering have been concerned in theory and experiment for more than a half century and it has made considerable progress in this field a common used scattering model is proposed by jackson et al jackson et al 1986a b jackson and briggs 1992 jackson et al 1996 mourad and jackson 1989 williams and jackson 1998 which applies to predict bottom scattering strength at high frequency 10 100 khz since the 1960s many researchers have carried out measurements of bottom scattering strength with various systems and methods to test the scattering models measurements in shallow water environments have been taken general attention in a very wide frequency range day and yamamoto 1999 hines et al 2005 holland et al 2000 ivakin 2016 la and choi 2010 liu et al 2004 liu and huang 2001 soukup and gragg 2003 stanic et al 1991 steininger et al 2014 weber and ward 2015 williams 2009 williams et al 2009 williams et al 2002 zeng et al 2014 experiments at very low frequency 1 khz were conducted in the deep sea greaves and stephen 1997 holland and neumann 1998 tang et al 1995 and acoustic scattering characteristics of marine sediments at very high frequency 1 mhz were researched in the laboratory where the granular structure is the main scattering mechanism bassett et al 2016 ivakin and sessarego 2007 williams et al 1988 however the available experimental data are not enough to completely describe the bottom scattering characteristics in the shallow water environment in consideration of its complexity and diversity furthermore public data have not been found over a wide band for different sediment types in the south yellow sea of china we focus on this issue and test whether the scattering model of jackson et al applies to this area this paper is a continuation of the technique presented by the authors for a sand bottom in a previous publication yu et al 2018 backscattering characteristics of another mud bottom was presented more environmental parameters were measured including the component of the sediment the porosity the mass density of grains the mean grain size and the seafloor roughness and the measurement frequency band was extended to 6 24 khz the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the environmental parameters at a sand and a mud sites the measurement system the observed data and the method used for calculating backscattering strength is illustrated in section 3 section 4 presents comparisons of measured backscattering strength with lambert s law and the scattering model at the two sites conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 environmental parameters the two experimental sites lie in the south yellow sea of china as shown in fig 1 s1 is a sand site with a water depth of 40 m located about 120 km southeast of qingdao s2 is a mud site with a water depth of 52 m located about 98 km northeast of s1 before measuring the bottom backscattering strength following environmental parameters at the two sites were obtained the sediment properties the sound speed profile in water column and the seafloor roughness i e the microtopography of the seafloor sediment samples were collected by a box corer and the main physical parameters were analyzed in the laboratory after the experiment the sound speed profile was measured using a sound velocity profiler during the experiment the seafloor roughness was acquired through a laser scanning system then the statistical characterization of the seafloor roughness was obtained 2 1 the sand site s1 core data showed that the sediment was fine sand consisting of sand 81 4 silt 8 6 and clay 10 0 removing a small amount of shell fragments with a mean grain size of 3 07 ϕ the porosity was 0 461 and the mass density of grains was 3 28 g cm3 the sound speed profile in water column is presented in fig 2 it underwent an obvious transition at a depth of about 20 m corresponding to the thermocline and was almost uniform near the seafloor because the sound speed is very stable in the range of depths from the measurement system to the seafloor the effect of ray bending was neglected in calculation of backscattering strength the seafloor roughness is an important physical mechanism of acoustic bottom scattering which was observed through an independently developed laser scanning system fig 3 the system consists of a support frame for seating on the seafloor an underwater camera an underwater laser a mobile platform a drive mechanism a servo motor and a main control board the camera and the laser were fixed on the mobile platform which could together move along two parallel tracks driven by the servo motor with a constant speed the laser transmitted line laser to the seafloor then the seafloor roughness leaded to distortion of the laser stripe which was recorded by the high definition and high speed camera with the movement of the camera and the laser many stripe images of the measuring area were obtained the center laser line and its laser point in each stripe image were extracted resorting to a processing algorism then 3d coordinates of the laser points were calculated using a triangular ranging algorithm finally a 2d height distribution of the seafloor roughness was obtained the largest scanning area for one cast is 3 0 m 1 0 m with resolution of 4 mm and 0 1 mm and the resolution in height is 0 01 mm a synthesized digital image corresponding to a real size of 2100 mm 640 mm after being processed using 1000 laser stripe images is presented in fig 4 it is found that the seafloor surface is relatively smooth with no obvious ripples photographs taken by the camera in the laser scanning system showed that the seafloor was covered by a small quantity of shell fragments and there were 2 3 starfish in an area corresponding to the digital image comparing the mean 1d roughness spectrum fig 5 lengthwise the x direction with that widthwise the y direction derived from fig 4 it indicates that the seafloor roughness is approximately isotropic the lower limit of the wavenumber k 2 π λ where λ is the acoustic wavelength is determined by the measurement range as 2 π l 2 99 and 9 82 m 1 for the x and the y directions respectively the upper limit corresponds to π δ where δ is the spatial resolution because the measurement range in the x direction is larger than that in the y direction the spatial frequency resolution is better in the x direction the roughness scale responsible for backscattering is 4 π cos θ λ tang 2004 subsequently the 1d roughness spectrum is fitted by a power law in a wavenumber range corresponding to the measurement frequency band as 1 w k w 1 k γ 1 where the parameter γ 1 is called the spectral exponent and the parameter w 1 is called the spectral strength under the condition of isotropic seafloor roughness the relationship between the 1d and 2d spectral parameters is jackson et al 1986a 2 γ 2 γ 1 1 3 w 2 w 1 γ γ 2 2 π γ γ 2 1 2 according to this relationship the spectral exponent and the spectral strength of the 2d roughness spectrum are 3 45 and 2 17 10 4 m4 respectively they are both input parameters of the scattering model 2 2 the mud site s2 at the mud site the sediment was sandy clay whose components were sand 33 silt 13 7 and clay 53 3 the mean grain size was 7 29 ϕ the porosity was 0 647 and the mass density of grains was 2 84 g cm3 the sound speed profile in water was similar to that at s1 where the sound speed was uniform near the seafloor as well unfortunately it was too turbid to get clear photographs the seafloor roughness was not well acquired during the experiment 3 measurement of bottom backscattering strength method of measuring the bottom backscattering strength is the same as that of yu et al 2018 but the frequency range was extended to 6 24 khz for different sediment types the measurement system consisted of an omnidirectional projector an omnidirectional hydrophone and a temperature and depth td sensor as shown in fig 6 three different projectors were used to cover the measurement frequency band the average height of the projector and hydrophone above the seafloor was measured according to the arrival time of the wave from the bottom and the sound speed in water column recorded signals of the hydrophone at 8 khz at the two sites are shown in fig 7 comparing the received signals at the two sites it indicates that the scattered wave from the subbottom is stronger than that from the seafloor surface at the mud site the reverberation level is presented in fig 8 the parts from the bottom and the sea surface correspond to that in fig 7 the blue curves are all the independent samples corresponding to each ping the red curves are the mean values which are used to obtain the best estimate of the bottom backscattering strength the source level the hydrophones and the sea state were different at the two sites which leads to obvious contrasts of the reverberation level from the bottom and the sea surface in calculation of the uncertainty of the backscattering strength one difference from yu et al 2018 is the choice of the statistical uncertainty 4 δ σ 1 1 96 i s d r 2 i i a n where n is the number of independent samples i i is the incident intensity at the scattering patch and i s d is the standard deviation of the scattered intensity following eq 4 it gives the uncertainty of the best estimate of the backscattering strength rather than the uncertainty of all independent sample values 4 analysis and discussions 4 1 the sand site s1 backscattering strengths at 6 10 16 and 24 khz are presented in fig 9 the measured data are the bottom backscattering strength derived from scattered signals for 100 pings with an interval of 2 s the solid circles present the best estimate and the error bars indicate the uncertainty of the best estimate overall the backscattering strength enhances with the increase of grazing angle and has a high variation rate at large grazing angles 60 70 moreover the backscattering strength in general slightly rises with the increase of frequency which is roughly consistent with the measured results at some sand sites in fig 12 7 of jackson and richardson 2007 for data 10 khz for reference the backscattering strength is somewhat lower than that of a medium sand site in williams et al 2002 which is reasonable in consideration of the frequency dependence for this site fitted results show that the backscattering strength agrees well with lambert s law only at mid grazing angles 30 60 as shown in fig 9 the deviation is obvious at large grazing angles which is also consistent with some other results jackson and richardson 2007 since stratification of the seafloor is not prominent at this site a scattering model based on that of jackson et al is used to fit to the data yu et al 2018 because not all the parameters were measured an inversion method is adopted to estimate 10 parameters of the scattering model selecting the search ranges of model parameters referring to values of typical sand sediments jackson and ivakin 1998 jackson et al 2010 williams et al 2002 and taking the best estimates of backscattering strength at several grazing angles of the four frequencies as the fitted objects the best values of model parameters can be obtained resorting to an optimization algorithm as shown in table 1 the values of v p and δ p are calculated at 8 khz the fitted results yield a model that in general agrees with the data however the data exhibit some fluctuation at 6 and 10 khz which may be a proof that the scattering model is not applicable to frequencies of 10 khz since the backscattering strength is more sensitive to parameters of β γ 2 w 2 and v p yu 2014 estimates of these parameters are more reliable the relative errors between the estimated values and the measured results of β γ 2 and w 2 are 1 95 8 99 and 11 5 respectively a large value of γ 2 implies that large scale roughness is the main component of the seafloor roughness considering the dispersion of sound speed v p is reasonable for fine sand in addition a good estimate is also obtained for the mean grain size with the relative error being 9 77 it is noted that there is an obvious increase near the critical angle about 15 at 8 khz according to the estimate value of v p in the model prediction owing to the effect of total internal reflection which is not characterized by lambert s law in detail unfortunately the measured data does not well perform this trend because the scattered signal was not strong enough to accurately estimate the backscattering strength at very low grazing angles to solve the problem the measurement system needs to be deployed more closely to the seafloor in the case of satisfying the far field condition of the source best estimates of bottom backscattering strength at different frequencies are summarized in fig 10 a linear fitting indicates that the backscattering strength depends on the frequency as 0 23 db khz and 0 20 db khz at grazing angles of 20 and 70 respectively bottom scattering is attributed to seafloor roughness and sediment heterogeneity in the scattering model of jackson et al the total scattering strength is given as 5 s b 10 log 10 σ b r σ b v where σ b r is the roughness scattering cross section and σ b v is the equivalent interface scattering cross section of the sediment volume scattering to analyze their relative contributions to total scattering the backscattering strength corresponding to different scattering mechanisms is shown in fig 11 using the best values of model parameters in table 1 it is found that scattering from seafloor roughness is dominant at low frequency 10 khz with the increase of frequency the acoustic wavelength gradually approaches the size of sediment heterogeneity and volume scattering from sediment heterogeneity becomes stronger and tends to a level similar to that of roughness scattering at low to mid grazing angles in theory the roughness scattering strength rapidly increases and is much larger than that of the volume scattering at large grazing angles 60 90 which lead to the measured data total scattering strength with a high variation rate at 60 70 4 2 the mud site s2 backscattering strengths at 6 12 18 and 24 khz are presented in fig 12 comparing the measured data with that of the sand site reveals that the backscattering strength is overall stronger there is an obvious peak near a grazing angle of 50 and the backscattering strength decreases for grazing angles 50 the backscattering strengths at large grazing angles are even smaller than those at low grazing angles conversely the different shapes of the backscattering strength curves can be used to qualitatively identify the sediment type the measured data depart from lambert s law at large grazing angles as shown in fig 12 the backscattering strength changes more rapidly and decreases with the increase of grazing angle which is just opposite to the dependence of lambert s law therefore lambert s law is too simple to explain the backscattering characteristics at the mud site where there may be complex scattering mechanisms a scattering model based on physics is necessary employing the same method as used at the sand site a best fitted model can be searched for selection of the search ranges of model parameters refers to typical mud sediments jackson et al 1996 jackson and richardson 2007 the values of v p and δ p are calculated at 8 khz as well however the measured data are not well fitted by the scattering model at the mud site using the best values in table 2 especially for low frequency 10 khz the value and the position of the peak in the backscattering strength curve are not accurately predicted by the model the peak indicates that there is obvious stratification of the seafloor at this site also being found in received signals of fig 7b to explain this new phenomenon other scattering mechanisms e g roughness scattering from subbottom interface or volume scattering from a strong heterogeneity layer need to be introduced into the scattering model according to the subbottom profile however the influence of stratification on bottom scattering is not prominent at low grazing angles and the scattering model is roughly consistent to the measured data in the well estimated parameters the relative error of β is 8 50 compared to the core data the spectral parameters γ 2 and w 2 are similar to those at the sand slit clay site with a mean grain size of 6 62 ϕ jackson et al 1996 in addition a good estimate of the mean grain size with a relative error of 2 47 is also obtained because the sound speed in mud sediment is lower than that in water there is no total internal reflection and the transition of backscattering strength at low grazing angles is nonexistent best estimates of bottom backscattering strength at different frequencies are summarized in fig 13 a linear fitting shows that the backscattering strength depends on the frequency as 0 27 db khz and 0 03 db khz at grazing angles of 20 and 70 respectively it is noteworthy that the backscattering strength is nearly independent of frequency at large grazing angles which is also observed in a sand mud environment williams et al 2009 if the scattering model is still used to analyze the scattering mechanism at this site the backscattering strength corresponding to different scattering mechanisms is shown in fig 14 using the best values of model parameters in table 2 the figure implies that scattering from seafloor roughness is dominant at low frequency as well with the increase of frequency volume scattering from sediment heterogeneity becomes the main scattering mechanism at large grazing angles however when the total scattering is attributed to the roughness scattering and the volume scattering it seams to be unreasonable for individual scattering strength as a function of the grazing angle because scattering strength from seafloor roughness should increase with the increase of grazing angle therefore roughness scattering from a subbottom interface or volume scattering from a strong heterogeneity layer may be used to explain the enhancement near the grazing angle of 50 when the grazing angle changes from 70 to 50 the penetration depth of the sound wave increases and the contribution of scattering from a latent strong heterogeneity layer enlarges which leads to decrease of the measured data from 50 to 70 5 conclusions bottom backscattering strength from a sand and a mud bottom in a shallow water environment of the south yellow sea of china was measured employing an omnidirectional projector and an omnidirectional hydrophone characteristics of bottom backscattering in the grazing angle range of 20 70 over a wide band 6 24 khz are compared in this paper for the sand site the backscattering strength enhances with the increase of grazing angle and has a high variation rate at large grazing angles 60 70 in point of frequency dependence the backscattering strength in general slightly rises with the increase of frequency the fitting of lambert s law to the backscattering strength indicates that the measured data agrees well with lambert s law only at mid grazing angles 30 60 while the deviation is obvious at large grazing angles fitted results of a scattering model based on that of jackson et al to the backscattering strength show that it in general agrees with the measured data employing the estimated model parameters obtained according to an inversion method comparing with the direct measured results good estimates of the model parameters β γ 2 w 2 and m z were obtained according to model predictions seafloor roughness scattering is dominant at low frequency 10 khz with the increase of frequency volume scattering from sediment heterogeneity becomes stronger and tends to a level similar to that of roughness scattering at low to mid grazing angles for the mud site the backscattering strength as a function of grazing angle is more complex the grazing angle dependence of the measured data is just opposite to lambert s law prediction at large grazing angles in terms of frequency dependence the backscattering strength somewhat decreases with the increase of frequency being nearly independent of frequency at large grazing angles fitted results of the scattering model are not as good as that at the sand site which indicates that other scattering mechanisms e g the stratification of the seafloor or a strong heterogeneity layer need to be taken into account roughness scattering is dominant at low frequency as well while volume scattering gradually becomes the main scattering mechanism at large grazing angles with the increase of frequency sediment types are diverse in the

21961,acoustic bottom scattering is the main source of reverberation background in the shallow water environment backscattering characteristics of a sand and a mud bottom in the south yellow sea of china were compared the backscattering strength in the grazing angel range of 20 70 over a wide band 6 24 khz was measured employing an omnidirectional projector and an omnidirectional hydrophone for the sand site the backscattering strength enhances with the increase of grazing angle and has a high variation rate at large grazing angles 60 70 for the mud site it decreases with the grazing angle in the range of 50 70 a comparison of the data at different frequencies reveals that the backscattering strength in general slightly rises at the sand site while it somewhat declines at the mud site with the increase of frequency a fitting curve of lambert s law against the backscattering strength indicates that the measured data depart from lambert s law at large grazing angles fitted results of a scattering model based on that of jackson et al to the backscattering strength suggest that seafloor roughness scattering is the main scattering mechanism at low frequency 10 khz for the two sites while volume scattering from sediment heterogeneity is dominant at high frequency and large grazing angles for the mud site keywords acoustic scattering south yellow sea sand mud 1 introduction scattering strength is an intrinsic property of the seafloor however different sediment types and areas possess diverse acoustic scattering characteristics in the filed of acoustics the sediment types can be roughly divided into mud including clay and silt sand gravel and rock with the increase of the mean grain size there may be a 10 20 db contrast of bottom scattering strength even for the same sediment type in different areas stanic et al 1988 because of different environmental parameters e g the seafloor roughness in addition the frequency dependence of bottom scattering strength may be also distinct for different sediment types boehme et al 1985 bunchuk and zhitkovskii 1980 chotiros et al 1985 jackson et al 1986a stanic et al 1989 therefore it needs to investigate the characteristics of acoustic bottom scattering for different sediment types in a specified area characteristics of acoustic bottom scattering have been concerned in theory and experiment for more than a half century and it has made considerable progress in this field a common used scattering model is proposed by jackson et al jackson et al 1986a b jackson and briggs 1992 jackson et al 1996 mourad and jackson 1989 williams and jackson 1998 which applies to predict bottom scattering strength at high frequency 10 100 khz since the 1960s many researchers have carried out measurements of bottom scattering strength with various systems and methods to test the scattering models measurements in shallow water environments have been taken general attention in a very wide frequency range day and yamamoto 1999 hines et al 2005 holland et al 2000 ivakin 2016 la and choi 2010 liu et al 2004 liu and huang 2001 soukup and gragg 2003 stanic et al 1991 steininger et al 2014 weber and ward 2015 williams 2009 williams et al 2009 williams et al 2002 zeng et al 2014 experiments at very low frequency 1 khz were conducted in the deep sea greaves and stephen 1997 holland and neumann 1998 tang et al 1995 and acoustic scattering characteristics of marine sediments at very high frequency 1 mhz were researched in the laboratory where the granular structure is the main scattering mechanism bassett et al 2016 ivakin and sessarego 2007 williams et al 1988 however the available experimental data are not enough to completely describe the bottom scattering characteristics in the shallow water environment in consideration of its complexity and diversity furthermore public data have not been found over a wide band for different sediment types in the south yellow sea of china we focus on this issue and test whether the scattering model of jackson et al applies to this area this paper is a continuation of the technique presented by the authors for a sand bottom in a previous publication yu et al 2018 backscattering characteristics of another mud bottom was presented more environmental parameters were measured including the component of the sediment the porosity the mass density of grains the mean grain size and the seafloor roughness and the measurement frequency band was extended to 6 24 khz the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the environmental parameters at a sand and a mud sites the measurement system the observed data and the method used for calculating backscattering strength is illustrated in section 3 section 4 presents comparisons of measured backscattering strength with lambert s law and the scattering model at the two sites conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 environmental parameters the two experimental sites lie in the south yellow sea of china as shown in fig 1 s1 is a sand site with a water depth of 40 m located about 120 km southeast of qingdao s2 is a mud site with a water depth of 52 m located about 98 km northeast of s1 before measuring the bottom backscattering strength following environmental parameters at the two sites were obtained the sediment properties the sound speed profile in water column and the seafloor roughness i e the microtopography of the seafloor sediment samples were collected by a box corer and the main physical parameters were analyzed in the laboratory after the experiment the sound speed profile was measured using a sound velocity profiler during the experiment the seafloor roughness was acquired through a laser scanning system then the statistical characterization of the seafloor roughness was obtained 2 1 the sand site s1 core data showed that the sediment was fine sand consisting of sand 81 4 silt 8 6 and clay 10 0 removing a small amount of shell fragments with a mean grain size of 3 07 ϕ the porosity was 0 461 and the mass density of grains was 3 28 g cm3 the sound speed profile in water column is presented in fig 2 it underwent an obvious transition at a depth of about 20 m corresponding to the thermocline and was almost uniform near the seafloor because the sound speed is very stable in the range of depths from the measurement system to the seafloor the effect of ray bending was neglected in calculation of backscattering strength the seafloor roughness is an important physical mechanism of acoustic bottom scattering which was observed through an independently developed laser scanning system fig 3 the system consists of a support frame for seating on the seafloor an underwater camera an underwater laser a mobile platform a drive mechanism a servo motor and a main control board the camera and the laser were fixed on the mobile platform which could together move along two parallel tracks driven by the servo motor with a constant speed the laser transmitted line laser to the seafloor then the seafloor roughness leaded to distortion of the laser stripe which was recorded by the high definition and high speed camera with the movement of the camera and the laser many stripe images of the measuring area were obtained the center laser line and its laser point in each stripe image were extracted resorting to a processing algorism then 3d coordinates of the laser points were calculated using a triangular ranging algorithm finally a 2d height distribution of the seafloor roughness was obtained the largest scanning area for one cast is 3 0 m 1 0 m with resolution of 4 mm and 0 1 mm and the resolution in height is 0 01 mm a synthesized digital image corresponding to a real size of 2100 mm 640 mm after being processed using 1000 laser stripe images is presented in fig 4 it is found that the seafloor surface is relatively smooth with no obvious ripples photographs taken by the camera in the laser scanning system showed that the seafloor was covered by a small quantity of shell fragments and there were 2 3 starfish in an area corresponding to the digital image comparing the mean 1d roughness spectrum fig 5 lengthwise the x direction with that widthwise the y direction derived from fig 4 it indicates that the seafloor roughness is approximately isotropic the lower limit of the wavenumber k 2 π λ where λ is the acoustic wavelength is determined by the measurement range as 2 π l 2 99 and 9 82 m 1 for the x and the y directions respectively the upper limit corresponds to π δ where δ is the spatial resolution because the measurement range in the x direction is larger than that in the y direction the spatial frequency resolution is better in the x direction the roughness scale responsible for backscattering is 4 π cos θ λ tang 2004 subsequently the 1d roughness spectrum is fitted by a power law in a wavenumber range corresponding to the measurement frequency band as 1 w k w 1 k γ 1 where the parameter γ 1 is called the spectral exponent and the parameter w 1 is called the spectral strength under the condition of isotropic seafloor roughness the relationship between the 1d and 2d spectral parameters is jackson et al 1986a 2 γ 2 γ 1 1 3 w 2 w 1 γ γ 2 2 π γ γ 2 1 2 according to this relationship the spectral exponent and the spectral strength of the 2d roughness spectrum are 3 45 and 2 17 10 4 m4 respectively they are both input parameters of the scattering model 2 2 the mud site s2 at the mud site the sediment was sandy clay whose components were sand 33 silt 13 7 and clay 53 3 the mean grain size was 7 29 ϕ the porosity was 0 647 and the mass density of grains was 2 84 g cm3 the sound speed profile in water was similar to that at s1 where the sound speed was uniform near the seafloor as well unfortunately it was too turbid to get clear photographs the seafloor roughness was not well acquired during the experiment 3 measurement of bottom backscattering strength method of measuring the bottom backscattering strength is the same as that of yu et al 2018 but the frequency range was extended to 6 24 khz for different sediment types the measurement system consisted of an omnidirectional projector an omnidirectional hydrophone and a temperature and depth td sensor as shown in fig 6 three different projectors were used to cover the measurement frequency band the average height of the projector and hydrophone above the seafloor was measured according to the arrival time of the wave from the bottom and the sound speed in water column recorded signals of the hydrophone at 8 khz at the two sites are shown in fig 7 comparing the received signals at the two sites it indicates that the scattered wave from the subbottom is stronger than that from the seafloor surface at the mud site the reverberation level is presented in fig 8 the parts from the bottom and the sea surface correspond to that in fig 7 the blue curves are all the independent samples corresponding to each ping the red curves are the mean values which are used to obtain the best estimate of the bottom backscattering strength the source level the hydrophones and the sea state were different at the two sites which leads to obvious contrasts of the reverberation level from the bottom and the sea surface in calculation of the uncertainty of the backscattering strength one difference from yu et al 2018 is the choice of the statistical uncertainty 4 δ σ 1 1 96 i s d r 2 i i a n where n is the number of independent samples i i is the incident intensity at the scattering patch and i s d is the standard deviation of the scattered intensity following eq 4 it gives the uncertainty of the best estimate of the backscattering strength rather than the uncertainty of all independent sample values 4 analysis and discussions 4 1 the sand site s1 backscattering strengths at 6 10 16 and 24 khz are presented in fig 9 the measured data are the bottom backscattering strength derived from scattered signals for 100 pings with an interval of 2 s the solid circles present the best estimate and the error bars indicate the uncertainty of the best estimate overall the backscattering strength enhances with the increase of grazing angle and has a high variation rate at large grazing angles 60 70 moreover the backscattering strength in general slightly rises with the increase of frequency which is roughly consistent with the measured results at some sand sites in fig 12 7 of jackson and richardson 2007 for data 10 khz for reference the backscattering strength is somewhat lower than that of a medium sand site in williams et al 2002 which is reasonable in consideration of the frequency dependence for this site fitted results show that the backscattering strength agrees well with lambert s law only at mid grazing angles 30 60 as shown in fig 9 the deviation is obvious at large grazing angles which is also consistent with some other

a model that in general agrees with the data however the data exhibit some fluctuation at 6 and 10 khz which may be a proof that the scattering model is not applicable to frequencies of 10 khz since the backscattering strength is more sensitive to parameters of β γ 2 w 2 and v p yu 2014 estimates of these parameters are more reliable the relative errors between the estimated values and the measured results of β γ 2 and w 2 are 1 95 8 99 and 11 5 respectively a large value of γ 2 implies that large scale roughness is the main component of the seafloor roughness considering the dispersion of sound speed v p is reasonable for fine sand in addition a good estimate is also obtained for the mean grain size with the relative error being 9 77 it is noted that there is an obvious increase near the critical angle about 15 at 8 khz according to the estimate value of v p in the model prediction owing to the effect of total internal reflection which is not characterized by lambert s law in

strength at different frequencies are summarized in fig 10 a linear fitting indicates that the backscattering strength depends on the frequency as 0 23 db khz and 0 20 db khz at grazing angles of 20 and 70 respectively bottom scattering is attributed to seafloor roughness and sediment heterogeneity in the scattering model of jackson et al the total scattering strength is given as 5 s b 10 log 10 σ b r σ b v where σ b r is the roughness scattering cross section and σ b v is the equivalent interface scattering cross section of the sediment volume scattering to analyze their relative

this paper we present a method to analyse the wave run up and air gap data obtained from lab measurements which is expected to be useful for field data analyses strong responses were found to be excited owing to the near trapped phenomenon which is reflected as peaks of the linear transfer functions at certain frequencies the second order non linearity plays a significant role and thus should not be neglected when predicting the run up and air gap responses the slow drift motions in the vertical plane e g heave and pitch motions due to the second order difference interactions between the frequency pairs were found to be important to the run up and air gap responses keywords wave run up air gap multi column structure near trapped modes slow drift motion quadratic transfer function 1 introduction the wave run up responses at the front face of a multi column structure and the air gap responses between the topside of the structure and the incident waves are important parameters in designing air gap responses may lead to large local slamming loads which can cause further damage to offshore structures accidents related to such a phenomenon have been reported swan et al 1997 tian et al 2017 the wave run up and air gap phenomena are relevant to multi column structures such as semi submersibles tension leg platforms and spars studies on the wave run up responses of structures with columns have been conducted for decades and began from the responses around an isolated fixed column to predict the maximum height of run up several analytical models have been developed hallermeier proposed a formula to estimate the run up for a cylinder through velocity stagnation head calculations based on the assumption that the potential energy of the water particles at the run up crest is derived from the kinetic energy hallermeier 1976 this formula was then corrected based on several experiments on the run up of an isolated vertical column de vos et al 2007 martin et al 2001 mase et al 2001 niedzwecki and huston 1992 niedzwecki and duggal 1992 although some of the results obtained by the semi empirical estimation compare favourably with the experimental data most of the researches are based on regular wave tests or only consider the maximum responses of a random sea it becomes more complex when the free surface elevations in the vicinity of the columns in an array are considered the violent motion of water around columns can be excited by the interactions between the incident reflected waves and the radiated waves due to the motions of floating platforms swan et al 1997 in view of the capability of calculating the wave field around a body with an arbitrary shape linear diffraction radiation theory was applied to investigate the run up and air gap responses underneath the lower deck of offshore structures for fixed multi column structures such as the gravity base structure and arrays of wind turbine foundations an exact solution for a column array with circular cross section was proposed linton and evans 1990 by using a simplified expression for the potential term close to the column when the incident wave with a certain frequency interacts with the column array a strong local free surface oscillation can be observed which is associated with a near trapped mode meylan and eatock taylor 2009 near trapped modes are natural characteristics of the structural geometry and correspond to the frequencies at which the minimum energy is radiated out to infinity grice et al 2013 for a free floating structure it is shown that trapped modes also exist which are regarded as coupled oscillations of the fluid and structure mciver and mciver 2006 when it comes to the floating structure the vertical motions heave roll and pitch must be accounted for in order to accurately estimate the run up and air gap sweetman 2004 a combination of the linear diffraction radiation theory and time domain analysis can be well used to predict the wave frequency motions of a platform with an arbitrary shape besides the linear vertical motions for a deep draft semi submersible platform prominent slow drift vertical motions excited by second order loads are observed and must also be taken into account when predicting the run up and air gap responses stansberg 2007 non linearity arises from not only vertical motions but also the non linear surface elevations in the vicinity of columns the second order responses of surface elevations result from the interactions between all possible pairs of frequency components of the incident waves thus difference and sum quadratic transfer functions qtfs can be used to describe the responses assuming that the contributions from different pairs of frequencies to the response frequency are the same and that the difference in frequency interactions can be neglected taylor et al 2007 a near flat sum qtf matrix approximation for the surface elevation around fixed cylinder arrays can then be introduced to reduce the second order calculations grice et al 2015 however the second order surface elevations for floating multi column structures do not seem to have been completely solved stansberg 2014 walker et al 2006 in this study the extreme run up and air gap responses were investigated for a deep draft semi submersible based on experimental data the features of the extreme run up and air gap responses under irregular waves were then studied the aspects that may influence the responses include trapped modes and motion coupling the local non linearities of the run up and air gap responses were then investigated and the approximately flat qtfs of the responses were obtained from the model test the details are included in section 3 following a description of the experimental set up in section 2 the conclusions drawn from the model tests are presented in section 4 2 experimental set up a series of model tests were conducted in the deepwater wave basin at shanghai jiao tong university with the scale of 1 60 the basin was 50 0 m in length 40 0 m in width and its maximum effective depth was 10 0 m in the model tests we selected a moored deep draft semi submersible as the object of study a schematic of the structure is illustrated in fig 1 at prototype scale the semi submersible is geometrically symmetric and was designed to be 91 5 m wide with four columns each of which is 21 m wide the pontoon height was 9 m the design draft was 37 m from the keel which resulted in an initial air gap distance between the calm water surface and the deck also called the freeboard of 22 m the relevant information regarding the geometry and mass data of the model are presented in appendix to simplify the whole floating system the semi hull was moored by four taut mooring lines one at each column corner while the other end of each mooring line was attached to a foundation point on the basin floor the mooring line properties including the length ea submerged weight of each segment and pretension are summarised in appendix note that the mooring line configuration is not symmetric owing to the variability of the bathymetry irregular waves were modelled based on the specified significant wave height hs peak spectrum period tp and wave spectrum jonswap spectrum with the parameters of hs 13 4 m tp 14 7 s andγ 2 4 at prototype scale was used to produce the incident waves to evaluate the wave run up and air gap responses two wave probes of resistance type were used to measure the wave elevation and period as shown in figs 1 and 2 the two wave probes were installed at the front face of the column for the run up and in the middle between the columns for the air gap by which the wave probes can move with the model to measure the relative surface elevations besides the wave probes that measured the relative wave displacements the non contact optical motion capture system was applied to measure the 6 dof motions of the semi submersible platform therefore we are capable to obtain the absolute surface elevation by splitting the local vertical motions from the relative wave displacements during the wave tests the data acquisition system starts collecting the required data signals only after the model motions reach steady state to avoid transient effects an irregular wave was generated for 25 min which after removing an incident transient phase that corresponded to 23 24 min at laboratory scale corresponded to 3 h at full scale all the data signals were collected at a sampling frequency of 60 hz in the model scale the quality of the measurements such as in surface elevations and vessel motions and the repeatability of the experiments have been demonstrated in a previous study zhao et al 2018a therefore we did not repeat similar plot though we checked the testing repeatability for each experiment 3 results and discussion prior to the wave tests several tests were conducted in calm water to verify the experimental set up offset tests have been conducted to obtain the restoring force curve in order to ensure that the properties of the mooring lines are simulated as designed decay tests were also conducted to verify the natural period of the platform motions and obtain the damping coefficients 3 1 validation of the experimental set up the extinction curves of the decay tests for heave roll and pitch motions are presented in fig 3 from which the non dimensional linear damping coefficients can be obtained based on eq 1 1 μ 2 ν ω 0 c ω 0 m a c k m a where μ is the non dimensional linear damping coefficient obtained from decay tests 2ν and ω 0 represents the damping coefficient and natural frequency and m a c and k refer to the total mass damping and stiffness of a floating system the typo t 0 in fig 3 represents the natural period for each degree of freedom of motions the static horizontal stiffness of the whole system was measured through static offset tests as shown in fig 4 the curve of restoring force versus horizontal offset of the overall mooring system was recorded and compared with the calculated target curves the comparison revealed a good agreement which confirmed the modelling of the mooring lines the experimental results are presented at the prototype scale throughout this paper tests in waves were conducted after the confirmation of the experimental set up the spectra of the undisturbed incident waves jonswap spectrum in the absence of the model and the corresponding run up air gap responses are presented in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 both the run up and air gap response spectra are broader than the incident wave spectrum the wave energies of the run up air gap response are prominently excited at higher frequency components it is obvious that the run up responses for frequencies ranging from 0 45 rad s to 0 6 rad s or higher than 0 8 rad s are much stronger than the air gap responses nearly the same spectral peaks appear at frequencies lower than 0 3 rad s in the figure which is attributed to the vertical motion corresponding to the heave and pitch motions at the positions of the wave probes the evidence for this is provided in the sections below it is also worth paying close attention to the phenomenon of near trapped modes which are likely to cause a violent response in this case the modes are very close to those of pure trapping the imaginary component of the wavenumber is equal to zero which means that little energy at this mode is radiated out to infinity in this research we first investigate the linear excitation of such near trapped modes the white noise wave signal was used as the incident wave in the commercial linear diffraction radiation code hydrod deepc the linear transfer function ltf of the absolute surface elevations and the run up air gap response can be easily obtained by numerical calculations as shown in fig 6 the linear run up response shows almost the same pattern as that of the absolute surface elevation for frequencies higher than 0 5 rad s which is along expected lines since the hull motions are relatively slow compared with the wave motion the same trend has been observed with the air gap response as well three tall peaks appear in both the run up and air gap responses at certain frequencies which align well with the natural frequencies of the motions of the moored floating system the ltf of the water surface elevations with respect to calm water converges to 1 for long waves which is not surprising owing to little diffraction effect when the wavelength becomes so short that the column can be treated as an infinite vertical wall diffraction starts playing an important role as the wavenumber increases the wavelength becomes comparable to the column width which means that the scattered wave cannot be neglected several peaks can be observed with the increase in wavenumber which are related to the trapped modes in front of the heading column more evident wiggles which correspond to the trapped modes are found in the ltf of the absolute surface elevation for the air gap response than in the ltf for the run up response that means that the extreme air gap response would more likely be excited by the trapped mode of the array of columns nevertheless the ltf of the absolute surface elevation for the air gap response always oscillates around 1 throughout the frequency range considered in this study the total transfer function ttf can be obtained through spectral analysis of the experimental data shown in fig 6 the transfer functions obtained from the experiments are only presented for the frequency range 0 3 rad s to 1 2 rad s as the input energy of the incident wave is too small which may produce distortions in the plot it is found that the run up responses to the incident waves are much stronger than those predicted by linear calculations for frequencies higher than about 0 6 rad s whereas the linear predictions match fairly well with the experimental results in the frequency range 0 3 rad s to 0 6 rad s for the air gap response a deviation between the ltf and the experimental results appears for frequencies higher than 0 849 rad s which is observed to be much smaller than that for the run up response from both the ltf comparisons fig 6 we may verify that the second order response plays a significant role in both the run up and air gap responses therefore obtaining the ltf directly from the spectra of the incident waves and responses may not be appropriate the qtf should be taken into consideration 3 2 motion coupling the wave run up and air gap are regarded as the relative elevation based on the coordinates fixed on the platform and expressed as 2 χ t ζ l i n e a r t ζ n o n l i n e a r t δ t where χ t is the total run up and air gap response which is also called upwell ζ l i n e a r t is the linear absolute surface elevation ζ n o n l i n e a r t is the non linear absolute surface elevation and δ t is the vertical motion at the specific position concerning the run up and air gap referring to eq 2 the vertical motions of the platform exhibit significant influences on the run up and air gap responses especially for the slow drift motion components in the vertical plane the vertical motion at a specific position on a platform can be obtained by coordinate rigid body transformation 3 δ t ξ 3 t y sin ξ 4 t x sin ξ 5 t where ξ 3 t ξ 4 t and ξ 5 t correspond to the heave roll and pitch motions at the centre of the gravity cog of the platform x and y refer to the horizontal positions relative to the cog in engineering practice it is a challenge to numerically predict the effects of the slow drift motion coupling at a certain sea state linear theory may normally be a sufficiently accurate way of predicting the wave frequency components of platform motions though it cannot consider the slow drift components due to non linear interactions fig 7 shows the transfer functions of the vertical motion obtained by linear numerical prediction and experimentation the numerical simulations were conducted with the damping coefficients obtained from the decay tests the ttf of the vertical motion agrees well with the experimental results for the wave frequency range 0 3 rad s to 1 0 rad s the two peaks shown in the numerical results are related to the contributions of the heave and pitch motions however the slow drift motions induced by the non linear difference frequency interaction should be considered when investigating the extreme run up and air gap responses fig 8 shows the history of the vertical motion obtained from the model test and that predicted numerically their corresponding spectra are revealed in fig 9 compared with the value obtained by linear numerical prediction the spectral energy of vertical motion obtained from the model test at the dominant frequency of the incident wave is slightly smaller which may be related to the decay coefficients applied in the numerical simulations a much stronger response of the vertical motion is observed from the model test in the low frequency range owing to the excitations caused by the non linear interaction of different frequencies noting that the wave probes measuring the run up and air gap responses were installed on the semi model the data measured by them are actually within the relative coordinates which move with the model therefore significant slow drift vertical motions are involved in the run up and air gap responses as a result when post processing the wave run up and air gap data obtained from the model tests the components of the vertical motions should be entirely removed from the measured data the net surface elevations at the specified wave probe locations can then be obtained accordingly based on which the local non linearities of the wave run up and air gap responses are analysed in the next section 3 3 local non linearity in this section we look at the properties of extreme non linear wave elevation responses for the run up and air gap the linear absolute surface elevation ζ linear t can be easily obtained from the incident waves and the ltfs of the surface elevations have been discussed in section 3 3 in order to examine the local non linearity of the extreme wave run up and air gap responses under irregular waves we adopted the idea of newwave analysis taylor et al 1997 zhao et al 2018b to obtain averaged extreme surface elevations during the process of calculating the averaged extreme responses the averaged incident waves can be obtained simultaneously for the same time interval the linear surface elevation ζ linear t can be calculated accordingly by combining the averaged incident waves obtained from the model tests and the ltf obtained from the numerical simulations then the non linear surface elevation can be determined by subtracting the linear results from the overall measured data comparisons of the surface elevations at the positions of the run up and air gap gauges are presented in fig 10 the extreme non linear run up response is found to be almost at the same level as the linear run up response the extreme non linear air gap response is smaller though it is still comparable with its linear response the averaged time histories of the non linear responses reveal that both the run up and air gap responses show smaller oscillation periods which correspond to higher frequency components in the spectra see fig 11 two peaks in the spectra appear in both the run up and air gap responses at the frequencies of around 0 7 rad s and 0 94 rad s the frequency components of the run up response up to 1 4 rad s are observed to be excited by the incident waves for non linear surface elevation we assume that only the second order contributions are included the application of the qtf may be one possible way of modelling such second order responses qtfs can correlate the second order response with the spectral components of the incident waves the second order elevation response components can be expressed by eq 4 based on the quadratic sum term ζ r 2 and the quadratic difference term ζ r 2 4 ζ n o n l i n e a r t ζ r 2 ζ r 2 ζ r 2 ζ r 2 and ζ r 2 can then be formally written as 5 ζ r 2 i 1 n j 1 n a i a j t i j c cos ω i ω j t θ i θ j a i a j t i j s sin ω i ω j t θ i θ j 6 ζ r 2 i 1 n j 1 n a i a j t i j c cos ω i ω j t θ i θ j a i a j t i j s sin ω i ω j t θ i θ j where the coefficients t i j c t i j s t i j c and t i j s are interpreted as qtfs which are independent of the amplitudes but are functions of the frequencies of incident waves say ω i and ω j in this section considering that the second order responses are dominated at higher frequencies as shown in fig 11 the assumption shall be made that the quadratic sum frequency interactions represent the main contributions to the second order responses based on this assumption the difference term in eq 4 is neglected it is clear that the qtf coefficients in eq 6 make up two dependent n n matrixes for a broadband spectrum with n frequency components taylor et al taylor et al 2007 introduced an approximation to the qtf matrix of the quadratic sum term so that the qtf displays a flat shape the results for the flat qtf approximation were showed to be fairly close to the full matrix solutions for the wave excitations around the column matrix therefore by applying the flat qtf approximation one may greatly reduce the number of lengthy qtf calculations needed for second order interactions between frequency components without significantly compromising the quality of results based on the flat qtf approximation the contribution of each frequency pair ω i and ω k i to the frequency component ω k is identical the quadratic sum term in eq 6 can be rewritten as 7 ζ r 2 k 2 n t k c i 1 k 1 a i a k i cos ω i ω k i t θ i θ k i t k s i 1 k 1 a i a k i sin ω i ω k i t θ i θ k i the number of unknown coefficients in each matrix can be reduced from n 2 to n which makes it possible to obtain the approximate qtf structure from the model test data fig 12 shows the module of the qtf for each pair of incident frequency components in the ranges 0 3 rad s ω i ω j 1 0 rad s and 0 4 rad s ω i ω j 1 0 rad s for the run up response and their corresponding 2d plots along the diagonal it is clearly revealed that a ridge with a high amplitude appears perpendicular to the leading diagonal at the frequency pairs around ω i ω j 0 647 rad s which corresponds to the trapped mode shown in fig 6 and table 1 that means that the trapped mode would excite the second order response as well there are other trapped modes which can excite the large response of the run up but these are less obvious in fig 12 we therefore shrink the plot to the range 0 4 rad s ω i ω j 1 0 rad s so that the less obvious ridges can be easily recognised see fig 12 these distinct ridges in the module qtfs for the run up appear close to the frequencies corresponding to the trapped modes predicted earlier 4 conclusions a series of model tests with irregular waves was conducted to investigate the wave run up and air gap responses for a semi submersible platform the aspects affecting the extreme run up and air gap responses under irregular waves such as trapped modes motion coupling and local non linearity were studied we demonstrated the effects of near trapped modes and structural motions a methodology to post process the measured surface elevations is provided by which the components from the motion coupling and linear and non linear surface elevations can be decomposed this methodology is valuable when applied to the study of a real field as the run up and air gap responses in a real field are normally measured by a point measurement sensor the frequencies where the peaks appear in the ltfs are related to the near trapped modes violent responses can be excited due to the near trapping phenomenon when the incident waves have frequencies close to the near trapped modes the vertical motion due to the slow drift heave and pitch motions is shown to be very important to the run up and air gap responses the second order non linearity plays an important role in the wave run up phenomenon whereas it exhibits a relatively weak effect on the air gap in this study which may be due to the fact that the wave gauge was not placed in the most violent locations for near trapped modes the structure of the qtfs was also obtained in this study based on flat qtf assumption and from it the coupling between the frequency components was demonstrated moreover the strong responses at the sum frequency components may be related to the interactions among the near trapped modes which may lead to the surface amplification beneath the lower deck of a semi submersible by applying the approach semi submersible geometrical features where near trapped mode excitation is significant can be found credit authorship

conducted to verify the natural period of the platform motions and obtain the damping coefficients 3 1 validation of the experimental set up the extinction curves of the decay tests for heave roll and pitch motions are presented in fig 3 from which the non dimensional linear damping coefficients can be obtained based on eq 1 1 μ 2 ν ω 0 c ω 0 m a c k m a where μ is the non dimensional linear damping coefficient obtained from decay tests 2ν and ω 0 represents the damping coefficient and natural frequency and m a c and k refer to the total mass damping and stiffness of a floating system the typo t 0 in fig 3 represents the natural period for each degree of freedom of motions the static horizontal stiffness of the whole system was measured through static offset tests as shown in fig 4 the curve of restoring force versus horizontal offset of the overall mooring system was recorded and compared with the calculated target curves the comparison revealed a good agreement which confirmed the modelling of the mooring lines the experimental results are presented at the prototype scale throughout this paper tests in waves were conducted after the confirmation of the experimental set up the spectra of the undisturbed incident waves jonswap spectrum in the absence of the model and the corresponding run up air gap responses are presented in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 both the run up and air gap response spectra are broader than the incident wave spectrum the wave energies of the run up air gap response are prominently excited at higher frequency components it is obvious that the run up responses for frequencies ranging from 0 45 rad s to 0 6 rad s or higher than 0 8 rad s are much stronger than the air gap responses nearly the same spectral peaks appear at frequencies lower than 0 3 rad s in the figure which is attributed to the vertical motion corresponding to the heave and pitch motions at the positions of the wave probes the evidence for this is provided in the sections below it is also worth paying close attention to the phenomenon of near trapped modes which are likely to cause a violent response in this case the modes are very close to those of pure trapping the imaginary component of the wavenumber is equal to zero which means that little energy at this mode is radiated out to infinity in this research we first investigate the linear excitation of such near trapped modes the white noise wave signal was used as the incident wave in the commercial linear diffraction radiation code hydrod deepc the linear transfer function ltf of the absolute surface elevations and the run up air gap response can be easily obtained by numerical calculations as shown in fig 6 the linear run up response shows almost the same pattern as that of the absolute surface elevation for frequencies higher than 0 5 rad s which is along expected lines since the hull motions are relatively slow compared with the wave motion the same trend has been observed with the air gap response as well three tall peaks appear in both the run up and air gap responses at certain frequencies which align well with the natural frequencies of the motions of the moored floating system the ltf of the water surface elevations with respect to calm water converges to 1 for long waves which is not surprising owing to little diffraction effect when the wavelength becomes so short that the column can be treated as an infinite vertical wall diffraction starts playing an important role as the wavenumber increases the wavelength becomes comparable to the column width which means that the scattered wave cannot be neglected several peaks can be observed with the increase in wavenumber which are related to the trapped modes in front of the heading column more evident wiggles which correspond to the trapped modes are found in the ltf of the absolute surface elevation for the air gap response than in the ltf for the run up response that means that the extreme air gap response would more likely be excited by the trapped mode of the array of columns nevertheless the ltf of the absolute surface elevation for the air gap response always oscillates around 1 throughout the frequency range considered in this study the total transfer function ttf can be obtained through spectral analysis of the experimental data shown in fig 6 the transfer functions obtained from the experiments are only presented for the frequency range 0 3 rad s to 1 2 rad s as the input energy of the incident wave is too small which may produce distortions in the plot it is found that the run up responses to the incident waves are much stronger than those predicted by linear calculations for frequencies higher than about 0 6 rad s whereas the linear predictions match fairly well with the experimental results in the frequency range 0 3 rad s to 0 6 rad s for the air gap response a deviation between the ltf and the experimental results appears for frequencies higher than 0 849 rad s which is observed to be much smaller than that for the run up response from both the ltf comparisons fig 6 we may verify that the second order response plays a significant role in both the run up and air gap responses therefore obtaining the ltf directly from the spectra of the incident waves and responses may not be appropriate the qtf should be taken into consideration 3 2 motion coupling the wave run up and air gap are regarded as the relative elevation based on the coordinates fixed on the platform and expressed as 2 χ t ζ l i n e a r t ζ n o n l i n e a r t δ t where χ t is the total run up and air gap response which is also called upwell ζ l i n e a r t is the linear absolute surface elevation ζ n o n l i n e a r t is the non linear absolute surface elevation and δ t is the vertical motion at the specific position concerning the run up and air gap referring to eq 2 the vertical motions of the platform exhibit significant influences on the run up and air gap responses especially for the slow drift motion components in the vertical plane the vertical motion at a specific position on a platform can be obtained by coordinate rigid body transformation 3 δ t ξ 3 t y sin ξ 4 t x sin ξ 5 t where ξ 3 t ξ 4 t and ξ 5 t correspond to the heave roll and pitch motions at the centre of the gravity cog of the platform x and y refer to the horizontal positions relative to the cog in engineering practice it is a challenge to numerically predict the effects of the slow drift motion coupling at a certain sea state linear theory may normally be a sufficiently accurate way of predicting the wave frequency components of platform motions though it cannot consider the slow drift components due to non linear interactions fig 7 shows the transfer functions of the vertical motion obtained by linear numerical prediction and experimentation the numerical simulations were conducted with the damping coefficients obtained from the decay tests the ttf of the vertical motion agrees well with the experimental results for the wave frequency range 0 3 rad s to 1 0 rad s the two peaks shown in the numerical results are related to the contributions of the heave and pitch motions however the slow drift motions induced by the non linear difference frequency interaction should be considered when investigating the extreme run up and air gap responses fig 8 shows the history of the vertical motion obtained from the model test and that predicted numerically their corresponding spectra are revealed in fig 9 compared with the value obtained by linear numerical prediction the spectral energy of vertical motion obtained from the model test at the dominant frequency of the incident wave is slightly smaller which may be related to the decay coefficients applied in the numerical simulations a much stronger response of the vertical motion is observed from the model test in the low frequency range owing to the excitations caused by the non linear interaction of different frequencies noting that the wave probes measuring the run up and air gap responses were installed on the semi model the data measured by them are actually within the relative coordinates which move with the model therefore significant slow drift vertical motions are involved in the run up and air gap responses as a result when post processing the wave run up and air gap data obtained from the model tests the components of the vertical motions should be entirely removed from the measured data the net surface elevations at the specified wave probe locations can then be obtained accordingly based on which the local non linearities of the wave run up and air gap responses are analysed in the next section 3 3 local non linearity in this section we look at the properties of extreme non linear wave elevation responses for the run up and air gap the linear absolute surface elevation ζ linear t can be easily obtained from the incident waves and the ltfs of the surface elevations have been discussed in section 3 3 in order to examine the local non linearity of the extreme wave run up and air gap responses under irregular waves we adopted the idea of newwave analysis taylor et al 1997 zhao et al 2018b to obtain averaged extreme surface elevations during the process of calculating the averaged extreme responses the averaged incident waves can be obtained simultaneously for the same time interval the linear surface elevation ζ linear t can be calculated accordingly by combining the averaged incident waves obtained from the model tests and the ltf obtained from the numerical simulations then the non linear surface elevation can be determined by subtracting the linear results from the overall measured data comparisons of the surface elevations at the positions of the run up and air gap gauges are presented in fig 10 the extreme non linear run up response is found to be almost at the same level as the linear run up response the extreme non linear air gap response is smaller though it is still comparable with its linear response the averaged time histories of the non linear responses reveal that both the run up and air gap responses show smaller oscillation periods which correspond to higher frequency components in the spectra see fig 11 two peaks in the spectra appear in both the run up and air gap responses at the frequencies of around 0 7 rad s and 0 94 rad s the frequency components of the run up response up to 1 4 rad s are observed to be excited by the incident waves for non linear surface elevation we assume that only the second order contributions are included the application of the qtf may be one possible way of modelling such second order responses qtfs can correlate the second order response with the spectral components of the incident waves the second order elevation response components can be expressed by eq 4 based on the quadratic sum term ζ r 2 and the quadratic difference term ζ r 2 4 ζ n o n l i n e a r t ζ r 2 ζ r 2 ζ r 2 ζ r 2 and ζ r 2 can then be formally written as 5 ζ r 2 i 1 n j 1 n a i a j t i j c cos ω i ω j t θ i θ j a i a j t i j s sin ω i ω j t θ i θ j 6 ζ r 2 i 1 n j 1 n a i a j t i j c cos ω i ω j t θ i θ j a i a j t i j s sin ω i ω j t θ i θ j where the coefficients t i j c t i j s t i j c and t i j s are interpreted as qtfs which are independent of the amplitudes but are functions of the frequencies of incident waves say ω i and ω j in this section considering that the second order responses are dominated at higher frequencies as shown in fig 11 the assumption shall be made that the quadratic sum frequency interactions represent the main contributions to the second order responses based on this assumption the difference term in eq 4 is neglected it is clear that the qtf coefficients in eq 6 make up two dependent n n matrixes for a broadband spectrum with n frequency components taylor et al taylor et al 2007 introduced an approximation to the qtf matrix of the quadratic sum term so that the qtf displays a flat shape the results for the flat qtf approximation were showed to be fairly close to the full matrix solutions for the wave excitations around the column matrix therefore by applying the flat qtf approximation one may greatly reduce the number of lengthy qtf calculations needed for second order interactions between frequency components without significantly compromising the quality of results based on the flat qtf approximation the contribution of each frequency pair ω i and ω k i to the frequency component ω k is identical the quadratic sum term in eq 6 can be rewritten as 7 ζ r 2 k 2 n t k c i 1 k 1 a i a k i cos ω i ω k i t θ i θ k i t k s i 1 k 1 a i a k i sin ω i ω k i t θ i θ k i the number of unknown coefficients in each matrix can be reduced from n 2 to n which makes it possible to obtain the approximate qtf structure from the model test data fig 12 shows the module of the qtf for each pair of incident frequency components in the ranges 0 3 rad s ω i ω j 1 0 rad s and 0 4 rad s ω i ω j 1 0 rad s for the run up response and their corresponding 2d plots along the diagonal it is clearly revealed that a ridge with a high amplitude appears perpendicular to the leading diagonal at the frequency pairs around ω i ω j 0 647 rad s which corresponds to the trapped mode shown in fig 6 and table 1 that means that the trapped mode would excite the second order response as well there are other trapped modes which can excite the large response of the run up but these are less obvious in fig 12 we therefore shrink the plot to the range 0 4 rad s ω i ω j 1 0 rad s so that the less obvious ridges can be easily recognised see fig 12 these distinct ridges in the module qtfs for the run up appear close to the frequencies corresponding to the trapped modes predicted earlier 4 conclusions a series of model tests with irregular waves was conducted to investigate the wave run up and air gap responses for a semi submersible platform the aspects affecting the extreme run up and air gap responses under irregular waves such as trapped modes motion coupling and local non linearity were studied we demonstrated the effects of near trapped modes and structural motions a methodology to post process the measured surface elevations is provided by which the components from the motion coupling and linear and non linear surface elevations can be decomposed this methodology is valuable when applied to the study of a real field as the run up and air gap responses in a real field are normally measured by a point measurement sensor the frequencies where the peaks appear in the ltfs are related to the near trapped modes violent responses can be excited due to the near trapping phenomenon when the incident waves have frequencies close to the near trapped modes the vertical motion due to the slow drift heave and pitch motions is shown to be very important to the run up and air gap responses the second order non linearity plays an important role in the wave run up phenomenon whereas it exhibits a relatively weak effect on the air gap in this study which may be due to the fact that the wave gauge was not placed in the most violent locations for near trapped modes the structure of the qtfs was also obtained in this study based on flat qtf assumption and from it the coupling between the frequency components was demonstrated moreover the strong responses at the sum frequency components may be related to the interactions among the near trapped modes which may lead to the surface amplification beneath the lower deck of a semi submersible by applying the approach semi submersible geometrical features where near trapped mode excitation is significant can be found credit authorship

21963,efficient hydrofoil design is a massive challenge for the current turbine blade designers flow separation on the suction side of the hydrofoil reduces the hydrodynamic performance of the current

has a valuable source of energy to provide the increasing energy demand of the world the renewable energy production units are environmentally friendly compare to conventional energy production units in terms of environmental perspective the most common renewable energy sources are bioenergy hydropower solar energy wind energy and geothermal energy among these renewable sources the current tidal energy is not appropriately exploited until now therefore there is a tremendous opportunity to utilize this energy different contemporary turbine designs are used to extract more power from the river tidal current however the complicated installation methods and the high initial cost are the few constraints to avoid this energy generation method by the industry therefore the current turbine must be designed for maximum efficiency to extract the most substantial amount of energy from river current tidal wave and to make the generation of electricity from current power economically feasible for the power generation industry the blade is the main component of a current turbine the hydrodynamic performance of hydrofoil directly affects the life span and efficiency of the turbine blade therefore efficient foil design is the primary concern to improve the hydrodynamic performance and to provide the structural strength of the hydrofoil in this study naca s1210 which has been used for horizontal axis current turbines goundar et al 2012 used as a baseline profile usually the pressure gradient has been taken as zero when the flow passes over the flat plate however when there is a pressure gradient over solid bodies i e curved surface free stream velocity changes if the pressure gradient is negative then it is a favorable condition for flow however when the pressure gradient becomes positive fluid velocity decreases velocity inside the boundary layer also decreases at a certain time fluid attains zero velocity this streamline having zero velocity cannot move in the forward direction so it separates from the path this phenomenon is termed as boundary layer separation in the case of a properly designed hydrofoil the boundary layer separation should be prevented or delayed prandtl pioneered the modern use of flow control and introduced the boundary layer theory prandtl 1904 explained the mechanics of steady two dimensional separation and eventually described several experiments in which the boundary layer was controlled after that many researchers cattafesta and sheplak 2011 ma et al 2019 zong et al 2018 beyhaghi and amano 2018 kundu 2019 zao et al 2019 ismail and vijayaraghavan 2015 shukla and kaviti 2017a schatz et al 2004 wang and zhuang 2017 lin et al 1991 2016 rumsey and ying 2002 weick and platt 1933 kruger 1947 yavuz et al 2015 olsman and colonius 2011 taylor 1947 wang et al 2017 martínez filgueira et al 2017 zhen et al 2011 gageik et al 2018 lishu and zhide 2011 delnero et al 2012 lishu et al 2011 baldacchino et al 2018 lin 1999 mueller vahl et al 2012 hansen et al 2016 godard and stanislas 2006 velte and hansen 2013 manolesos and voutsinas 2015a gao et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 xu et al 2014 kundu et al 2019 proposed different flow control methods for various applications in recent years these approaches can be divided into two types of flow separation control techniques active flow separation control and passive flow separation control active flow separation control techniques are based on putting energy into the flow while passive control techniques do not induce energy in the system in practice active flow separation control can lead to higher lift performance improvements compared to passive techniques often at the cost of the increased complexity of the system the active flow control techniques classiﬁed into the following solutions fluidic actuator moving object surface plasma actuator cattafesta and sheplak 2011 ma et al 2019 zong et al 2018 besides active flow control methods various forms of passive flow separation control techniques are available in the literature beyhaghi and amano 2018 kundu 2019 zao et al 2019 ismail and vijayaraghavan 2015 shukla and kaviti 2017a schatz et al 2004 wang and zhuang 2017 lin et al 1991 2016 rumsey and ying 2002 weick and platt 1933 kruger 1947 yavuz et al 2015 olsman and colonius 2011 taylor 1947 wang et al 2017 martínez filgueira et al

velte and hansen 2013 manolesos and voutsinas 2015a gao et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 xu et al 2014 kundu et al 2019 unlike active flow control no direct energy is brought into the system meaning that passive flow control is solely based on mixing high momentum fluid to areas of low momentum hence to boundary layers that are on the verge of separation a narrow span wise rectangular slot at the leading edge for the naca 4412 has been proposed in beyhaghi and amano 2018 the lift coefficient was increased by 30 without sacrificing the drag inserting tubes in an aero hydrofoil at a constant spacing connecting the fluid near the leading edge and a downstream location on the suction side was another novel approach that was numerically investigated in kundu 2019 the numerical and experimental work was conducted at different angles of attack at a reynolds number of 105 in zao et al 2019 to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of the slotted hydrofoil in the presence of the free surface a gurney flap gf with an inward dimple on the pressure side near the trailing edge of naca0015 aerofoil was designed by ismail and vijayaraghavan 2015 and found that the average increase of tangential force was increased by 35 in the steady state case compared to baseline aerofoil the effect of dimple gurney flap and combined effect of gurney flap with a dimple on different symmetric aerofoil has been discussed in shukla and kaviti 2017a a self activated movable flap was designed to enhance the lift by more than 10 in schatz et al 2004 leading edge serration wang and zhuang 2017 and wave like trailing edge lin et al 2016 was proposed recently to control the flow separation many researchers rumsey and ying 2002 weick and platt 1933 kruger 1947 yavuz et al 2015 suggested leading edge slat to delay the flow separation at low relative speed the aerofoil with cavity was proposed to reduce the strength of the separated vortex in olsman and colonius 2011 the most common passive flow control technology in literature is the vortex generator to improve the stall characteristics of the foil various researchers investigated the vortex generator s effects on different aerofoil profile and found better results compared to the baseline aerofoil in the late 1940s the first time conventional vane type of vortex generators has been introduced on the airfoil surface by taylor 1947 after that many researchers tried on different kinds of vortex generators on the aerofoil surface to enhance the performance of the foil the optimization study of vortex generators for specific applications is still going on few optimization studies have been discussed in this section wang et al 2017 martínez filgueira et al 2017 zhen et al 2011 gageik et al 2018 lishu and zhide 2011 delnero et al 2012 lishu et al 2011 baldacchino et al 2018 lin et al 1991 lin 1999 mueller vahl et al 2012 hansen et al 2016 godard and stanislas 2006 velte and hansen 2013 manolesos and voutsinas 2015a the aerodynamic performance of the s809 airfoil with and without vg has been discussed in wang et al 2017 the results showed that the arrangement of twin vg showed the better performance to control flow separation the effects of low profile vgs on vortices in a flat plate boundary layer has been examined in martínez filgueira et al 2017 and proposed the feasibility of low profile vg for boundary layer flow control the performance of rectangular and curved edge vg is better than that of triangular vg has been concluded in zhen et al 2011 the unstable waves were identified in the separated boundary layer using a numerical visualization method in gageik et al 2018 and found that micro vg can suppress the pressure waves which eventually improve the performance of the foil from the experimental results presented in lishu and zhide 2011 it has been concluded that the combination of green flaps and vg can significantly improve the performance of the airfoil the various experimental study has been conducted in delnero et al 2012 lishu et al 2011 baldacchino et al 2018 to visualize the effects of vgs on suppressing airfoil flow separation three different types of vortex generating devices submerged vortex generators large eddy breakup devices and vortex generator jets were examined in lin et al 1991 vortex generator jets proposed to be the best vortex generating device out of these three micro vortex generator height of the vortex generators are less than the boundary layer thickness was proposed in lin 1999 and it has been found that the glide ratio increment was 100 at near flight reynolds number the effects of vgs position size and spanwise spacing were studied in mueller vahl et al 2012 the best excellent place of vgs to delay the flow separation on the suction side of the hydrofoil was at the trailing edge recently aerodynamically shaped vortex generator was suggested by hansen et al 2016 the experimental studies on different aerofoil were conducted to optimize the vortex generator s design in godard and stanislas 2006 velte and hansen 2013 manolesos and voutsinas 2015a besides the flow control of the corresponding foil providing structural strength of the hydrofoil is also an essential requirement for the current turbine blade design many researchers gao et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 xu et al 2014 kundu et al 2019 suggested better design of the aerofoil to provide sufficient strength the blunt trailing edge aerofoil with vgs was analyzed in gao et al 2015 and found that the drag force increment due to the increase of vg height is more than the lift force different blunt trailing edge airfoil design was proposed by zhang et al 2009 symmetric airfoil with a blunt trailing edge was discussed in xu et al 2014 it was suggested that the optimum thickness of the blunt trailing edge was 5 of the chord length a comparison of the blunt trailing edge and circular trailing was discussed in kundu et al 2019 the results showed that the circular trailing edge of s1210 hydrofoil improved the performance of the foil compared to the blunt trailing edge and baseline hydrofoil in this study the profile performance is solely dependent on the hydrodynamic force coefficients any effect due to the tip leakage vortex such as liu and tan 2019 liu and tan 2018a liu et al 2019 liu and tan 2018b is not included here although many researchers have studied the flow control mechanism of passive flow control there are still many problems related to the application of passive flow control of horizontal axis current turbine blades for example the optimum vg positions geometric parameters of vg the concept behind the two different flow mechanism vgs to energize the flow anderson 2010 bender et al 1999 and the tube to trapped the vortex rossow 1978 methods to increase the lift force combined effects of different passive flow control methods and the structural improvement aspects of the hydrofoil etc vortex generators are the only established passive flow control method to delay the boundary layer separation on the airfoil the substantial work has not to be done until now to improve the structural strength as well as hydrodynamic performance improvement of the hydrofoil therefore in this study the main objective is to propose a modified hydrofoil that will improve the hydrodynamic performances as well as the structural strength of the blade for that the combined effects of vgs with dimple and tubes with dimple has been proposed here 2 naca s1210 hydrofoil and its modifications for the flow control study in this work three different passive flow control methods vgs dimple tubes have been considered for the blade design s1210 profile has been considered here as the baseline profile for the investigation as it has produced a high lift to drag ratio the chord length of the naca s1210 profile is taken as 1 0 m the geometry of the baseline profile is presented in fig 1 the discrete span length of each section is considered for the hydrofoil study is 0 14 m the geometry of vortex generators and tubes parameters are presented in figs 2 and 3 the values of some other variables of vortex generators and tubes are presented in table 1 the inward and outward dimples 1 5 of c as a radius and fixed at 90 of c with vgs and tubes are shown in fig 4 3 working principles of this passive flow control methods the working principles of vgs and tubes are different the brief discussion of these flow control techniques is presented in sections 3 1 and 3 2 3 1 vortex generators vortex generators create artificial vortices on the suction side of the hydrofoil to mix the outer region water flow with the boundary region flow it energizes the fluid motion which lost its momentum at a higher angle of attack as a consequence the presence of vortex generators delays or reduces the flow separation which eventually improves the hydrodynamic performance of the hydrofoil based on the joukowski lift theorem and thin aerofoil theory anderson 2010 a suitable model bay model bender et al 1999 has been developed to understand the flow physics due to the presence of vortex generators in this model the

suction side is provided to remove the water from the core region in order to organize the angular momentum into a vortex and to hold or trap the vortex on the suction side of the hydrofoil the low pressure in the surrounding of the vortex produces the lift enhancement of the foil lift enhancement due to externally trapped vortex has been described in rossow 1978 4 computational domain and meshing the computational domain is shown in fig 5 the large domain size has been considered to avoid the boundaries affect the boundary was located at 12 5 times and 25 times the chord length away from the hydrofoil at leading and trailing edge respectively velocity inlet and pressure outlet boundary conditions have been considered for the study the hydrofoil surface has been set as a no slip wall condition the nonstructured grid has been used in the whole domain except hydrofoil surroundings the structured mesh surrounding the hydrofoil has been used to capture the boundary layer effects on the hydrofoil the average orthogonal quality of the mesh is 0 92 which signifies the good quality mesh for this study fuglsang et al 2003 the y value has been calculated based on inflation layer

are presented in figs 7 and 8 respectively the results obtained from the current simulations are matching satisfactorily therefore the above set up was used as the base set up throughout this study 8 results and discussion in blade element momentum theory glauert 1935 1959 the blade has been divided into a number of sections and all the forces have been calculated individually for each section the summation of all the forces on the individual section provides the total force acting on the single blade fig 9 a represents a small section of the blade at a distance of r from the hub the corresponding forces acting on the blade are shown in fig 9b gundtoft 2009 the coefficient of lift cl coefficient of drag cd and glide ratio gr is calculated as eqs 18 20 18 c l f l 1 2 ρ w 2 b c 19 c d f d 1 2 ρ w 2 b c 20 glide ratio gr c l c d the axial force dt and the torque du on a blade element with the radius r and the thickness dr has been calculated using eqs 21 and 22 21 d t 1 2 ρ w 2 c b c y d r 22 d u 1 2 ρ w 2 c b c x r d r where 23 c x c l sin ϕ c d cos ϕ 24 c y c l cos ϕ c d sin ϕ then the power produced is given in eq 25 25 d p d u r ω where ω is the angular speed of the current turbine is given by eq 26 26 ω 2 π n n the rotational speed of the current turbine that s why force coefficients lift coefficient cl the drag coefficient cd and the glide ratio gr results are analyzed to make a decision on the performance of the hydrofoil 8 1 hydrodynamic performance of hydrofoil with tubes and dimple the results in fig 10 a shows that the lift coefficient for the modified hydrofoil is higher compared to the baseline configuration at a higher angle of attack above 6 the drag coefficient fig 10b value at a lower angle of attack up to 8 is almost identical for all the hydrofoil design the drag coefficient values for modified hydrofoil are always lower compared to the baseline hydrofoil at a higher angle of attack above 8 from the above results it has been concluded that the lift forces are increases due to the presence of the vgs and tubes but at the same time the drag forces also decrease therefore the study of glide ratio is more relevant for giving the final conclusion of the performance of the hydrofoil the glide ratio results fig 11 are higher for the modified hydrofoil compared to the baseline foil at a higher angle of attack above 6 the maximum percentage increment of the glide ratio is 132 at an angle of attack of 12 for the hydrofoil with an outward dimple hence it can be concluded that the combined effects of dimple and tubes provide better performance compared to baseline hydrofoil the tangential and normal force coefficients are shown in fig 12 the tangential force and torque coefficient are identical for 2 d hydrofoil as can be seen from fig 12 the tangential force coefficients of hydrofoil s1210 are increased due to the profile modifications the increments are more at a higher angle of attack the maximum increment of tangential force has been found at 14 angles of attack the percentage increment of tangential forces compare to baseline hydrofoil is 14 8 29 6 41 4 at an angle of attack of 10 12 and 14 respectively 8 2 hydrodynamic performance of hydrofoil with vgs and dimple the combined effects of vgs and dimple on hydrodynamic characteristics of the hydrofoil are obtained for a different angle of attack and its comparison with baseline hydrofoil is shown in figs 13 and 14 the results in fig 13a shows that the lift coefficient for the modified hydrofoil is higher compared to the baseline hydrofoil irrespective of the angle of attack the stall angle is increased from 10 to 12 the maximum percentage increment of the lift coefficient is 15 for outward dimple with vgs hydrofoil compare to baseline hydrofoil at an angle of attack of 12 the drag coefficient fig 13b values are always lower compared to the baseline hydrofoil at a higher angle of attack above 10 at a lower angle of attack up to 10 the coefficient of drag values is higher for hydrofoil with inward dimple and vgs the glide ratio values fig 14 are higher for the modified hydrofoil compared to the baseline foil irrespective of the angle of attack the percentage increment of the glide ratio for the combined effects of vgs and dimple is 22 144 94 at an angle of attack of 10 12 and 14 respectively the tangential and normal force coefficients are shown in fig 15 it can be noticed that the peak tangential force coefficient has been increased almost by 39 at an angle of attack of 14 the inward dimple with vgs and outward dimple with vgs tangential force coefficient results are almost identical 8 3 analysis of the coefficient of pressure the pressure coefficients for the modified hydrofoil at an angle of attack of 12 are presented in fig 16 due to the effects of tubes vgs and dimple the integration areas of the pressure coefficient increase in comparison to the clean hydrofoil the integration area on the pressure coefficient curve represents the lift force generated by the hydrofoil at a specific angle of attack it is clear from fig 16 that coefficient of pressure curve for the baseline hydrofoil is smooth on both sides suction and pressure side of the hydrofoil on the other hand there is a peak point on the suction side of the modified hydrofoil this increment is due to the addition of vgs and tubes outlet on the suction side at 0 7c of the hydrofoil the coefficient of pressure variation due to the presence of inward or outward dimple on the pressure side of the hydrofoil at 0 9c is not affected that much the coefficient of pressure values for baseline hydrofoil is overlapping with the coefficient values for the hydrofoil with a dimple from this it has been concluded that dimple on the pressure side 0 9c of the hydrofoil does not contribute to improving the hydrodynamic performance of the hydrofoil rather it increase or decrease the strength of the blade further studies are required to verify the strength of the hydrofoil in the presence of inward or outward dimple 8 4 analysis of horizontal velocity and velocity vortex the horizontal velocity profiles on the suction side of the foil with and without modifications are compared in figs 17 and 18 at four different chordwise locations 0 2c 0 4c 0 6c and 0 8c at an angle of attack of 12 the thickness of the boundary layer is reduced by the presence of vgs tubes and dimple hence the expected benefit from the tube slots can be noticed from the tangential velocity component point of view as well velocity vortex core region of outward dimple with vgs and tube has been presented in fig 19 fig 19 shows the three dimensional velocity vortex structure induced by vgs and tubes at 10 and 12 angles of attack two different flow phenomenon has been clearly visible from fig 19 that the lower pressure region at the trailing edge for the hydrofoil with vgs is lower compare to the hydrofoil with tubes that justifies the fact that the inclusion of vgs energizes the flow at the downstream region while hydrofoil with tube trapped the vortex to increase the hydrodynamic performance of the foil 8 5 location of separation points on baseline profile and analysis of flow field the skin friction coefficient over the foil surface can be expressed as in eq 27 the value of the skin friction coefficient at the separation point is zero 27 c f τ ω 1 2 ρ u 2 where τ ω the local wall shear stress the flow separation on the clean baseline hydrofoil at different angles of attack is shown in fig 20 the flow separation point is shifted from the trailing edge towards the leading edge with an increasing angle of attack these significant changes in the flow characteristic considerably affect the performance of the hydrofoil beyond 12 angles of attack hence the profile has modified to overcome this flow separation which eventually improves the performance of the hydrofoil in order to further explain the hydrodynamic performance of the modified hydrofoil the flow field around the hydrofoil has been analyzed fig 21 shows the comparison of two dimensional streamlines between baseline hydrofoil and modified hydrofoil at an angle of attack of 12 from fig 21 a significant amount of flow separation is observed for the baseline hydrofoil while the hydrofoil with vgs and dimple exhibits attached flow on the other hand hydrofoil with tubes and dimple trapped the vortex on the suction side of the hydrofoil this trapped vortex is increased the lift coefficient of the modified hydrofoil 8 6 effects of current velocity on the modified hydrofoil the effects of current velocity on hydrodynamic performance of modified hydrofoil have been investigated here for an initial investigation on the influence of the current velocity in the cross section the hydrofoil with dimple and vgs have been selected the current velocity has been considered as 0 5 m s the comparative study has been presented in figs 22 and 23 it has been found in fig 22a that the coefficient of lift is higher than the baseline profile the stall angle is also increased from 10 to 12 when the hydrofoil is modified with outward dimple and vgs the glide ratio values fig 23 is higher for the hydrofoil with outward dimple and vgs compared to the baseline foil a similar observation is also reported in section 8 2 where the current velocity is considered as 2 1 m s hence it can be concluded that outward dimple with vgs provides better solutions irrespective of current velocity 9 conclusions in this paper the combined effects of dimple with vgs and dimple with tubes is numerically investigated from the results presented here it can be concluded that hydrofoil with outward dimple with tubes vgs appears more effective compared to the baseline hydrofoil the coupled effects of outward dimple with vgs and outward dimple with tubes appear more effective compare to baseline hydrofoil maximum glide ratio increments are 132 and 144 at an angle of attack of 12 for outward dimple with tubes and outward dimple with vgs respectively hence in order to optimize the power output from a current turbine with the minimum possible thrust outward dimple with vgs and outward dimple with a tube at a regular interval are two proposed efficient methods acknowledgments the author would like to express the deepest gratitude and hearted acknowledgment to dr

has a valuable source of energy to provide the increasing energy demand of the world the renewable energy production units are environmentally friendly compare to conventional energy production units in terms of environmental perspective the most common renewable energy sources are bioenergy hydropower solar energy wind energy and geothermal energy among these renewable sources the current tidal energy is not appropriately exploited until now therefore there is a tremendous opportunity to utilize this energy different contemporary turbine designs are used to extract more power from the river tidal current however the complicated installation methods and the high initial cost are the few constraints to avoid this energy generation method by the industry therefore the current turbine must be designed for maximum efficiency to extract the most substantial amount of energy from river current tidal wave and to make the generation of electricity from current power economically feasible for the power generation industry the blade is the main component of a current turbine the hydrodynamic performance of hydrofoil directly affects the life span and efficiency of the turbine blade therefore efficient foil design is the primary concern to improve the hydrodynamic performance and to provide the structural strength of the hydrofoil in this study naca s1210 which has been used for horizontal axis current turbines goundar et al 2012 used as a baseline profile usually the pressure gradient has been taken as zero when the flow passes over the flat plate however when there is a pressure gradient over solid bodies i e curved surface free stream velocity changes if the pressure gradient is negative then it is a favorable condition for flow however when the pressure gradient becomes positive fluid velocity decreases velocity inside the boundary layer also decreases at a certain time fluid attains zero velocity this streamline having zero velocity cannot move in the forward direction so it separates from the path this phenomenon is termed as boundary layer separation in the case of a properly designed hydrofoil the boundary layer separation should be prevented or delayed prandtl pioneered the modern use of flow control and introduced the boundary layer theory prandtl 1904 explained the mechanics of steady two dimensional separation and eventually described several experiments in which the boundary layer was controlled after that many researchers cattafesta and sheplak 2011 ma et al 2019 zong et al 2018 beyhaghi and amano 2018 kundu 2019 zao et al 2019 ismail and vijayaraghavan 2015 shukla and kaviti 2017a schatz et al 2004 wang and zhuang 2017 lin et al 1991 2016 rumsey and ying 2002 weick and platt 1933 kruger 1947 yavuz et al 2015 olsman and colonius 2011 taylor 1947 wang et al 2017 martínez filgueira et al 2017 zhen et al 2011 gageik et al 2018 lishu and zhide 2011 delnero et al 2012 lishu et al 2011 baldacchino et al 2018 lin 1999 mueller vahl et al 2012 hansen et al 2016 godard and stanislas 2006 velte and hansen 2013 manolesos and voutsinas 2015a gao et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 xu et al 2014 kundu et al 2019 proposed different flow control methods for various applications in recent years these approaches can be divided into two types of flow separation control techniques active flow separation control and passive flow separation control active flow separation control techniques are based on putting energy into the flow while passive control techniques do not induce energy in the system in practice active flow separation control can lead to higher lift performance improvements compared to passive techniques often at the cost of the increased complexity of the system the active flow control techniques classiﬁed into the following solutions fluidic actuator moving object surface plasma actuator cattafesta and sheplak 2011 ma et al 2019 zong et al 2018 besides active flow control methods various forms of passive flow separation control techniques are available in the literature beyhaghi and amano 2018 kundu 2019 zao et al 2019 ismail and vijayaraghavan 2015 shukla and kaviti 2017a schatz et al 2004 wang and zhuang 2017 lin et al 1991 2016 rumsey and ying 2002 weick and platt 1933 kruger 1947 yavuz et al 2015 olsman and colonius 2011 taylor 1947 wang et al 2017 martínez filgueira et al 2017 zhen et al 2011 gageik et al 2018 lishu and zhide 2011 delnero et al 2012 lishu et al 2011 baldacchino et al 2018 lin 1999 mueller vahl et al 2012 hansen et al 2016 godard and stanislas 2006 velte and hansen 2013 manolesos and voutsinas 2015a gao et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 xu et al 2014 kundu et al 2019 unlike active flow control no direct energy is brought into the system meaning that passive flow control is solely based on mixing high momentum fluid to areas of low momentum hence to boundary layers that are on the verge of separation a narrow span wise rectangular slot at the leading edge for the naca 4412 has been proposed in beyhaghi and amano 2018 the lift coefficient was increased by 30 without sacrificing the drag inserting tubes in an aero hydrofoil at a constant spacing connecting the fluid near the leading edge and a downstream location on the suction side was another novel approach that was numerically investigated in kundu 2019 the numerical and experimental work was conducted at different angles of attack at a reynolds number of 105 in zao et al 2019 to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of the slotted hydrofoil in the presence of the free surface a gurney flap gf with an inward dimple on the pressure side near the trailing edge of naca0015 aerofoil was designed by ismail and vijayaraghavan 2015 and found that the average increase of tangential force was increased by 35 in the steady state case compared to baseline aerofoil the effect of dimple gurney flap and combined effect of gurney flap with a dimple on different symmetric aerofoil has been discussed in shukla and kaviti 2017a a self activated movable flap was designed to enhance the lift by more than 10 in schatz et al 2004 leading edge serration wang and zhuang 2017 and wave like trailing edge lin et al 2016 was proposed recently to control the flow separation many researchers rumsey and ying 2002 weick and platt 1933 kruger 1947 yavuz et al 2015 suggested leading edge slat to delay the flow separation at low relative speed the aerofoil with cavity was proposed to reduce the strength of the separated vortex in olsman and colonius 2011 the most common passive flow control technology in literature is the vortex generator to improve the stall characteristics of the foil various researchers investigated the vortex generator s effects on different aerofoil profile and found better results compared to the baseline aerofoil in the late 1940s the first time conventional vane type of vortex generators has been introduced on the airfoil surface by taylor 1947 after that many researchers tried on different kinds of vortex generators on the aerofoil surface to enhance the performance of the foil the optimization study of vortex generators for specific applications is still going on few optimization studies have been discussed in this section wang et al 2017 martínez filgueira et al 2017 zhen et al 2011 gageik et al 2018 lishu and zhide 2011 delnero et al 2012 lishu et al 2011 baldacchino et al 2018 lin et al 1991 lin 1999 mueller vahl et al 2012 hansen et al 2016 godard and stanislas 2006 velte and hansen 2013 manolesos and voutsinas 2015a the aerodynamic performance of the s809 airfoil with and without vg has been discussed in wang et al 2017 the results showed that the arrangement of twin vg showed the better performance to control flow separation the effects of low profile vgs on vortices in a flat plate boundary layer has been examined in martínez filgueira et al 2017 and proposed the feasibility of low profile vg for boundary layer flow control the performance of rectangular and curved edge vg is better than that of triangular vg has been concluded in zhen et al 2011 the unstable waves were identified in the separated boundary layer using a numerical visualization method in gageik et al 2018 and found that micro vg can suppress the pressure waves which eventually improve the performance of the foil from the experimental results presented in lishu and zhide 2011 it has been concluded that the combination of green flaps and vg can significantly improve the performance of the airfoil the various experimental study has been conducted in delnero et al 2012 lishu et al 2011 baldacchino et al 2018 to visualize the effects of vgs on suppressing airfoil flow separation three different types of vortex generating devices submerged vortex generators large eddy breakup devices and vortex generator jets were examined in lin et al 1991 vortex generator jets proposed to be the best vortex generating device out of these three micro vortex generator height of the vortex generators are less than the boundary layer thickness was proposed in lin 1999 and it has been found that the glide ratio increment was 100 at near flight reynolds number the effects of vgs position size and spanwise spacing were studied in mueller vahl et al 2012 the best excellent place of vgs to delay the flow separation on the suction side of the hydrofoil was at the trailing edge recently aerodynamically shaped vortex generator was suggested by hansen et al 2016 the experimental studies on different aerofoil were conducted to optimize the vortex generator s design in godard and stanislas 2006 velte and hansen 2013 manolesos and voutsinas 2015a besides the flow control of the corresponding foil providing structural strength of the hydrofoil is also an essential requirement for the current turbine blade design many researchers gao et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 xu et al 2014 kundu et al 2019 suggested better design of the aerofoil to provide sufficient strength the blunt trailing edge aerofoil with vgs was analyzed in gao et al 2015 and found that the drag force increment due to the increase of vg height is more than the lift force different blunt trailing edge airfoil design was proposed by zhang et al 2009 symmetric airfoil with a blunt trailing edge was discussed in xu et al 2014 it was suggested that the optimum thickness of the blunt trailing edge was 5 of the chord length a comparison of the blunt trailing edge and circular trailing was discussed in kundu et al 2019 the results showed that the circular trailing edge of s1210 hydrofoil improved the performance of the foil compared to the blunt trailing edge and baseline hydrofoil in this study the profile performance is solely dependent on the hydrodynamic force coefficients any effect due to the tip leakage vortex such as liu and tan 2019 liu and tan 2018a liu et al 2019 liu and tan 2018b is not included here although many researchers have studied the flow control mechanism of passive flow control there are still many problems related to the application of passive flow control of horizontal axis current turbine blades for example the optimum vg positions geometric parameters of vg the concept behind the two different flow mechanism vgs to energize the flow anderson 2010 bender et al 1999 and the tube to trapped the vortex rossow 1978 methods to increase the lift force combined effects of different passive flow control methods and the structural improvement aspects of the hydrofoil etc vortex generators are the only established passive flow control method to delay the boundary layer separation on the airfoil the substantial work has not to be done until now to improve the structural strength as well as hydrodynamic performance improvement of the hydrofoil therefore in this study the main objective is to propose a modified hydrofoil that will improve the hydrodynamic performances as well as the structural strength of the blade for that the combined effects of vgs with dimple and tubes with dimple has been proposed here 2 naca s1210 hydrofoil and its modifications for the flow control study in this work three different passive flow control methods vgs dimple tubes have been considered for the blade design s1210 profile has been considered here as the baseline profile for the investigation as it has produced a high lift to drag ratio the chord length of the naca s1210 profile is taken as 1 0 m the geometry of the baseline profile is presented in fig 1 the discrete span length of each section is considered for the hydrofoil study is 0 14 m the geometry of vortex generators and tubes parameters are presented in figs 2 and 3 the values of some other variables of vortex generators and tubes are presented in table 1 the inward and outward dimples 1 5 of c as a radius and fixed at 90 of c with vgs and tubes are shown in fig 4 3 working principles of this passive flow control methods the working principles of vgs and tubes are different the brief discussion of these flow control techniques is presented in sections 3 1 and 3 2 3 1 vortex generators vortex generators create artificial vortices on the suction side of the hydrofoil to mix the outer region water flow with the boundary region flow it energizes the fluid motion which lost its momentum at a higher angle of attack as a consequence the presence of vortex generators delays or reduces the flow separation which eventually improves the hydrodynamic performance of the hydrofoil based on the joukowski lift theorem and thin aerofoil theory anderson 2010 a suitable model bay model bender et al 1999 has been developed to understand the flow physics due to the presence of vortex generators in this model the lifting force source term l i has been added to the eqs 1 and 2 1 v i δ ρ u i δ t j f m j s j l i 2 v i δ ρ e i δ t j f e j s j u l i 3 l i c v g s v g v i v i α ρ u 2 l ˆ l ˆ is a unit vector in the direction of the lifting force acting on the flow v i is the volume of the grid cell svg is the planform area of the vortex generator cvg is the empirical constant 3 2 tubes tubes outlet on the suction side is provided to remove the water from the core region in order to organize the angular momentum into a vortex and to hold or trap the vortex on the suction side of the hydrofoil the low pressure in the surrounding of the vortex produces the lift enhancement of the foil lift enhancement due to externally trapped vortex has been described in rossow 1978 4 computational domain and meshing the computational domain is shown in fig 5 the large domain size has been considered to avoid the boundaries affect the boundary was located at 12 5 times and 25 times the chord length away from the hydrofoil at leading and trailing edge respectively velocity inlet and pressure outlet boundary conditions have been considered for the study the hydrofoil surface has been set as a no slip wall condition the nonstructured grid has been used in the whole domain except hydrofoil surroundings the structured mesh surrounding the hydrofoil has been used to capture the boundary layer effects on the hydrofoil the average orthogonal quality of the mesh is 0 92 which signifies the good quality mesh for this study fuglsang et al 2003 the y value has been calculated based on inflation layer thickness the calculated value is equal to one which is acceptable for the chosen turbulence model fluent the h type mesh of the domain is shown in fig 6 5 grid convergence and uncertainty analysis the specific number of grids for the computation domain is required to overcome the accuracy of the model three different grids with 2 5 106 grid 1 6 2 106 grid 2 and 15 5 106 grid 3 have been used for s1210 hydrofoil with outward dimple and vgs the corresponding force coefficients are showing in table 2 the grid convergence index method gci and factor of safety celik et al 2008 roache 1994 were suggested by the researchers to understand the uncertainty of the numerical results in this study the gci method has been used to verify the uncertainty of the numerical results the results are shown

calculations the well known spalart allmaras s a turbulence model is chosen to close the governing equations the s a turbulence model is a one equation model designed for the aerofoil body crivellini

and manolesos and voutsinas 2015b respectively the current numerical set up is validated with the results available in shukla and kaviti 2017b and manolesos and voutsinas 2015b the comparison results are presented in figs 7 and 8 respectively the results obtained from the current simulations are matching satisfactorily therefore the above set up was used as the base set up throughout this study 8 results and discussion in blade element momentum theory glauert 1935 1959 the blade has been divided into a number of sections and all the forces have been calculated individually for each section the summation of all the forces on the individual section provides the total force acting on the single blade fig 9 a represents a small section of the blade at a distance of r from the hub the corresponding forces acting on the blade are shown in fig 9b gundtoft 2009 the coefficient of lift cl coefficient of drag cd and glide ratio gr is calculated as eqs 18 20 18 c l f l 1 2 ρ w 2 b c 19 c d f d 1 2 ρ w 2 b c 20 glide ratio gr c l c d the axial force dt and the torque du on a blade element with the radius r and the thickness dr has been calculated using eqs 21 and 22 21 d t 1 2 ρ w 2 c b c y d r 22 d u 1 2 ρ w 2 c b c x r d r where 23 c x c l sin ϕ c d cos ϕ 24 c y c l cos ϕ c d sin ϕ then the power produced is given in eq 25 25 d p d u r ω where ω is the angular speed of the current turbine is given by eq 26 26 ω 2 π n n the rotational speed of the current turbine that s why force coefficients lift coefficient cl the drag coefficient cd and the glide ratio gr results are analyzed to make a decision on the performance of the hydrofoil 8 1 hydrodynamic performance of hydrofoil with tubes and dimple the results in fig 10 a shows that the lift coefficient for the modified hydrofoil is higher compared to the baseline configuration at a higher angle of attack above 6 the drag coefficient fig 10b value at a lower angle of attack up to 8 is almost identical for all the hydrofoil design the drag coefficient values for modified hydrofoil are always lower compared to the baseline hydrofoil at a higher angle of attack above 8 from the above results it has been concluded that the lift forces are increases due to the presence of the vgs and tubes but at the same time the drag forces also decrease therefore the study of glide ratio is more relevant for giving the final conclusion of the performance of the hydrofoil the glide ratio results fig 11 are higher for the modified hydrofoil compared to the baseline foil at a higher angle of attack above 6 the maximum percentage increment of the glide ratio is 132 at an angle of attack of 12 for the hydrofoil with an outward dimple hence it can be concluded that the combined effects of dimple and tubes provide better performance compared to baseline hydrofoil the tangential and normal force coefficients are shown in fig 12 the tangential force and torque coefficient are identical for 2 d hydrofoil as can be seen from fig 12 the tangential force coefficients of hydrofoil s1210 are increased due to the profile modifications the increments are more at a higher angle of attack the maximum increment of tangential force has been found at 14 angles of attack the percentage increment of tangential forces compare to baseline hydrofoil is 14 8 29 6 41 4 at an angle of attack of 10 12 and 14 respectively 8 2 hydrodynamic performance of hydrofoil with vgs and dimple the combined effects of vgs and dimple on hydrodynamic characteristics of the hydrofoil are obtained for a different angle of attack and its comparison with baseline hydrofoil is shown in figs 13 and 14 the results in fig 13a shows that the lift coefficient for the modified hydrofoil is higher compared to the baseline hydrofoil irrespective of the angle of attack the stall angle is increased from 10 to 12 the maximum percentage increment of the lift coefficient is 15 for outward dimple with vgs hydrofoil compare to baseline hydrofoil at an angle of attack of 12 the drag coefficient fig 13b values are always lower compared to the baseline hydrofoil at a higher angle of attack above 10 at a lower angle of attack up to 10 the coefficient of drag values is higher for hydrofoil with inward dimple and vgs the glide ratio values fig 14 are higher for the modified hydrofoil compared to the baseline foil irrespective of the angle of attack the percentage increment of the glide ratio for the combined effects of vgs and dimple is 22 144 94 at an angle of attack of 10 12 and 14 respectively the tangential and normal force coefficients are shown in fig 15 it can be noticed that the peak tangential force coefficient has been increased almost by 39 at an angle of attack of 14 the inward dimple with vgs and outward dimple with vgs tangential force coefficient results are almost identical 8 3 analysis of the coefficient of pressure the pressure coefficients for the modified hydrofoil at an angle of attack of 12 are presented in fig 16 due to the effects of tubes vgs and dimple the integration areas of the pressure coefficient increase in comparison to the clean hydrofoil the integration area on the pressure coefficient curve represents the lift force generated by the hydrofoil at a specific angle of attack it is clear from fig 16 that coefficient of pressure curve for the baseline hydrofoil is smooth on both sides suction and pressure side of the hydrofoil on the other hand there is a peak point on the suction side of the modified hydrofoil this increment is due to the addition of vgs and tubes outlet on the suction side at 0 7c of the hydrofoil the coefficient of pressure variation due to the presence of inward or outward dimple on the pressure side of the hydrofoil at 0 9c is not affected that much the coefficient of pressure values for baseline hydrofoil is overlapping with the coefficient values for the hydrofoil with a dimple from this it has been concluded that dimple on the pressure side 0 9c of the hydrofoil does not contribute to improving the hydrodynamic performance of the hydrofoil rather it increase or decrease the strength of the blade further studies are required to verify the strength of the hydrofoil in the presence of inward or outward dimple 8 4 analysis of horizontal velocity and velocity vortex the horizontal velocity profiles on the suction side of the foil with and without modifications are compared in figs 17 and 18 at four different chordwise locations 0 2c 0 4c 0 6c and 0 8c at an angle of attack of 12 the thickness of the boundary layer is reduced by the presence of vgs tubes and dimple hence the expected benefit from the tube slots can be noticed from the tangential velocity component point of view as well velocity vortex core region of outward dimple with vgs and tube has been presented in fig 19 fig 19 shows the three dimensional velocity vortex structure induced by vgs and tubes at 10 and 12 angles of attack two different flow phenomenon has been clearly visible from fig 19 that the lower pressure region at the trailing edge for the hydrofoil with vgs is lower compare to the hydrofoil with tubes that justifies the fact that the inclusion of vgs energizes the flow at the downstream region while hydrofoil with tube trapped the vortex to increase the hydrodynamic performance of the foil 8 5 location of separation points on baseline profile and analysis of flow field the skin friction coefficient over the foil surface can be expressed as in eq 27 the value of the skin friction coefficient at the separation point is zero 27 c f τ ω 1 2 ρ u 2 where τ ω the local wall shear stress the flow separation on the clean baseline hydrofoil at different angles of attack is shown in fig 20 the flow separation point is shifted from the trailing edge towards the leading edge with an increasing angle of attack these significant changes in the flow characteristic considerably affect the performance of the hydrofoil beyond 12 angles of attack hence the profile has modified to overcome this flow separation which eventually improves the performance of the hydrofoil in order to further explain the hydrodynamic performance of the modified hydrofoil the flow field around the hydrofoil has been analyzed fig 21 shows the comparison of two dimensional streamlines between baseline hydrofoil and modified hydrofoil at an angle of attack of 12 from fig 21 a significant amount of flow separation is observed for the baseline hydrofoil while the hydrofoil with vgs and dimple exhibits attached flow on the other hand hydrofoil with tubes and dimple trapped the vortex on the suction side of the hydrofoil this trapped vortex is increased the lift coefficient of the modified hydrofoil 8 6 effects of current velocity on the modified hydrofoil the effects of current velocity on hydrodynamic performance of modified hydrofoil have been investigated here for an initial investigation on the influence of the current velocity in the cross section the hydrofoil with dimple and vgs have been selected the current velocity has been considered as 0 5 m s the comparative study has been presented in figs 22 and 23 it has been found in fig 22a that the coefficient of lift is higher than the baseline profile the stall angle is also increased from 10 to 12 when the hydrofoil is modified with outward dimple and vgs the glide ratio values fig 23 is higher for the hydrofoil with outward dimple and vgs compared to the baseline foil a similar observation is also reported in section 8 2 where the current velocity is considered as 2 1 m s hence it can be concluded that outward dimple with vgs provides better solutions irrespective of current velocity 9 conclusions in this paper the combined effects of dimple with vgs and dimple with tubes is numerically investigated from the results presented here it can be concluded that hydrofoil with outward dimple with tubes vgs appears more effective compared to the baseline hydrofoil the coupled effects of outward dimple with vgs and outward dimple with tubes appear more effective compare to baseline hydrofoil maximum glide ratio increments are 132 and 144 at an angle of attack of 12 for outward dimple with tubes and outward dimple with vgs respectively hence in order to optimize the power output from a current turbine with the minimum possible thrust outward dimple with vgs and outward dimple with a tube at a regular interval are two proposed efficient methods acknowledgments the author would like to express the deepest gratitude and hearted acknowledgment to dr

21964,in this investigation we evaluated the wavewatch iii wwiii model performances by testing the sensitivity of different input dissipation parameterizations for the indian seas using deep and shallow water measurements five input dissipation terms of wwiii namely st1 st2 st3 st4 and st6 have been used to simulate the significant wave parameters in the bay of bengal and arabian sea for the years 2003 and 2004 the comparisons suggest that the simulations using st4 physics functions best with low rmse and pe for all the seasons the st2 physics was best in simulating rough weather conditions further at a location off gopalpur the swan hindcast outperforms wwiii by using st4 st6 physics with low pe the study also points out to the fact that such comparisons have limitations and hence model performance evaluation must aim to consider spectrum and source function analysis keywords wavewatch swan parameterization dissipation sensitivity analysis wind wave model 1 introduction in the past decades wind waves were of prime importance with its applicability of forecasting and hindcasting sea states for ocean related operations the information on wind driven waves have been amplified with the aid of wave model outputs satellite and buoy data during the past 50 years wave models gelci et al 1957 were used widely for weather prediction generation of climatological databases which has practical applications for coastal protection sediment transport design of coastal and offshore structures shipping surface and subsurface navigation and various other research applications the wave modelling group wamdi 1988 and komen et al 1994 has been consistently working to bring out accurate prediction of sea states tolman and chalikov 1996 by improving the existing physical parameterizations ardhuin et al 2010 bidlot et al 2007 and thereby augment the performances rogers et al 2012 of wave models hence with commendable improvements in the area of atmospheric modelling and finer improvements in model physics cavaleri et al 2012 2018 global wave modelling has attained tremendous amount of accuracy in operational forecasting many operational forecasting centres over the world such as noaa ncep navoceano fnmoc meteo france u k met office and many more have accepted the improved skills by the application of st4 and st6 physics in wwiii it is also reported by edwards et al 2018 that based on the skill improvements the computational cost increases from 40 to 100 in using wwiii with st4 physics and 25 50 with swan using st6 the wave models using the energy balance equation and numerical schemes janssen 2008 is considered as effective means to study wind waves moreover the wave climate is of immense interest due to scientific and societal significance in regions where in situ measurements cavaleri et al 2007 are rare such as northern indian ocean the simulated wave model heights is the best source of continual sea state information appendini et al 2014 with desired resolution and accuracy the continuous efforts in wave modelling komen et al 1994 has produced the state of the art third generation spectral wave models namely the wave action model wam wamdi group 1988 wavewatch iii wwiii tolman 1989 1991 and simulating waves nearshore swan booij et al 1999 these models are popularly used by many well known operational prediction centres across the globe chawla et al 2007 balakrishnan nair et al 2013 and sandhya et al 2014 wam and wwiii are deep water models used for global and regional modelling samiksha et al 2015 umesh et al 2017 2019 while swan is best suited for coastal nearshore modelling parvathy et al 2017 umesh and swain 2018 the coastal nearshore areas are regions demanding high attention where interaction between waves and currents is considered to be most dominant cavaleri et al 2018 including collective and response effects the wave characteristics nayak et al 2013 and rajesh et al 2009 in the indian seas has been studied using wam and wwiii extensively sanil kumar et al 2000 2003 and umesh 2015 the nearshore model swan is an addition of wam with shallow water transformation processes performance evaluation is a crucial accompaniment to wave forecast model outputs the wwiii model was assessed by many researchers in the past based on its prediction capability and a number of validation studies using the wwiii model have been carried out over the years tolman 1991 tolman and alves 2005 hanson et al 2009 stopa et al 2013 and wang et al 2014 validation studies of wwiii 3 14 have been demonstrated by chawla et al 2012 using the quality controlled altimeter data samiksha et al 2012 validated the wwiii model for the indian seas and highlighted the importance of swells originating from the atlantic ocean and its propagation in the indian seas the nearshore model swan model is also extensively validated and used popularly across the globe in simulating coastal wave characteristics wang et al 2004 raj kumar et al 2009 bhowmick et al 2009 brown 2010 moeini et al 2012 siadatmousavi et al 2012 mazaheri et al 2013 nikishova et al 2017 and umesh et al 2019 in a study by breivik et al 2009 and anselmi molina et al 2012 it is reported the application of wam swan and wwiii swan nested models warner et al 2008 for accurate prediction of neashore waves wwiii input dissipation parameterization evaluation studies have been reported by various researchers across the globe wang et al 2017 evaluated the wwiii model v3 14 for the south china seas based on the input dissipation source term packages st1 st2 and st3 physics for the period january 1 to 31 2012 the experimental comparison of hs in the south chinas seas with radar and altimeter observations revealed that the st2 physics with effective wind speed formulations performed better than st1 and st2 thereby pointing out that the effects of atmospheric stability has infact a very significant impact on the wave growth in a study by sheng et al 2019 the wwiii v5 16 was used to simulate typhoons around the zhoushan islands the study used the different input dissipation parametrizations st1 st2 st3 st4 and st6 and compared the simulated hs with five in situ buoys it is reported that the st2 physics was the best option in simulating the hs with an rmse of 0 79 and zero bias for the typhoon fung wong similarly in another study by montoya et al 2013 it is noted that the tolman and chalikov 1996 parametrization in wwiii showed better results during hurricane katrina in the gulf of mexico thereby confirming the results reported in ortiz and mercado 2008 qiao at al 2019 also used the wwiii st2 physics package to simulate the typhoon kalmaegi 2014 in the northwest pacific ocean liu et al 2017 in his study with hurricane evan 2004 showed that the st3 st4 and st6 physics performed better and the study also stated that by accurately improving the strength of the negative wind input can lead to an improvement in the overall skills of the model the performance evaluation of wwiii model in the east korean seas w r t input dissipation parametrizations reported by lee 2015 showed that wam4 type wind input and dissipation parameterizations and its variant form provide the best performance for the storm waves in october 2006 further over the globe the accuracy of the source term packages st2 st3 st4 and st6 was assessed by stopa et al 2016 using wwiii model in this study st2 overestimates hs st3 gave a better match than st2 though errors were observed in higher order moments but at the same time st4 and st6 performed more or less alike and the notable differences were in the lower wave heights and higher order wave parameters campos and guedes soares 2016 in a comparative study for the north atlantic ocean reported that wwiii produced the best simulation results in terms of bias with wam hindcasts comparisons ponce de león et al 2018 evaluated the performances of wwiii and swan models in the north sea the deviations from measurements were higher with swan while spectral comparisons revealed the dependence on environmental conditions in which both the spectra can appear similar or different performance evaluation of wwiii in the mediterranean sea mentaschi et al 2015 showed that the wave growth dissipation parameterization proposed by ardhuin et al 2010 gave the best performance results this parameterization was capable in balancing the wave growth effects and dissipation induced by atmospheric forcings thereby achieving the prevailing local effects which is of utmost importance for the dynamics of the mediterranean sea the simulation capability of wwiii model in the pacific ocean was reported by fan et al 2015 in the open ocean the st4 physics performed well in reproducing the significant wave parameters and thus leading to improved accuracy of the wave systems while at the same time the st6 physics proved better in achieving the associated swell energy variations the assessment results provide guidance for the selection of st4 for use in a pacific ocean hindcasting for high wave climate research accuracy in wave modelling is dependent on wind forcing parameterizations of the source term and numerics used in numerical wave models amongst all the physical processes dissipation whitecapping cavaleri et al 2007 is least understood which needs considerable improvements in the past theoretical analytical models were used hasselmann 1974 and philips 1985 to define the source term dissipation parameterizations polnikov 1993 the models failed to describe the wave breaking phenomenon donelan and yuan 1994 and could only provide sea state information cavaleri et al 2007 before breaking an extensive study in this context was reported by researchers such as donelan and yuan 1994 young and babanin 2006 and cavaleri et al 2007 experimental investigations phillips et al 2001 and babanin et al 2007 has also reported that dissipation function cavaleri et al 2007 is a function of wave spectrum in the present day models wwiii model has better advantages than other models in terms of propagation schemes of higher order and improved physics for the parameterisations of source terms the model performs better for swell propagation in the long range order evaluation of wwiii based on input dissipation terms was reported by researchers such as kalantzi et al 2009 amrutha et al 2016 and seemanth et al 2016 in the north indian ocean kalantzi et al 2009 showed that both st1 and st2 physics did not perform well during a period when the study location could be under the possible influence of swells amrutha et al 2016 had reported that the wwiii simulated results using st4 physics at a deep water location in the eastern arabian sea showed good match with the buoy hs with a correlation of 0 97 and si 0 16 for the mean wave periods a high over prediction 23 7 was noted using the st2 physics in comparison to st4 physics 8 2 seemanth et al 2016 tested the performance capability of the wwiii model in the indian ocean based on the input and dissipation schemes for different seasons for the indian ocean the parameterization scheme by bidlot et al 2005 was seen to be the best in simulating hs over all seasons and during non monsoon seasons tolman and chalikov scheme achieved good performances seemanth et al 2016 in another study over the indian ocean by bhowmick et al 2015 the altika hs have been validated using the wwiii model which proved the quality of the altimeter data and hence was used for assimilation which improved the simulation capability of the models in the wwiii v3 14 the wam4 source term package was introduced and in a further version of wwiii v4 18 the parameterization by ardhuin et al 2010 was introduced on october 2016 the wwiii model v5 16 was introduced with improvements in the structure of the model equations governing the model numerical schemes and parameterizations ww3dg 2016 in particular its developments included a new source term non linear wave wave interaction and space time extremes calculation capability recently the latest version of wwiii 6 07 was released on march 21 2019 but the input dissipation parameterization terms remain the same as wwiii 5 16 in view of the above discussed past studies it is noted that a study based on using the improved input dissipation parameterizations in wwiii model is however missing in the indian ocean in this study the simulation capability of the wwiii version 5 16 is assessed for the indian seas based on the sensitivity of the model to different input and dissipation parameterization schemes available the accuracy of the schemes as indicated in table 1 such as st1 st2 st3 st4 and st6 will be tested the depth induced breaking leading to dissipation of wave energy is available in both wwiii and swan w r t shallow waters hence the study also attempted to compare the wwiii hindcasts at a coastal location with a nested wwiii swan setup to assess the performance of the model in the nearshore waters the manuscript will proceed as described the study location is described in section 2 and section 3 is dedicated to explaining the wave model settings section 4 describes the forcing and validation data sets along with the methodology and section 5 represents the results and discussions followed by a summary of the present work with conclusions as presented in section 7 2 study location amidst the world s major oceans the indian ocean has triggered many researchers for its inherent complexities however less explored and understood oceanographically unlike pacific and atlantic ocean the indian ocean is unique due to the periodic reversal in wind pattern linked with the indian monsoon and the associated currents of the upper ocean in this study the northern part of the indian ocean see fig 1 that covers 20 of the world ocean is focussed the indian subcontinent divides the northern indian ocean in to two semi enclosed basins the arabian sea on the west adjoined by two marginal seas the persian gulf and red sea and the bay of bengal in the east and both the seas infringes the equatorial regime of the basin shankar and shetye 2001 the northern indian ocean experiences semi annual reversing of monsoon as the winds blow from the north east ne during october january ne monsoon post monsoon and from the south west sw during june september sw monsoon the period during february may are considered as pre monsoon season the strong ocean atmosphere interaction over basin scales is responsible for the indian monsoon that forces seasonally reversing winds that subsequently reverses the observed sea state conditions according to the prevailing wind system earlier studies reported the influence of the strong monsoonal winds on the wave climate in the northern indian ocean which is dominated by young wind sea vethamony et al 2006 in contrast the wave climate of the northern indian ocean basin is strongly modulated by long swells propagating from southern indian ocean young 1999 and nayak et al 2013 the sea breeze impacts the diurnal cycle of sea state along the west coast of india due to the presence of weak winds during the pre monsoon season remya and rajkumar 2013 the northwesterly swells propagating in the northwestern arabian sea towards the west coast of india during the northeast and the early monsoon is termed as winter shamal swells aboobacker et al 2011 the swells are also reported during the period from may to august originating from the summer shamal winds in the persian gulf propagating in the north westerly glejin et al 2013 the co occurrence of the local wind sea waves and the pre existing swells generates diurnal variations on the resultant waves rashmi et al 2013 the arabian sea is dominated by wind sea during the sw monsoon due to strong and persistent winds from southwest and generally calm with the presence of swells in the remaining part of the year the ne winds are relatively weaker in the arabian sea while the bay of bengal experiences strong winds during southwest and northeast monsoon which makes the sea rough during these periods the bay of bengal significantly modulates the monsoon over the indian ocean vinayachandran et al 1996 and this region is prone to cyclone and other extreme events that create large inter annual variations in the wave parameters 3 overview of wave models in order to predict waves in the india ocean and shallow waters along the coastal regions the study utilised the state of the art numerical models the applied numerical models are wavewatch iii deep water wave model and swan nearshore spectral wave significant wave parameters obtained from the simulations are analysed i to assess the simulation capability of the wwiii model in the northern indian ocean using available input dissipation parameterisations and ii to compare the performance of the wwiii model with a nested wwiii swan setup at a nearshore location a brief description of the above models is outlined in the subsequent sections 3 1 spectral wave model wavewatch iii wwiii designed by noaa ncep is a third generation spectral wind wave model that solves the action density balance equation 1 n t 1 cos ϕ ϕ ϕ n cos θ λ λ n k k n θ θ g n s σ where λ φ θ k t and σ are the longitude latitude wave propagation direction wave number time and intrinsic angular frequency respectively the l h s of equation 1 expresses the local rate of change of wave action density propagation in physical space action density shifting in frequency and direction due to the spatial and temporal variations of depth and current the term s on the right hand side of equation 1 is defined as the net source term in deep waters with three main parts namely sin snl and sds representing wind wave interaction term non linear wave wave interaction term and a dissipation term whitecapping respectively the wave bottom interaction defined as sbot is the most notable process shemdin et al 1978 in shallow waters while triad wave wave interactions str and depth induced breaking sdb are essential in the near shore waters hence the wwiii model source terms are defined as 2 s sln sin snl sds sbot sdb str ssc sxx more details on wwiii model are available in the model s user manual ww3dg 2016 3 1 1 input dissipation parameterizations in wavewatch iii in the version 5 16 wwiii includes 7 input dissipation parameterisations namely st1 st2 st2 stab2 st3 st3 stab3 st4 and st6 in switch of wwiii switches play an important role in fine tuning of the model here fine tuning is not merely change of values of certain parameters but change of parameterization itself switch is used to fix the type of parameterization and the values of various parameters can be changed in the model files the wam3 source terms komen et al 1984 are used in the st1 switch snyder et al 1981 the tolman and chalikov 1996 formulations hereafter tc96 is represented in the switch st2 the tc96 source package is stably corrected in the switch st2 stab2 and the source term is fine tuned for fetch limited growth st3 switch is based on the input and dissipation source terms of janssen 2004 and bidlot et al 2005 respectively in the case of unpredictable meteorological conditions abdalla and bidlot 2002 suggested the parameterization st3 stab3 to stabilise st3 ardhuin et al 2010 recommended the input dissipation source term st4 switch the st6 switch is derived from laboratory experiments and lakes measurements zieger et al 2015 more details on the input and dissipation terms are provided in table 1 3 2 nearshore wave model swan swan simulating waves nearshore developed by delft university of technology netherlands is based on the wave action balance equation booij et al 1999 for applications in coastal and inland waters zijlema 2010 the swan model uses inputs such as bathymetry wind water level current and bottom friction the wave action balance equation is expressed in the following form 3 n t c x n x c y n y c σ n σ c θ n θ s σ where n σ θ x and y t and s represents the wave action density relative frequency wave direction horizontal coordinates time and total of source sink terms wave energy density respectively the l h s of equation 3 represents the local rate of change of action density in time the propagation of action in geographical space x y with propagation velocities cx and cy shifting of the relative frequency due to variations in depth and currents with propagation velocity cσ in σ space and depth current induced refraction with propagation velocity cθ in θ space respectively the source terms in this wave model are expressed as follows 4 stot sin snl3 snl4 sds w sds b sds br the r h s of equation 4 defines the wind input triad wave wave interactions quadruplet wave wave interactions dissipation by white capping bottom friction and breaking respectively the terms such as bottom friction and triad wave wave interaction are considered only in shallow water wave calculations in the latest version swan 41 20 used in this study the so called observation consistent wind input and white capping known as the st6 physics is included as an option in addition dissipation of swell energy is also included this st6 package

resolution and 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution were used for the years 2003 and 2004 since it is very essential to assess the simulation capability of wave models in rough weather conditions the study also used winds for selected periods of the years 1997 1999 2001 and 2005 4 2 wave data the study utilised data buoys at various locations in the northern indian ocean available from national

hasselmann et al 1973 the study executed five simulation experiments using the various input dissipation source packages namely i st1 wam3 ii st2 tolman and chalikov 1996 tc 96 iii st3 bidlot et al 2005 janssen 2004 iv st4 ardhuin et al 2010 and st6 physics zieger et al 2015 rogers et al 2012 and babanin 2011 the numerical simulations in this study used era interim winds as the forcing input wind field the wave model has the capability in interpolating the wind fields to desired model grids with the magnitudes preferred the model simulations are carried out for the years 2003 and 2004 and wave characteristics are generated at every 6h intervals model run was started 20 days prior to the considered period providing initial spin up period with the objective to select the best available parameterization schemes for the northern indian ocean each parameterization option is estimated independently by verifying the model simulated significant wave parameters namely hs wave height tm mean wave period θm mean wave direction tp peak period and θp peak direction with buoy observations in the indian seas for the periods 2003 and 2004 the outputs of the model are processed from the domain d3 as shown in fig 1a which is the innermost domain with high resolution the study also evaluated the performance of the model in simulating cyclones in the arabian sea and bay of bengal using the input dissipation source packages and thereby validating with the measured hs statistical analysis was also carried out by computing the various statistical indicators using the model and measured

directional space respectively the frequency ranges from 0 04 hz to 0 58 hz the input by wind sin in the model is based on the formulation by komen et al 1984 whereas the default settings in the model apply to other source and sink terms the model run is operated in a non stationary mode with a computational time step of 1800 s 4 5 performance assessment approach statistical estimates were used to evaluate the performance of the model by validating the simulated wave model outputs with buoy in situ measurements available from the moored buoy network in the indian ocean the position of the buoys

five different switches st1 st2 st3 st4 and st6 in wwiii the 6 hourly era interim winds is used to force the model for the years 2003 and 2004 and the simulated wave model outputs such as hs tm θm tp and θp in the northern indian ocean are analysed by comparing with in situ measurements 5 1 wave hindcast experiments using wwiii for northern indian ocean the numerical experiment results of the sensitivity analysis using wwiii model is examined in this section the north indian ocean was selected as the study area because the annual reversal of the surface wind systems in the indian seas is so remarkable that such a system exists nowhere else over the globe the transition from north east monsoon to the south west monsoon winds modulates the wave climate locally in the north indian ocean in this context since the wind input dissipation parameterizations schemes are based on different physics under specific environmental conditions their ability to produce accurate results is always uncertain five experiments have been carried out for the years 2003 and 2004 to have an understanding of parameterization schemes input dissipation source terms at first general wind and wave characteristics in the years 2003 and 2004 are discussed fig 3 shows the seasonal averaged 10 m wind speed and direction for the year 2003 the seasonal average wind speeds were computed for the considered duration to obtain the seasonal means for jfm january to march amj april to june jas july to september and ond october to december over the large part of the indian ocean the surface wind forcing completely reverses between the boreal winter december april and boreal summer june october monsoons fig 3 the siberian high is noted to be strong in january with a flow beyond the equator approaching the itcz inter tropical convergence zone hence winds observed north of the equator in most parts of the indian ocean are north easterlies while between equator and 15 s northwesterly winds prevail in this month the southeasterly winds exist throughout the year in the region south of 15 s similar type of conditions sustained in the entire winter monsoon season december to february during march to may winds are weak over the indian ocean north of 10 s the southwest monsoon winds become very strong in july and august with strong south westerlies in the north of the equator and south easterlies south of the equator by october southwest monsoon winds get weaken and light winds prevail over the northern indian ocean similar conditions prevail in the month of november fig 3d in the equatorial indian ocean unique wind forcing pattern occurs in comparison to other equatorial oceans it is noted that over the equator during the periods of april to june and october to november schott and mccreary 2001 there exists semiannual eastward winds the highest wind speeds 12 13 m s are found in the region of 60 s hence the seasonal averages for the year 2003 confirms the fact the winds followed the general climatology pattern in the indian ocean similarly the wind rose patterns fig 4 at selected locations in the arabian sea ds6 sw1 sw3 sw4 and bay of bengal ds3 ds4 mb12 ob8 sw5 and sw6 shows the general wind climatology that prevailed over the study location for the year 2003 fig 5 shows the seasonal mean variation of hs m and direction degrees for the year 2003 the mean hs values in the northern indian ocean varied in the order 0 1 1 5m 0 1 2 5m 0 2 3 0m and 0 1 2 0m for jfm amj jas and ond seasons respectively fig 6 shows the wave rose plots depicting wave climatology using buoys in the arabian sea and bay of bengal for the year 2003 similarly the mean wind speeds varied in the range of 1 7 m s 1 9 m s 1 11 m s and 1 7 m s for the seasons considered during 2004 the mean hs values in the northern indian ocean varied in the range 0 1 1 5m 0 2 2 5m 0 1 3 5m and 0 1 1 5m for jfm amj jas and ond seasons respectively hence the wind and wave characteristics for the year 2004 represents the standard climatic pattern of wind and wave variability to better analyse the prevailing wave characteristics for the years 2003 and 2004 we carried out a wavelet analysis of hs for chosen regions in the arabian sea and bay of bengal fig 7 a d shows the wavelet power spectra for chosen locations in the arabian sea fig 7a b and bay of bengal fig 7c d which indicate the variance or wavelet power spread over the entire time over which the data has been recorded the dark red regions represent the oscillations with maximum magnitude and when it is enclosed within a thick contour greater than 95 confidence is ensured when compared against a red noise spectrum the cone of influence curve shown in fig 7 depicts the significant variance present above the curve and below which the variance is insignificant at the location 1 ds1 in the arabian sea the analysis shows fig 7a dominant modes of oscillations with periodicities centered at 12 h and 32 h during the month of july similar to location 2 fig 7b ds2 location in the arabian sea although the 32 h oscillation is spread over a larger duration may july at the latter location location 3 fig 7c ds4 location in the bay of bengal depicts a 6 h and 16 h cycle during july the 16 h oscillation is repeated during september as well while the 32 h cycle exists in this location also between may to september location 4 fig 7d ds5 location in the bay of bengal shows peaks with periodicities between 8 and 32 h that occur in several months intermittently viz january may july august september and december 2003 in 2004 locations 1 2 and 3 fig 7e f g all display a peak in the magnitude of hs during march through september at periodicities ranging from 16 to 90 h the same oscillation is dispersed and scattered over a much longer duration may december at location 4 fig 7h just as is seen for 2003 at this location fig 7d 5 1 1 sensitivity of various parameterization input dissipation schemes in wwiii to evaluate the performance of wwiii simulated values of hs tm θm tp and θp were compared with chosen locations in the deep waters of arabian sea and bay of bengal different experimental simulations were executed using st1 st2 st3 st4 and st6 physics packages in wwiii in this study moored buoy measurements were used for validating the simulation capability of wwiii in the arabian sea and bay of bengal the validation of wwiii hindcast wave parameters using era interim winds was executed for the years 2003 and 2004 in the year 2003 the sensitivity of the wwiii model has been tested and validated using ds6 march to november sw1 february to july sw3 january to august and sw4 january to december buoys in the arabian sea and ds3 january to december ds4 september to december ds5 january to october mb12 january to december ob8 january to december sw5 january to june and sw6 september to december buoys located in the bay of bengal figs 8 10 show the validation of wave height using different switches with moored buoys stationed in the arabian sea and bay of bengal in general from figs 8 10 it reveals that all along the analysis period the wwiii model overpredicted the hs using st2 physics while st1 physics resulted mostly in underprediction of the model simulated hs at the same time considerable variations in the simulation capability of wwiii using st3 st4 and st6 physics were noted most importantly the simulations using st4 physics revealed good match with the buoy observations in most comparisons fig 8a shows the comparison at a deep water location ds6 for the period march to november 2003 it is seen that st1 st2 and st3 physics shows very poor match in comparison to st4 and st6 physics the st4 physics showed a good match with nbi 0 28m r 0 89 nrmse 0 24m mpi 0 92 and pe 12 at sw1 fig 8b location st1 and st6 physics have over predicted the hs and st2 is under predicted similarly at the sw3 location fig 8c both st1 and st2 revealed over prediction of hs followed by underestimations using st4 and st6 in fig 8b and c the st6 physics shows deviations in the performance compared to st4 physics in st4 physics the swell has no impact on the dissipation but it generally decreases the drag thereby reducing the sin term at the same time the st6 physics utilises an empirical drag coefficient depending on wind speed alone and the effect of swells is lower on wind sea growth the st4 and st6 physics also varies in the methods the steepness is predicted from a spectral bandwidth or else locally and also dependent on how across the spectrum the dissipation of waves is reorganized leckler et al 2013 hence these deviations can be attributed to the effects in the physics driving the model growth and dissipation due to atmospheric forcings as well as the prevailing local effects which is significant for the long term dynamics of the indian seas fig 11 presents the statistics of the verfication of buoy hs and wwiii hindcasts using different switches in the arabian sea for the year 2003 at the sw4 location fig 8d it is noted that both st4 and st6 could adequately reproduce hs with slight departures while at the same time st1 and st3 options were undestimated with overprediction using st2 it is well evident from fig 11a that the wwiii model performed well using st4 physics at the ds6 location while st3 physics perfomed the best at sw1 sw3 and sw4 locations figs 9 and 10 show the validation using 7 buoys in the bay of bengal with validation statistics as shown in fig 12 amongst the comparisons it is observed that st4 physics performs better in most cases except in one case where st6 performance was the best at the ds3 location fig 9a it is noted that st3 st4 and st6 have performed equally well with better performances exhibited using st4 physics the ds4 location fig 9b showed a pe 11 with r 0 95 nbi 0 18m and nrmse 0 17m and mpi 0 93 with st4 physics it is noted that in fig 9c at the ds5 buoy location off machilipatnam during 11 17 may 2003 the st2 option could reasonably capture the peak in hs compared to other switches physics the peaks observed were due to the passage of a storm at the buoy location at mb12 location fig 9d also the comparions revealed overestimation using st2 and underestimations using st1 and st3 the st4 and st6 physics options revealed good match with r values of 0 93 and 0 86 respectively in all three locations ob8 sw5 and sw6 fig 10 st1 and st2 options showed greater underprediction and overestimation as compared to other input physics options the pe varied in the range 10 32 with nrmse of the range 0 19 0 50m hence from fig 10 it is infered that although the st4 physics could reproduce the wave height at the buoys stationed in the bay of bengal it is equally noted that a fairly good performance with st6 physics is also observed in the bay of bengal at the sw6 location this can be possibly dependent on the combined effect of the prevailing local winds and the nearshore characteristics involved in the stable growth of wind waves at the sw6 study location apart from validating the hs the study also attempted to validate significant parameters such as tm tp θm and θp fig 13 shows the comparison of tm tp θm and θp at a deep water location ds6 off minicoy in the arabian sea 2003 the tm revealed best comparison fig 13a using st3 and st4 physics with a correlation of 0 96 and 0 91 respectively the pe for both cases varied from 7 to 12 while both st2 and st6 options overestimated the tm at the buoy location the peak wave period fig 13b showed the best match using st4 physics with a nrmse of 0 27s nbi 0 12s pe 12 with a mpi 0 89 it is observed that rest all options have underestimated tm similarly θm fig 13c and θp fig 13d simulated at the buoy location gave best results with st6 physics nrmse 0 10 and 0 13 for θm and θp while the rest all are underestimated similar comparison for the year 2003 was also carried out for a location in the bay of bengal ob8 off cuddalore as shown in fig 14 the mean wave period fig 14a was best simulated using the st4 physics with a correlation r 0 95 and pe 9 all other physics options have underestimated the wave period at the buoy location still a better performance amongst them was the option of st6 physics the peak wave period fig 14b also shows a better performance using st4 physics r 0 93 nrmse 0 071s and pe 10 similar to the case of arabian sea the wwiii model could recreate θm and θp with slighter deviation at the buoy location using st6 physics option fig 14c and d the pe varied from 8 to 12 with low bias and rmse in the year 2004 the sensitivity of the wwiii model has been tested and validated using ds1 october to december ds2 january to april sw3 january to june sw4 january to may buoys in the arabian sea and ds3 july to november ds4 july to december mb12 january to december ob8 january to october and sw6 january to may buoys stationed in the bay of bengal figs 15 and 16 shows the validation of hs with different physics inputs in wwiii and its comparison with moored buoys located in the arabian sea and bay of bengal fig 17 shows the statistical estimates of the validation of buoy hs and wwiii hindcasts using different switches in the arabian sea for the year 2004 in general from fig 17 it is evident that in the arabian sea both st4 and st6 physics performed equally well in simulating hs at the buoy locations ds1 ds2 sw3 and sw4 in fig 15 significant underestimations were noted using st1 and overprediction using st2 at the ds1 location fig 15a the pe varied from 10 to 27 nrmse of the order 0 16 0 52m with the best results with st4 physics at the ds2 location fig 15b the comparisons revealed a nbi of the range 0 45 to 0 37m with r ranging from 0 52 to 0 88 the st3 physics proved to better in simulating the wave hindcasts compared to other source packages this could be due to the formulation of dissipation source term in terms of a mean steepness and a mean frequency that gives more emphasis on the high frequency part of the spectrum this results in a more realistic interaction between wind sea and swells bidlot et al 2005 the sw3 and sw4 locations fig 15c and d revealed a higher correlation of 0 89 and 0 90 using st4 and st3 physics at the sw3 location off goa fig 15c in the arabian sea the st4 physics could not capture the peak significantly which possibly could be due to fact that the sw3 being a shallow water location the wave fields dominated by the swells inturn modifies the drag the effects of the bottom bathymetry data at the location and the depth effects on propagation and source terms could also be the possible reasons for such deviations similarly comparison in the bay of bengal also revealed better performances using st3 st4 and st6 physics fig 16 the statistical estimates of the comparison of buoy hs and wwiii hindcasts using different switches in the bay of bengal for the year 2004 is as shown in fig 18 at the ds3 location fig 16a the pe varied from 12 to 28 with highest deviation using st2 physics in the ds4 location fig 16b the nbi ranged from 0 38 to 0 57m with r of the order 0 53 to 0 89 considering the location mb12 fig 16c the pe was the lowest 10 using st3 physics with a mpi 0 89 again at the ob8 location fig 16d it is noted that the st2 physics reproduced the hs at the buoy location with fairly good accuracy the pe mpi nrmse and nbi were 12 0 90 0 12m and 0 19m respectively all the three physics namely st3 st4 and st6 were undestimated at the ob8 location in the sw6 location fig 16e the simulations revealed comparable performances while applying the st3 st4 and st6 physics which is quite evident from many of the validations in the arabian sea and bay of bengal hence from fig 18 it is evident that the comparisons revealed varied performances at the buoy locations with best performances shown by using st2 st3 st4 and st6 physics the study also attempted to validate the parameters tm tp θm and θp at a selected location in the arabian sea for the year 2004 fig 19 shows the validation of wave period and direction using different switches at ds2 location off lakshadweep in the arabian sea for tm and tp the best performances fig 19a and b were given by st3 and st4 physics respectively with a pe of 6 and 10 respectively the st4 physics overestimated the mean wave period while all others were underestimated except st3 at the buoy location similarly for peak wave period the st6 physics pe 23 revealed overestimations while all others showed underestimations for mean wave direction and peak wave direction fig 19c d the wwiii model revealed distinct performances with st4 and st6 as the best performances pe s of 9 and 12 respectively at the same time a consistently good performance by st3 in simulating the mean wave direction and peak wave direction was also noted fig 20 shows the validation of wave period and direction using different switches at the location mb12 off visakhapatnam in the bay of bengal the comparisons are quite promising with best performances using st4 and st6 physics for tm and tp fig 20a and b the simulations revealed st6 and st4 physics as the best ones while all others showed underestimations or slight overestimations similarly for mean wave direction and peak wave direction fig 20c and d the st6 physics was the most matching with pe of 7 and 10 respectively in general the hindcast experiments using all the parameterization schemes input dissipation in the arabian sea and bay of bengal revealed comparable distribution of wave trends with observations in the northern indian ocean however wwiii using the st1 physics underestimated the hs in most of the locations in comparion to other schemes similar underestimations have been reported by wamdi group 1988 on the underprediction of hs using wam 3 parametersiation in the southern latitudes roughest sea sectors it was also reported in an earlier study by chen 1993 that the extremes waves predicted with wam 3 parameterization underestimated the buoy measurements the simulated hs results using st1 and st2 physics in the arabian sea and bay of bengal in the present study showed either underestimations or over estimations from the buoy measurments the possible reasons for this deviation could be that the model with the st1 or st2 physics was not capable to accurately dissipate the energy during swell propagation it can also be possible that there is an enormous generation of swell seas beyond the area thereby overpredicting the hs especially over monsson transition period when the region in not under the influence of local winds and young sea these results are comparable with the results reported by kalantzi et al 2009 it is to be noted that the performances of wam 4 and variants may underperform due to the inability in swell capturing in an experiment by kalantzi et al 2009 st1 physics dissipates more energy than st2 where other physics were not introduced in the model the st2 physics can also overpredict the swell wave heights as reported by stopa et al 2016 which can lead to an overprediction of hs as described by tolman and chalikov 1996 the dissipation of swells extends with the velocity of friction and later disappears when the wind speed tends to zero similarly in a study by lee 2015 loss in energy is higher with st2 physics as compared to dissipation with st1 physics st2 and st3 have the largest disparities mainly due to their different formulations of the wind generation and dissipation due to whitecapping in the eastern arabian sea the hs and tm compared at a deep water location by amrutha et al 2016 showed that the st4 physics reported an under estimaiton of hs by 8 28 and overestimation of tm by 8 2 while the st2 physics was showing an overestimation of hs and tm by 10 52 and 23 7 respectively the st4 physics showed a higher correlation of 0 97 for hs and a lower correlation 0 59 for tm which is comparable with the results obtained in the present study for the indian seas the st3 physics combines wave energy dissipation and probability in wave breaking w r t steepness of the spectrum the deviations shown by st3 physics in the indian seas can also be attributed to the spurious variability at high frequencies ardhuin et al 2012 also reported that the reduction in error seen by using st4 st6 physics in comparison to st3 can be assigned to the application of the more effective decoupling of swell and wind seas associated with the saturation based dissipation overall the role of saturation and turbulence terms needs detailed evaluation to identify the deviation in the performance of different physics also physics are different in the defining of how the wind input is balanced with the whitecapping dissipation in st4 and st6 in combination with non linear wave interactions and dissipation due to bottom friction the energy dissipated described by the breaking physics is not adequately modelled and it represents the wave conditions just before breaking or continuing features after breaking which is in turn associated with previous breaking due to dissipation concerning the deviations in direction the variations in directional propagation of waves especially in swell dominant areas can be possibly due to the marked different representations of the interaction among swell and windseas in the source physics in order to better analyse the reasons for the varied performances by the different parameterisations in addition to the comparisons between the observed and simulated parameters extensive studies must be carried out considering directional spectrum at offshore observation points analysis of wind waves and swell components separately by evaluating how much energy is dissipating due to whitecapping in direction and frequency space and how energy is balanced between source wind input non linear interaction and sink whitecapping bottom friction mainly in shallow water non linear interaction however it is not in the scope of the present study due to the non availability of measured directional spectra and source terms and shall be considered in future studies furthermore the evaluation of the significant wave parameters provided an important understanding of the performances of the models but on a spectral basis it did not provide detailed information on how these parameterization s functions hence it is very essential to have a detailed analysis with the spectral distributions in the north indian ocean so that the performances of these formulations can be evaluated 5 2 wwiii hindcast evaluation during cyclones in the arabian sea and bay of bengal the north indian ocean is inclined to tropical cyclones hence it is imperative to assess the efficiency of the parmeterisation schemes over a rough weather event since there was no available measured data during cyclones for the periods of study 2003 2004 the study have used the data from available sources for other periods in simulating and comparing a rough weather scenario table 3 shows the cyclones cases simulated in this study with the buoy data utilised the following cases were simulated to validate wwiii for a rough weather scenario in 1997 a severe cyclonic storm occurred during the month of september 19 27 which made its landfall in bangladesh on the 27th and dissipated shortly thereafter the effect of the bangladesh cyclone on wind waves was captured by the ds4 buoy in the bay of bengal the cylone track and location of the buoy are illustrated in fig 21 a right panel the buoy captured an increase in hs from 24th to 26th of september 1997 revealing the characteristic rough sea driven with active cyclonic winds the time series validation of model predicted hs fig 21a with buoy measurements revealed that the experiments with the five parameterization options reasonably follows the buoy hs pattern but with deviations in magnitude model with st1 physics underestimated the hs and the high waves induced by the cyclone are not captured in comparison with other input physics model using st2 physics gave the best estimation with slight underprediction of hs 6 2m during the cyclone with nrmse of 0 21m and pe 6 all the other physics showed underestimations in simualting the maximum hs fig 21b shows the comparion of an arabian sea cyclone during may 16 to may 22 1999 it was the most severe storm event formed in the arabian sea until 2001 the cyclone made its landfall at peak intensity near karachi pakistan on may 20 2001 and the impact of the cyclone on the sea state was visible from the ds1 buoy datasets the track of the cyclone is as shown adjacent to fig 21b the comparison reveal a best match using st2 physics in simulating the hs close to 6 5m at the same time the st6 physics has overestimated the hs while others are seen underestimated the jtwc issued an alert on october 23 1999 for a low pressure area in the south china sea the storm deteriorated as it weakened onshore in odisha along the east coast of india while pouring heavy rains it weakened to a tropical depression on october 31 before dissipating on november 4 fig 21c shows the comparison for the orissa super cyclone for the period 12 to 30 october 1999 the track of the cyclone is as shown in fig 21c right panel with the ds4 buoy location which has captured the sea state the comparison shows that the wwiii model with st2 physics was capable in simulating the hs of 8 3m with a slight underestimation as recorded by the buoy at the location the st6 physics was found to be overestimated while all others were underestimated the study also compared the cyclone in arabian sea during 12 may 31 2001 it is the only storm on record in the arabian sea surpassed by cyclone gonu in 2007 the cyclone had weakened into a deep depression on may 28th and the imd downgraded the storm to a remnant low before the circulation approached near to the gujarat coast fig 22 a shows the comparison for the cyclone in the arabian sea the track of the cyclone is as shown in the figure with the ds1 buoy location which has captured the sea state the comparison shows that the wwiii model with st2 physics was capable in simulating the hs of 8 1m with a slight underestimation as recorded by the buoy at the location as in previous discussed cases the st6 physics was found to be overestimated while all others were underestimated at the buoy location during 1 to may 11 2004 there occurred a cyclone in the arabian sea which strolled off southwest india and later degenerated into a residual low off gujarat coast on may 10 2004 fig 22b shows the comparison of the above cyclone as captured by the ob3 buoy for the period 1 to may 11 2004 the cyclonic track is as shown in fig 22b right panel the comparison shows that the wwiii model with st2 physics was capable in simulating the hs of 6 5m as recorded by the buoy ob3 at the location in comparison to previous cases here the st6 physics was found to be underestimated along with all other source physics at the buoy location the study also simulated the cyclonic storm baaz that occurred during november 28 to december 2 2005 the storm generated in the eastern bay of bengal later downgraded to a residual low reaching north of pondicherry by december 3 2005 fig 22c shows the comparison of the above cyclone as captured by the mb10 buoy for the period 23 november to december 05 2005 the cyclonic track is as shown in fig 22c right panel the comparison shows that the wwiii model with st2 physics was capable in simulating the hs of 4 3m as recorded by the buoy mb10 at the location the st6 physics was again found to be overestimated while all other source physics at the buoy location were seen underestimated in another comparion in this study the cyclonic storm fanoos during 6 to 10th december 2005 was considered the system originated in the south andaman sea on december 4 2005 and later moved through the bay of bengal west south westward with its weakening into a deep depression on december 10 leading to its landfall near vedaranyam eastern tamil nadu fig 22d shows the comparison of the above cyclone as captured by the mb10 buoy for the period 03 to december 13 2005 the cyclonic track is as shown in fig 22d right panel the comparison shows that the wwiii model with st2 physics was capable in simulating the hs of 3 7m as recorded by the buoy mb10 at the location the st6 physics was again found to be overestimated while all other source physics at the buoy location were seen underestimated overall it is seen from the comparison that the wam4 and variant schemes st3 physics clearly underestimated the hs with a negative bias and higher rmse similar inferences are drawn in the context using st1 and st4 physics it is noted that in most of the comparison st6 has over predicted the hs briefly the study remarked the st2 physics as the suitable option for input and dissipation source term to simulate the cyclonic waves it may be due to the commendable wave growth behaviour of tolman and chalikov scheme for extremely short fetches up to its full growth in the st2 source term package the input peak frequency is estimated from the equivalent frequency of the positive part of the input source term it is difficult to get an estimate value from the remaining source packages st1 st3 st4 st6 due to the complex relevance among parameters within the wind input term qiao et al 2019 the results in the present study for the north indian ocean are consistent with the findings of seemanth et al 2016 the study reported the use of st2 physics as the best rmse 0 2m in simulating the cyclonic storm nilam in 2012 similarly in a study by sheng et al 2019 the st2 physics achieved best results with an rmse of 0 79 m and 1 12m for typhoon fung wong and typhoon chan hom respectively in the east china seas in the gulf of mexico it is reported that the tolman and chalikov 1996 wind input parmatersiation showed best results in simulating the hurricane katrina with an improved response to approximately rapid variations in wind speed which also affirms the findings by ortiz and mercado 2008 at the same time a different result is also reported by liu et al 2017 based on his study with hurcccane ivan 2004 in which all the three physcis st3 st4 and st6 showed best results although an overestimation in the energy of waves was noted further the study opined the fact that by the uncertainty in the input winds the most accurate physics among the three was not reported in a recent study by qiao et al 2019 it is shown that better results for typhoon waves can be achieved by modification of the st2 wind stress coefficient scheme by introducing wave boundary layer model to wwiii thus in the context of high sea state conditions it is essential to examine the intensity of wind under extreme conditions and the prevailing atmospheric variability which is not within the scope of the present study 6 comparison of wwiii and nested wwiii swan hindcasts for the coastal location off gopalpur the purpose of this comparison is to understand and check the performance of two well known spectral wave models in simulating waves at a selected coastal location in this section comparison of hindcast results of two models wwiii and swan are presented and analysed the swan and wwiii models were evaluated in terms of their performances at a coastal location off gopalpur for the period june 2008 to may 2009 and further the significant wave parameters hs tm tp and θp were examined to achieve this the wave model sets ups and configurations in both models were retained as comparable as attainable during the period june 2008 to may 2009 the mean wind speeds varied in the range of 1 8 m s june to august 1 10 m s september to november 1 11 m s december to february and 1 7 m s march to may in the northern indian ocean the maximum winds 12 14 m s were observed in the region of 60 s which occurs due to frequent storms in general the wind system followed the general wind climatology in the indian ocean similarly the mean hs varied in the range 0 5 4 5m june to august 0 2 2m september to november 0 5 2m december to february and 0 1 2m march to may and it follows the wave climatology in the study location fig 23 shows the wavelet analysis of hs at the location off gopalpur during june 2008 to may 2009 the x axis represents the time stamp in hours and the data used is 3 hourly the figure illustrates an 18 h centered oscillation during july seen from 500 h stamp in fig 23 december 2008 and march 2009 along with an oscillation centered at 48 h and lasting from may to december 2008 and march 2009 in this comparison the wwiii model is first set with three nested grids including global domain d1 1 1 an intermediate domain sd2 0 5 0 5 77 e to 95 e and 0 n to 30 n and an inner coastal domain sd3 0 1 0 1 80 e to 87 e and 14 n to 21 n off gopalpur fig 1b the purpose of the wwiii global domain d1 is to provide boundary conditions for the swan setup the swan model is first set for the domain sd2 with a 0 5 0 5 grid resolution using the boundary conditions from wwiii d1 domain further the swan sd2 run will generate boundary conditions which will be used in the inner coastal domain sd3 over a 0 1 0 1 grid resolution off gopalpur hence both wam and wwiii setups in the inner coastal domain off gopalpur are maintained similar for the comparions in this study both wwiii and swan are used to simulate the wave parameters namely hs tm tp and θp at the coastal location off gopalpur the model experiments were performed using the source physics namely st1 st2 st3 st4 and st6 in the following discussion the results using st1 and st2 physics are not included as it did not reveal a good choice hence only the comparison using st3 st4 and st6 physics is considered the models wwiii and swan were simulated using the era interim winds for the evaluation period june 2008 to may 2009 the hindcast wave outputs such as hs tm tp and θp are processed and analysed fig 24 shows the comparison of hindcast wave parameters using swan and wwiii at the coastal location off gopalpur in fig 24 wwiii st3 wwiii st4 and wwiii st6 denotes the outputs using wwiii with different source physics similarly swan st3 swan st4 and swan st6 denotes the hindcast outputs using boundary inputs from wwiii with st3 st4 and st6 physics respectively the comparison statistics of wwiii and swan outputs hs tm tp and θp is as shown in table 4 the wwiii and swan comparisons at the coastal location of gopalpur revealed underestimations using wwiii and over estimations using swan fig 24a shows that the wwiii hindcasts for hs were underestimated in comparison to swan simulated hindcasts wwiii using st6 physics gave the best match with noted underestimations while swan using st4 physics gave a better performance the nbi values varied in the range 0 32 to 0 14m for wwiii while swan showed 0 16 to 0 21m table 4 the pe in wwiii ranged from 12 to 21 and 9 18 in swan overall swan gave a better simulation using the st4 physics while at the same time it is also noted that swan using st6 physics did show a good performance but with slight overestimation the tm simulated fig 24b using wwiii were underestimated using st3 st4 and st6 physics while st3 and st6 showed similar performances in simulating tm in swan however the tm was overestimated using st3 physics and it revealed similar and good match using st4 and st6 physics table 4 the results are comparable with the studies reported by amruta et al 2016 in which at a location in the nearshore waters off karwar the nested wwiii swan model could reproduce the hs with a good level of accuracy using st4 physics of wwiii the st4 physics was also observed to be better in simulating the tm the estimated hs were underestimated 0 48 by st4 physics while the tm and tp was underpredicted by st4 physics over the periods of pre and post monsoons the simulated peak period fig 24c also showed a better match using swan st4 and swan st6 and overestimation using st3 physics in comparison to wwiii in wwiii all options underestimated the peak wave period with better performances using st6 physics the peak wave direction analysed fig 24d showed a good match using st6 physics in swan while it was over predicted by wwiii with st6 physics and underestimated using st3 and st4 in wwiii in a study by van vledder et al 2016 it is reported that the st6 source term package gives the best swan model performance in the north sea in terms of hs the low frequency wave height the spectral period and spectral shape the results from montoya et al 2013 points out that in a comparison between wwiii and swan models the swan model tends to overestimate the high frequency energy also the directional spectra from both models is quite similar but the swan model tends to overestimate the hs and tp and this can be attributed to the difference in the models to the way wind energy ortiz and mercado 2008 is transferred to wave energy sin and its dissipation due to whitecapping sds similar to the present study performance of the ww3 using st3 physics and swan models was evaluated by ponce de león et al 2018 in the north sea in the comparisons the simulated hs showed a correlation of the order 0 91 to 0 97 and 0 52 to 0 79 using wwiii and swan respectively similarly the bias was of the order 0 35 to 0 17 and 0 16 to 1 99 using wwiii and swan respectively although wwiii performed better than swan in the comparison of 1 d spectra neither wwiii nor swan compared well with the measured wave spectrum which can be attributed to the fact that bottom friction and other shallow water processes might have an important role in the coastal zone and may have a significant effect on the swell propagation in a study by aijaz et al 2016 it is reported that the new physics st6 available in both wwiii zieger et al 2015 and swan rogers et al 2012 makes both models mutually consistent for nesting from deep to shallow waters where the implicit schemes in swan is efficient in coastal operational applications at very high résolutions in general wwiii results show larger deviations from the measured data in comparison to swan results the st3 st4 and st6 physics demonstrated varied performances with similar source function settings in both the models however it should be noted that there were some model feature variations in the models which may be considered as a limitation of the present investigation eventhough the investigation using significant wave parameters provided a good background on the simulation capability of the model using different parameterisations it is equally essential to evaluate wave spectrum and integral spectrum components it is to be noted that if steering factors for wave evolution are wind speed and direction then the growth of the spectrum can be controlled by factors such as directional spreading similarly the dissipation of wave energy is afflicted in the complete spectrum based on the dissipation function utilised the directional spread is not modelled accurately and hence it is a challenging task to compare the directional wave elements further the source terms distribution in terms of direction have to be analysed to gain better understanding on the directional wave spectra 7 summary and conclusions the present investigation is a unique sensitivity evaluation study of different parameterizations schemes accessible in state of the art wwiii wave model the model is simulated for the years 2003 and 2004 with the era interim wind forcings and selected years 1997 1999 2001 2004 2005 for cyclonic simulations the estimated wave parameters are evaluated and assessed to test the appropriateness of input dissipation schemes in the north indian ocean all the parameterizations were examined independently to validate the simulated hs tm tp θm and θp with moored buoy observations in the arabian sea and bay of bengal further the wwiii hindcasts were also compared with the swan model outputs hence performance evaluation of wavewatch iii and swan models using in situ measurements in the northern indian ocean yielded the following conclusions the study infers that st4 physics is the adequate option for input and dissipation term for the indian seas arabian sea and bay of bengal irrespective of the seasons it is to be noted that wind seas with high frequencies and prevailing swells is a characteristic feature of the sea state in north indian ocean and hence the present st4 option is best suited with improvements to accurately model the interdependence of swells and wind sea the st1 physics is seen to be underestimated all times along with overestimation seen by st2 physics st3 physics revealed a moderate performance showing deviations at the buoy locations the two year simulation showed that using st6 physics package which is the newest in wwiii it performs similarity to st4 st6 has large variability and it overestimates the model parameters it does not actually improve wave parameters and resulted in lower model performance statistics compared to st4 which is an older physics package in the case of simulation experiments carried out during periods of tropical cyclones it is realized that the st2 physics best represented the strong waves driven by the cyclonic systems the comparison of hs for 7 cases in both the semi enclosed seas such as arabian sea and bay of bengal rated st2 as the most efficient in reproducing the simulated hs at the selected buoy locations the comparison of wwiii and nested swan model set up revealed better performances using swan with st4 and st6 physics this points out to the better estimations of swell dissipation by st4 and st6 physics in wwiii and thereby achieving the consistency of input output momentum energy with the corresponding drag laws and estimates of breaking improving parameterization is one of the very basic requirements for the accurate model skills and performance hence data assimilation techniques will be considered in future studies to improve the prediction capability the model performance assessment will be extended giving importance to spectrum and source function analysis hence future studies will also aim at using spectra and long term continuous measurements to resolve the uncertainty in accurate prediction of sea states in both

21964,in this investigation we evaluated the wavewatch iii wwiii model performances by testing the sensitivity of different input dissipation parameterizations for the indian seas using deep and shallow water measurements five input dissipation terms of wwiii namely st1 st2 st3 st4 and st6 have been used to simulate the significant wave parameters in the bay of bengal and arabian sea for the years 2003 and 2004 the comparisons suggest that the simulations using st4 physics functions best with low rmse and pe for all the seasons the st2 physics was best in simulating rough weather conditions further at a location off gopalpur the swan hindcast outperforms wwiii by using st4 st6 physics with low pe the study also points out to the fact that such comparisons have limitations and hence model performance evaluation must aim to consider spectrum and source function analysis keywords wavewatch swan parameterization dissipation sensitivity analysis wind wave model 1 introduction in the past decades wind waves were of prime importance with its applicability of forecasting and hindcasting sea states for ocean related operations the information on wind driven waves have been amplified with the aid of wave model outputs satellite and buoy data during the past 50 years wave models gelci et al 1957 were used widely for weather prediction generation of climatological databases which has practical applications for coastal protection sediment transport design of coastal and offshore structures shipping surface and subsurface navigation and various other research applications the wave modelling group wamdi 1988 and komen et al 1994 has been consistently working to bring out accurate prediction of sea states tolman and chalikov 1996 by improving the existing physical parameterizations ardhuin et al 2010 bidlot et al 2007 and thereby augment the performances rogers et al 2012 of wave models hence with commendable improvements in the area of atmospheric modelling and finer improvements in model physics cavaleri et al 2012 2018 global wave modelling has attained tremendous amount of accuracy in operational forecasting many operational forecasting centres over the world such as noaa ncep navoceano fnmoc meteo france u k met office and many more have accepted the improved skills by the application of st4 and st6 physics in wwiii it is also reported by edwards et al 2018 that based on the skill improvements the computational cost increases from 40 to 100 in using wwiii with st4 physics and 25 50 with swan using st6 the wave models using the energy balance equation and numerical schemes janssen 2008 is considered as effective means to study wind waves moreover the wave climate is of immense interest due to scientific and societal significance in regions where in situ measurements cavaleri et al 2007 are rare such as northern indian ocean the simulated wave model heights is the best source of continual sea state information appendini et al 2014 with desired resolution and accuracy the continuous efforts in wave modelling komen et al 1994 has produced the state of the art third generation spectral wave models namely the wave action model wam wamdi group 1988 wavewatch iii wwiii tolman 1989 1991 and simulating waves nearshore swan booij et al 1999 these models are popularly used by many well known operational prediction centres across the globe chawla et al 2007 balakrishnan nair et al 2013 and sandhya et al 2014 wam and wwiii are deep water models used for global and regional modelling samiksha et al 2015 umesh et al 2017 2019 while swan is best suited for coastal nearshore modelling parvathy et al 2017 umesh and swain 2018 the coastal nearshore areas are regions demanding high attention where interaction between waves and currents is considered to be most dominant cavaleri et al 2018 including collective and response effects the wave characteristics nayak et al 2013 and rajesh et al 2009 in the indian seas has been studied using wam and wwiii extensively sanil kumar et al 2000 2003 and umesh 2015 the nearshore model swan is an addition of wam with shallow water transformation processes performance evaluation is a crucial accompaniment to wave forecast model outputs the wwiii model was assessed by many researchers in the past based on its prediction capability and a number of validation studies using the wwiii model have been carried out over the years tolman 1991 tolman and alves 2005 hanson et al 2009 stopa et al 2013 and wang et al 2014 validation studies of wwiii 3 14 have been demonstrated by chawla et al 2012 using the quality controlled altimeter data samiksha et al 2012 validated the wwiii model for the indian seas and highlighted the importance of swells originating from the atlantic ocean and its propagation in the indian seas the nearshore model swan model is also extensively validated and used popularly across the globe in simulating coastal wave characteristics wang et al 2004 raj kumar et al 2009 bhowmick et al 2009 brown 2010 moeini et al 2012 siadatmousavi et al 2012 mazaheri et al 2013 nikishova et al 2017 and umesh et al 2019 in a study by breivik et al 2009 and anselmi molina et al 2012 it is reported the application of wam swan and wwiii swan nested models warner et al 2008 for accurate prediction of neashore waves wwiii input dissipation parameterization evaluation studies have been reported by various researchers across the globe wang et al 2017 evaluated the wwiii model v3 14 for the south china seas based on the input dissipation source term packages st1 st2 and st3 physics for the period january 1 to 31 2012 the experimental comparison of hs in the south chinas seas with radar and altimeter observations revealed that the st2 physics with effective wind speed formulations performed better than st1 and st2 thereby pointing out that the effects of atmospheric stability has infact a very significant impact on the wave growth in a study by sheng et al 2019 the wwiii v5 16 was used to simulate typhoons around the zhoushan islands the study used the different input dissipation parametrizations st1 st2 st3 st4 and st6 and compared the simulated hs with five in situ buoys it is reported that the st2 physics was the best option in simulating the hs with an rmse of 0 79 and zero bias for the typhoon fung wong similarly in another study by montoya et al 2013 it is noted that the tolman and chalikov 1996 parametrization in wwiii showed better results during hurricane katrina in the gulf of mexico thereby confirming the results reported in ortiz and mercado 2008 qiao at al 2019 also used the wwiii st2 physics package to simulate the typhoon kalmaegi 2014 in the northwest pacific ocean liu et al 2017 in his study with hurricane evan 2004 showed that the st3 st4 and st6 physics performed better and the study also stated that by accurately improving the strength of the negative wind input can lead to an improvement in the overall skills of the model the performance evaluation of wwiii model in the east korean seas w r t input dissipation parametrizations reported by lee 2015 showed that wam4 type wind input and dissipation parameterizations and its variant form provide the best performance for the storm waves in october 2006 further over the globe the accuracy of the source term packages st2 st3 st4 and st6 was assessed by stopa et al 2016 using wwiii model in this study st2 overestimates hs st3 gave a better match than st2 though errors were observed in higher order moments but at the same time st4 and st6 performed more or less alike and the notable differences were in the lower wave heights and higher order wave parameters campos and guedes soares 2016 in a comparative study for the north atlantic ocean reported that wwiii produced the best simulation results in terms of bias with wam hindcasts comparisons ponce de león et al 2018 evaluated the performances of wwiii and swan models in the north sea the deviations from measurements were higher with swan while spectral comparisons revealed the dependence on environmental conditions in which both the spectra can appear similar or different performance evaluation of wwiii in the mediterranean sea mentaschi et al 2015 showed that the wave growth dissipation parameterization proposed by ardhuin et al 2010 gave the best performance results this parameterization was capable in balancing the wave growth effects and dissipation induced by atmospheric forcings thereby achieving the prevailing local effects which is of utmost importance for the dynamics of the mediterranean sea the simulation capability of wwiii model in the pacific ocean was reported by fan et al 2015 in the open ocean the st4 physics performed well in reproducing the significant wave parameters and thus leading to improved accuracy of the wave systems while at the same time the st6 physics proved better in achieving the associated swell energy variations the assessment results provide guidance for the selection of st4 for use in a pacific ocean hindcasting for high wave climate research accuracy in wave modelling is dependent on wind forcing parameterizations of the source term and numerics used in numerical wave models amongst all the physical processes dissipation whitecapping cavaleri et al 2007 is least understood which needs considerable improvements in the past theoretical analytical models were used hasselmann 1974 and philips 1985 to define the source term dissipation parameterizations polnikov 1993 the models failed to describe the wave breaking phenomenon donelan and yuan 1994 and could only provide sea state information cavaleri et al 2007 before breaking an extensive study in this context was reported by researchers such as donelan and yuan 1994 young and babanin 2006 and cavaleri et al 2007 experimental investigations phillips et al 2001 and babanin et al 2007 has also reported that dissipation function cavaleri et al 2007 is a function of wave spectrum in the present day models wwiii model has better advantages than other models in terms of propagation schemes of higher order and improved physics for the parameterisations of source terms the model performs better for swell propagation in the long range order evaluation of wwiii based on input dissipation terms was reported by researchers such as kalantzi et al 2009 amrutha et al 2016 and seemanth et al 2016 in the north indian ocean kalantzi et al 2009 showed that both st1 and st2 physics did not perform well during a period when the study location could be under the possible influence of swells amrutha et al 2016 had reported that the wwiii simulated results using st4 physics at a deep water location in the eastern arabian sea showed good match with the buoy hs with a correlation of 0 97 and si 0 16 for the mean wave periods a high over prediction 23 7 was noted using the st2 physics in comparison to st4 physics 8 2 seemanth et al 2016 tested the performance capability of the wwiii model in the indian ocean based on the input and dissipation schemes for different seasons for the indian ocean the parameterization scheme by bidlot et al 2005 was seen to be the best in simulating hs over all seasons and during non monsoon seasons tolman and chalikov scheme achieved good performances seemanth et al 2016 in another study over the indian ocean by bhowmick et al 2015 the altika hs have been validated using the wwiii model which proved the quality of the altimeter data and hence was used for assimilation which improved the simulation capability of the models in the wwiii v3 14 the wam4 source term package was introduced and in a further version of wwiii v4 18 the parameterization by ardhuin et al 2010 was introduced on october 2016 the wwiii model v5 16 was introduced with improvements in the structure of the model equations governing the model numerical schemes and parameterizations ww3dg 2016 in particular its developments included a new source term non linear wave wave interaction and space time extremes calculation capability recently the latest version of wwiii 6 07 was released on march 21 2019 but the input dissipation parameterization terms remain the same as wwiii 5 16 in view of the above discussed past studies it is noted that a study based on using the improved input dissipation parameterizations in wwiii model is however missing in the indian ocean in this study the simulation capability of the wwiii version 5 16 is assessed for the indian seas based on the sensitivity of the model to different input and dissipation parameterization schemes available the accuracy of the schemes as indicated in table 1 such as st1 st2 st3 st4 and st6 will be tested the depth induced breaking leading to dissipation of wave energy is available in both wwiii and swan w r t shallow waters hence the study also attempted to compare the wwiii hindcasts at a coastal location with a nested wwiii swan setup to assess the performance of the model in the nearshore waters the manuscript will proceed as described the study location is described in section 2 and section 3 is dedicated to explaining the wave model settings section 4 describes the forcing and validation data sets along with the methodology and section 5 represents the results and discussions followed by a summary of the present work with conclusions as presented in section 7 2 study location amidst the world s major oceans the indian ocean has triggered many researchers for its inherent complexities however less explored and understood oceanographically unlike pacific and atlantic ocean the indian ocean is unique due to the periodic reversal in wind pattern linked with the indian monsoon and the associated currents of the upper ocean in this study the northern part of the indian ocean see fig 1 that covers 20 of the world ocean is focussed the indian subcontinent divides the northern indian ocean in to two semi enclosed basins the arabian sea on the west adjoined by two marginal seas the persian gulf and red sea and the bay of bengal in the east and both the seas infringes the equatorial regime of the basin shankar and shetye 2001 the northern indian ocean experiences semi annual reversing of monsoon as the winds blow from the north east ne during october january ne monsoon post monsoon and from the south west sw during june september sw monsoon the period during february may are considered as pre monsoon season the strong ocean atmosphere interaction over basin scales is responsible for the indian monsoon that forces seasonally reversing winds that subsequently reverses the observed sea state conditions according to the prevailing wind system earlier studies reported the influence of the strong monsoonal winds on the wave climate in the northern indian ocean which is dominated by young wind sea vethamony et al 2006 in contrast the wave climate of the northern indian ocean basin is strongly modulated by long swells propagating from southern indian ocean young 1999 and nayak et al 2013 the sea breeze impacts the diurnal cycle of sea state along the west coast of india due to the presence of weak winds during the pre monsoon season remya and rajkumar 2013 the northwesterly swells propagating in the northwestern arabian sea towards the west coast of india during the northeast and the early monsoon is termed as winter shamal swells aboobacker et al 2011 the swells are also reported during the period from may to august originating from the summer shamal winds in the persian gulf propagating in the north westerly glejin et al 2013 the co occurrence of the local wind sea waves and the pre existing swells generates diurnal variations on the resultant waves rashmi et al 2013 the arabian sea is dominated by wind sea during the sw monsoon due to strong and persistent winds from southwest and generally calm with the presence of swells in the remaining part of the year the ne winds are relatively weaker in the arabian sea while the bay of bengal experiences strong winds during southwest and northeast monsoon which makes the sea rough during these periods the bay of bengal significantly modulates the monsoon over the indian ocean vinayachandran et al 1996 and this region is prone to cyclone and other extreme events that create large inter annual variations in the wave parameters 3 overview of wave models in order to predict waves in the india ocean and shallow waters along the coastal regions the study utilised the state of the art numerical models the applied numerical models are wavewatch iii deep water wave model and swan nearshore spectral wave significant wave parameters obtained from the simulations are analysed i to assess the simulation capability of the wwiii model in the northern indian ocean using available input dissipation parameterisations and ii to compare the performance of the wwiii model with a nested wwiii swan setup at a nearshore location a brief description of the above models is outlined in the subsequent sections 3 1 spectral wave model wavewatch iii wwiii designed by noaa ncep is a third generation spectral wind wave model that solves the action density balance equation 1 n t 1 cos ϕ ϕ ϕ n cos θ λ λ n k k n θ θ g n s σ where λ φ θ k t and σ are the longitude latitude wave propagation direction wave number time and intrinsic angular frequency respectively the l h s of equation 1 expresses the local rate of change of wave action density propagation in physical space action density shifting in frequency and direction due to the spatial and temporal variations of depth and current the term s on the right hand side of equation 1 is defined as the net source term in deep waters with three main parts namely sin snl and sds representing wind wave interaction term non linear wave wave interaction term and a dissipation term whitecapping respectively the wave bottom interaction defined as sbot is the most notable process shemdin et al 1978 in shallow waters while triad wave wave interactions str and depth induced breaking sdb are essential in the near shore waters hence the wwiii model source terms are defined as 2 s sln sin snl sds sbot sdb str ssc sxx more details on wwiii model are available in the model s user manual ww3dg 2016 3 1 1 input dissipation parameterizations in wavewatch iii in the version 5 16 wwiii includes 7 input dissipation parameterisations namely st1 st2 st2 stab2 st3 st3 stab3 st4 and st6 in switch of wwiii switches play an important role in fine tuning of the model here fine tuning is not merely change of values of certain parameters but change of parameterization itself switch is used to fix the type of parameterization and the values of various parameters can be changed in the model files the wam3 source terms komen et al 1984 are used in the st1 switch snyder et al 1981 the tolman and chalikov 1996 formulations hereafter tc96 is represented in the switch st2 the tc96 source package is stably corrected in the switch st2 stab2 and the source term is fine tuned for

university of technology netherlands is based on the wave action balance equation booij et al 1999 for applications in coastal and inland waters zijlema 2010 the swan model uses inputs such as bathymetry wind water level current and bottom friction the wave action balance equation is expressed in the following form 3 n t c x n x c y n y c σ n σ c θ n θ s σ where n σ θ x and y t and s represents the wave action density relative frequency wave direction horizontal coordinates time and total of source sink terms wave energy density respectively the l h s of equation 3 represents the local rate of change of action density in time the propagation of action in geographical space x y with propagation velocities cx and cy shifting of the relative frequency due to variations in depth and currents with propagation velocity cσ in σ space and depth current induced refraction with propagation velocity cθ in θ space respectively the source terms in this wave model are expressed as follows 4 stot sin snl3 snl4 sds w sds b sds br the r h s of equation 4 defines the wind input triad wave wave interactions quadruplet wave wave interactions dissipation by white capping bottom friction and breaking respectively the terms such as bottom friction and triad wave wave interaction are considered only in shallow water wave calculations in the latest version swan 41 20 used in this study the so called observation consistent wind input and white capping known as the st6 physics is included as an option in addition dissipation of swell energy is also included this st6 package can be considered as an alternative to the komen and janssen komen et al 1984 janssen 1991 formulations 4 data and methodology in the present study wave data obtained from directional wave rider buoys

resolution and 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution were used for the years 2003 and 2004 since it is very essential to assess the simulation capability of wave models in rough weather conditions the study

hasselmann et al 1973 the study executed five simulation experiments using the various input dissipation source packages namely i st1 wam3 ii st2 tolman and chalikov 1996 tc 96 iii st3 bidlot et al 2005 janssen 2004 iv st4 ardhuin et al 2010 and st6 physics zieger et al 2015 rogers et al 2012 and babanin 2011 the numerical simulations in this study used era interim winds as the forcing input wind field the wave model has the capability in interpolating the wind fields to desired model grids with the magnitudes preferred the model simulations are carried out for the years 2003 and 2004 and wave characteristics are generated at every 6h intervals model run was started 20 days prior to the considered period providing initial spin up period with the objective to select the best available parameterization schemes for the northern indian ocean each parameterization option is estimated independently by verifying the model simulated significant wave parameters namely hs wave height tm mean wave period θm mean wave direction tp peak period and θp peak direction with buoy observations in the indian seas for the periods 2003 and 2004 the outputs of the model are processed from the domain d3 as shown in fig 1a which is the innermost domain with high resolution the study also evaluated the performance of the model in simulating cyclones in the arabian sea and bay of bengal using the input dissipation source packages and thereby validating with the measured hs statistical analysis was also carried out by computing the various statistical indicators using the model and measured

locations in all the three domains refer fig 1b the swan runs an implicit integration scheme the frequency space in the surface gravity spectrum is discretized into 33 and 36 bins in the frequency and directional space respectively the frequency ranges from 0 04 hz to 0 58 hz the input by wind sin in the model is based on the formulation by komen et al 1984 whereas the default settings in the model apply to other source and sink terms the model run is operated in a non stationary mode with a computational time step of 1800 s 4 5 performance assessment approach statistical estimates were used to evaluate the performance of the model by validating the simulated wave model outputs with buoy in situ measurements available from the moored buoy network in the indian ocean the position of the buoys

five different switches st1 st2 st3 st4 and st6 in wwiii the 6 hourly era interim winds is used to force the model for the years 2003 and 2004 and the simulated wave model outputs such as hs tm θm tp and θp in the northern indian ocean are analysed by comparing with in situ measurements 5 1 wave hindcast experiments using wwiii for northern indian ocean the numerical experiment results of the sensitivity analysis using wwiii model is examined in this section the north indian ocean was selected as the study area because the annual reversal of the surface wind systems in the indian seas is so remarkable that such a system exists nowhere else over the globe the transition from north east monsoon to the south west monsoon winds modulates the wave climate locally in the north indian ocean in this context since the wind input dissipation parameterizations schemes are based on different physics under specific environmental conditions their ability to produce accurate results is always uncertain five experiments have been carried out for the years 2003 and 2004 to have an understanding of parameterization schemes input dissipation source terms at first general wind and wave characteristics in the years 2003 and 2004 are discussed fig 3 shows the seasonal averaged 10 m wind speed and direction for the year 2003 the seasonal average wind speeds were computed for the considered duration to obtain the seasonal means for jfm january to march amj april to june jas july to september and ond october to december over the large part of the indian ocean the surface wind forcing completely reverses between the boreal winter december april and boreal summer june october monsoons fig 3 the siberian high is noted to be strong in january with a flow beyond the equator approaching the itcz inter tropical convergence zone hence winds observed north of the equator in most parts of the indian ocean are north easterlies while between equator and 15 s northwesterly winds prevail in this month the southeasterly winds exist throughout the year in the region south of 15 s similar type of conditions sustained in the entire winter monsoon season december to february during march to may winds are weak over the indian ocean north of 10 s the southwest monsoon winds become very strong in july and august with strong south westerlies in the north of the equator and south easterlies south of the equator by october southwest monsoon winds get weaken and light winds prevail over the northern indian ocean similar conditions prevail in the month of november fig 3d in the equatorial indian ocean unique wind forcing pattern occurs in comparison to other equatorial oceans it is noted that over the equator during the periods of april to june and october to november schott and mccreary 2001 there exists semiannual eastward winds the highest wind speeds 12 13 m s are found in the region of 60 s hence the seasonal averages for the year 2003 confirms the fact the winds followed the general climatology pattern in the indian ocean similarly the wind rose patterns fig 4 at selected locations in the arabian sea ds6 sw1 sw3 sw4 and bay of bengal ds3 ds4 mb12 ob8 sw5 and sw6 shows the general wind climatology that prevailed over the study location for the year 2003 fig 5 shows the seasonal mean variation of hs m and direction degrees for the year 2003 the mean hs values in the northern indian ocean varied in the order 0 1 1 5m 0 1 2 5m 0 2 3 0m and 0 1 2 0m for jfm amj jas and ond seasons respectively fig 6 shows the wave rose plots depicting wave climatology using buoys in the arabian sea and bay of bengal for the year 2003 similarly the mean wind speeds varied in the range of 1 7 m s 1 9 m s 1 11 m s and 1 7 m s for the seasons considered during 2004 the mean hs values in the northern indian ocean varied in the range 0 1 1 5m 0 2 2 5m 0 1 3 5m and 0 1 1 5m for jfm amj jas and ond seasons respectively hence the wind and wave characteristics for the year 2004 represents the standard climatic pattern of wind and wave variability to better analyse the prevailing wave characteristics for the years 2003 and 2004 we carried out a wavelet analysis of hs for chosen regions in the arabian sea and bay of bengal fig 7 a d shows the wavelet power spectra for chosen locations in the arabian sea fig 7a b and bay of bengal fig 7c d which indicate the variance or wavelet power spread over the entire time over which the data has been recorded the dark red regions represent the oscillations with maximum magnitude and when it is enclosed within a thick contour greater than 95 confidence is ensured when compared against a red noise spectrum the cone of influence curve shown in fig 7 depicts the significant variance present above the curve and below which the variance is insignificant at the location 1 ds1 in the arabian sea the analysis shows fig 7a dominant modes of oscillations with periodicities centered at 12 h and 32 h during the month of july similar to location 2 fig 7b ds2 location in the arabian sea although the 32 h oscillation is spread over a larger duration may july at the latter location location 3 fig 7c ds4 location in the bay of bengal depicts a 6 h and 16 h cycle during july the 16 h oscillation is repeated during september as well while the 32 h cycle exists in this location also between may to september location 4 fig 7d ds5 location in the bay of bengal shows peaks with periodicities between 8 and 32 h that occur in several months intermittently viz january may july august september and december 2003 in 2004 locations 1 2 and 3 fig 7e f g all display a peak in the magnitude of hs during march through september at periodicities ranging from 16 to 90 h the same oscillation is dispersed and scattered over a much longer duration may december at location 4 fig 7h just as is seen for 2003 at this location fig 7d 5 1 1 sensitivity of various parameterization input dissipation schemes in wwiii to evaluate the performance of wwiii simulated values of hs tm θm tp and θp were compared with chosen locations in the deep waters of arabian sea and bay of bengal different experimental simulations were executed using st1 st2 st3 st4 and st6 physics packages in wwiii in this study moored buoy measurements were used for validating the simulation capability of wwiii in the arabian sea and bay of bengal the validation of wwiii hindcast wave parameters using era interim winds was executed for the years 2003 and 2004 in the year 2003 the sensitivity of the wwiii model has been tested and validated using ds6 march to november sw1 february to july sw3 january to august and sw4 january to december buoys in the arabian sea and ds3 january to december ds4 september to december ds5 january to october mb12 january to december ob8 january to december sw5 january to june and sw6 september to december buoys located in the bay of bengal figs 8 10 show the validation of wave height using different switches with moored buoys stationed in the arabian sea and bay of bengal in general from figs 8 10 it reveals that all along the analysis period the wwiii model overpredicted the hs using st2 physics while st1 physics resulted mostly in underprediction of the model simulated hs at the same time considerable variations in the simulation capability of wwiii using st3 st4 and st6 physics were noted most importantly the simulations using st4 physics revealed good match with the buoy observations in most comparisons fig 8a shows the comparison at a deep water location ds6 for the period march to november 2003 it is seen that st1 st2 and st3 physics shows very poor match in comparison to st4 and st6 physics the st4 physics showed a good match with nbi 0 28m r 0 89 nrmse 0 24m mpi 0 92 and pe 12 at sw1 fig 8b location st1 and st6 physics have over predicted the hs and st2 is under predicted similarly at the sw3 location fig 8c both st1 and st2 revealed over prediction of hs followed by underestimations using st4 and st6 in fig 8b and c the st6 physics shows deviations in the performance compared to st4 physics in st4 physics the swell has no impact on the dissipation but it generally decreases the drag thereby reducing the sin term at the same time the st6 physics utilises an empirical drag coefficient depending on wind speed alone and the effect of swells is lower on wind sea growth the st4 and st6 physics also varies in the methods the steepness is predicted from a spectral bandwidth or else locally and also dependent on how across the spectrum the dissipation of waves is reorganized leckler et al 2013 hence these deviations can be attributed to the effects in the physics driving the model growth and dissipation due to atmospheric forcings as well as the prevailing local effects which is significant for the long term dynamics of the indian seas fig 11 presents the statistics of the verfication of buoy hs and wwiii hindcasts using different switches in the arabian sea for the year 2003 at the sw4 location fig 8d it is noted that both st4 and st6 could adequately reproduce hs with slight departures while at the same time st1 and st3 options were undestimated with overprediction using st2 it is well evident from fig 11a that the wwiii model performed well using st4 physics at the ds6 location while st3 physics perfomed the best at sw1 sw3 and sw4 locations figs 9 and 10 show the validation using 7 buoys in the bay of bengal with validation statistics as shown in fig 12 amongst the comparisons it is observed that st4 physics performs better in most cases except in one case where st6 performance was the best at the ds3 location fig 9a it is noted that st3 st4 and st6 have performed equally well with better performances exhibited using st4 physics the ds4 location fig 9b showed a pe 11 with r 0 95 nbi 0 18m and nrmse 0 17m and mpi 0 93 with st4 physics it is noted that in fig 9c at the ds5 buoy location off machilipatnam during 11 17 may 2003 the st2 option could reasonably capture the peak in hs compared to other switches physics the peaks observed were due to the passage of a storm at the buoy location at mb12 location fig 9d also the comparions revealed overestimation using st2 and underestimations using st1 and st3 the st4 and st6 physics options revealed good match with r values of 0 93 and 0 86 respectively in all three locations ob8 sw5 and sw6 fig 10 st1 and st2 options showed greater underprediction and overestimation as compared to other input physics options the pe varied in the range 10 32 with nrmse of the range 0 19 0 50m hence from fig 10 it is infered that although the st4 physics could reproduce the wave height at the buoys stationed in the bay of bengal it is equally noted that a fairly good performance with st6 physics is also observed in the bay of bengal at the sw6 location this can be possibly dependent on the combined effect of the prevailing local winds and the nearshore characteristics involved in the stable growth of wind waves at the sw6 study location apart from validating the hs the study also attempted to validate significant parameters such as tm tp θm and θp fig 13 shows the comparison of tm tp θm and θp at a deep water location ds6 off minicoy in the arabian sea 2003 the tm revealed best comparison fig 13a using st3 and st4 physics with a correlation of 0 96 and 0 91 respectively the pe for both cases varied from 7 to 12 while both st2 and st6 options overestimated the tm at the buoy location the peak wave period fig 13b showed the best match using st4 physics with a nrmse of 0 27s nbi 0 12s pe 12 with a mpi 0 89 it is observed that rest all options have underestimated tm similarly θm fig 13c and θp fig 13d simulated at the buoy location gave best results with st6 physics nrmse 0 10 and 0 13 for θm and θp while the rest all are underestimated similar comparison for the year 2003 was also carried out for a location in the bay of bengal ob8 off cuddalore as shown in fig 14 the mean wave period fig 14a was best simulated using the st4 physics with a correlation r 0 95 and pe 9 all other physics options have underestimated the wave period at the buoy location still a better performance amongst them was the option of st6 physics the peak wave period fig 14b also shows a better performance using st4 physics r 0 93 nrmse 0 071s and pe 10 similar to the case of arabian sea the wwiii model could recreate θm and θp with slighter deviation at the buoy location using st6 physics option fig 14c and d the pe varied from 8 to 12 with low bias and rmse in the year 2004 the sensitivity of the wwiii model has been tested and validated using ds1 october to december ds2 january to april sw3 january to june sw4 january to may buoys in the arabian sea and ds3 july to november ds4 july to december mb12 january to december ob8 january to october and sw6 january to may buoys stationed in the bay of bengal figs 15 and 16 shows the validation of hs with different physics inputs in wwiii and its comparison with moored buoys located in the arabian sea and bay of bengal fig 17 shows the statistical estimates of the validation of buoy hs and wwiii hindcasts using different switches in the arabian sea for the year 2004 in general from fig 17 it is evident that in the arabian sea both st4 and st6 physics performed equally well in simulating hs at the buoy locations ds1 ds2 sw3 and sw4 in fig 15 significant underestimations were noted using st1 and overprediction using st2 at the ds1 location fig 15a the pe varied from 10 to 27 nrmse of the order 0 16 0 52m with the best results with st4 physics at the ds2 location fig 15b the comparisons revealed a nbi of the range 0 45 to 0 37m with r ranging from 0 52 to 0 88 the st3 physics proved to better in simulating the wave hindcasts compared to other source packages this could be due to the formulation of dissipation source term in terms of a mean steepness and a mean frequency that gives more emphasis on the high frequency part of the spectrum this results in a more realistic interaction between wind sea and swells bidlot et al 2005 the sw3 and sw4 locations fig 15c and d revealed a higher correlation of 0 89 and 0 90 using st4 and st3 physics at the sw3 location off goa fig 15c in the arabian sea the st4 physics could not capture the peak significantly which possibly could be due to fact that the sw3 being a shallow water location the wave fields dominated by the swells inturn modifies the drag the effects of the bottom bathymetry data at the location and the depth effects on propagation and source terms could also be the possible reasons for such deviations similarly comparison in the bay of bengal also revealed better performances using st3 st4 and st6 physics fig 16 the statistical estimates of the comparison of buoy hs and wwiii hindcasts using different switches in the bay of bengal for the year 2004 is as shown in fig 18 at the ds3 location fig 16a the pe varied from 12 to 28 with highest deviation using st2 physics in the ds4 location fig 16b the nbi ranged from 0 38 to 0 57m with r of the order 0 53 to 0 89 considering the location mb12 fig 16c the pe was the lowest 10 using st3 physics with a mpi 0 89 again at the ob8 location fig 16d it is noted that the st2 physics reproduced the hs at the buoy location with fairly good accuracy the pe mpi nrmse and nbi were 12 0 90 0 12m and 0 19m respectively all the three physics namely st3 st4 and st6 were undestimated at the ob8 location in the sw6 location fig 16e the simulations revealed comparable performances while applying the st3 st4 and st6 physics which is quite evident from many of the validations in the arabian sea and bay of bengal hence from fig 18 it is evident that the comparisons revealed varied performances at the buoy locations with best performances shown by using st2 st3 st4 and st6 physics the study also attempted to validate the parameters tm tp θm and θp at a selected location in the arabian sea for the year 2004 fig 19 shows the validation of wave period and direction using different switches at ds2 location off lakshadweep in the arabian sea for tm and tp the best performances fig 19a and b were given by st3 and st4 physics respectively with a pe of 6 and 10 respectively the st4 physics overestimated the mean wave period while all others were underestimated except st3 at the buoy location similarly for peak wave period the st6 physics pe 23 revealed overestimations while all others showed underestimations for mean wave direction and peak wave direction fig 19c d the wwiii model revealed distinct performances with st4 and st6 as the best performances pe s of 9 and 12 respectively at the same time a consistently good performance by st3 in simulating the mean wave direction and peak wave direction was also noted fig 20 shows the validation of wave period and direction using different switches at the location mb12 off visakhapatnam in the bay of bengal the comparisons are quite promising with best performances using st4 and st6 physics for tm and tp fig 20a and b the simulations revealed st6 and st4 physics as the best ones while all others showed underestimations or slight overestimations similarly for mean wave direction and peak wave direction fig 20c and d the st6 physics was the most matching with pe of 7 and 10 respectively in general the hindcast experiments using all the parameterization schemes input dissipation in the arabian sea and bay of bengal revealed comparable distribution of wave trends with observations in the northern indian ocean however wwiii using the st1 physics underestimated the hs in most of the locations in comparion to other schemes similar underestimations have been reported by wamdi group 1988 on the underprediction of hs using wam 3 parametersiation in the southern latitudes roughest sea sectors it was also reported in an earlier study by chen 1993 that the extremes waves predicted with wam 3 parameterization underestimated the buoy measurements the simulated hs results using st1 and st2 physics in the arabian sea and bay of bengal in the present study showed either underestimations or over estimations from the buoy measurments the possible reasons for this deviation could be that the model with the st1 or st2 physics was not capable to accurately dissipate the energy during swell propagation it can also be possible that there is an enormous generation of swell seas beyond the area thereby overpredicting the hs especially over monsson transition period when the region in not under the influence of local winds and young sea these results are comparable with the results reported by kalantzi et al 2009 it is to be noted that the performances of wam 4 and variants may underperform due to the inability in swell capturing in an experiment by kalantzi et al 2009 st1 physics dissipates more energy than st2 where other physics were not introduced in the model the st2 physics can also overpredict the swell wave heights as reported by stopa et al 2016 which can lead to an overprediction of hs as described by tolman and chalikov 1996 the dissipation of swells extends with the velocity of friction and later disappears when the wind speed tends to zero similarly in a study by lee 2015 loss in energy is higher with st2 physics as compared to dissipation with st1 physics st2 and st3 have the largest disparities mainly due to their different formulations of the wind generation and dissipation due to whitecapping in the eastern arabian sea the hs and tm compared at a deep water location by amrutha et al 2016 showed that the st4 physics reported an under estimaiton of hs by 8 28 and overestimation of tm by 8 2 while the st2 physics was showing an overestimation of hs and tm by 10 52 and 23 7 respectively the st4 physics showed a higher correlation of 0 97 for hs and a lower correlation 0 59 for tm which is comparable with the results obtained in the present study for the indian seas the st3 physics combines wave energy dissipation and probability in wave breaking w r t steepness of the spectrum the deviations shown by st3 physics in the indian seas can also be attributed to the spurious variability at high frequencies ardhuin et al 2012 also reported that the reduction in error seen by using st4 st6 physics in comparison to st3 can be assigned to the application of the more effective decoupling of swell and wind seas associated with the saturation based dissipation overall the role of saturation and turbulence terms needs detailed evaluation to identify the deviation in the performance of different physics also physics are different in the defining of how the wind input is balanced with the whitecapping dissipation in st4 and st6 in combination with non linear wave interactions and dissipation due to bottom friction the energy dissipated described by the breaking physics is not adequately modelled and it represents the wave conditions just before breaking or continuing features after breaking which is in turn associated with previous breaking due to dissipation concerning the deviations in direction the variations in directional propagation of waves especially in swell dominant areas can be possibly due to the marked different representations of the interaction among swell and windseas in the source physics in order to better analyse the reasons for the varied performances by the different parameterisations in addition to the comparisons between the observed and simulated parameters extensive studies must be carried out considering directional spectrum at offshore observation points analysis of wind waves and swell components separately by evaluating how much energy is dissipating due to whitecapping in direction and frequency space and how energy is balanced between source wind input non linear interaction and sink whitecapping bottom friction mainly in shallow water non linear interaction however it is not in the scope of the present study due to the non availability of measured directional spectra and source terms and shall be considered in future studies furthermore the evaluation of the significant wave parameters provided an important understanding of the performances of the models but on a spectral basis it did not provide detailed information on how these parameterization s functions hence it is very essential to have a detailed analysis with the spectral distributions in the north indian ocean so that the performances of these formulations can be evaluated 5 2 wwiii hindcast evaluation during cyclones in the arabian sea and bay of bengal the north indian ocean is inclined to tropical cyclones hence it is imperative to assess the efficiency of the parmeterisation schemes over a rough weather event since there was no available measured data during cyclones for the periods of study 2003 2004 the study have used the data from available sources for other periods in simulating and comparing a rough weather scenario table 3 shows the cyclones cases simulated in this study with the buoy data utilised the following cases were simulated to validate wwiii for a rough weather scenario in 1997 a severe cyclonic storm occurred during the month of september 19 27 which made its landfall in bangladesh on the 27th and dissipated shortly thereafter the effect of the bangladesh cyclone on wind waves was captured by the ds4 buoy in the bay of bengal the cylone track and location of the buoy are illustrated in fig 21 a right panel the buoy captured an increase in hs from 24th to 26th of september 1997 revealing the characteristic rough sea driven with active cyclonic winds the time series validation of model predicted hs fig 21a with buoy measurements revealed that the experiments with the five parameterization options reasonably follows the buoy hs pattern but with deviations in magnitude model with st1 physics underestimated the hs and the high waves induced by the cyclone are not captured in comparison with other input physics model using st2 physics gave the best estimation with slight underprediction of hs 6 2m during the cyclone with nrmse of 0 21m and pe 6 all the other physics showed underestimations in simualting the maximum hs fig 21b shows the comparion of an arabian sea cyclone during may 16 to may 22 1999 it was the most severe storm event formed in the arabian sea until 2001 the cyclone made its landfall at peak intensity near karachi pakistan on may 20 2001 and the impact of the cyclone on the sea state was visible from the ds1 buoy datasets the track of the cyclone is as shown adjacent to fig 21b the comparison reveal a best match using st2 physics in simulating the hs close to 6 5m at the same time the st6 physics has overestimated the hs while others are seen underestimated the jtwc issued an alert on october 23 1999 for a low pressure area in the south china sea the storm deteriorated as it weakened onshore in odisha along the east coast of india while pouring heavy rains it weakened to a tropical depression on october 31 before dissipating on november 4 fig 21c shows the comparison for the orissa super cyclone for the period 12 to 30 october 1999 the track of the cyclone is as shown in fig 21c right panel with the ds4 buoy location which has captured the sea state the comparison shows that the wwiii model with st2 physics was capable in simulating the hs of 8 3m with a slight underestimation as recorded by the buoy at the location the st6 physics was found to be overestimated while all others were underestimated the study also compared the cyclone in arabian sea during 12 may 31 2001 it is the only storm on record in the arabian sea surpassed by cyclone gonu in 2007 the cyclone had weakened into a deep depression on may 28th and the imd downgraded the storm to a remnant low before the circulation approached near to the gujarat coast fig 22 a shows the comparison for the cyclone in the arabian sea the track of the cyclone is as shown in the figure with the ds1 buoy location which has captured the sea state the comparison shows that the wwiii model with st2 physics was capable in simulating the hs of 8 1m with a slight underestimation as recorded by the buoy at the location as in previous discussed cases the st6 physics was found to be overestimated while all others were underestimated at the buoy location during 1 to may 11 2004 there occurred a cyclone in the arabian sea which strolled off southwest india and later degenerated into a residual low off gujarat coast on may 10 2004 fig 22b shows the comparison of the above cyclone as captured by the ob3 buoy for the period 1 to may 11 2004 the cyclonic track is as shown in fig 22b right panel the comparison shows that the wwiii model with st2 physics was capable in simulating the hs of 6 5m as recorded by the buoy ob3 at the location in comparison to previous cases here the st6 physics was found to be underestimated along with all other source physics at the buoy location the study also simulated the cyclonic storm baaz that occurred during november 28 to december 2 2005 the storm generated in the eastern bay of bengal later downgraded to a residual low reaching north of pondicherry by december 3 2005 fig 22c shows the comparison of the above cyclone as captured by the mb10 buoy for the period 23 november to december 05 2005 the cyclonic track is as shown in fig 22c right panel the comparison shows that the wwiii model with st2 physics was capable in simulating the hs of 4 3m as recorded by the buoy mb10 at the location the st6 physics was again found to be overestimated while all other source physics at the buoy location were seen underestimated in another comparion in this study the cyclonic storm fanoos during 6 to 10th december 2005 was considered the system originated in the south andaman sea on december 4 2005 and later moved through the bay of bengal west south westward with its weakening into a deep depression on december 10 leading to its landfall near vedaranyam eastern tamil nadu fig 22d shows the comparison of the above cyclone as captured by the mb10 buoy for the period 03 to december 13 2005 the cyclonic track is as shown in fig 22d right panel the comparison shows that the wwiii model with st2 physics was capable in simulating the hs of 3 7m as recorded by the buoy mb10 at the location the st6 physics was again found to be overestimated while all other source physics at the buoy location were seen underestimated overall it is seen from the comparison that the wam4 and variant schemes st3 physics clearly underestimated the hs with a negative bias and higher rmse similar inferences are drawn in the context using st1 and st4 physics it is noted that in most of the comparison st6 has over predicted the hs briefly the study remarked the st2 physics as the suitable option for input and dissipation source term to simulate the cyclonic waves it may be due to the commendable wave growth behaviour of tolman and chalikov scheme for extremely short fetches up to its full growth in the st2 source term package the input peak frequency is estimated from the equivalent frequency of the positive part of the input source term it is difficult to get an estimate value from the remaining source packages st1 st3 st4 st6 due to the complex relevance among parameters within the wind input term qiao et al 2019 the results in the present study for the north indian ocean are consistent with the findings of seemanth et al 2016 the study reported the use of st2 physics as the best rmse 0 2m in simulating the cyclonic storm nilam in 2012 similarly in a study by sheng et al 2019 the st2 physics achieved best results with an rmse of 0 79 m and 1 12m for typhoon fung wong and typhoon chan hom respectively in the east china seas in the gulf of mexico it is reported that the tolman and chalikov 1996 wind input parmatersiation showed best results in simulating the hurricane katrina with an improved response to approximately rapid variations in wind speed which also affirms the findings by ortiz and mercado 2008 at the same time a different result is also reported by liu et al 2017 based on his study with hurcccane ivan 2004 in which all the three physcis st3 st4 and st6 showed best results although an overestimation in the energy of waves was noted further the study opined the fact that by the uncertainty in the input winds the most accurate physics among the three was not reported in a recent study by qiao et al 2019 it is shown that better results for typhoon waves can be achieved by modification of the st2 wind stress coefficient scheme by introducing wave boundary layer model to wwiii thus in the context of high sea state conditions it is essential to examine the intensity of wind under extreme conditions and the prevailing atmospheric variability which is not within the scope of the present study 6 comparison of wwiii and nested wwiii swan hindcasts for the coastal location off gopalpur the purpose of this comparison is to understand and check the performance of two well known spectral wave models in simulating waves at a selected coastal location in this section comparison of hindcast results of two models wwiii and swan are presented and analysed the swan and wwiii models were evaluated in terms of their performances at a coastal location off gopalpur for the period june 2008 to may 2009 and further the significant wave parameters hs tm tp and θp were examined to achieve this the wave model sets ups and configurations in both models were retained as comparable as attainable during the period june 2008 to may 2009 the mean wind speeds varied in the range of 1 8 m s june to august 1 10 m s september to november 1 11 m s december to february and 1 7 m s march to may in the northern indian ocean the maximum winds 12 14 m s were observed in the region of 60 s which occurs due to frequent storms in general the wind system followed the general wind climatology in the indian ocean similarly the mean hs varied in the range 0 5 4 5m june to august 0 2 2m september to november 0 5 2m december to february and 0 1 2m march to may and it follows the wave climatology in the study location fig 23 shows the wavelet analysis of hs at the location off gopalpur during june 2008 to may 2009 the x axis represents the time stamp in hours and the data used is 3 hourly the figure illustrates an 18 h centered oscillation during july seen from 500 h stamp in fig 23 december 2008 and march 2009 along with an oscillation centered at 48 h and lasting from may to december 2008 and march 2009 in this comparison the wwiii model is first set with three nested grids including global domain d1 1 1 an intermediate domain sd2 0 5 0 5 77 e to 95 e and 0 n to 30 n and an inner coastal domain sd3 0 1 0 1 80 e to 87 e and 14 n to 21 n off gopalpur fig 1b the purpose of the wwiii global domain d1 is to provide boundary conditions for the swan setup the swan model is first set for the domain sd2 with a 0 5 0 5 grid resolution using the boundary conditions from wwiii d1 domain further the swan sd2 run will generate boundary conditions which will be used in the inner coastal domain sd3 over a 0 1 0 1 grid resolution off gopalpur hence both wam and wwiii setups in the inner coastal domain off gopalpur are maintained similar for the comparions in this study both wwiii and swan are used to simulate the wave parameters namely hs tm tp and θp at the coastal location off gopalpur the model experiments were performed using the source physics namely st1 st2 st3 st4 and st6 in the following discussion the results using st1 and st2 physics are not included as it did not reveal a good choice hence only the comparison using st3 st4 and st6 physics is considered the models wwiii and swan were simulated using the era interim winds for the evaluation period june 2008 to may 2009 the hindcast wave outputs such as hs tm tp and θp are processed and analysed fig 24 shows the comparison of hindcast wave parameters using swan and wwiii at the coastal location off gopalpur in fig 24 wwiii st3 wwiii st4 and wwiii st6 denotes the outputs using wwiii with different source physics similarly swan st3 swan st4 and swan st6 denotes the hindcast outputs using boundary inputs from wwiii with st3 st4 and st6 physics respectively the comparison statistics of wwiii and swan outputs hs tm tp and θp is as shown in table 4 the wwiii and swan comparisons at the coastal location of gopalpur revealed underestimations using wwiii and over estimations using swan fig 24a shows that the wwiii hindcasts for hs were underestimated in comparison to swan simulated hindcasts wwiii using st6 physics gave the best match with noted underestimations while swan using st4 physics gave a better performance the nbi values varied in the range 0 32 to 0 14m for wwiii while swan showed 0 16 to 0 21m table 4 the pe in wwiii ranged from 12 to 21 and 9 18 in swan overall swan gave a better simulation using the st4 physics while at the same time it is also noted that swan using st6 physics did show a good performance but with slight overestimation the tm simulated fig 24b using wwiii were underestimated using st3 st4 and st6 physics while st3 and st6 showed similar performances in simulating tm in swan however the tm was overestimated using st3 physics and it revealed similar and good match using st4 and st6 physics table 4 the results are comparable with the studies reported by amruta et al 2016 in which at a location in the nearshore waters off karwar the nested wwiii swan model could reproduce the hs with a good level of accuracy using st4 physics of wwiii the st4 physics was also observed to be better in simulating the tm the estimated hs were underestimated 0 48 by st4 physics while the tm and tp was underpredicted by st4 physics over the periods of pre and post monsoons the simulated peak period fig 24c also showed a better match using swan st4 and swan st6 and overestimation using st3 physics in comparison to wwiii in wwiii all options underestimated the peak wave period with better performances using st6 physics the peak wave direction analysed fig 24d showed a good match using st6 physics in swan while it was over predicted by wwiii with st6 physics and underestimated using st3 and st4 in wwiii in a study by van vledder et al 2016 it is reported that the st6 source term package gives the best swan model performance in the north sea in terms of hs the low frequency wave height the spectral period and spectral shape the results from montoya et al 2013 points out that in a comparison between wwiii and swan models the swan model tends to overestimate the high frequency energy also the directional spectra from both models is quite similar but the swan model tends to overestimate the hs and tp and this can be attributed to the difference in the models to the way wind energy ortiz and mercado 2008 is transferred to wave energy sin and its dissipation due to whitecapping sds similar to the present study performance of the ww3 using st3 physics and swan models was evaluated by ponce de león et al 2018 in the north sea in the comparisons the simulated hs showed a correlation of the order 0 91 to 0 97 and 0 52 to 0 79 using wwiii and swan respectively similarly the bias was of the order 0 35 to 0 17 and 0 16 to 1 99 using wwiii and swan respectively although wwiii performed better than swan in the comparison of 1 d spectra neither wwiii nor swan compared well with the measured wave spectrum which can be attributed to the fact that bottom friction and other shallow water processes might have an important role in the coastal zone and may have a significant effect on the swell propagation in a study by aijaz et al 2016 it is reported that the new physics st6 available in both wwiii zieger et al 2015 and swan rogers et al 2012 makes both models mutually consistent for nesting from deep to shallow waters where the implicit schemes in swan is efficient in coastal operational applications at very high résolutions in general wwiii results show larger deviations from the measured data in comparison to swan results the st3 st4 and st6 physics demonstrated varied performances with similar source function settings in both the models however it should be noted that there were some model feature variations in the models which may be considered as a limitation of the present investigation eventhough the investigation using significant wave parameters provided a good background on the simulation capability of the model using different parameterisations it is equally essential to evaluate wave spectrum and integral spectrum components it is to be noted that if steering factors for wave evolution are wind speed and direction then the growth of the spectrum can be controlled by factors such as directional spreading similarly the dissipation of wave energy is afflicted in the complete spectrum based on the dissipation function utilised the directional spread is not modelled accurately and hence it is a challenging task to compare the directional wave elements further the source terms distribution in terms of direction have to be analysed to gain better understanding on the directional wave spectra 7 summary and conclusions the present investigation is a unique sensitivity evaluation study of different parameterizations schemes accessible in state of the art wwiii wave model the model is simulated for the years 2003 and 2004 with the era interim wind forcings and selected years 1997 1999 2001 2004 2005 for cyclonic simulations the estimated wave parameters are evaluated and assessed to test the appropriateness of input dissipation schemes in the north indian ocean all the parameterizations were examined independently to validate the simulated hs tm tp θm and θp with moored buoy observations in the arabian sea and bay of bengal further the wwiii hindcasts were also compared with the swan model outputs hence performance evaluation of wavewatch iii and swan models using in situ measurements in the northern indian ocean yielded the following conclusions the study infers that st4 physics is the adequate option for input and dissipation term for the indian seas arabian sea and bay of bengal irrespective of the seasons it is to be noted that wind seas with high frequencies and prevailing swells is a characteristic feature of the sea state in north indian ocean and hence the present st4 option is best suited with improvements to accurately model the interdependence of swells and wind sea the st1 physics is seen to be underestimated all times along with overestimation seen by st2 physics st3 physics revealed a moderate performance showing deviations at the buoy locations the two year simulation showed that using st6 physics package which is the newest in wwiii it performs similarity to st4 st6 has large variability and it overestimates the model parameters it does not actually improve wave parameters and resulted in lower model performance statistics compared to st4 which is an older physics package in the case of simulation experiments carried out during periods of tropical cyclones it is realized that the st2 physics best represented the strong waves driven by the cyclonic systems the comparison of hs for 7 cases in both the semi enclosed seas such as arabian sea and bay of bengal rated st2 as the most efficient in reproducing the simulated hs at the selected buoy locations the comparison of wwiii and nested swan model set up revealed better performances using swan with st4 and st6 physics this points out to the better estimations of swell dissipation by st4 and st6 physics in wwiii and thereby achieving the consistency of input output momentum energy with the corresponding drag laws and estimates of breaking improving parameterization is one of the very basic requirements for the accurate model skills and performance hence data assimilation techniques will be considered in future studies to improve the prediction capability the model performance assessment will be extended giving importance to spectrum and source function analysis hence future studies will also aim at using spectra and long term continuous measurements to resolve the uncertainty in accurate prediction of sea states in both
