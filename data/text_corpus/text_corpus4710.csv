23550,in this paper implosion of a micron sized air bubble was studied numerically using openfoam software package then a parametric investigation on the flow physics of the problem was performed the results show that as the initial pressure of the liquid increases the pressure and the temperature inside the bubble increases such that in some cases the temperature is as high as the one required for luminescence also increasing the density and the temperature of the liquid solely decreases the intensity of the collapse 1 introduction in physics bubble implosion is of high importance since it has a significant role in many phenomena such as sonoluminescence in which micron sized bubbles excited by the sound waves emit flashes of light during strong collapse barber et al 1991 also due to destruction caused by cavitation bubble implosion is of great interest in engineering and industry it is now a century that rayleigh first described the pressure developed in a liquid during the collapse of spherical cavities rayleigh 1917 although he assumed the liquid to be as inviscid and incompressible and ignored surface tension which is a significant parameter especially in microscale his results formed bubble dynamics basis later plesset tried to improve rayleigh s theory by taking into account for the effects of viscosity and surface tension which led to the well known rayleigh plesset equation hickling and plesset 1964 experiments such as cole 1949 showed that the energy of the exploded bubble vanishes gently during bubble beat in order to find the reason behind the energy dissipation of the exploded bubble many researchers also considered the compressibility of the liquid surrounding the bubble keller and kolodner 1956 prosperetti and lezzi 1986 lezzi and prosperetti 1987 nigmatulin et al 2000 the mentioned studies assumed the collapse of the bubble as spherical but practically due to huge compression of the materials inside the bubble and large velocities during the last steps of the collapse bubbles never collapse completely spherical in this regard researchers studied the shape stability of the bubble and found that the spherical symmetry hypothesis cannot be precisely true particularly at the last step of the collapse plesset and prosperetti 1977 bogoyavlenskiy 2000 in other studies brennen 2013 and hilgenfeldt et al 1996 declared that the rayleigh taylor shape instabilities may cause the extinction of sonoluminescence most of the phenomenon related to the bubble implosion such as sonoluminescence or cavitation damage occur so rapid that in spite of using high tech equipment experimental researchers are not easily able to investigate the bubble implosion phenomenon and providing accurate data hence numerical simulations serve as an efficient tool for studying bubble dynamics wu and roberts 1993 using the rayleigh plesset equation and considering the collapse as spherical suggest the formation of a shock inside the bubble moss et al 1994 utilizing a finite difference technique studied the hydrodynamics of the liquid around the bubble time dependently however their investigation was in one dimension and lacked surface tension and viscous effects in a later study yu et al 1995 by solving three dimensional navier stokes equations using a finite difference front tracking method and ignoring thermal effects investigated the collapse of a cavitation bubble in shear flows however in their simulation the surrounding liquid was incompressible during the past two decades many numerical techniques have been proposed by the researchers for studying bubble dynamics for example boundary element method bem best and kucera 1992 zhang and liu 2015 li et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 boundary integral method bim blake et al 1986 1987 wang 2013 wang 2014 or smoothed particle hydrodynamics method sph ming et al 2016 were used to investigate non spherical bubble dynamics also researchers utilized level set method to describe the bubble motion nagrath et al 2006 lauer et al 2012 volume of fluid vof is a finite volume based method that has been used widely for dealing with multiphase flows details about the vof method can be found in hirt and nichols 1981 many of the researchers implemented this method for studying the bubble dynamics especially in the recent years passandideh fard and roohi 2008 utilized a modified vof for studying cavitating flows osterman et al 2009 used vof to study near wall bubble collapse under the influence of acoustic fields more recently koch et al 2016 using open source software package openfoam numerically modeled laser generated cavitation bubbles they were able to capture shock waves by implementing tait equation of state for the liquid phase koukouvinis et al 2016a used vof to study the non spherical collapse of a laser generated bubble subject to gravitational force they found that during the expansion the bubble shape is highly spherical but at the final stages of the collapse a jet emerges at the axis of symmetry also in another study koukouvinis et al 2016b they investigated a laser generated bubble interacting with a free surface using vof since bubble implosion is a highly interested area of research especially for sonoluminescence studies and based on our literature review there is not sufficient information about the environmental conditions that affect the bubble implosion this paper aims to focus on the physics of bubble implosion under different environmental conditions volume of fluid method of open source software package openfoam is used to handle interactions of the liquid and the gas both the liquid and the gas phases are treated as compressible surface tension viscous and thermal effects are taken into account as given in koch et al 2016 there is no need to include phase transition and therefore there is no mass transfer between the phases 2 numerical procedure the volume of fluid method of openfoam is used to deal with the interface between the liquid and the gas openfoam et al and both phases are treated as compressible in the following the governing equations and the methodology used in the present simulation are discussed in detail 2 1 governing equation the governing equations solved in openfoam are as follows the continuity equation 1 ρ t ρ u 0 the navier stokes equation 2 ρ u t ρ u u p 2 3 μ u μ u u μ ρ g σ κ α 1 α 1 in which σ is the surface tension κ is the curvature of the surface and α 1 is the phase fraction of phase 1 the curvature of the surface can be obtained as 3 κ α 1 α 1 2 2 equation of state for the liquid and gas phase for the liquid and gas phases a linear equation of state is used as follows 4 ρ i ψ i p ρ 0 i where i is the phase liquid l or gas g and ψ i denotes the compressibility and is equal to 1 c i 2 where c i is the sound speed for the compressible gas the density ρ 0 is considered zero which results in an ideal equation of state i e ρ 1 r t p on the other hand for a less compressible liquid ρ 0 would be the density at t 0 as a result the density of the liquid phase is considered as constant except that the liquid is under high pressures 2 3 volime fraction equation the continuity equation eq 1 for each phase can be rewritten as 5 ρ α i t ρ α i u i 0 for a compressible flow we would have 6 α i t α i u i α i ρ i d ρ i d t eq 4 which relates density to pressure can be modified as follows 7 d ρ i d t ψ i d p d t substituting eq 7 into eq 6 we would obtain 8 α i t α i u i α i ψ i ρ i d p d t the velocity u can be computed through the following relation 9 u α 1 ψ 1 ρ 1 α 2 ψ 2 ρ 2 d p d t the volume fraction equation eq 8 for a compressible flow would be as 10 α 1 t α 1 u 1 α 1 1 α 1 u r α 1 1 α 1 ζ α 1 u 2 4 grid study in the first case study a spherical air bubble with an initial 10 μ m radius and 1e5 pa pressure was considered which is under pressure by the surrounding water at 1e7 pa the properties of air and water at 300 k was chosen for the simulation and in the computations the surface tension was considered 0 072 n m the geometry of the problem is given in fig 1 referring to the figure the computational domain of the problem consists of a 5 sector of a sphere with 50 μ m radius obviously in order to reduce the computational cost the flow field was solved only on this 5 sector of the sphere instead of considering a full three dimensional domain fig 2 demonstrates the structure of the grid used in the simulation and a zoomed view of the mesh inside the bubble as indicated the mesh inside the bubble is such fine that even when the bubble reaches its minimum radius during the first collapse the interface can be captured easily in order to see the effects of grid resolution on the accuracy of the solution three different grids containing 52400 coarse mesh 90600 intermediate mesh and 213400 fine mesh cells were considered the intensity of the bubble collapse depends on the degree of sphericity of the bubble until the last stages of the collapse therefore making the mesh in the region of the bubble finer would guarantee to some extent the sphericity of the bubble during the collapse fig 3 shows the bubble radius versus time for the three mentioned grids as it is shown in the figure there is not so much difference between the three grids except that for the finer grids the minimum radius value is less which means that the amount of temperature and pressure at the center of the bubble for finer grids is more in order to decrease the computational cost the medium grid containing 90600 cells was considered for the rest of results 3 results and discussion in this section we are going to validate the bubble dynamics in our simulation with the rayleigh plesset equation and present some results and then a parametric study on the problem will be fulfilled 3 1 numerical simulation validation in order to validate the numerical methodology underwater bubble implosion as our first case study was simulated and the results were compared to that obtained through the rayleigh plesset equation the well known rayleigh plesset equation used in this simulation for comparison is as follows 11 ρ r r 3 2 r 2 p v p p g 0 r 0 r 3 n 2 σ r 4 μ r r in which ρ is the liquid density r is the bubble radius p v is the vapor pressure p is the pressure at the bubble level p g 0 is the initial bubble pressure σ is the surface tension between the liquid and the gas μ is the liquid dynamic viscosity and n is a polytropic exponent set equal to γ the ratio of specific heats of the gas if the gas inside the bubble obeys the isentropic law in this simulation the vapor pressure p v was assumed to be zero and the vapor mass transfer was omitted the geometry and properties of the problem is the same as given in the grid study section fig 4 demonstrates the variation of the bubble radius during time achieved from the present study compared with the one from the rayleigh plesset equation eq 11 according to the figure the bubble radius variation obtained from the simulation follows that of the rayleigh plesset equation the bubble starts to decrease in size from an initial 10 μ m radius down to a minimum radius of 1 μ m then the bubble rebounds thereafter unlike the rayleigh plesset equation the bubble cannot recover the initial radius since during the collapse the spherical shape of the bubble is somehow distorted and also the viscosity of the liquid acts as a damper which does not allow the bubble to expand enough to gain the initial radius fig 5 shows the pressure and temperature variation at the center of the bubble as time goes referring to fig 5 the initial pressure and temperature at the center of the bubble is 1e5 pa and 300 k respectively then when the bubble starts to collapse the pressure and temperature inside the bubble increase this is because a spherical pressure wave starts to travel inside the bubble approaching the center causing the pressure and temperature at the center of the bubble to increase dramatically such that in some cases like what happens in sonoluminescence the temperature is so high leading to emission of flashes of light when the bubble first rebounds the temperature and pressure inside it decrease massively and then when the bubble collapses for the second time the temperature and pressure inside the bubble rise but not as high as the first collapse since the second collapse is weaker than the first one thereafter the bubble rebounds again and the pressure and temperature fall accordingly fig 6 depicts the pressure distribution along the radius for different times from the figure one can understand that the center approaching pressure waves are the sings of presence of a shock wave at the center of the bubble which induces a pressure value of more than 1 1 gpa near the last stage of the collapse also the temperature profile along the radius for various times is given in fig 7 which shows that a spherical shock is approaching the center of the bubble furthermore at the last stages of the collapse the temperature inside the bubble rises beyond 4000 k it is worth to say that from figs 6 and 7 it is obvious that the pressure and the temperature back of the shock drop instantly due to hydrodynamic expansion x component of velocity profiles along with the variation of the bubble radius are given in fig 8 demonstrating that the fluid moved toward the center until the last stages of the collapse about 96 ns the converging shock wave raises initially the velocity inside the gas quickly but when the shock approaches the center the velocity decreases due to the fact that more compression of the gas is impossible thereafter as the shock reaches the center and moves back the flow moves outward as well another point which can be withdrawn from fig 8 is that the velocity profile is nearly linear inside the bubble fig 9 shows volume fraction contours at different times near the bubble region according to the figure the bubble collapses spherically and its radius decreases until about 96 ns where the bubble reaches its minimum radius then it rebounds and expands to some extent and the second collapse happens at about 0 262 μs thereafter also it is visible that for the second collapse the bubble deviates from its spherical shape and some shape instabilities occur on the interface 3 2 parametric study in this section a parametric study on the problem including the effects of liquid pressure density and temperature variation and the effects of changing the surface tension between the liquid and the gas is presented also the simultaneous effects of changing surface tension with temperature is investigated 3 2 1 effects of liquid pressure variation in order to see the effects of changing the liquid pressure on the physics of the problem while the gas pressure was at a constant value of 1e5 pa three more different liquid pressure values were considered and the results were compared with the case where the liquid pressure is 1e7 pa fig 10 shows pressure and temperature values on a line starting from the center of the bubble to somewhere outside the bubble for different amounts of liquid pressure when the bubble attains its minimum radius i e collapse time also fig 11 demonstrates the bubble radius variation versus time for different values of liquid pressure from fig 10 and from what we expect as the liquid initial pressure increases the pressure at the center of the bubble rises such that for 160 mpa liquid initial pressure more than 25 gpa pressure at the center of the bubble is achievable also as the liquid initial pressure rises the temperature inside the bubble increases such that again for 160 mpa liquid initial pressure more than 14 000 k at the center of the bubble is attainable which can be the sign of luminescence referring to fig 11 as the liquid pressure increases the slope of the radius versus time curve becomes steeper which shows that the collapse occurs more severely another point is that raising the liquid pressure leads to a lower value of minimum radius and a sooner collapse time moreover the amplitude of the rebounds becomes smaller as the liquid pressure increases 3 2 2 effects of liquid density variation in order to study the effects of changing the liquid density on the dynamics of the problem leaving everything unchanged i e all the properties are the same as the base case four different values of density were considered for water and the corresponding results were compared with the case when the density of water is 1000 k g m 3 fig 12 shows the bubble radius changing during time for different water densities according to the figure as the density of water increases the slope of the curve becomes more gentle which means that the collapse and accordingly the rebound of the bubble happening in a denser liquid tends to be weaker also the value of the minimum radius would be less fig 13 demonstrates the pressure and temperature distribution versus the distance from the center of the bubble when the liquid density here water varies as before the curves were obtained at each case collapse time according to fig 13 and referring to fig 12 it is obvious that when the liquid becomes denser the pressure and temperature decrease when the density of the liquid is 1000 k g m 3 the pressure and temperature at the center of the bubble are about 1 1 gpa and 4000 k respectively these values decrease to roughly 0 6 gpa and 3000 k when the density of water rises to 1800 k g m 3 3 2 3 effects of liquid temperature variation to see the effects of changing the temperature of the liquid on the intensity of the bubble collapse leaving everything unchanged except surface tension of air water interface and viscosity of water the water temperature was changed three times and the results were compared with the case where the water temperature was 300 k fig 14 shows the bubble radius changing during time for four different values of water temperature including 280 290 300 and 350 k according to the figure as the temperature of water is increased there is no distinguished difference between the curves except that the collapse of the bubble in cooler water seems to be slightly stronger although the effects of changing the surface tension of air water interface was studied solely the results were almost the same 4 conclusion bubble implosion problem was studied numerically using openfoam software package in this paper also a parametric investigation on the physics of the problem was performed the results of the parametric study showed that as the initial pressure of the liquid is increased the collapse of the bubble becomes stronger and the pressure and the temperature at the center of the bubble rise such that luminescence can be observable as the density of the liquid increases the intensity of the collapse decreases slightly changing the temperature of the liquid will not affect the physics of the problem significantly

steam jet ejector the central water jet configuration was applied for the engine where a central water jet was surrounded by an annular steam flow the annular steam flow as the primary fluid was the decomposition gas of hydrogen peroxide and cold water was the secondary fluid the catalyst pack was composed of the alumina pellets doped with manganese oxides the performance evaluation of the engine was performed without the flow field of the secondary fluid the demonstrator successfully generated a practical propulsive force which could be applied for the systems of unmanned underwater vehicles for design of experiments the nozzle exit areas were dealt with it should be ensured that the exit area of nozzle was sufficiently large to prevent thrust instabilities due to the disturbance in the high speed flows in contrast the excessively large area of the nozzle exit might decrease the efficiency of the engine performance in that the geometry of the engine failed to encourage the heat energy transfer between the primary and the secondary fluids keywords hydrogen peroxide decomposition catalyst steam ejector jet propulsion 1 introduction underwater exploration has drawn considerable interest in recent years with respect to resource observation submarine topography oceanography an early warning of natural disaster or military purposes in response to these actions a majority of cost effective and efficient approaches have been devised unmanned underwater vehicles such as autonomous underwater vehicle auv and unmanned undersea vehicles uuv are regarded as one of the appropriate options to perform the future missions because they are able to explore an extensive area of the seabed without the need to be tethered to a mother ship in addition it is expected that the unmanned underwater vehicles will carry out multifarious duties at the same time via constellation operations various kinds of unmanned underwater vehicles were developed and tested and the propulsion system played an important role to determine the performance of the vehicles mooney et al 2001 in general screw propellers have been widely utilized to provide propulsive force for the vehicles because it was simple and inexpensive the propellers were usually powered by diverse electric supply equipment such as batteries fuel cell solar cell and hybrid configurations bradley et al 2001 even though unmanned underwater vehicles should have high driving capability for a large maneuvering range the conventional propellers carried heavy performance penalties at high speeds xin et al 2013 when the propeller rotates at a high speed to produce huge amount of thrust the phenomenon of cavitation is caused on the blade surfaces at a certain point once such cavitation events are triggered severe noise and performance degradation occur from that perspective the use of conventional propellers seems to be barely suitable for the application of high speed unmanned underwater vehicles as an alternative to the conventional propellers the technology of underwater jet propulsion has been studied e g gongwer 1960 korde 2004 guo et al 2011 underwater jet propulsion can be classified depending on the state of the jet condition first liquid water itself as working fluid can jet out after increasing its local pressure through a pump fed system in that situation it would not be expected to deliver high performance because the potential energy of the working fluid is inherently low second the mechanism of steam generation can be applied for underwater jet propulsion there are several ways to generate high temperature steam using the inflowing water a heat exchanger can be utilized for the steam jet engine as a representative example however the concept of steam jet engine seems fairly difficult to be adapted for a small unmanned underwater vehicle because the mechanical components required for the heat exchanger increase the complexity of the overall system moreover the combustion process for the heat source of the heat exchanger might cause marine pollution lastly a propulsion unit of torpedoes can be employed to produce propulsive jet flow in water by directly ejecting the combustion exhaust gas through the nozzle the propulsion system is similar with a rocket propulsion system the use of the method makes it easy for an underwater vehicle to travel at a very high speed but the combustion plume could severely pollute the ocean environment it is apparent that hydrogen peroxide is a one of the promising propellants for underwater jet propulsion hydrogen peroxide has been recognized as a non toxic and environment friendly propellant and it is easily decomposed by a catalyst with the result that steam and oxygen are produced musker et al 2006 the products are also environmentally sound substances the process of the catalytic decomposition is an exothermic reaction which can be utilized as a heat source for underwater jet propulsion meanwhile hydrogen peroxide has been used for the jet propulsion system of torpedoes ventura and mullens 1999 however the propulsion system also caused significant environmental pollutants because the rocket plume was injected into the ocean where hydrogen peroxide was used as an oxidizer for the combustion process with hydrocarbon fuels to resolve the problems a new concept of underwater jet propulsion using only hydrogen peroxide was recently suggested claussen et al 2014 marr et al 2015 in the preceding studies relatively low concentration of hydrogen peroxide 30 50 wt was utilized as a propellant and the platinum based catalysts were produced in a peculiar manner the micro underwater vehicles were designed by using these factors and the performance of the vehicles was evaluated in water although the previous researches demonstrated the concept of h2o2 monopropellant propulsion system for the application of the micro underwater vehicle there is still room for improvement the purpose of the present research is to suggest the conceptual design of high speed underwater jet engine for unmanned underwater vehicles in general the vehicles can weigh from tens kilograms to hundreds kilograms thus the jet engine on board should have the capability to propel the whole system at a high speed there are two ways to effectively increase the speed of the vehicle the first is to use a propellant having high energy density the second is to design the shape of the vehicle to decrease the drag force induced by high speed maneuvers in this work high concentration of hydrogen peroxide 90 wt of h2o2 was introduced as a propellant to increase the energy density of the working fluid a high speed underwater jet engine was conceptually designed on the basis of the principles of steam jet ejector heinze 2015 the catalyst pack was also designed to catalytically decompose the propellant and it was composed of the gamma phase alumina pellets doped with manganese oxides 2 experimental approach 2 1 hydrogen peroxide and catalyst pack hydrogen peroxide is easily decomposed by a catalyst without the preheating process of the catalyst pack which contributes to reduce the electric energy consumption required for the preheating method furthermore the mechanism of the catalytic decomposition makes a gas production method simple and light in this work 90 wt of high test peroxide was utilized as a propellant which indicates that the contents of stabilizers in hydrogen peroxide were strictly controlled to prevent the catalyst poisoning the adiabatic temperature of 90 wt high test peroxide was approximately 750 c thus once the propellant was catalytically decomposed superheated steam and oxygen were produced the hydrogen peroxide was purchased from shanghai habo chemical technology co ltd manganese oxides mnox were prepared as active materials and gamma phase alumina γ al2o3 pellets were used for the catalyst support sodium permanganate namno4 solution was used as the catalyst precursor it was purchased from sigma aldrich co ltd the alumina pellets were purchased from alfa aesar the original size of the pellet was about 3 18 mm in diameter and herein they were ground to 1 18 2 00 mm the production process of the catalyst was similar to that of the previous research an et al 2010 kang et al 2017 the refined pellets were washed in the running water and dried in the convection oven 120 c 5 h the active materials were loaded on the pellets by wet impregnation method after that the pellet type catalysts were dried 120 c 24 h and calcined in the furnace 500 c 7 h after finishing the calcination the pellets were washed with water to remove the sodium ions and they were dried 120 c 24 h to take the moisture out fig 1 shows the configuration of the catalyst pack hydrogen peroxide was injected into the catalyst pack via a showerhead type injector the design capacity of the catalyst pack was overestimated with the intention of fully decomposing the propellant injected the distributor was located in the downstream of the catalyst pack to physically support the pellets 2 2 design of underwater jet engine an underwater jet engine should be designed to minimize the drag force during high speed maneuvers to do that the jet engine should operate while inhaling sea water herein a high speed underwater jet engine was conceptually designed on the basis of the principles of steam jet ejector because this concept facilitates breathing cold water as a secondary fluid at a high speed the concept was originally suggested by todman and wallis 2002 they supplied hot steam gas as the primary fluid into the engine by using a heat exchanger the heat exchanger produced the hot steam gas through the heat transfer process from the combustion zone between diesel fuel and air they demonstrated that their engineering model generated the propulsive force in water the jet engine had several features that were not in any of the current propellant driven systems they claimed that the engine had no rotating underwater parts so that it was very quiet efficient virtually impossible to block and cheap to manufacture however there are still parts to be improved first of all the heat exchanger was too bulky and complicate to be placed on board in a small size unmanned underwater vehicles moreover the enthalpy of the hot steam gas was significantly lower than that of high concentration of hydrogen peroxide when considering that the adiabatic decomposition temperature of 90 wt h2o2 reached about 750 c fig 2 presents the schematic view of the conceptual design of high speed underwater jet engine using high concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the beginning stage of this research the central water jet configuration was applied for the engine for this type of engine a central water jet was surrounded by an annular steam flow herein the annular stream flow was the decomposition gas of high concentration of hydrogen peroxide these two flows interacted in the mixing chamber i e heat transfer between the superheated gases and cold water occurred the area of the intake was designed to be gradually shrinking along the axial direction in order to increase the velocity of the incoming flow the cross sectional area of the reduced intake at the end was named as the effective area in this work it was assumed that the catalyst pack was on board in an unmanned underwater vehicle and the engine body was only submerged in water considering that the demonstration of the engine performance was conducted in the static water bath the incoming momentum of the secondary fluid at the intake was negligible so that the mass flow rate at the nozzle exit m e was almost same with the mass flow rate of the decomposition gas m p injected through the gas injector the gas injector was designed with a single annular shaped venturi orifice to accelerate the momentum of the decomposition gas the throat area of the single annular shaped venturi orifice was intentionally determined to choke the primary fluid the decomposition gas of hydrogen peroxide generated from the catalyst pack for stably supplying the high enthalpy gas into the mixing chamber as a fundamental study of the design parameters of the engine the nozzle exit area herein was dealt with the parameters in terms of the nozzle exit area were determined based on the effective area the geometrical information of the engine was summarized in table 1 in this case study it was regarded that the standard test case was the normal area case where the cross sectional area of the nozzle exit was same with that of the effective area conceptually these cross sectional areas were important to determine the velocity of the fluids passing through the inside of the engine and the internal pressure difference the propulsive performance of the engine can be determined by these factors in the normal area case it was theoretically impossible to generate the propulsive force by using only the secondary fluid when the mechanical losses of the fluid were negligible in that situation it can easily distinguish the effect of the additional gas injection from the catalyst pack in terms of the propulsive performance the conversing area case was designed for the extreme case to cause the operational failure of the engine on purpose the reason was that it was impossible to investigate the phenomena related to the operational failure in the diverging area case even though the observation was worthwhile to improve the design of the engine 2 3 testbed configuration fig 3 represents the schematic diagram of the testbed configuration the engine was located under the water in the static water bath and the catalyst pack was placed above the surface of water 90 wt h2o2 was used as a propellant the propellant was injected into the catalyst pack by using the pressure fed system high purity nitrogen gas was utilized as the pressurant the solenoid valve controlled the pneumatic valve in which the valve regulated the injection sequence of the propellant the measurement locations of pressure and temperature were also described in fig 3 the gauge pressure sensors manufactured by sensor system technology co ltd functioned with 0 037 femtosecond accuracy and k type thermocouples were used these sensors were separately located somewhat away from the engine body to prevent them from sinking in the water a scxi module of national instruments was employed as a signal conditioning device with a sampling rate of 1000 hz and a 100 khz filter the thrust was estimated based on the recorded data of torque sensor there was a moment arm between the torque sensor and the engine body an orifice type mass flow meter with roughly 1 accuracy was used to measure the mass flow rate of the propellant fig 4 shows the actual testbed configuration in this work 3 results and discussion the performance evaluation of the engine was conducted in two different conditions in atmospheric and in water conditions two independent variables were the mass flow rate of hydrogen peroxide and the exit area of the nozzle respectively the burn time was set to 3 s in all cases among the three test cases the description of the results of the converging area case was first in this section because a large thrust instability of the engine was abnormally observed on the other hand no abnormal fluctuation was observed in terms of the temperature profiles in all cases 3 1 operation failure in the parameter study using the water bath a large thrust instability of the engine was observed in the converging area case the test results were described in fig 5 according to the data just after passing through the catalyst pack the temperature of the decomposition gas was relatively lower than the adiabatic decomposition temperature of 90 wt h2o2 the temperatures of the engine inside submerged in water were below than 100 c although it was confirmed that the decomposition gas was stably injected in the engine based on the pressure data the thrust was significantly fluctuated there was no apparent signal on the other pressure sensors at that moment the bubbles generated inside of the mixing zone were vigorously emitted from both sides the intake and the nozzle exist of the engine at the same time the fact indicates that the streams of the mixed flow were severely disturbed by the narrow area of the nozzle exit so that the bulk flow of turbulence streams occurred inside of the engine as a result the severe thrust instability was caused by the geometrical problem in terms of the nozzle exit area in order words it should be ensured that the exit area of nozzle is sufficiently large to prevent the disturbance in the high speed flows for this type of underwater jet engine meanwhile the phenomenon might be the result of the stationary water inside the bath without the initiation of the flow of the secondary fluid because the flow condition in front of the intake can have a decisive effect on the startup phase of the engine further research should be implemented to investigate the phenomenon the following sections include the discussion on the experimental results of the other cases 3 2 performance evaluation in terms of temperature there was not much difference in the experimental results of the both cases the normal area case and the diverging area case likewise with the previous test case there was also no apparent signal on the pressure sensors connected to the engine fig 6 provides the representative result showing that the designed underwater jet engine was successfully operated in the water condition it was necessary to focus on the performance variations of the engine depending on the environmental conditions fig 7 indicates that the temperature variations of the engine with the mass flow rate of hydrogen peroxide in the atmospheric condition the symbols connected through the dash dot lines represent the temperatures measured in the catalyst pack and the symbols connected through the solid lines indicates the temperatures measured in the engine as the mass flow rate was increased the outlet temperature t2 of the catalyst pack gradually approached to its adiabatic decomposition temperature the inlet temperature t1 of the catalyst pack started to decrease when the mass flow rate was beyond the specific value because the liquid jets of h2o2 with high moment could penetrate into the location where the temperature t1 was placed in the catalyst pack even though the outlet temperatures of the gas injector t4 were very similar to each other those of the nozzle exit t7 were different the temperatures in the normal area case were higher these results implied that the excessively large area of the nozzle exit caused the huge amount of the heat energy loss due to the reduction of the residence time for interacting the two streams at high velocities in the measurement locations of t3 t5 and t6 there were no significant changes in the temperature profiles depending on the mass flow rate in short in this type of engine the strong interactions between the two different streams might occur along the inner walls of the engine fig 8 summarizes the results in the water condition comparing to the data obtained from the atmospheric condition the overall temperatures inside of the engine were decreased in the water condition especially the temperatures of the gas injector t4 were considerably reduced this was because large amount of heat energy of the decomposition gas was transferred to the cold water due to the heat transfer some portion of the stagnant cold water in the engine would be boiled on the contrary to this the steam vapor in the decomposition gas could be condensed similar to the test results in the atmospheric condition the temperatures of the nozzle exit in the normal area case were higher than those of the nozzle exit in the diverging area case in conclusion although it is difficult to predict the flow field inside the engine when the secondary fluid comes in it is important to evenly mix the two streams for efficiently transferring the heat energy to the cold water the factor can be controlled by varying the cross sectional areas and gas injection patterns 3 3 performance evaluation in terms of pressure and thrust the performance characteristics in terms of pressure and thrust were noticeably changed depending on the external environments however the pressure and thrust profiles were qualitatively similar regardless of the test conditions fig 9 provides the representative data in the diverging area case the pressure profiles related to the catalyst pack were nearly identical to the other cases which indicates that the gas conditions injected to the engine were almost same there was a long delay in the response time of the torque sensor until the magnitude of thrust converged to a certain value this might be due to the fact that the length of the moment arm was excessively long leading to mechanical oscillations the oscillations could influence on the thrust profiles measured by qualitatively comparing these two test conditions it appeared that the fluctuations of the thrust profiles were mainly intensified by the physical interactions between the primary fluid and the cold water in the engine rather than the mechanical oscillations when the condition of the gas injection from the catalyst pack was not considerably changed it was possible that the amplitude of the thrust fluctuations in the atmospheric condition was dominantly affected by the oscillations caused by the thrust measuring rig on the other hand in the water condition the interaction between the two fluids evidently intensified the amplitude of the thrust fluctuations this was because a large amount of the bubbles were vigorously generated inside of the engine resulted from the interaction from that perspective it seems that the thrust fluctuations can be reduced by the modification of the internal design of the engine for example the mixing chamber can be redesigned by adding some ribs to reduce the fluctuations for the performance analysis in this work it was assumed that the engine reached the steady state from 2 to 3 s fig 10 presents the performance comparison of the engine in terms of specific thrust fs the specific thrust was estimated through eq 1 where f and m are the average values of the measured thrust and mass flow rate of hydrogen peroxide in the steady state respectively in both cases the specific thrust was decreased when the engine operated in water the performance loss was resulted from the interaction of the two fluids the heat energy of the decomposition gas was transferred to the stagnant cold water according to the data the specific thrust in the normal area case and in the diverging area case decreased by 19 and 18 3 respectively in other words the performance loss in the normal area case was slightly more than that in the diverging area case the reason was that the heat energy exchange more actively occurred between the primary fluid and the cold water the aspect was in line with the temperature variations in the nozzle exit see figs 7 and 8 thus it appeared that the engine geometry tested in the normal area case was more favorable to transfer the heat energy from the primary fluid to the secondary fluid from that perspective it was expected that the engine performance in the normal area case might be higher than that in the diverging area case when the flow field of the secondary fluid was formed fig 11 represents the thrust instabilities of the engine in the steady state the thrust instabilities were quantitatively compared using the root mean square error rmse method in the atmospheric condition the thrust instabilities were gradually stabilized in the certain conditions as the mass flow rate of hydrogen peroxide was increased however the thrust instabilities of the engine in the water condition continued to grow the phenomena seem to be attributed to the interaction between the decomposition gas and the stagnant cold water as the mass flow rate of the propellant was increased the process of bubble nucleation in the boiling water could be accelerated along the interfaces of the two fluids it was also expected that the phenomena related to the thrust instabilities could be reduced when the flow field of the secondary fluid was formed 1 f s f m 4 conclusions as a feasibility study on a new propulsion system for unmanned underwater vehicles the conceptual design of high speed underwater jet engine was conducted and demonstrated using 90 wt hydrogen peroxide as a propellant such a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide not only has high chemical potential energy but also is an environmentally friendly propellant on the basis of the principles of steam jet ejector the central water jet configuration was applied for the engine for this type of engine a central water jet was surrounded by an annular steam flow herein the annular stream flow was the decomposition gas of the high concentration of hydrogen peroxide the catalyst pack consisted of gamma phase alumina pellets doped with manganese oxides as a fundamental approach of the design parameters the nozzle exit area herein was dealt with the parameters of the nozzle exit area were determined based on the effective area of the engine intake in the beginning stage of the research the performance evaluation of the engine was performed without the formation of the flow field of the secondary fluid it was successful to generate a practical propulsive force with the demonstrator which might be applied for the existing systems of unmanned underwater vehicles based on the experimental data it was found that the exit area of the nozzle noticeably affected the performance of the engine it should be ensured that the exit area of nozzle was sufficiently large to prevent thrust instabilities due to the disturbance of the internal flow path in contrast the excessively large area of the nozzle exit could decrease the efficiency of the engine performance in that the geometry of the engine failed to encourage the heat energy transfer between the primary fluid the decomposition gas of hydrogen peroxide and the secondary fluid the inflowing water meanwhile there were some limitations in this research first of all the actual performance evaluation of the engine should be implemented with the flow field of the secondary fluid because the performance characteristics of the engine must be changed depending on the flow field of the secondary fluid furthermore it appeared that the thrust fluctuations in this work were mainly derived from the mechanical reasons attributed to the interaction of the two fluids to resolve the problems it would be helpful to perform simple cfd simulations for optimizing the design of the mixing chamber and nozzle shape the core design parameters of the engine also should be examined in more detail moreover the thrust measuring rig should be modified to accurately measure the propulsive force of the engine in water acknowledgments this research was supported by the basic science research program through the national research foundation of korea nrf funded by the

that moment the bubbles generated inside of the mixing zone were vigorously emitted from both sides the intake and the nozzle exist of the engine at the same time the fact indicates that the streams of the mixed flow were severely disturbed by the narrow area of the nozzle exit so that the bulk flow of turbulence streams occurred inside of the engine as a result the severe thrust instability was caused by the geometrical problem in terms of the nozzle exit area in order words it should be ensured that the exit area of nozzle is sufficiently large to prevent the disturbance in the high speed flows for this type of underwater jet engine meanwhile the phenomenon might be the result of the stationary water inside the bath without the initiation of the flow of the secondary fluid because the flow condition in front of the intake can have a decisive effect on the startup phase of the engine further research should be implemented to investigate the phenomenon the following sections include the discussion on the experimental results of the other cases 3 2 performance evaluation in terms of temperature there was not much difference in the experimental results of the both cases the normal area case and the diverging area case likewise with the previous test case there was also no apparent signal on the pressure sensors connected to the engine fig 6 provides the representative result showing that the designed underwater jet engine was successfully operated in the water condition it was necessary to focus on the performance variations of the engine depending on the environmental conditions fig 7 indicates that the temperature variations of the engine with the mass flow rate of hydrogen peroxide in the atmospheric condition the symbols connected through the dash dot lines represent the temperatures measured in the catalyst pack and the symbols connected through the solid lines indicates the temperatures measured in the engine as the mass flow rate was increased the outlet temperature t2 of the catalyst pack gradually approached to its adiabatic decomposition temperature the inlet temperature t1 of the catalyst pack started to decrease when the mass flow rate was beyond the specific value because the liquid jets of h2o2 with high moment could penetrate into the location where the temperature t1 was placed in the catalyst pack even though the outlet temperatures of the gas injector t4 were very similar to each other those of the nozzle exit t7 were different the temperatures in the normal area case were higher these results implied that the excessively large area of the nozzle exit caused the huge amount of the heat energy loss due to the reduction of the residence time for interacting the two streams at high velocities in the measurement locations of t3 t5 and t6 there were no significant changes in the temperature profiles depending on the mass flow rate in short in this type of engine the strong interactions between the two different streams might occur along the inner walls of the engine fig 8 summarizes the results in the water condition comparing to the data obtained from the atmospheric condition the overall temperatures inside of the engine were decreased in the water condition especially the temperatures of the gas injector t4 were considerably reduced this was because large amount of heat energy of the decomposition gas was transferred to the cold water due to the heat transfer some portion of the stagnant cold water in the engine would be boiled on the contrary to this the steam vapor in the decomposition gas could be condensed similar to the test results in the atmospheric condition the temperatures of the nozzle exit in the normal area case were higher than those of the nozzle exit in the diverging area case in conclusion although it is difficult to predict the flow field inside the engine when the secondary fluid comes in it is important to evenly mix the two streams for efficiently transferring the heat energy to the cold water the factor can be controlled by varying the cross sectional areas and gas injection patterns 3 3 performance evaluation in terms of pressure and thrust the performance characteristics in terms of pressure and thrust were noticeably changed depending on the external environments however the pressure and thrust profiles were qualitatively similar regardless of the test conditions fig 9 provides the representative data in the diverging area case the pressure profiles related to the catalyst pack were nearly identical to the other cases which indicates that the gas conditions injected to the engine were almost same there was a long delay in the response time of the torque sensor until the magnitude of thrust converged to a certain value this might be due to the fact that the length of the moment arm was excessively long leading to mechanical oscillations the oscillations could influence on the thrust profiles measured by qualitatively comparing these two test conditions it appeared that the fluctuations of the thrust profiles were mainly intensified by the physical interactions between the primary fluid and the cold water in the engine rather than the mechanical oscillations when the condition of the gas injection from the catalyst pack was not considerably changed it was possible that the amplitude of the thrust fluctuations in the atmospheric condition was dominantly affected by the oscillations caused by the thrust measuring rig on the other hand in the water condition the interaction between the two fluids evidently intensified the amplitude of the thrust fluctuations this was because a large amount of the bubbles were vigorously generated inside of the engine resulted from the interaction from that perspective it seems that the thrust fluctuations can be reduced by the modification of the internal design of the engine for example the mixing chamber can be redesigned by adding some ribs to reduce the fluctuations for the performance analysis in this work it was assumed that the engine reached the steady state from 2 to 3 s fig 10 presents the performance comparison of the engine in terms of specific thrust fs the specific thrust was estimated through eq 1 where f and m are the average values of the measured thrust and mass flow rate of hydrogen peroxide in the steady state respectively in both cases the specific thrust was decreased when the engine operated in water the performance loss was resulted from the interaction of the two fluids the heat energy of the decomposition gas was transferred to the stagnant cold water according to the data the specific thrust in the normal area case and in the diverging area case decreased by 19 and 18 3 respectively in other words the performance loss in the normal area case was slightly more than that in the diverging area case the reason was that the heat energy exchange more actively occurred between the primary fluid and the cold water the aspect was in line with the temperature variations in the nozzle exit see figs 7 and 8 thus it appeared that the engine geometry tested in the normal area case was more favorable to transfer the heat energy from the primary fluid to the secondary fluid from that perspective it was expected that the engine performance in the normal area case might be higher than that in the diverging area case when the flow field of the secondary fluid was formed fig 11 represents the thrust instabilities of the engine in the steady state the thrust instabilities were quantitatively compared using the root mean square error rmse method in the atmospheric condition the thrust instabilities were gradually stabilized in the certain conditions as the mass flow rate of hydrogen peroxide was increased however the thrust instabilities of the engine in the water condition continued to grow the phenomena seem to be attributed to the interaction between the decomposition gas and the stagnant cold water as the mass flow rate of the propellant was increased the process of bubble nucleation in the boiling water could be accelerated along the interfaces of the two fluids it was also expected that the phenomena related to the thrust instabilities could be reduced when the flow field of the secondary fluid was formed 1 f s f m 4 conclusions as a feasibility study on a new propulsion system for unmanned underwater vehicles the conceptual design of high speed underwater jet engine was conducted and demonstrated using 90 wt hydrogen peroxide as a propellant such a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide not only has high chemical potential energy but also is an environmentally friendly propellant on the basis of the principles of steam jet ejector the central water jet configuration was applied for the engine for this type of engine a central water jet was surrounded by an annular steam flow herein the annular stream flow was the decomposition gas of the high concentration of hydrogen peroxide the catalyst pack consisted of gamma phase alumina pellets doped with manganese oxides as a fundamental approach of the design parameters the nozzle exit area herein was dealt with the parameters of the nozzle exit area were determined based on the effective area of the engine intake in the beginning stage of the research the performance evaluation of the engine was performed without the formation of the flow field of the secondary fluid it was successful to generate a practical propulsive force with the demonstrator which might be applied for the existing systems of unmanned underwater vehicles based on the experimental data it was found that the exit area of the nozzle noticeably affected the performance of the engine it should be ensured that the exit area of nozzle was sufficiently large to prevent thrust instabilities due to the disturbance of the internal flow path in contrast the excessively large area of the nozzle exit could decrease the efficiency of the engine performance in that the geometry of the engine failed to encourage the heat energy transfer between the primary fluid the decomposition gas of hydrogen peroxide and the secondary fluid the inflowing water meanwhile there were some limitations in this research first of all the actual performance evaluation of the engine should be implemented with the flow field of the secondary fluid because the performance characteristics of the engine must be changed depending on the flow field of the secondary fluid furthermore it appeared that the thrust fluctuations in this work were mainly derived from the mechanical reasons attributed to the interaction of the two fluids to resolve the problems it would be helpful to perform simple cfd simulations for optimizing the design of the mixing chamber and nozzle shape the core design parameters of the engine also should be examined in more detail moreover the thrust measuring rig should be modified to accurately measure the propulsive force of the engine in water acknowledgments this research was supported by the basic science research program through the national research foundation of korea nrf funded by the

23552,the paper presents a 3d dynamic programming based ship voyage optimization method aiming to select the optimal path and speed profile for a ship voyage on the basis of weather forecast maps the optimization is performed in accordance to a minimum fuel consumption strategy taking also into account ship motions and comfort the optimization is carried out in a discretized space time domain the ship voyage is parametrized as a multi stage decision process in order to formulate a dynamic programming optimization problem waves and wind conditions are estimated for each route segment by weather forecasting maps then seakeeping related indexes and fuel oil consumption are computed taking into account wave induced ship motions and added resistance the best routing solution is thus selected by a dynamic programming algorithm developed and implemented by the authors results and discussion of the proposed method are presented for a merchant ship application in a test case voyage through the northern atlantic ocean and compared to the constant speed great circle solution keywords ship voyage optimization dynamic programming weather routing ship propulsion ship motions 1 introduction in the recent years the continuously increasing availability of reliable weather forecast data has significantly improved the safety of the ship voyages helping the operators to select proper routes to avoid rough weather and have an estimate of the time of arrival eta and the voyage cost moreover increased attention is put nowadays to seakeeping abilities of ships in order to improve passage safety even with rough sea however most of the time medium intensity weather conditions are encountered these conditions do not affect ship safety but influence fuel consumption and comfort on board in this framework optimization algorithms can provide a significant support to the decision making process in order to select the best choice in sight of one or more objectives the selection of the optimal route combines a number of objective functions as well as various constraints in principle a ship voyage is characterized by a starting point an arrival point a constrained arrival time window eventually a number of fixed way points geographical static constraints need to be considered as well for example the shore line traffic separation schemes restricted areas bathymetry realistic modeling of the ship behaviour in relation to weather conditions is crucial to correctly estimate and compare the ship performance in different conditions decision making needs to be based on ship response rather than on external conditions chen 2013 in order to better fit different ship types shapes and dimensions different ships have different responses in the same weather and speed conditions ship and human life safety fuel consumption energy efficiency crew and passengers comfort voyage time management control of delays are possible tasks which can be pursued by voyage optimization weather routing services and codes available on the market are usually not supported by public domain scientific papers due to confidentiality reasons in author s knowledge very often they are based on the principle of storm avoidance the typical approach is to implement a set of generic speed reduction curves in function of sea state parameters for example the beaufort wind force scale and a number of global ship parameters for example displacement and length the fuel consumption is estimated on the basis of empirical relationships while ship hull geometry seakeeping abilities and propulsion system features are neglected this approach can lead to unnecessary diversions to avoid rough weather badly affecting the fuel consumption the ship speed decrease in rough weather can occur as a consequence of two reasons involuntary speed reduction due to the additional resistance induced by wind and waves and or voluntary speed reduction to avoid navigation hazards and excessive ship motions which would result in propeller racing slamming or green water additional constraints related to safety and or comfort might thus be considered to limit ship motions or wave induced forces a proper ship response modeling is crucial in order to correctly estimate these phenomena on a case by case basis furthermore a model of the actual propulsion system is essential in order to predict the propulsion performances in rough sea and to take into account the propulsion system limits when steaming into stormy conditions moreover ship speed changes need to be managed by the optimization algorithm in order to use the speed adjustment as a rough weather avoidance parameter in addition to course deviation but within the propulsion system thrust power capability the weather routing problem has been addressed by many authors in the past and different approaches have been proposed the first pioneer works were centred on finding the minimum time of arrival on a voyage james 1957 zoppoli 1972 papadakis and perakis 1990 however most of the authors neglected the ship response behaviour in rough sea more recently voyage optimization has been approached in a wider sense taking into account ship motions and or fuel consumption the most used techniques include multi objective genetic algorithms marie et al 2009 maki et al 2011 vettor and guedes soares 2016 zaccone et al 2016 deterministic enumerative algorithms lin et al 2013 fang and lin 2015 shao et al 2012 brute force optimization lu et al 2015 local search algorithms safaei et al 2015 simulation of ship behaviour in rough sea have been proposed in the past by several authors journée 1976 journée and meijers 1980 proposed some guidelines to develop a ship model to take into account either propulsion and ship motions more recently weather routing oriented propulsion simulation without optimization have been published by coraddu et al 2013 crew and passengers comfort evaluation techniques for human bodies exposed to mechanical vibrations and accelerations are suggested in the iso 2631 1 1997 based on the methods proposed by o hanlon and mccauley 1973 and lawther and griffin 1988 the authors gained extensive experience in steady state and transient modeling of ship propulsion systems altosole et al 2008 2014 2016 2017 martelli et al 2014a b mainly for control design purposes in the here presented work ship voyage optimization problem is tackled by means of a problem specific algorithm based on 3d dynamic programming 3ddp coupled with a dynamic ship propulsion model and with weather forecast data fuel oil consumption is considered as the objective function to minimize while ship motions and expected time of arrival eta are used as constraints in particular ship motions based constraints are imposed on probability of slamming and deck wetness journée and meijers 1980 motions sickness index msi o hanlon and mccauley 1973 and lateral forces perez 2006 the constraints allow to implicitly take into account any voluntary speed reduction in presence of rough weather while involuntary speed reductions are simulated by considering the effect of the ship resistance increase due to waves journée 1976 on the propulsion system wave and wind forecast data are considered in function of time and geographical coordinates wave significant height mean period direction and wind speed components are obtained via space time interpolation in the forecast maps the obtained data are used to estimate ship motions and added resistance in order to assess the required engine power and fuel consumption via steady state ship propulsion simulation the fuel consumption is used as the cost function to evaluate each route segment and compute the optimal solution dp approach fits well to best path search problems bellman 1958 so is one of the classic choices to tackle ship voyage optimization tasks in particular the problem is solved by exhaustively exploring a discretization of the search domain while very little restrictions are put on either the objective function and optimization constraints because no derivatives are calculated the deterministic nature of the algorithm may be seen as an advantage with respect to heuristic global search algorithms nevertheless in a weather routing framework the benefit is partially limited by the fact that input data is affected by significant uncertainties dp method has some drawbacks in terms of compuatation speed however the presented implementation includes proper problem specific pruning strategies to boost computational efficiency the implemented algorithm performs an efficient systematic exploration of the domain of the solutions defined by a three dimensional space time grid the result of the optimization is a sequence of waypoints and intermediate times determining the ship trajectory and speed profile with respect to present state of the art weather routing and voyage optimization methods the presented approach presents a twofold benefit it is based on a detailed description of the propulsion system allowing a realistic evaluation of the fuel consumption and exhaust emissions versus ship speed and it implements an innovative 3d dynamic programming optimization routine which allows to manage both ship route and speed profile to this end the main tasks to be solved in order to manage the route optimization problem are weather forecast data availability and management ship propulsion performance and hydrodynamic response modeling optimization problem formulation and solution a short overview is given to the first point which is considered as input data the paper is centred on the second and third points which are going to be described in detail finally a case study is analysed and results are shown in order to highlight the features of the presented approach in a realistic case 2 weather conditions two weather actions are considered waves and wind wind forecast data is provided in terms of wind speed components u v as a function of geographical coordinates λ φ and time t forecasted wave significant parameters are provided as well in function of the same variables in particular significant wave height h 1 3 wave period t 1 and direction θ the wave parameters are used to fit a parametric spectral formulation ittc 84 jonswap spectral formulation with a cosine square spreading function is used 1 s ω θ 155 h 1 3 2 ω 5 t 1 4 exp 944 ω 4 t 1 4 γ y 2 π cos 2 θ being 2 y exp 0 191 ω t 1 1 2 σ where ω is the wave circular frequency and γ 3 3 for northern atlantic applications the choice of the spectral formulation can significantly affect the results as it directly influences the ship motions and resistance in particular a correct selection of parameter γ should be made in function of the geographical area in which the optimization is performed moreover real and parametric spectra may differ significantly in presence of crossing seas mentaschi et al 2015 spentza et al 2017 these aspects will be deeply investigated in the future research while the presented work is mainly focused on investigating the potential of the optimization procedures in a voyage optimization framework 3 ship model the ship numerical model allows to estimate the fuel consumption in given geographical positions weather conditions and ship speeds the model is structured in four main blocks hydrodynamic resistance calculation ship motions and comfort assessment propeller performance prediction engine performance prediction the model arrangement is shown in fig 1 at any time and geographical coordinates the weather conditions wave and wind data are estimated by interpolating into weather forecast data then the hydrodynamic resistance as well as ship motions are computed finally the required propeller thrust and torque are evaluated using propeller open water diagrams in order to finally assess the engine power and fuel consumption 3 1 resistance the hydrodynamic resistance of the ship r t o t is decomposed in accordance with the following equation 3 r t o t r t r a w r w i n d where r t is the still water hydrodynamic resistance r a w is the added resistance due to the rough sea effect and r w i n d is the wind resistance the added wave resistance r a w is estimated according to the following expression lewis 1989 4 r a w 0 0 2 π φ a w s ζ d ω d μ where ω is the wave circular frequency s ζ is the directional wave energy spectral density φ a w ω θ v is the wave added resistance pseudo response amplitude operator which expresses the longitudinal drift forces per squared wave amplitude and wave circular frequency and μ is the encounter angle the wind resistance r w i n d is expressed through a function of the relative wind speed v w r 5 r w i n d 1 2 ρ a i r a f v w r 2 c x γ w where ρ a i r is the air density a f is the ship s above water front projection area and c x is the wind resistance coefficient depending on the encounter angle γ w the effects of rough weather are thus modelled in terms of resistance increase rather than speed reductions the resistance increase is actually the cause of the involuntary speed reduction or the power output increase to achieve the required speed within engine limits 3 2 ship motions and comfort the energy spectrum of absolute motion η i is evaluated in accordance with the following equation lewis 1989 6 s η i r a o η i 2 s ζ where ω is the wave circular frequency μ is the encounter angle s ζ ω μ is the directional wave energy spectral density and r a o η i is the complex response amplitude operator of motion η i with i 1 to 6 represent surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw motions respectively the probability that motion η i exceeds the value η i is given by the following relationship 7 p η i η i exp η i 2 2 m 0 η i where m 0 η i is the spectral moment of order zero of motion η i the joint probability that motions η i and η j exceed the values η i and η j respectively is obtained under the hypothesis of independence between η i and η j and is given by the following formula 8 p η i η i η j η j exp η i 2 2 m 0 η i η j 2 2 m 0 η j the spectral moment of order n per squared wave height of motion η i is given by 9 m n 1 0 0 2 π ω n s η i d ω d μ lateral force estimator lfe is used as a global index to take into account either lateral accelerations and displacements perez 2006 the lfe at the point p of cartesian coordinates x p y p z p is given by the following equation 10 l f e p η 2 η 4 z p z g η 6 x p x g g η 4 where η i represent the acceleration of motion η i the above mentioned equation is an expression of side component of the apparent acceleration acting on a body on a ship expressed in its relative system of coordinates simplified for small amplitude motions in particular the first term represents the acceleration induced by the sway motion the second and third express the contributes due to roll and yaw angular accelerations multiplied by the respective arms while the last term is the lateral component of the gravity acceleration originated by the roll angle a more detailed description of the mathematical proof of equation 10 can be found in perez 2006 ship passengers comfort evaluation has been discussed by various authors which propose proper parameters depending mainly on vertical accelerations mean value and frequency the most used parameters are the motion sickness incidence msi proposed by o hanlon and mccauley 1973 and the vomiting incidence vi by lawther and griffin 1986 1988 in this study msi has been used to estimate crew comfort the msi at point p for a reference exposition time of 2 h is given by the following equation cepowski 2012 piscopo and scamardella 2015 in dependence of the spectral moments of the absolute vertical motion η 3 p 11 m s i 100 0 5 erf log 10 a v g μ m s i 0 4 where g is the gravitational acceleration erf x is the error function and a v and μ m s i are defined as follows 12 a v 0 798 m 4 η

k q respectively versus advance coefficient j respectively defined as follows 13 j v a n d 14 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 15 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 where ρ is the density of water t and q are the propeller open water thrust and torque v a is the propeller advance speed n is the propeller revolution speed and d is the propeller diameter the propeller revolutions are evaluated imposing the equilibrium between required vs delivered thrust by using the auxiliary variable k t j 2 is used the engine power is computed in accordance to the following equation 16 p b 2 π ρ h 2 o n 3 d 5 k q η r η s η g where η r η s η g are the relative rotative efficiency the shaft efficiency and the gearbox efficiency respectively considered as constant values the engine fuel mass flow rate m f is evaluated by using the engine performance map modelled using the engine mcr power and revolution by the performance map each working conditions are checked for not exceeding the engine limits fig 2 the feasibility or infeasibility of any combination of speed and weather conditions as well as the associated cost in terms of fuel consumption are thus a result of the propulsion simulation the procedure is summarized in algorithm 1 algorithm 1 fuel mass flow rate computation procedure image 1 the mass of fuel burned m f of each route segment is evaluated by numerical integration of the fuel mass flow rate with respect to time as shown in equation 17 17 m f x i t i x j t j t i t j m f t d t where is supposed to ship travel from point x i at time t i to point x j at time t j expression 17 allows to compute the cost function at each dp step the cost of the whole voyage is obtained by summation of all the contributes 4 route parametrization a parametric definition of the ship voyage is needed in order to perform the optimization the proposed parametrization is based on great circle geometry in order to easily identify the shortest solution in an optimal solution any deviation from the great circle is thus caused by rough weather the minimum angular distance θ a b measured in radiants between two points a and b satisfies the following relationship 18 cosθ a b sin φ a sin φ b c o s φ a cos φ b cos λ b λ a where φ a φ b λ a λ b denote latitude and longitude of the points the course α is defined as the angle between the ship heading and the true north direction it is measured clockwise and it changes continuously along a segment of great circle the following relationships provide the initial and final course angles respectively α i and α f of the great circle segment linking points a and b 19 cos α i sin φ b sin φ a cosθ a b cos φ a sinθ a b 20 cos α f sin φ b cosθ a b sin φ a cos φ b sinθ a b the geographical coordinates of a point x laying on the great circle segment linking a and b and the local course angle are given by the following equations 21 sin φ x sin φ a cos m a b x cos φ a sin θ a b x cos α i 22 cos λ x λ a cos θ a b x cos φ a cos φ x tan φ a tan φ x 23 cos α x sin φ x cos θ a b x sin φ a cos φ x sin θ a b x where x θ a x θ a b is an advance parameter the coordinates of points y are given as a function of the deviation parameter δ by the following expressions 24 φ y φ x δ sin α x 25 λ y λ x σ δ cos α x where σ 1 going eastward and σ 1 going westward fig 3 summarizes the above presented sets of equations in the proposed dynamic programming framework the ship route is modelled as a finite set of way points x 0 x 1 x n such that x i λ i φ i and a corresponding set of arrival times at the way points t 0 t 1 t n where t 0 0 and t n e t a each segment x i x i 1 is sailed at constant speed v i the described scheme allows to identify unequivocally the great circle i e minimum distance solution which is the most convenient in calm sea and obstacle free conditions 5 dynamic programming optimization dynamic programming is an optimization strategy that aims to solve a problem by using a multi stage approach in which the final result is the consequence of a number of separate decisions optimal solution is found on the basis of bellmans principle of optimality an optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with regard to the state resulting from the first decision bellman 1954 the structure of the method well adapts to any multi stage decision process and among all best path search type problems bellman 1958 bellman 1962 as they can be reduced as a sequence of decisions in dependance of which a return is obtained 5 1 formalization the proposed formulation of the ship voyage optimization problem is solved in a three dimensional domain start and arrival points and time instants are assigned a priori then a two dimensional domain is identified by discretizing parameters x and δ in equations 21 25 fig 4 a discretization of the time axis fig 5 is as well performed the route is modelled as finite set of n 1 way points through which the ship passes at assigned times the ship is supposed to travel at constant speed between each pair of waypoints the route r is thus given by the following sets 26 r x x 0 x 1 x n t t 0 t 1 t n where x i λ i φ i x 0 a x n b t 0 0 t n e t a equation 17 allows to compute the fuel m f x i t i x j t j consumed from point x i at time t i to point x j at time t j steaming at constant speed the objective of the problem is to minimize the total fuel consumption 27 m f i 0 n 1 m f x i t i x i 1 t i 1 the problem can be written in the form of the bellman s equation as follows let f i x t be the fuel consumed at stage i from the start following an optimal policy being the ship in position x at time t the target of the search is thus f n x n e t a i e the mass of fuel consumed at the end of the voyage identified by the arrival point x n and estimated time of arrival e t a following an optimal policy in accordance to bellman s principle of optimality the following functional relationship can be written 28 f i x t min ξ τ m f ξ τ x t f i 1 ξ τ where ξ and τ represent the possible positions and times of arrival at stage i 1 5 2 computational aspects dp is an exhaustive approach i e it guarantees to identify the optimal solution associated to the discretization of the problem nevertheless this advantage over heuristic global search algorithms is partially limited by the fact that input data is affected by significant uncertainties dp presents some drawbacks in terms of compuatation speed bellman ford implementation on a graph bellman 1958 runs in o v e where v and e are the number of graph and edges respectively in the present work the breadth first search structure of the bellman ford algorithm has been maintained however a significant speed up has been made by implementing problem specific modifications to the algorithm in the proposed solution scheme the cost of each route segment linking each couple of nodes all geographical positions and all time instants is evaluated in the forward phase the search domain is progressively explored following a breadth first approach nodes are sorted by priority to minimize the number of segments estimations a computationally cheap lower bound of the cost of each segment is first computed in order to early prune the less promising solutions the compliance of each node with the time of arrival window is checked as early as possible nodes visibility based on geographical constraints is checked by using an efficient nearest neighbour search algorithm based on kd tree structures friedman et al 1977 before evaluating the cost of each segment the cost associated to each segment is computed by numerical integration of the ship model output at the end of the calculation a number of nodes characterized by a time of arrival i e the eta and a cost associated fuel consumption are identified the final nodes identify global optima in terms of fuel consumption at fixed time or the fastest solutions at fixed fuel consumption the final set of nodes can thus be seen as the pareto frontier of a two objective optimization problem which aims to minimize both time of arrival and fuel consumption each node contains the information of the previous one so each solution is extracted by back tracking the optimization routine has been developed and implemented by the authors in c language significantly relying on c standard template library armadillo linear algebra library sanderson 2010 has been used for basic matrix manipulation 6 case study the above described optimization code has been tested on a bulk carrier to evaluate the effectiveness of the adopted optimization strategy the main data of the considered vessel are summarized in table 1 the still water resistance has been calculated in accordance with the method proposed by holtrop 1984 wind resistance coefficient c x has been computed according to the method proposed by blendermann 1994 finally open source strip theory seakeeping code pdstrip bertram et al 2006 has been used to evaluate the pseudo response amplitude operator φ a w and ship motions absolute raos the optimization is performed with reference to a voyage representing a north atlantic crossing 6 1 grid setup two optimization modes are compared a speed profile optimization in which no deviations from the great circle route are allowed referred as speed optimization so and a speed and course optimization referred as voyage optimization vo in which both speed and course adjustments are performed in order to achieve the optimum moreover a constant speed great circle solution is presented for comparison a 10 stages by 11 steps grid with 1 maximum deviation is considered the resulting waypoints are about 300 miles apart times of arrival are discretized every 60 min while integration time step is set to 30 min the computation is carried out considering a time of arrival window between 200 and 400 h from departure 6 2 constraints ship safety and comfort constraints are imposed as well in particular slamming and deck wetness probabilities are checked journée 1976 journée and meijers 1980 in accordance with the following inequalities 29 p η 3 r 0 9 l t η 3 r 0 9 l 0 093 g l 0 03 30 p η 3 r b f b 0 07 31 p η 3 b 0 4 g 0 07 being η 3 r 0 9 l and η 3 r b the relative vertical motion at 90 of the ship length and at bow respectively l t and f b the ship length draft and free board at the bow respectively in addition the following inequality constraints are imposed 32 l f e r m s l f e m a x 33 m s i m s i m a x where m s i m a x has been set to 10 l f e r m s is the root mean square of the lateral force estimator and l f e m a x has been selected in accordance with perez 2006 who proposes 0 1 g as an upper bound for general purposes 6 3 weather forecasts the forecasts used for the test case are based on the national weather service noaa wave watch iii model which provides forecast maps every 6 h the files are available in grib format they are 162 h deep they have a 1 25 1 grid resolution and a 6 h time resolution noaa mmab operational wave model the weather forecasts have been downloaded from http www globalmarinenet com in particular the case study optimization is carried out in a typical northern atlantic winter rough weather condition using the forecast maps of day 2016 01 21 12 00 a m an example screenshot of the storm occurring is shown in fig 6 6 4 results fig 7 shows the fuel consumption vs eta trade off curve each point of the curve is the minimum fuel consumption solution at the corresponding eta i e the curve can be seen as the pareto frontier of the minimum eta and minimum fuel consumption optimization problem vo and so solutions are compared and the results achievable by sailing at constant speed are reported for comparison note that the course and speed optimization curve vo has a significant lower consumption with respect to the other two however also speed optimization so provides good results especially for high etas note in addition that both the optimization strategies allow to reduce the negative effect of involuntary speed reduction on the eta allowing thus to achieve lower times of arrival by adjusting speed and course to the weather conditions i e catching up the lost time when the weather conditions are better moreover each of the suggested solutions is the most fuel saving strategy to perform the voyage in the assigned time finally note that fig 7 allows to easily estimate the cost of each hour of anticipation or delay in terms of tons of fuel consumed the trajectories associated to different etas 220 250 and 300 h are presented in figs 8 10 the corresponding speed profiles are presented in figs 11 13 it is worth noting that the optimization algorithm vo acts drastically on ship speed to search the optimum finding articulated speed profiles the route and or speed adjustments allow a global reduction of the fuel mass flow rate required by the propulsion system figs 14 16 resulting in a reduction of the total energy requirement and co2 emissions the fuel consumption profiles are presented in figs 17 19 the solutions presented until now are referred to a westward voyage this direction is associated to head or bow sea mainly if the opposite voyage in the same day of departure is considered the solutions change radically the fuel consumption to eta curves of the two voyages are compared in fig 20 the eastward voyage presents significantly lower fuel consumption as expected the following sea condition is predominant thus the added resistance is lower moreover lower etas are achievable as the weather conditions are less severe involuntary speed reduction is thus less significant in addition the eastward optimized solutions do not present significant fuel saving with respect to the constant speed solution if compared to the westward ones due to the fact that the course and speed changes have small effect on the hydrodynamic resistance in following seas fig 21 presents the trajectories in the two cases associated to an eta of 250 h note that the suggested routes are significantly different due to the different the conditions encountered note finally that sailing in following sea may lead to significant lateral motions the constraint on lateral forces allows to limit these effects however a check of parametric roll maki et al 2011 might be included in a future version 6 5 computational time the above presented computations have been carried out on a standard laptop which main data are summarized in table 2 the computation time is significantly influenced by the chosen discretization parameters and by the set up of the constraints the average computation times achieved are presented in table 3 the computation times required in case a unique eta with no delay is selected are also reported note that the computation in this case is significantly faster on the contrary the computation time increases as the eta window gets wider in general the more the problem is constrained the less nodes are processed resulting in a faster computation 7 conclusions a ship voyage optimization method has been developed and presented aiming to find the minimum fuel consumption voyage subject to safety and comfort constraints by using 3d dynamic programming optimization a steady state ship model has been described the model computes the seakeeping and propulsion performances of the ship in assigned wind and wave conditions a parametric route model based on great circle navigation has been introduced in order to give a dynamic programming formulation of the problem the solution is found by solving the bellman s equation which cost function i e the total mass of burned fuel is evaluated by means of a ship steady sate simulation model in order to take into account ship safety and crew comfort in the optimization slamming deck wetness and high bow acceleration probabilities as well as motion sickness incidence and lateral forces in the crew accommodations are checked not to exceed threshold values an algorithm has been developed and implemented

constant speed voyage a speed profile only optimization and a full speed and course optimization have been compared the presented results include the voyage time to fuel consumption trade off curves the optimal trajectories and speed profiles obtained for different voyage times moreover fuel mass flow rate and fuel consumption profiles associated to the considered solutions have been discussed the sensitivity of the optimization procedure to different weather conditions has been tested by optimizing the reverse voyage in the same days in light of the obtained results a notable fuel saving potential is observed in particular in the voyage optimization vo case in which the algorithm takes full advantage from the ship propulsion model features 
23552,the paper presents a 3d dynamic programming based ship voyage optimization method aiming to select the optimal path and speed profile for a ship voyage on the basis of weather forecast maps the optimization is performed in accordance to a minimum fuel consumption strategy taking also into account ship motions and comfort the optimization is carried out in a discretized space time domain the ship voyage is parametrized as a multi stage decision process in order to formulate a dynamic programming optimization problem waves and wind conditions are estimated for each route segment by weather forecasting maps then seakeeping related indexes and fuel oil consumption are computed taking into account wave induced ship motions and added resistance the best routing solution is thus selected by a dynamic programming algorithm developed and implemented by the authors results and discussion of the proposed method are presented for a merchant ship application in a test case voyage through the northern atlantic ocean and compared to the constant speed great circle solution keywords ship voyage optimization dynamic programming weather routing ship propulsion ship motions 1 introduction in the recent years the continuously increasing availability of reliable weather forecast data has significantly improved the safety of the ship voyages helping the operators to select proper routes to avoid rough weather and have an estimate of the time of arrival eta and the voyage cost moreover increased attention is put nowadays to seakeeping abilities of ships in order to improve passage safety even with rough sea however most of the time medium intensity weather conditions are encountered these conditions do not affect ship safety but influence fuel consumption and comfort on board in this framework optimization algorithms can provide a significant support to the decision making process in order to select the best choice in sight of one or more objectives the selection of the optimal route combines a number of objective functions as well as various constraints in principle a ship voyage is characterized by a starting point an arrival point a constrained arrival time window eventually a number of fixed way points geographical static constraints need to be considered as well for example the shore line traffic separation schemes restricted areas bathymetry realistic modeling of the ship behaviour in relation to weather conditions is crucial to correctly estimate and compare the ship performance in different conditions decision making needs to be based on ship response rather than on external conditions chen 2013 in order to better fit different ship types shapes and dimensions different ships have different responses in the same weather and speed conditions ship and human life safety fuel consumption energy efficiency crew and passengers comfort voyage time management control of delays are possible tasks which can be pursued by voyage optimization weather routing services and codes available on the market are usually not supported by public domain scientific papers due to confidentiality reasons in author s knowledge very often they are based on the principle of storm avoidance the typical approach is to implement a set of generic speed reduction curves in function of sea state parameters for example the beaufort wind force scale and a number of global ship parameters for example displacement and length the fuel consumption is estimated on the basis of empirical relationships while ship hull geometry seakeeping abilities and propulsion system features are neglected this approach can lead to unnecessary diversions to avoid rough weather badly affecting the fuel consumption the ship speed decrease in rough weather can occur as a consequence of two reasons involuntary speed reduction due to the additional resistance induced by wind and waves and or voluntary speed reduction to avoid navigation hazards and excessive ship motions which would result in propeller racing slamming or green water additional constraints related to safety and or comfort might thus be considered to limit ship motions or wave induced forces a proper ship response modeling is crucial in order to correctly estimate these phenomena on a case by case basis furthermore a model of the actual propulsion system is essential in order to predict the propulsion performances in rough sea and to take into account the propulsion system limits when steaming into stormy conditions moreover ship speed changes need to be managed by the optimization algorithm in order to use the speed adjustment as a rough weather avoidance parameter in addition to course deviation but within the propulsion system thrust power capability the weather routing problem has been addressed by many authors in the past and different approaches have been proposed the first pioneer works were centred on finding the minimum time of arrival on a voyage james 1957 zoppoli 1972 papadakis and perakis 1990 however most of the authors neglected the ship response behaviour in rough sea more recently voyage optimization has been approached in a wider sense taking into account ship motions and or fuel consumption the most used techniques include multi objective genetic algorithms marie et al 2009 maki et al 2011 vettor and guedes soares 2016 zaccone et al 2016 deterministic enumerative algorithms lin et al 2013 fang and lin 2015 shao et al 2012 brute force optimization lu et al 2015 local search algorithms safaei et al 2015 simulation of ship behaviour in rough sea have been proposed in the past by several authors journée 1976 journée and meijers 1980 proposed some guidelines to develop a ship model to take into account either propulsion and ship motions more recently weather routing oriented propulsion simulation without optimization have been published by coraddu et al 2013 crew and passengers comfort evaluation techniques for human bodies exposed to mechanical vibrations and accelerations are suggested in the iso 2631 1 1997 based on the methods proposed by o hanlon and mccauley 1973 and lawther and griffin 1988 the authors gained extensive experience in steady state and transient modeling of ship propulsion systems altosole et al 2008 2014 2016 2017 martelli et al 2014a b mainly for control design purposes in the here presented work ship voyage optimization problem is tackled by means of a problem specific algorithm based on 3d dynamic programming 3ddp coupled with a dynamic ship propulsion model and with weather forecast data fuel oil consumption is considered as the objective function to minimize while ship motions and expected time of arrival eta are used as constraints in particular ship motions based constraints are imposed on probability of slamming and deck wetness journée and meijers 1980 motions sickness index msi o hanlon and mccauley 1973 and lateral forces perez 2006 the constraints allow to implicitly take into account any voluntary speed reduction in presence of rough weather while involuntary speed reductions are simulated by considering the effect of the ship resistance increase due to waves journée 1976 on the propulsion system wave and wind forecast data are considered in function of time and geographical coordinates wave significant height mean period direction and wind speed components are obtained via space time interpolation in the forecast maps the obtained data are used to estimate ship motions and added resistance in order to assess the required engine power and fuel consumption via steady state ship propulsion simulation the fuel consumption is used as the cost function to evaluate each route segment and compute the optimal solution dp approach fits well to best path search problems bellman 1958 so is one of the classic choices to tackle ship voyage optimization tasks in particular the problem is solved by exhaustively exploring a discretization of the search domain while very little restrictions are put on either the objective function and optimization constraints because no derivatives are calculated the deterministic nature of the algorithm may be seen as an advantage with respect to heuristic global search algorithms nevertheless in a weather routing framework the benefit is partially limited by the fact that input data is affected by significant uncertainties dp method has some drawbacks in terms of compuatation speed however the presented implementation includes proper problem specific pruning strategies to boost computational efficiency the implemented algorithm performs an efficient systematic exploration of the domain of the solutions defined by a three dimensional space time grid the result of the optimization is a sequence of waypoints and intermediate times determining the ship trajectory and speed profile with respect to present state of the art weather routing and voyage optimization methods the presented approach presents a twofold benefit it is based on a detailed description of the propulsion system allowing a realistic evaluation of the fuel consumption and exhaust emissions versus ship speed and it implements an innovative 3d dynamic programming optimization routine which allows to manage both ship route and speed profile to this end the main tasks to be solved in order to manage the route optimization problem are weather forecast data availability and management ship propulsion performance and hydrodynamic response modeling optimization problem formulation and solution a short overview is given to the first point which is considered as input data the paper is centred on the second and third points which are going to be described in detail finally a case study is analysed and results are shown in order to highlight the features of the presented approach in a realistic case 2 weather conditions two weather actions are considered waves and wind wind forecast data is provided in terms of wind speed components u v as a function of geographical coordinates λ φ and time t forecasted wave significant parameters are provided as well in function of the same variables in particular significant wave height h 1 3 wave period t 1 and direction θ the wave parameters are used to fit a parametric spectral formulation ittc 84 jonswap spectral formulation with a cosine square spreading

choice of the spectral formulation can significantly affect the results as it directly influences the ship motions and resistance in particular a correct selection of parameter γ should be made in function of the geographical area in which the optimization is performed moreover real and parametric spectra may differ significantly in presence of crossing seas mentaschi et al 2015 spentza et al 2017 these aspects will be deeply investigated in the future research while the presented work is mainly focused on investigating the potential of the optimization procedures in a voyage optimization framework 3 ship model the ship numerical model allows to estimate the fuel consumption in given geographical positions weather conditions and ship speeds the model is structured in four main blocks hydrodynamic resistance calculation ship motions and comfort assessment propeller performance prediction engine performance prediction the model arrangement is shown in fig 1 at any time and geographical coordinates the weather conditions wave and wind data are estimated by interpolating into weather forecast data then the hydrodynamic resistance as well as ship motions are computed finally the required propeller thrust and torque are evaluated using propeller open water diagrams in order to finally assess the engine power and fuel consumption 3 1 resistance the hydrodynamic resistance of the ship r t o t is decomposed in accordance with the following equation 3 r t o t r t r a w r w i n d where r t is the still water hydrodynamic resistance r a w is the added resistance due to the rough sea effect and r w i n d is the wind resistance the added wave resistance r a w is estimated according to the following expression lewis 1989 4 r a w 0 0 2 π φ a w s ζ d ω d μ where ω is the wave circular frequency s ζ is the directional wave energy spectral density φ a w ω θ v is the wave added resistance pseudo response amplitude operator which expresses the longitudinal drift forces per squared wave amplitude and wave circular frequency and μ is the encounter angle the wind resistance r w i n d is expressed through a function of the relative wind speed v w r 5 r w i n d 1 2 ρ a i r a f v w r 2 c x γ w where ρ a i r is the air density a f is the ship s above water front projection area and c x is the wind resistance coefficient depending on the encounter angle γ w the effects of rough weather are thus modelled in terms of resistance increase rather than speed reductions the resistance increase is actually the cause of the involuntary speed reduction or the power output increase to achieve the required speed within engine limits 3 2 ship motions and comfort the energy spectrum of absolute motion η i is evaluated in accordance with the following equation lewis 1989 6 s η i r a o η i 2 s ζ where ω is the wave circular frequency μ is the encounter angle s ζ ω μ is the directional wave energy spectral density and r a o η i is the complex response amplitude operator of motion η i with i 1 to 6 represent surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw motions respectively the probability that motion η i exceeds the value η i is given by the following relationship 7 p η i η i exp η i 2 2 m 0 η i where m 0 η i is the spectral moment of order zero of motion η i the joint probability that motions η i and η j exceed the values η i and η j respectively is obtained under the hypothesis of independence between η i and η j and is given by the following formula 8 p η i η i η j η j exp η i 2 2 m 0 η i η j 2 2 m 0 η j the spectral moment of order n per squared wave height of motion η i is given by 9 m n 1 0 0 2 π ω n s η i d ω d μ lateral force estimator lfe is used as a global index to take into account either lateral accelerations and displacements perez 2006 the lfe at the point p of cartesian coordinates x p y p z p is given by the following equation 10 l f e p η 2 η 4 z p z g η 6 x p x g g η 4 where η i represent the acceleration of motion η i the above mentioned equation is an expression of side component of the apparent acceleration acting on a body on a ship expressed in its relative system of coordinates simplified for small amplitude motions in particular the first term represents the acceleration induced by the sway motion the second and third express the contributes due to roll and yaw angular accelerations multiplied by the respective arms while the last term is the lateral component of the gravity acceleration originated by the roll angle a more detailed description of the mathematical proof of equation 10 can be found in perez 2006 ship passengers comfort evaluation has been discussed by various authors which propose proper parameters depending mainly on vertical accelerations mean value and frequency the most used parameters are the motion sickness incidence msi proposed by o hanlon and mccauley 1973 and the vomiting incidence vi by lawther and griffin 1986 1988 in this study msi has been used to estimate crew comfort the msi at point p for a reference exposition time of 2 h is given by the following equation cepowski 2012 piscopo and scamardella 2015 in dependence of the spectral moments of the absolute vertical motion η 3 p 11 m s i 100 0 5 erf log 10 a v g μ m s i 0 4 where g is the gravitational acceleration erf x is the error function and a v and μ m s i are defined as follows 12 a v 0 798 m 4 η

k q respectively versus advance coefficient j respectively defined as follows 13 j v a n d 14 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 15 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 where ρ is the density of water t and q are the propeller open water thrust and torque v a is the propeller advance speed n is the propeller revolution speed and d is the propeller diameter the propeller revolutions are evaluated imposing the equilibrium between required vs delivered thrust by using the auxiliary variable k t j 2 is used the engine power is computed in accordance to the following equation 16 p b 2 π ρ h 2 o n 3 d 5 k q η r η s η g where η r η s η g are the relative rotative efficiency the shaft efficiency and the gearbox efficiency respectively considered as constant values the engine fuel mass flow rate m f is evaluated by using the engine performance map modelled using the engine mcr power and revolution by the performance map each working conditions are checked for not exceeding the engine limits fig 2 the feasibility or infeasibility of any combination of speed and weather conditions as well as the associated cost in terms of fuel consumption are thus a result of the propulsion simulation the procedure is summarized in algorithm 1 algorithm 1 fuel mass flow rate computation procedure image 1 the mass of fuel burned m f of each route segment is evaluated by numerical integration of the fuel mass flow rate with respect to time as shown in equation 17 17 m f x i t i x j t j t i t j m f t d t where is supposed to ship travel from point x i at time t i to point x j at time t j expression 17 allows to compute the cost function at each dp step the cost of the whole voyage is obtained by summation of all the contributes 4 route parametrization a parametric definition of the ship voyage is needed in order to perform the optimization the proposed parametrization is based on great circle geometry in order to easily identify the shortest solution in an optimal solution any deviation from the great circle is thus caused by rough weather the minimum angular distance θ a b measured in radiants between two points a and b satisfies the following relationship 18 cosθ a b sin φ a sin φ b c o s φ a cos φ b cos λ b λ a where φ a φ b λ a λ b denote latitude and longitude of the points the course α is defined as the angle between the ship heading and the true north direction it is measured clockwise and it changes continuously along a segment of great circle the following relationships provide the initial and final course angles respectively α i and α f of the great circle segment linking points a and b 19 cos α i sin φ b sin φ a cosθ a b cos φ a sinθ a b 20 cos α f sin φ b cosθ a b sin φ a cos φ b sinθ a b the geographical coordinates of a point x laying on the great circle segment linking a and b and the local course angle are given by the following equations 21 sin φ x sin φ a cos m a b x cos φ a sin θ a b x cos α i 22 cos λ x λ a cos θ a b x cos φ a cos φ x tan φ a tan φ x 23 cos α x sin φ x cos θ a b x sin φ a cos φ x sin θ a b x where x θ a x θ a b is an advance parameter the coordinates of points y are given as a function of the deviation parameter δ by the following expressions 24 φ y φ x δ sin α x 25 λ y λ x σ δ cos α x where σ 1 going eastward and σ 1 going westward fig 3 summarizes the above presented sets of equations in the proposed dynamic programming framework the ship route is modelled as a finite set of way points x 0 x 1 x n such that x i λ i φ i and a corresponding set of arrival times at the way points t 0 t 1 t n where t 0 0 and t n e t a each segment x i x i 1 is sailed at constant speed v i the described scheme allows to identify unequivocally the great circle i e minimum distance solution which is the most convenient in calm sea and obstacle free conditions 5 dynamic programming optimization dynamic programming is an optimization strategy that aims to solve a problem by using a multi stage approach in which the final result is the consequence of a number of separate decisions optimal solution is found on the basis of bellmans principle of optimality an optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with regard to the state resulting from the first decision bellman 1954 the structure of the method well adapts to any multi stage decision process and among all best path search type problems bellman 1958 bellman 1962 as they can be reduced as a sequence of decisions in dependance of which a return is obtained 5 1 formalization the proposed formulation of the ship voyage optimization problem is solved in a three dimensional domain start and arrival points and time instants are assigned a priori then a two dimensional domain is identified by discretizing parameters x and δ in equations 21 25 fig 4 a discretization of the time axis fig 5 is as well performed the route is modelled as finite set of n 1 way points through which the ship passes at assigned times the ship is supposed to travel at constant speed between each pair of waypoints the route r is thus given by the following sets 26 r x x 0 x 1 x n t t 0 t 1 t n where x i λ i φ i x 0 a x n b t 0 0 t n e t a equation 17 allows to compute the fuel m f x i t i x j t j consumed from point x i at time t i to point x j at time t j steaming at constant speed the objective of the problem is to minimize the total fuel consumption 27 m f i 0 n 1 m f x i t i x i 1 t i 1 the problem can be written in the form of the bellman s equation as follows let f i x t be the fuel consumed at stage i from the start following an optimal policy being the ship in position x at time t the target of the search is thus f n x n e t a i e the mass of fuel consumed at the end of the voyage identified by the arrival point x n and estimated time of arrival e t a following an optimal policy in accordance to bellman s principle of optimality the following functional relationship can be written 28 f i x t min ξ τ m f ξ τ x t f i 1 ξ τ where ξ and τ represent the possible positions and times of arrival at stage i 1 5 2 computational aspects dp is an exhaustive approach i e it guarantees to identify the optimal solution associated to the discretization of the problem nevertheless this advantage over heuristic global search algorithms is partially limited by the fact that input data is affected by significant uncertainties dp presents some drawbacks in terms of compuatation speed bellman ford implementation on a graph bellman 1958 runs in o v e where v and e are the number of graph and edges respectively in the present work the breadth first search structure of the bellman ford algorithm has been maintained however a significant speed up has been made by implementing problem specific modifications to the algorithm in the proposed solution scheme the cost of each route segment linking each couple of nodes all geographical positions and all time instants is evaluated in the forward phase the search domain is progressively explored following a breadth first approach nodes are sorted by priority to minimize the number of segments estimations a computationally cheap lower bound of the cost of each segment is first computed in order to early prune the less promising solutions the compliance of each node with the time of arrival window is checked as early as possible nodes visibility based on geographical constraints is checked by using an efficient nearest neighbour search algorithm based on kd tree structures friedman et al 1977 before evaluating the cost of each segment the cost associated to each segment is computed by numerical integration of the ship model output at the end of the calculation a number of nodes characterized by a time of arrival i e the eta and a cost associated fuel consumption are identified the final nodes identify global optima in terms of fuel consumption at fixed time or the fastest solutions at fixed fuel consumption the final set of nodes can thus be seen as the pareto frontier of a two objective optimization problem which aims to minimize both time of arrival and fuel consumption each node contains the information of the previous one so each solution is extracted by back tracking the optimization routine has been developed and implemented by the authors in c language significantly relying on c standard template library armadillo linear algebra library sanderson 2010 has been used for basic matrix manipulation 6 case study the above described optimization code has been tested on a bulk carrier to evaluate the effectiveness of the adopted optimization strategy the main data of the considered vessel are summarized in table 1 the still water resistance has been calculated in accordance with the method proposed by holtrop 1984 wind resistance coefficient c x has been computed according to the method proposed by blendermann 1994 finally open source strip theory seakeeping code pdstrip bertram et al 2006 has been used to evaluate the pseudo response amplitude operator φ a w and ship motions absolute raos the optimization is performed with reference to a voyage representing a north atlantic crossing 6 1 grid setup two optimization modes are compared a speed profile optimization in which no deviations from the great circle route are allowed referred as speed optimization so and a speed and course optimization referred as voyage optimization vo in which both speed and course adjustments are performed in order to achieve the optimum moreover a constant speed great circle solution is presented for comparison a 10 stages by 11 steps grid with 1 maximum deviation is considered the resulting waypoints are about 300 miles apart times of arrival are discretized every 60 min while integration time step is set to 30 min the computation is carried out considering a time of arrival window between 200 and 400 h from departure 6 2 constraints ship safety and comfort constraints are imposed as well in particular slamming and deck wetness probabilities are checked journée 1976 journée and meijers 1980 in accordance with the following inequalities 29 p η 3 r 0 9 l t η 3 r 0 9 l 0 093 g l 0 03 30 p η 3 r b f b 0 07 31 p η 3 b 0 4 g 0 07 being η 3 r 0 9 l and η 3 r b the relative vertical motion at 90 of the ship length and at bow respectively l t and f b the ship length draft and free board at the bow respectively in addition the following inequality constraints are imposed 32 l f e r m s l f e m a x 33 m s i m s i m a x where m s i m a x has been set to 10 l f e r m s is the root mean square of the lateral force estimator and l f e m a x has been selected in accordance with perez 2006 who proposes 0 1 g as an upper bound for general purposes 6 3 weather forecasts the forecasts used for the test case are based on the national weather service noaa wave watch iii model which provides forecast maps every 6 h the files are available in grib format they are 162 h deep they have a 1 25 1 grid resolution and a 6 h time resolution noaa mmab operational wave model the weather forecasts have been downloaded from http www globalmarinenet com in particular the case study optimization is carried out in a typical northern atlantic winter rough weather condition using the forecast maps of day 2016 01 21 12 00 a m an example screenshot of the storm occurring is shown in fig 6 6 4 results fig 7 shows the fuel consumption vs eta trade off curve each point of the curve is the minimum fuel consumption solution at the corresponding eta i e the curve can be seen as the pareto frontier of the minimum eta and minimum fuel consumption optimization problem vo and so solutions are compared and the results achievable by sailing at constant speed are reported for comparison note that the course and speed optimization curve vo has a significant lower consumption with respect to the other two however also speed optimization so provides good results especially for high etas note in addition that both the optimization strategies allow to reduce the negative effect of involuntary speed reduction on the eta allowing thus to achieve lower times of arrival by adjusting speed and course to the weather conditions i e catching up the lost time when the weather conditions are better moreover each of the suggested solutions is the most fuel saving strategy to perform the voyage in the assigned time finally note that fig 7 allows to easily estimate the cost of each hour of anticipation or delay in terms of tons of fuel consumed the trajectories associated to different etas 220 250 and 300 h are presented in figs 8 10 the corresponding speed profiles are presented in figs 11 13 it is worth noting that the optimization algorithm vo acts drastically on ship speed to search the optimum finding articulated speed profiles the route and or speed adjustments allow a global reduction of the fuel mass flow rate required by the propulsion system figs 14 16 resulting in a reduction of the total energy requirement and co2 emissions the fuel consumption profiles are presented in figs 17 19 the solutions presented until now are referred to a westward voyage this direction is associated to head or bow sea mainly if the opposite voyage in the same day of departure is considered the solutions change radically the fuel consumption to eta curves of the two voyages are compared in fig 20 the eastward voyage presents significantly lower fuel consumption as expected the following sea condition is predominant thus the added resistance is lower moreover lower etas are achievable as the weather conditions are less severe involuntary speed reduction is thus less significant in addition the eastward optimized solutions do not present significant fuel saving with respect to the constant speed solution if compared to the westward ones due to the fact that the course and speed changes have small effect on the hydrodynamic resistance in following seas fig 21 presents the trajectories in the two cases associated to an eta of 250 h note that the suggested routes are significantly different due to the different the conditions encountered note finally that sailing in following sea may lead to significant lateral motions the constraint on lateral forces allows to limit these effects however a check of parametric roll maki et al 2011 might be included in a future version 6 5 computational time the above presented computations have been carried out on a standard laptop which main data are summarized in table 2 the computation time is significantly influenced by the chosen discretization parameters and by the set up of the constraints the average computation times achieved are presented in table 3 the computation times required in case a unique eta with no delay is selected are also reported note that the computation in this case is significantly faster on the contrary the computation time increases as the eta window gets wider in general the more the problem is constrained the less nodes are processed resulting in a faster computation 7 conclusions a ship voyage optimization method has been developed and presented aiming to find the minimum fuel consumption voyage subject to safety and comfort constraints by using 3d dynamic programming optimization a steady state ship model has been described the model computes the seakeeping and propulsion performances of the ship in assigned wind and wave conditions a parametric route model based on great circle navigation has been introduced in order to give a dynamic programming formulation of the problem the solution is found by solving the bellman s equation which cost function i e the total mass of burned fuel is evaluated by means of a ship steady sate simulation model in order to take into account ship safety and crew comfort in the optimization slamming deck wetness and high bow acceleration probabilities as well as motion sickness incidence and lateral forces in the crew accommodations are checked not to exceed threshold values an algorithm has been developed and implemented by the authors in c language to solve the proposed task the presented approach has been applied to a case study voyage from france to new york along the atlantic ocean the results associated to a constant speed voyage a speed profile only optimization and a full speed and course optimization have been compared the presented results include the voyage time to fuel consumption trade off curves the optimal trajectories and speed profiles obtained for different voyage times moreover fuel mass flow rate and fuel consumption profiles associated to the considered solutions have been discussed the sensitivity of the optimization procedure to different weather conditions has been tested by optimizing the reverse voyage in the same days in light of the obtained results a notable fuel saving potential is observed in particular in the voyage optimization vo case in which the algorithm takes full advantage from the ship propulsion model features 
23553,a coupled modelling framework consisting of the fvcom circulation model and fvcom swave wave model was used to numerically estimate extreme waves and surges over the northwest pacific ocean the ecmwf era interim atmospheric reanalysis data with modification by a parametric typhoon model were used as surface forcing to simulate waves and surges for a 35 year period the extreme waves and surges with a 100 year return period were then estimated with the gumbel distribution the results showed that the extreme wave heights generally decreased northward and shoreward varying from 23 m in deepwater areas to less than 7 m in nearshore areas the extreme wave heights in the east and southeast directions were found to be larger than those in other directions and the extreme waves in summer

waves and surges 1 introduction the northwest pacific ocean region fig 1 is the path of a large number of typhoons every year the typhoons often come with strong winds and low sea surface pressures that generate extraordinarily large waves and surges and cause great damage to the affected areas on the other hand the rapid economic development and population growth have put this region under increasing pressure for a better protection from and reduced vulnerability to the extreme waves and high sea levels during typhoon events yin et al 2011 zhang and sheng 2015 to minimize and mitigate the damages caused by the extreme typhoons and to ensure a safe and effective design for ocean and coastal engineering projects it is desirable and essential to gain a better understanding of the temporal and spatial distributions of the extreme waves and surges in both offshore and nearshore areas in recent years there have been a number of studies focused on the spatial and temporal distribution features of mean and extreme waves in this region based on the analysis of field observational data or remote sensing data yao et al 1992 qi et al 1997 wang and yi 1997 liu and sun 2000 chen et al 2006a b there have also been studies on the spatial and temporal distribution of extreme sea levels based on the analysis of tide gauge observation data xu and huang 2011 li and li 2013 feng and tsimplis 2014 feng and jiang 2015 however because of the limited observation data the results from those studies are only applicable to local areas which may not be adequate for large domains such as the northwest pacific ocean region with significant advancement in computing techniques and power numerical modelling has become an effective way to study the long term wave climate over the northwest pacific ocean region third generation spectral wave models such as wam wamdig 1988 wavewatch iii tolman 1991 or swan booij et al 1999 are commonly used for wave modelling a series of wind data which usually comes from a global or regional reanalysis dataset is used to drive the wave model for long term wave hindcasting and analysis of the wave characteristics in an entire study region for example lv et al 2014 used the ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis wind data to drive the swan model to perform a 20 year wave hindcasting in the bohai sea then the annual and seasonal distributions of mean wave characteristics in the bohai sea were analysed liang et al 2014 used the wind data obtained from the weather research and forecasting wrf model to drive the swan model for a 22 year wave hindcasting in the bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea byecs the spatial distributions of mean and largest significant wave heights in four seasons in byecs were then specified zheng and li 2015 used the ccmp cross calibrated multi platform surface wind data to drive the wavewatch iii model for a 24 year wave hindcasting and the annual distributions of mean wave height and wave power density in the china sea were discussed in detail in addition to the analysis of mean wave characteristics numerical modelling has also been applied to estimate the extreme waves over a large domain lee and jun 2006 used the ecmwf reanalysis wind data to drive the wam model for a 25 year wave hindcasting and simulated the typhoon waves for 106 major typhoons that affected the waters around the korean peninsula individually the design wave heights for the return periods of 10 20 30 50 and 100 years for 16 directions were estimated by means of the extreme wave analysis method chen et al 2013 used the ncep ncar national centers for environmental prediction national centre for atmospheric research reanalysis wind data to drive the wam wave model for hind casting waves over 60 years in the east china seas and the results were used to estimate the extreme waves with 50 year and 100 year return periods li et al 2016a used both ncep and ecmwf wind data to drive the wam wave model and calculated the extreme waves in the same region waves with a 100 year return period generated by both wind datasets were compared with those measured at several observation stations along the china coasts although the ecmwf wind data were regarded relatively better in terms of resolution than other wind datasets e g ncep ncar the extreme waves were found in general underestimated in comparison with the measurements indicating the necessity for improvement of the original ecmwf wind data particularly during the period of typhoon events li et al 2016b applied the method proposed by pan et al 2016 of modifying the ecmwf reanalysis data and found that the modified wind field considerably improved the accuracy of simulated extreme waves in the china seas although a number of relevant studies have shown the feasibility of using wave models to reveal the temporal and spatial distributions of extreme waves over the entire region of the northwest pacific ocean further detailed research is still much needed to obtain a more accurate estimation apart from the extreme waves the determination of extreme surges is also important for the design of coastal and offshore structures considering its destructive power the relevant literature on modelling of storm surge has usually focussed on the temporal and spatial distribution of storm surge during a single storm event guo et al 2009 zhang et al 2007 beardsley et al 2013 yoon et al 2014 recently zhang and sheng 2015 used the ncep cfsr climate forecast system reanalysis wind data to drive the pom princeton ocean model for a period of 32 years and analysed the extreme sea levels from surges and tides in the northwest pacific ocean however studies using coupled wave current models for detailed analyses of spatial and temporal variations of extreme surges especially from long term simulations are still lacking given the strong nonlinear interaction between waves and currents during typhoon periods especially in the coastal area yoon and jun 2015 it is essential to consider the effects of wave current interaction in long term simulations to study the extreme waves and surges in this study a coupled modelling framework which consisted of the fvcom circulation model and fvcom swave was set up over the northwest pacific ocean region for hindcasting waves and surges for a period of 35 years from 1979 to 2013 the modelling system was driven by the surface forcing based on the newly released ecmwf era interim reanalysis data and the tide forcing at the open boundaries from tpxo 7 2 data egbert and erofeeva 2002 to take account for the effects on typhoons events occurred in the region the ecmwf data were also modified by a parametric typhoon model as proposed by pan et al 2016 the hindcasting results were then used to estimate the temporal and spatial distributions of extreme waves and surges over the entire northwest pacific ocean region the paper is organized as follows the description of the wave and surge model used for the hindcasting and the method used for extreme analysis of annual maxima is presented in section 2 the details of model setup and model validation are presented in sections 3 and 4 respectively the results of mean and extreme waves with a 100 year return period are presented and discussed in section 5 the results of extreme surges with a 100 year return period are presented in section 6 followed by a few conclusions in section 7 2 methodology 2 1 modelling framework the modelling framework used in this study was the coupled 3d circulation model fvcom and the wave model fvcom swave whilst the details of each model can be found elsewhere chen et al 2006a b qi et al 2009 both models and the principal governing equations used are briefly described here 2 1 1 fvcom model the fvcom model is a prognostic unstructured grid finite volume free surface three dimensional 3 d primitive equations community ocean model developed originally by chen et al 2003 by using an unstructured triangular mesh the model is capable of resolving complex geometry and bathymetry with boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations the governing equations momentum and continuity in σ coordinates are as follows 1 d u t d u 2 x d u v y u ω σ f v d gd η η a x g d 2 ρ 0 σ 0 ρ x σ d d x ρ σ d σ σ k m d u σ f u 2 d v t d u v x d v 2 y v ω σ f u d gd η η a y g d 2 ρ 0 σ 0 ρ y σ d d y ρ σ d σ σ k m d v σ f v 3 η t d u x d v y ω σ 0 where x y and σ are the east north and vertical directions in the cartesian coordinate system u v and ω are the velocity components in x y and z respectively f is the coriolis coefficient g is the gravitational acceleration k m is the vertical eddy viscosity coefficient ρ 0 is the reference density ρ is the perturbation density d h η is the total water depth where h is the reference depth below the mean sea level and η is the surface elevation η a is the sea level displacement induced by the atmospheric pressure perturbation s inverted barometer effect and f u and f v are the horizontal momentum diffusion terms the baroclinic dynamics is excluded in this study 2 1 2 fvcom swave model the fvcom swave model is an unstructured grid version of the surface wave model developed by qi et al 2009 who implemented the finite volume algorithms within the swan model booij et al 1999 this model provides an alternative option for unstructured grid wave models for the coastal ocean the fvcom swave model can also be coupled with any triangular mesh based unstructured grid ocean models for the study of current wave interactions the main governing equation is the spectral action balance equation 4 n t c g v n c σ n σ c θ n θ s t o t σ where n is the wave action density spectrum t is the time σ is the relative frequency θ is the wave direction c σ and c θ are the wave propagation velocities in spectral space σ θ c g is the group velocity and v is ambient water current vector s t o t is the source sink term defined as 5 s t o t s i n s n l 3 s n l 4 s d s w s d s b s d s b r where s i n is the function for wind induced wave growth s n l 3 is the nonlinear transfer of wave energy from three wave interactions s n l 4 is the nonlinear transfer of wave energy from four wave interactions s d s w is the wave decay from white capping s d s b is the wave decay from bottom friction and s d s b r is the wave decay from depth induced wave breaking 2 1 3 coupled fvcom and fvcom swave models as described in wu et al 2011 the coupled fvcom and fvcom swave models have been used to study nearshore and ocean hydrodynamic processes such as tides circulations storm surge and waves the coupling between the fvcom model and the fvcom swave model is achieved by incorporating 3d radiation stress wave current related bottom boundary layer and sea surface stress parameterizations after the initialization the wave model calculates significant wave height wave direction average wave length surface wave relative peak period wave bottom orbit velocity and bottom wave period the radiation stresses or surface stresses are passed to the circulation model after the completion of the wave computation the results of current and water surface elevation from the circulation model are fed back to the wave model for the wave current interaction to be considered for simulations at the next time step 2 2 long term wave statistics analysis method gumbel distribution in general the extreme waves and surges with a given return period can be estimated using a particular statistical method the gumbel distribution is one of the most commonly used methods to estimate the extreme values in the design of coastal engineering also known as the extreme value type i distribution hong et al 2013 the gumbel distribution is given by castillo 1988 as 6 f x exp exp α x u where f x denotes the cumulative distribution function x denotes the value of the random variable x and u and α are the location and scale parameters respectively relation y α x u represents the standardized or reduced extreme variety the mean of x μ x and its standard deviation σ x are given in equations 7 and 8 7 μ x u γ α 8 σ x π 6 α where γ 0 5772 is a euler constant for a given t year return period the value of x x t can be estimated by using the following equation 9 x t u 1 α ln ln 1 1 t 3 model setup 3 1 computational domain in this study the computational domain for the coupled model covers the northwest pacific ocean region which includes the bohai sea the yellow sea the east china sea the northern part of the south china sea and the southern part of the japan sea as shown in fig 1 the model used an unstructured mesh with a resolution of 1 at the open boundaries and finer than 0 1 in the coastal areas there were 12 077 nodes and 22 562 elements in this mesh the bathymetric data were obtained from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco 30 arc second global bathymetric dataset http www gebco net data and products gridded bathymetrydata with corrections at the nearshore areas using available ocean maps and then interpolated onto the model grid the model mesh and bathymetry are shown in fig 2 3 2 model forcing along the open boundaries of the computational domain tidal forcing was used to drive the model with tidal levels imposed on the north east and south open boundaries the tidal levels along the open boundaries were calculated with 13 tidal constituents m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 q1 mf mm m4 ms2 and mn4 from the global tidal model tpxo 7 2 all the constituents are corrected by the 18 6 year nodal cycle in this study by considering the contribution of nodal modulation to tidal amplitudes haigh et al 2011 for the surface forcing the model was driven by 6 hourly atmospheric pressure at the sea surface level and the wind velocity at 10 m above the sea surface based on the ecmwf era interim global atmospheric reanalysis data that modified by a parametric typhoon model as described below the resolution of the ecmwf data field is t255 triangular truncation at 255 n128 128 latitude circles pole to equator which corresponds to approximately 79 km on the reduced gaussian grid while the data used in this study was the version interpolated to 0 125 grid the data was regarded finer than many other reanalysis data sets available such as that from ncep kalnay et al 1996 li et al 2016a 3 3 parametric typhoon model the existing resolution of reanalysis wind data provided by ecmwf as suggested by earlier studies jourdain et al 2014 li et al 2016b is insufficient to represent the atmospheric forcing of typhoon events therefore a parametric typhoon model as introduced by jelesnianski 1965 was used to generate typhoon wind field and air pressure near the typhoon centre for a better representation of the typhoon s effects the parametric typhoon model was based on the measured typhoon tracks from the best track dataset provided by china meteorological administration tropical cyclone data centre http tcdata typhoon gov cn the concept and formulations used in the parametric typhoon model are described as follows 10 p r ρ a 3 v r γ 2 r r 3 p 0 0 r r ρ a v r γ 2 r r p r r 11 v r v r r r 3 2 v s r r r r 0 r r v r r r 1 2 v s r r r r r r where p r is the sea surface pressure v r is the wind speed at radius r with respect to the typhoon centre ρ a is the air density p 0 is the air pressure at the centre and p is the air pressure at great distance from the centre v r is the maximum wind speed at distance r from its centre and v s r is the moving velocity of the typhoon centre r is the radius at which the maximum wind speed occurs and is calculated according to the method suggested by knaff et al 2007 the value of γ can be calculated by 12 γ 2 v r ρ a 3 p p 0 as the typhoon centre in the reanalysis data might not always coincide with the one in the parametric typhoon model jourdain et al 2014 a shift of the reanalysis wind and pressure field was made before blending the typhoon model wind and pressure field into the original reanalysis data pan et al 2016 and then a smoothening technique was used to ensure that the wind field was generally continuous 13 v 1 e v e c m w f e v t y where v is the modified wind speed v e c m w f is the original reanalysis ecmwf wind speed v t y is the wind speed of the parametric typhoon wind field and e is the weight coefficient which can be calculated by 14 e r r 1 r 2 r 1 where r 1 and r 2 are the two boundary limits of the transition region of the blended data eq 13 is also applicable to sea surface air pressure 4 model validation the numerical model was first validated with the field measurements for tides and waves the locations of the measurements for tides and waves are shown in fig 1 because of the availability of the field data the model validations were carried out for tides and surge levels in 1995 and for waves between june and oct 2012 the majority of the water level measurements were taken along the coastal areas of china and wave data measurements were taken in the offshore area of the southern taiwan island three numerical experiments were considered case to is the tide only case and case wc1 and case wc2 are for the combined tide and wave conditions case wc1 was driven by original or un modified ecmwf reanalysis wind and surface atmospheric pressure denoted as ecmwf and the case wc2 was driven by the wind and surface atmospheric pressure integrated with the results of the parametric typhoon model for a better presentations of typhoon effects denoted as ecmwf t as listed in table 1 for tidal level validation the model was run in the tide only mode case to over the entire year of 1995 because of the availability of field data the amplitudes and phased of principle tidal constituents m2 and k1 are calculated from the case to results and compared with that from the tpxo dataset as shown in fig 3 it can be seen that the amplitudes and phases of the m2 and k1 tides produced by the fvcom model are in good agreement with those generated by the tpxo 7 2 database especially for the area near china coasts the simulated amplitudes and phases are also found to be comparable with the previous numerical or observational studies within the northwest pacific ocean of fang et al 2004 song et al 2013 and zhang and sheng 2015 to validate the model on tide levels the measurements taken from 16 tide gauge stations in the northwest pacific ocean region see fig 1 provided by the sea level centre at the university of hawaii uhslc http uhslc soest hawaii edu caldwell et al 2015 are used fig 4 shows the comparisons of tidal levels between simulations and observations at 16 gauge stations from the 5th to the 21st of january 1995 over a spring neap tide cycle it can be seen from fig 4 that the simulated tidal level generally agreed well with the observational data for both tidal range and tidal phase to further quantify the model performance in predicting tidal levels the correlation coefficients r and root mean square errors rmse between the computed and measured tidal levels defined below were calculated by the following equations 15 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 16 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 the correlation coefficient r indicates the fit level between the observed and simulated quantities and rmse measures their deviations fig 5 shows the correlation coefficients and rmses of the validation results at 16 stations it is clear that all correlation coefficients were over 0 8 and the rmses were no more than 0 3 m except at lvsi because of a very complicated bathymetry near the radial sandy ridge area in the southern yellow sea xu et al 2016 in general as seen from the results shown in both figs 4 and 5 the simulated tidal levels agreed well with the observational data which indicates that the modelling system performed well in simulating the tidal levels in the study area 4 1 wave validation with the combined tide and wave conditions the computed significant wave heights generated by the un modified ecmwf reanalysis wind data case wc1 and the modified ecmwf t wind data case wc2 were compared with the measurements from three wave buoys taitung ocean station with depth of approximately 5 600 m taitung station and pratas station with depth of approximately 2 600 m in the southern coastal water of taiwan see fig 1 fig 6 a shows the comparison of measured and the simulated wave heights between june and october 2012 it can be seen from fig 6 a that the waves generated by both wind fields generally agreed with the observational data however in the simulation of large waves during the typhoon periods for example those in 27 september 2012 as shown in fig 6 b and c the waves generated in case wc2 agreed better fig 7 shows the values of correlation coefficients and rmses between simulated and observed data the rmses at all the three stations were less than 1 m whereas the extreme wave heights at these stations were greater than 5 m and up to 10 m in some cases which can be regarded as satisfactory the values of correlation coefficients for waves generated by ecmwf t showed better correlations at taitung station compared with the results for the un modified ecmwf data however at pratas station the correlation was slightly less satisfactory wave heights at this station were the lowest among all stations because the typhoon centres were far from the station in this case the modification of typhoon winds might be less effective nonetheless the mean wave heights were reasonably predicted compared with the field measurements in general the results demonstrated the improvement of the wave predictions gained from the modified ecmwf data ecmwf t 4 2 surge validation for storm surge the model was run with conditions for the entire year of 1995 the simulated storm surge was calculated by subtracting the water levels from the tide only model case to from those from the model driven by wind and sea level pressure using ecmwf and ecmwf t data case wc1 and case wc2 the tidal and non tidal components of the observation sea levels were extracted using a harmonic analysis package known as t tide pawlowicz et al 2002 fig 8 shows the comparison of the simulated surge levels from both ecmwf and ecmwf t data with the observations at four selected tide gauge stations beihai shanwei xiamen and shijiusuo from the south to the north coast as shown in fig 1 it can be seen from fig 8 that the simulated surges from both wind data sets fit the observational data well for further comparison the quantile quantile q q plots for the simulated and observed surge levels at the four observation stations are given in fig 9 it can be seen that the extremely large surges simulated by ecmwf t generally agreed better with the observational data than those generated by ecmwf especially at beihai and shanwei because of the better performance of ecmwf t data in the simulation of large storm surges during the typhoon periods whereas the surges were underestimated when using the original ecmwf data however the improvement of ecmwf t at shijiusuo station appears to have been minimal the maximum surge levels were under predicted using both ecmwf and ecmwf t at almost an identical level because the extreme surges generated by the cold storms in winter seasons were more significant than those by typhoons at this station however it should be noted that the overall surge levels here were much lower than at other stations 4 3 wave current effects during typhoon periods according to yoon and jun 2015 the nonlinear interaction between waves and currents are strong during typhoon periods especially in the coastal area in order to understand the effects of wave current interaction on wave and surge simulations under the extreme conditions typhoon saola the ninth named storm in 2012 was chosen as an example to illustrate the effect of the wave current interaction using the coupled and uncoupled models at 4 examining locations in present study fig 10 shows the track of saola and four examining locations nearshore which are close to the typhoon centre the water depths for locations a b c and d are 7 9 m 21 4 m 115 9 m and 1 527 4 m respectively the effects of the wave current interaction were examined by running both coupled and uncoupled models i e case wc and case wo and comparing the simulated wave height at four locations as shown in fig 11 during typhoon saola it can be seen that at the shallow water location location a and b the wave heights calculated by coupled model fluctuate with the change of tidal level i e modulated by tides and the peak is about 0 3 m larger than the uncoupled model at location a it is demonstrated the necessity of using the coupled model to estimate the extreme waves in the coastal area with the increasing of the water depth location c and d the wave current effect during the typhoon period is negligible the surge processes simulated by coupled and uncoupled model i e case wc and case tow at these four locations are also compared during typhoon saola as showed in fig 12 it can be seen that the effects of wave current interaction on the surge are noticeable at near shore area location a and b when the typhoon centre approaches the nearshore area while the effects becomes insignificant at deep water area location c and d from figs 11 and 12 it can be seen that the wave current interaction have noticeable effects on the wave and surge simulations particularly in the nearshore area during the typhoon affected period therefore using the coupled modelling framework becomes necessary when estimating the extreme conditions of waves and surges 5 long term wave analysis following the model validations the model was run for long term simulations of waves and surges from 1979 to 2013 fig 13 shows the typhoon tracks over 35 years in the northwest pacific ocean in total 862 typhoons occurred in this region during this period to improve the simulation accuracy the original ecmwf reanalysis data were modified by the parametric typhoon model jelesnianski 1965 using the 35 year best track data both the original ecmwf reanalysis data and the modified ecmwf data with the parametric typhoon model ecmwf t were used to drive the model for comparisons case wc1 case wc2 to minimize the boundary effects the model results from a sub domain 105 e 140 e and 15 n 41 n were extracted for analysis over which the spatial and temporal distributions of mean and extreme wave heights and surge levels with 50 year and 100 year return periods were calculated since the distributions and patterns for both return periods were similar only the extreme waves and surges with 100 year return period results are presented in this paper 5 1 mean wave heights the mean wave heights were calculated by averaging the computed wave heights over the 35 year simulation period fig 14 shows the 35 year mean wave heights generated by both ecmwf and ecmwf t wind data in the study area the results clearly show that the mean wave height generally decreased northwards and landwards fig 14 shows that the mean significant wave height was between 1 3 m and 1 7 m in the north of the south china sea 1 2 m 1 5 m in the east china sea 0 9 m 1 3 m in the yellow sea and less than 1 m in the bohai sea the largest mean wave heights were found southeast of taiwan island by comparing the wave fields generated by the ecmwf and ecmwf t winds it can be seen that the distributions of mean wave heights from both winds were generally similar however noticeable differences were seen southeast of taiwan island with larger waves generated by the ecmwf t winds this is expected and believed to be reasonable because this is the area with a large occurrence of typhoons over the 35 year period as shown in fig 13 the results show evidence of the improvement of wind data when the parametric typhoon model was used 5 2 extreme wave heights the annual maximum significant wave heights were extracted from the long term computed wave heights the annual maxima were analysed by using the gumbel distribution method described in section 2 2 to calculate the wave heights with a 100 year return period the extreme wave heights were first estimated by considering the waves in all directions and the extreme wave heights in 6 main directional sections were then estimated the directional distributions were particularly important for determining the design waves at different coastal locations the extreme waves were also calculated in different seasons to explore their seasonal variation 5 2 1 distribution of overall extreme waves the annual maximum wave heights at each grid point were calculated and the distribution of overall extreme wave heights were then calculated for the entire computational region fig 15 shows the spatial distributions of extreme wave heights generated by ecmwf and ecmwf t data it can be seen that the extreme waves decreased from south to north and from sea to coast the contours appear to be parallel to the coast when approaching it the extreme waves in the bohai sea and the yellow sea generated with both ecmwf and ecmwf t winds were almost the same because typhoon events might not occur so often in these areas see fig 13 it can be seen from fig 15 that the 100 year return period wave heights in the bohai sea were less than 7 m whereas those in the yellow sea were between 7 m and 11 m however in the east china sea and the northern part of the south china sea the extreme wave heights calculated by the ecmwf t winds were much larger than those from the ecmwf winds especially in the southeast part of taiwan island this is the area through which many typhoons passed during 1979 2013 as shown in fig 13 because the parametric typhoon model improved the accuracy of wind fields during the typhoon events over the un modified ecmwf winds it is reasonable that the extreme waves generated by ecmwf t wind data were more accurate than those generated by ecmwf wind data 5 2 2 directional distribution of extreme waves because the directional distribution of extreme waves is of great importance for engineering designs especially for infrastructure in coastal areas extreme waves in six landward directional sectors e n ne s se and sw were chosen for the study coming direction for waves because the waves generated by ecmwf t data were more accurate than those generated by ecmwf data only the extreme waves from ecmwf t data are presented and discussed here fig 16 shows the spatial distributions of extreme waves in the six directions extreme waves in e and se directions generally had the largest values followed by those in s direction northerly extreme waves were the smallest the large waves higher than 20 m mainly occurred in the open deep water areas particularly the area east and south east of taiwan island similar to those shown in fig 15 b for the extreme waves in e direction the results showed that larger waves could penetrate much closer to the shore such as the areas in the eastern coast of china adjacent to taiwan island the extreme waves in se direction exhibited a similar trend because the large typhoon induced waves in this study area were mostly from the east or south east directions along which a large fetch was available for waves to develop and propagate shoreward in the region 5 2 3 distribution of seasonal extreme waves in the northwest pacific ocean typhoons generally occur in the summer and autumn seasons and cold storm waves occur in the winter and spring seasons therefore typhoon waves may feature strong seasonality which was also examined in this study fig 17 shows the 100 year return period wave heights generated by ecmwf t winds in spring march april and may summer june july and august autumn september october and november and winter january february and december seasons it can be clearly seen that the extreme wave heights were the smallest in the spring season whereas larger extreme waves occurred in the summer and autumn seasons resulting from the frequent occurrence of the typhoon events the largest extreme waves occurred in the east and south east of taiwan island which is under the path of the majority of the typhoons shown in fig 13 it should be noted that the extreme waves in winter were relatively larger than those in summer in the northern area such as in the bohai sea and part of the yellow sea which indicates the existence and impacts of cold winter storms in winter in the north part of the china coasts 5 2 4 extreme waves at nearshore stations extreme waves were gradually reduced shoreward as shown in fig 15 and became low in the nearshore areas however they remain important for the design of coastal engineering projects especially at locations of important coastal infrastructure to examine the accuracy of the estimated extreme waves in the coastal area the hind casted extreme wave heights with a 100 year return period were compared with the field measurements taken at several nearshore wave observation stations along the coast of china the availability of the field data at these stations is summarized in table 2 and the locations are marked in fig 1 fig 18 shows the comparisons of the computed extreme wave heights with the measurements in 6 main directional sectors along the coasts of china the observational data denoted as obs in fig 18 were calculated from the long term measurements at those stations as listed in table 2 note that the measurement data in some directions were unavailable and are missing in fig 18 the results show the general pattern of the extreme wave distributions along the coast of china clearly showing that the extreme wave heights were relatively small in the northern region and large in the southern region in all directions for the locations in the south the extreme waves were the largest in e direction followed by ne and se directions because those areas were exposed to the open seas toward the east so that waves from those directions could directly propagate to the shore over a large fetch without being sheltered in n direction the nearshore extreme waves at the mid eastern coast of china were large and decreased southwards whereas the nearshore extreme waves in s direction exhibited an opposite trend the variations can be attributed to the orientation of the shorelines and impacts on wave propagation it is also interesting that large extreme waves existed in sw direction although the extreme waves in this direction may often be ignored in engineering designs the smaller nearshore extreme waves in the northern coasts from laohutan to lianyungang the coastal areas of bohai sea and yellow sea are believed to be because of the fewer occurrences of typhoons and shallower water depths in those areas fig 18 shows that the simulated extreme wave heights agreed well with the observational data at the nearshore locations the extreme wave heights computed by the ecmwf data were underestimated in most of the observation stations whereas the extreme wave heights computed by the ecmwf t data again clearly indicated an improvement in yielding the extreme values in the nearshore area despite the discrepancies between the measurements and the model results at some stations for example the extreme waves from the model were obviously underestimated in dachen from n to e directions and overestimated in nanji in sw and se directions because the resolution of the computational mesh was insufficiently fine to represent the rapid variation of the bathymetry in the nearshore areas further refinement will be required in future study 6 extreme surges to examine the extreme surge the water levels computed in the tide only case case to were subtracted from those computed in the cases with the combined tide and wave conditions case wc1 case wc2 the water level differences surge levels calculated were then analysed and the annual maxima over the 35 year period were used to estimate the extreme surge levels for a 100 year return period at each grid point in the model domain 6 1 distribution of extreme surges fig 19 shows the distributions of 100 year return period surges driven by ecmwf and ecmwf t data over the study region comparing the surges generated by the un modified ecmwf and ecmwf t data their distribution patterns are largely similar the surge levels generated by the ecmwf t data were slightly larger as expected the extreme surges increased towards the coastal waters when water depth decreased larger 100 year return period extreme surges were found along the coastline of china from the south of shandong peninsula to the hainan island fig 1 up to 2 m in general but as large as over 4 m in some areas the extreme surge levels appear to be closely related to the local bathymetry the surge level was larger when the water depth was smaller and the extreme surge contours often coincided with the water depth contours the simulation results suggest that the coastal area in the radial sandy ridge area off the jiangsu coast hangzhou bay and the north of the qiongzhou strait tend to have the relatively large extreme surges two particular areas were chosen to illustrate the impacts the area adjacent to the hangzhou bay and the area adjacent to the qiongzhou strait as indicated in fig 19 a fig 20 shows the extreme surges in those two areas generated by both ecmwf and ecmwf t data the shape of the coastline and the change of the water depth affected the surge level for example in hangzhou bay shown in fig 20 a and b the funnel shape of the coastline resulted in the concentration of tidal energy and extremely large surges inside the bay additionally surges were higher in the area where typhoons frequently occurred such as in the north of qiongzhou strait see fig 20 c and d the differences in surges in the area adjacent to hangzhou bay were insignificant whereas there were noticeable differences for surges in the area adjacent to the qiongzhou strait the tide surge interactions could also make a great contribution to extreme surges in these areas feng and tsimplis 2014 zhang and sheng 2015 although this is outside the scope of this paper 6 2 extreme surges at nearshore stations to compare the model results with the field measurements in the nearshore areas specifically the sea level observations at 10 tide gauges as listed in the uhslc database caldwell et al 2015 were used the database contains the measurements for more than 25 years the gumbel distribution was applied to the measured surge levels to estimate the extreme values with a 100 year return period the non tidal components were extracted from the measured sea levels at these locations using the t tide package introduced in section 4 3 the comparison of 100 year return period surges between measured data and simulated data driven by ecmwf and ecmwf t are shown in fig 21 in general the computed surge levels at all stations were close to those from measurements and those generated by the ecmwf t winds were in better agreement except lvsi station which may be due to the complicated currents there among all 10 stations the lvsi zhapo and haikou stations appeared to have the largest values of extreme surge over 2 m these three stations are located in the large extreme surge domain discovered in the mapped extreme surge field in section 6 1 in general the surges along the coast of china were slightly underestimated which may have been caused by the rapidly changing water depth and the coarse grid in the nearshore area along the coast of china moreover to some extent the wind discrepancies may have also affected the simulated results however the extreme surges simulated by the ecmwf t data were generally better than those simulated by the original ecmwf data which further confirms the superiority of modified ecmwf data in the simulation of extreme events in the coastal region of china 7 conclusions this study used the coupled hydrodynamic model fvcom and the wave model fvcom swave to simulate long term waves and surges for the 35 years from 1979 to 2013 and to estimate the 100 year return period extreme waves and surges in the northwest pacific ocean region the model was forced by tidal conditions provided by the tpxo 7 2 database and atmospheric conditions provided by both the original ecmwf reanalysis data ecmwf and the modified ecmwf data ecmwf t with a parametric typhoon model to improve the representation of typhoon events the model was validated with field measurements of waves and surges the results demonstrated that the waves and surges generated by ecmwf t were in better agreement with the measurements and the adequate implementation of the parametric wave model the 35 year mean wave heights in the region showed that waves were high in the south and gradually deceased northwards the largest mean wave heights were located in the area east of taiwan island the extreme waves and surges with a 100 year return period in the region were estimated from the computed wave heights and surge levels over the 35 year period using the gumbel distribution the results of the spatial distribution showed that the extreme waves in the study area generally decreased northward and shoreward similar to the mean wave height distributions the maximum extreme wave heights were also found southeast of taiwan island with values up to 23 m the distributions of directional and seasonal extreme waves were also examined the extreme waves in e se and ne directions and in summer and autumn seasons appeared to have larger values in most of the deep open water areas the extreme waves in the sw direction were also found to have large values which indicated a significant wave propagation parallel to the shoreline in the southern coast of china the extreme surge levels were found to be significant in the nearshore areas particularly at the coasts in the jiangsu radial sandy ridge area hangzhou bay and north of the qiongzhou strait the extreme surges appeared to coincide with the water depth contours which indicates the effects of local bathymetry on surges the results of the 100 year return period wave heights and surges were compared with those calculated from the long term observational data at a number of locations along the coast of china the comparisons showed that the waves and surges generated by the modified ecmwf data ecmwf t by the parametric typhoon model agreed better with the measurements and were more accurate than those generated by the original ecmwf reanalysis data this study provided detailed insights into the distribution of extreme waves and surges in the northwest pacific ocean especially the coast of china it has also provided a simple yet effective method to modify the surface forcing the ecmwf reanalysis data in this case when simulating waves and water levels with typhoon events the details of the extreme waves and surges obtained from this study can be easily used for engineering designs at the given locations of interest by longitude and latitude the simulation results in the coastal area may be further improved with the refinement of the unstructured mesh of the area of interest

23553,a coupled modelling framework consisting of the fvcom circulation model and fvcom swave wave model was used to numerically estimate extreme waves and surges over the northwest pacific ocean the ecmwf era interim atmospheric reanalysis data with modification by a parametric typhoon model were used as surface forcing to simulate waves and surges for a 35 year period the extreme waves and surges with a 100 year return period were then estimated with the gumbel distribution the results showed that the extreme wave heights generally decreased northward and shoreward varying from 23 m in deepwater areas to less than 7 m in nearshore areas the extreme wave heights in the east and southeast directions were found to be larger than those in other directions and the extreme waves in summer and autumn were found to be larger than those in other seasons the extreme surge levels were relatively large in the radial sandy ridge area of the jiangsu coast hangzhou bay and north of the qiongzhou strait this study demonstrated an effective approach to improve the representation of typhoon in the numerical estimation of extreme events the results provide insights into the temporal and spatial distributions of extreme waves and surges over the northwest pacific ocean keywords fvcom circulation model fvcom swave wave model ecmwf reanalysis wind data parametric typhoon model extreme waves and surges 1 introduction the northwest pacific ocean region fig 1 is the path of a large number of typhoons every year the typhoons often come with strong winds and low sea surface pressures that generate extraordinarily large waves and surges and cause great damage to the affected areas on the other hand the rapid economic development and population growth have put this region under increasing pressure for a better protection from and reduced vulnerability to the extreme waves and high sea levels during typhoon events yin et al 2011 zhang and sheng 2015 to minimize and mitigate the damages caused by the extreme typhoons and to ensure a safe and effective design for ocean and coastal engineering projects it is desirable and essential to gain a better understanding of the temporal and spatial distributions of the extreme waves and surges in both offshore and nearshore areas in recent years there have been a number of studies focused on the spatial and temporal distribution features of mean and extreme waves in this region based on the analysis of field observational data or remote sensing data yao et al 1992 qi et al 1997 wang and yi 1997 liu and sun 2000 chen et al 2006a b there have also been studies on the spatial and temporal distribution of extreme sea levels based on the analysis of tide gauge observation data xu and huang 2011 li and li 2013 feng and tsimplis 2014 feng and jiang 2015 however because of the limited observation data the results from those studies are only applicable to local areas which may not be adequate for large domains such as the northwest pacific ocean region with significant advancement in computing techniques and power numerical modelling has become an effective way to study the long term wave climate over the northwest pacific ocean region third generation spectral wave models such as wam wamdig 1988 wavewatch iii tolman 1991 or swan booij et al 1999 are commonly used for wave modelling a series of wind data which usually comes from a global or regional reanalysis dataset is used to drive the wave model for long term wave hindcasting and analysis of the wave characteristics in an entire study region for example lv et al 2014 used the ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis wind data to drive the swan model to perform a 20 year wave hindcasting in the bohai sea then the annual and seasonal distributions of mean wave characteristics in the bohai sea were analysed liang et al 2014 used the wind data obtained from the weather research and forecasting wrf model to drive the swan model for a 22 year wave hindcasting in the bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea byecs the spatial distributions of mean and largest significant wave heights in four seasons in byecs were then specified zheng and li 2015 used the ccmp cross calibrated multi platform surface wind data to drive the wavewatch iii model for a 24 year wave hindcasting and the annual distributions of mean wave height and wave power density in the china sea were discussed in detail in addition to the analysis of mean wave characteristics numerical modelling has also been applied to estimate the extreme waves over a large domain lee and jun 2006 used the ecmwf reanalysis wind data to drive the wam model for a 25 year wave hindcasting and simulated the typhoon waves for 106 major typhoons that affected the waters around the korean peninsula individually the design wave heights for the return periods of 10 20 30 50 and 100 years for 16 directions were estimated by means of the extreme wave analysis method chen et al 2013 used the ncep ncar national centers for environmental prediction national centre for atmospheric research reanalysis wind data to drive the wam wave model for hind casting waves over 60 years in the east china seas and the results were used to estimate the extreme waves with 50 year and 100 year return periods li et al 2016a used both ncep and ecmwf wind data to drive the wam wave model and calculated the extreme waves in the same region waves with a 100 year return period generated by both wind datasets were compared with those measured at several observation stations along the china coasts although the ecmwf wind data were regarded relatively better in terms of resolution than other wind datasets e g ncep ncar the extreme waves were found in general underestimated in comparison with the measurements indicating the necessity for improvement of the original ecmwf wind data particularly during the period of typhoon events li et al 2016b applied the method proposed by pan et al 2016 of modifying the ecmwf reanalysis data and found that the modified wind field considerably improved the accuracy of simulated extreme waves in the china seas although a number of relevant studies have shown the feasibility of using wave models to reveal the temporal and spatial distributions of extreme waves over the entire region of the northwest pacific ocean further detailed research is still much needed to obtain a more accurate estimation apart from the extreme waves the determination of extreme surges is also important for the design of coastal and offshore structures considering its destructive power the relevant literature on modelling of storm surge has usually focussed on the temporal and spatial distribution of storm surge during a single storm event guo et al 2009 zhang et al 2007 beardsley et al 2013 yoon et al 2014 recently zhang and sheng 2015 used the ncep cfsr climate forecast system reanalysis wind data to drive the pom princeton ocean model for a period of 32 years and analysed the extreme sea levels from surges and tides in the northwest pacific ocean however studies using coupled wave current models for detailed analyses of spatial and temporal variations of extreme surges especially from long term simulations are still lacking given the strong nonlinear interaction between waves and currents during typhoon periods especially in the coastal area yoon and jun 2015 it is essential to consider the effects of wave current interaction in long term simulations to study the extreme waves and surges in this study a coupled modelling framework which consisted of the fvcom circulation model and fvcom swave was set up over the northwest pacific ocean region for hindcasting waves and surges for a period of 35 years from 1979 to 2013 the modelling system was driven by the surface forcing based on the newly released ecmwf era interim reanalysis data and the tide forcing at the open boundaries from tpxo 7 2 data egbert and erofeeva 2002 to take account for the effects on typhoons events occurred in the region the ecmwf data were also modified by a parametric typhoon model as proposed by pan et al 2016 the hindcasting results were then used to estimate the temporal and spatial distributions of extreme waves and surges over the entire northwest pacific ocean region the paper is organized as follows the description of the wave and surge model used for the hindcasting and the method used for extreme analysis of annual maxima is presented in section 2 the details of model setup and model validation are presented in sections 3 and 4 respectively the results of mean and extreme waves with a 100 year return period are presented and discussed in section 5 the results of extreme surges with a 100 year return period are presented in section 6 followed by a few conclusions in section 7 2 methodology 2 1 modelling framework the modelling framework used in this study was the coupled 3d circulation model fvcom and the wave model fvcom swave whilst the details of each model can be found elsewhere chen et al 2006a b qi et al 2009 both models and the principal governing equations used are briefly described here 2 1 1 fvcom model the fvcom model is a prognostic unstructured grid finite volume free surface three dimensional 3 d primitive equations community ocean model developed originally by chen et al 2003 by using an unstructured triangular mesh the model is capable of resolving complex geometry and bathymetry with boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations the governing equations momentum and continuity in σ coordinates are as follows 1 d u t d u 2 x d u v y u ω σ f v d gd η η a x g d 2 ρ 0 σ 0 ρ x σ d d x ρ σ d σ σ k m d u σ f u 2 d v t d u v x d v 2 y v ω σ f u d gd η η a y g d 2 ρ 0 σ 0 ρ y σ d d y ρ σ d σ σ k m d v σ f v 3 η t d u x d v y ω σ 0 where x y and σ are the east north and vertical directions in the cartesian coordinate system u v and ω are the velocity components in x y and z respectively f is the coriolis coefficient g is the gravitational acceleration k m is the vertical eddy viscosity coefficient ρ 0 is the reference density ρ is the perturbation density d h η is the total water depth where h is the reference depth below the mean sea level and η is the surface elevation η a is the sea level displacement induced by the atmospheric pressure perturbation s inverted barometer effect and f u and f v are the horizontal momentum diffusion terms the baroclinic dynamics is excluded in this study 2 1 2 fvcom swave model the fvcom swave model is an unstructured grid version of the surface wave model developed by qi et al 2009 who implemented the finite volume algorithms within the swan model booij et al 1999 this model provides an alternative option for unstructured grid wave models for the coastal ocean the fvcom swave model can also be coupled with any triangular mesh based unstructured grid ocean models for the study of current wave interactions the main governing equation is the spectral action balance equation 4 n t c g v n c σ n σ c θ n θ s t o t σ where n is the wave action density spectrum t is the time σ is the relative frequency θ is the wave direction c σ and c θ are the wave propagation velocities in spectral space σ θ c g is the group velocity and v is ambient water current vector s t o t is the source sink term defined as 5 s t o t s i n s n l 3 s n l 4 s d s w s d s b s d s b r where s i n is the function for wind induced wave growth s n l 3 is the nonlinear transfer of wave energy from three wave interactions s n l 4 is the nonlinear transfer of wave energy from four wave interactions s d s w is the wave decay from white capping s d s b is the wave decay from bottom friction and s d s b r is the wave decay from depth induced wave breaking 2 1 3 coupled fvcom and fvcom swave models as described in wu et al 2011 the coupled fvcom and fvcom swave models have been used to study nearshore and ocean hydrodynamic processes such as tides circulations storm surge and waves the coupling between the fvcom model and the fvcom swave model is achieved by incorporating 3d radiation stress wave current related bottom boundary layer and sea surface stress parameterizations after the initialization the wave model calculates significant wave height wave direction average wave length surface wave relative peak period wave bottom orbit velocity and bottom wave period the radiation stresses or surface stresses are passed to the circulation model after the completion of the wave computation the results of current and water surface elevation from the circulation model are fed back to the wave model for the wave current interaction to be considered for simulations at the next time step 2 2 long term wave statistics analysis method gumbel distribution in general the extreme waves and surges with a given return period can be estimated using a particular statistical method the gumbel distribution is one of the most commonly used methods to estimate the extreme values in the design of coastal engineering also known as the extreme value type i distribution hong et al 2013 the gumbel distribution is given by castillo 1988 as 6 f x exp exp α x u where f x denotes the cumulative distribution function x denotes the value of the random variable x and u and α are the location and scale parameters respectively relation y α x u represents the standardized or reduced extreme variety the mean of x μ x and its standard deviation σ x are given in equations 7 and 8 7 μ x u γ α 8 σ x π 6 α where γ 0 5772 is a euler constant for a given t year return period the value of x x t can be estimated by using the following equation 9 x t u 1 α ln ln 1 1 t 3 model setup 3 1 computational domain in this study the computational domain for the coupled model covers the northwest pacific ocean region which includes the bohai sea the yellow sea the east china sea the northern part of the south china sea and the southern part of the japan sea as shown in fig 1 the model used an unstructured mesh with a resolution of 1 at the open boundaries and finer than 0 1 in the coastal areas there were 12 077 nodes and 22 562 elements in this mesh the bathymetric data were obtained from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco 30 arc second global bathymetric dataset http www gebco net data and products gridded bathymetrydata with corrections at the nearshore areas using available ocean maps and then interpolated onto the model grid the model mesh and bathymetry are shown in fig 2 3 2 model forcing along the open boundaries of the computational domain tidal forcing was used to drive the model with tidal levels imposed on the north east and south open boundaries the tidal levels along the open boundaries were calculated with 13 tidal constituents m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 q1 mf mm m4 ms2 and mn4 from the global tidal model tpxo 7 2 all the constituents are corrected by the 18 6 year nodal cycle in this study by considering the contribution of nodal modulation to tidal amplitudes haigh et al 2011 for the surface forcing the model was driven by 6 hourly atmospheric pressure at the sea surface level and the wind velocity at 10 m above the sea surface based on the ecmwf era interim global atmospheric reanalysis data that modified by a parametric typhoon model as described below the resolution of the ecmwf data field is t255 triangular truncation at 255 n128 128 latitude circles pole to equator which corresponds to approximately 79 km on the reduced gaussian grid while the data used in this study was the version interpolated to 0 125 grid the data was regarded finer than many other reanalysis data sets available such as that from ncep kalnay et al 1996 li et al 2016a 3 3 parametric typhoon model the existing resolution of reanalysis wind data provided by ecmwf as suggested by earlier studies jourdain et al 2014 li et al 2016b is insufficient to represent the atmospheric forcing of typhoon events therefore a parametric typhoon model as introduced by jelesnianski 1965 was used to generate typhoon wind field and air pressure near the typhoon centre for a better representation of the typhoon s effects the parametric typhoon model was based on the measured typhoon tracks from the best track dataset provided by china meteorological administration tropical cyclone data centre http tcdata typhoon gov cn the concept and formulations used in the parametric typhoon model are described as follows 10 p r ρ a 3 v r γ 2 r r 3 p 0 0 r r ρ a v r γ 2 r r p r r 11 v r v r r r 3 2 v s r r r r 0 r r v r r r 1 2 v s r r r r r r where p r is the sea surface pressure v r is the wind speed at radius r with respect to the typhoon centre ρ a is the air density p 0 is the air pressure at the centre and p is the air pressure at great distance from the centre v r is the maximum wind speed at distance r from its centre and v s r is the moving velocity of the typhoon centre r is the radius at which the maximum wind speed occurs and is calculated according to the method suggested by knaff et al 2007 the value of γ can be calculated by 12 γ 2 v r ρ a 3 p p 0 as the typhoon centre in the reanalysis data might not always coincide with the one in the parametric typhoon model jourdain et al 2014 a shift of the reanalysis wind and pressure field was made before blending the typhoon model wind and pressure field into the original reanalysis data pan et al 2016 and then a smoothening technique was used to ensure that the wind field was generally continuous 13 v 1 e v e c m w f e v t y where v is the modified wind speed v e c m w f is the original reanalysis ecmwf wind speed v t y is the wind speed of the parametric typhoon wind field and e is the weight coefficient which can be calculated by 14 e r r 1 r 2 r 1 where r 1 and r 2 are the two boundary limits of the transition region of the blended data eq 13 is also applicable to sea surface air pressure 4 model validation the numerical model was first validated with the field measurements for tides and waves the locations of the measurements for tides and waves are shown in fig 1 because of the availability of the field data the model validations were carried out for tides and surge levels in 1995 and for waves between june and oct 2012 the majority of the water level measurements were taken along the coastal areas of china and wave data measurements were taken in the offshore area of the southern taiwan island three numerical experiments were considered case to is the tide only case and case wc1 and case wc2 are for the combined tide and wave conditions case wc1 was driven by original or un modified ecmwf reanalysis wind and surface atmospheric pressure denoted as ecmwf and the case wc2 was driven by the wind and surface atmospheric pressure integrated with the results of the parametric typhoon model for a better presentations of typhoon effects denoted as ecmwf t as listed in table 1 for tidal level validation the model was run in the tide only mode case to over the entire year of 1995 because of the availability of field data the amplitudes and phased of principle tidal constituents m2 and k1 are calculated from the case to results and compared with that from the tpxo dataset as shown in fig 3 it can be seen that the amplitudes and phases of the m2 and k1 tides produced by the fvcom model are in good agreement with those generated by the tpxo 7 2 database especially for the area near china coasts the simulated amplitudes and phases are also found to be comparable with the previous numerical or observational studies within the northwest pacific ocean of fang et al 2004 song et al 2013 and zhang and sheng 2015 to validate the model on tide levels the measurements taken from 16 tide gauge stations in the northwest pacific ocean region see fig 1 provided by the sea level centre at the university of hawaii uhslc http uhslc soest hawaii edu caldwell et al 2015 are used fig 4 shows the comparisons of tidal levels between simulations and observations at 16 gauge stations from the 5th to the 21st of january 1995 over a spring neap tide cycle it can be seen from fig 4 that the simulated tidal level generally agreed well with the observational data for both tidal range and tidal phase to further quantify the model performance in predicting tidal levels the correlation coefficients r and root mean square errors rmse between the computed and measured tidal levels defined below were calculated by the following equations 15 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 16 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 the correlation coefficient r indicates the fit level between the observed and simulated quantities and rmse measures their deviations fig 5 shows the correlation coefficients and rmses of the validation results at 16 stations it is clear that all correlation coefficients were over 0 8 and the rmses were no more than 0 3 m except at lvsi because of a very complicated bathymetry near the radial sandy ridge area in the southern yellow sea xu et al 2016 in general as seen from the results shown in both figs 4 and 5 the simulated tidal levels agreed well with the observational data which indicates that the modelling system performed well in simulating the tidal levels in the study area 4 1 wave validation with the combined tide and wave conditions the computed significant wave heights generated by the un modified ecmwf reanalysis wind data case wc1 and the modified ecmwf t wind data case wc2 were compared with the measurements from three wave buoys taitung ocean station with depth of approximately 5 600 m taitung station and pratas station with depth of approximately 2 600 m in the southern coastal water of taiwan see fig 1 fig 6 a shows the comparison of measured and the simulated wave heights between june and october 2012 it can be seen from fig 6 a that the waves generated by both wind fields generally agreed with the observational data however in the simulation of large waves during the typhoon periods for example those in 27 september 2012 as shown in fig 6 b and c the waves generated in case wc2 agreed better fig 7 shows the values of correlation coefficients and rmses between simulated and observed data the rmses at all the three stations were less than 1 m whereas the extreme wave heights at these stations were greater than 5 m and up to 10 m in some cases which can be regarded as satisfactory the values of correlation coefficients for waves generated by ecmwf t showed better correlations at taitung station compared with the results for the un modified ecmwf data however at pratas station the correlation was slightly less satisfactory wave heights at this station were the lowest among all stations because the typhoon centres were far from the station in this case the modification of typhoon winds might be less effective nonetheless the mean wave heights were reasonably predicted compared with the field measurements in general the results demonstrated the improvement of the wave predictions gained from the modified ecmwf data ecmwf t 4 2 surge validation for storm surge the model was run with conditions for the entire year of 1995 the simulated storm surge was calculated by subtracting the water levels from the tide only model case to from those from the model driven by wind and sea level pressure using ecmwf and ecmwf t data case wc1 and case wc2 the tidal and non tidal components of the observation sea levels were extracted using a harmonic analysis package known as t tide pawlowicz et al 2002 fig 8 shows the comparison of the simulated surge levels from both ecmwf and ecmwf t data with the observations at four selected tide gauge stations beihai shanwei xiamen and shijiusuo from the south to the north coast as shown in fig 1 it can be seen from fig 8 that the simulated surges from both wind data sets fit the observational data well for further comparison the quantile quantile q q plots for the simulated and observed surge levels at the four observation stations are given in fig 9 it can be seen that the extremely large surges simulated by ecmwf t generally agreed better with the observational data than those generated by ecmwf especially at beihai and shanwei because of the better performance of ecmwf t data in the simulation of large storm surges during the typhoon periods whereas the surges were underestimated when using the original ecmwf data however the improvement of ecmwf t at shijiusuo station appears to have been minimal the maximum surge levels were under predicted using both ecmwf and ecmwf t at almost an identical level because the extreme surges generated by the cold storms in winter seasons were more significant than those by typhoons at this station however it should be noted that the overall surge levels here were much lower than at other stations 4 3 wave current effects during typhoon periods according to yoon and jun 2015 the nonlinear interaction between waves and currents are strong during typhoon periods especially in the coastal area in order to understand the effects of wave current interaction on wave and surge simulations under the extreme conditions typhoon saola the ninth named storm in 2012 was chosen as an example to illustrate the effect of the wave current interaction using the coupled and uncoupled models at 4 examining locations in present study fig 10 shows the track of saola and four examining locations nearshore which are close to the typhoon centre the water depths for locations a b c and d are 7 9 m 21 4 m 115 9 m and 1 527 4 m respectively the effects of the wave current interaction were examined by running both coupled and uncoupled models i e case wc and case wo and comparing the simulated wave height at four locations as shown in fig 11 during typhoon saola it can be seen that at the shallow water location location a and b the wave heights calculated by coupled model fluctuate with the change of tidal level i e modulated by tides and the peak is about 0 3 m larger than the uncoupled model at location a it is demonstrated the necessity of using the coupled model to estimate the extreme waves in the coastal area with the increasing of the water depth location c and d the wave current effect during the typhoon period is negligible the surge processes simulated by coupled and uncoupled model i e case wc and case tow at these four locations are also compared during typhoon saola as showed in fig 12 it can be seen that the effects of wave current interaction on the surge are noticeable at near shore area location a and b when the typhoon centre approaches the nearshore area while the effects becomes insignificant at deep water area location c and d from figs 11 and 12 it can be seen that the wave current interaction have noticeable effects on the wave and surge simulations particularly in the nearshore area during the typhoon affected period therefore using the coupled modelling framework becomes necessary when estimating the extreme conditions of waves and surges 5 long term wave analysis following the model validations the model was run for long term simulations of waves and surges from 1979 to 2013 fig 13 shows the typhoon tracks over 35 years in the northwest pacific ocean in total 862 typhoons occurred in this region during this period to improve the simulation accuracy the original ecmwf reanalysis data were modified by the parametric typhoon model jelesnianski 1965 using the 35 year best track data both the original ecmwf reanalysis data and the modified ecmwf data with the parametric typhoon model ecmwf t were used to drive the model for comparisons case wc1 case wc2 to minimize the boundary effects the model results from a sub domain 105 e 140 e and 15 n 41 n were extracted for analysis over which the spatial and temporal distributions of mean and extreme wave heights and surge levels with 50 year and 100 year return periods were calculated since the distributions and patterns for both return periods were similar only the extreme waves and surges with 100 year return period results are presented in this paper 5 1 mean wave heights the mean wave heights were calculated by averaging the computed wave heights over the 35 year simulation period fig 14 shows the 35 year mean wave heights generated by both ecmwf and ecmwf t wind data in the study area the results clearly show that the mean wave height generally decreased northwards and landwards fig 14 shows that the mean significant wave height was between 1 3 m and 1 7 m in the north of the south china sea 1 2 m 1 5 m in the east china sea 0 9 m 1 3 m in the yellow sea and less than 1 m in the bohai sea the largest mean wave heights were found southeast of taiwan island by comparing the wave fields generated by the ecmwf and ecmwf t winds it can be seen that the distributions of mean wave heights from both winds were generally similar however noticeable differences were seen southeast of taiwan island with larger waves generated by the ecmwf t winds this is expected and believed to be reasonable because this is the area with a large occurrence of typhoons over the 35 year period as shown in fig 13 the results show evidence of the improvement of wind data when the parametric typhoon model was used 5 2 extreme wave heights the annual maximum significant wave heights were extracted from the long term computed wave heights the annual maxima were analysed by using the gumbel distribution method described in section 2 2 to calculate the wave heights with a 100 year return period the extreme wave heights were first estimated by considering the waves in all directions and the extreme wave heights in 6 main directional sections were then estimated the directional distributions were particularly important for determining the design waves at different coastal locations the extreme waves were also calculated in different seasons to explore their seasonal variation 5 2 1 distribution of overall extreme waves the annual maximum wave heights at each grid point were calculated and the distribution of overall extreme wave heights were then calculated for the entire computational region fig 15 shows the spatial distributions of extreme wave heights generated by ecmwf and ecmwf t data it can be seen that the extreme waves decreased from south to north and from sea to coast the contours appear to be parallel to the coast when approaching it the extreme waves in the bohai sea and the yellow sea generated with both ecmwf and ecmwf t winds were almost the same because typhoon events might not occur so often in these areas see fig 13 it can be seen from fig 15 that the 100 year return period wave heights in the bohai sea were less than 7 m whereas those in the yellow sea were between 7 m and 11 m however in the east china sea and the northern part of the south china sea the extreme wave heights calculated by the ecmwf t winds were much larger than those from the ecmwf winds especially in the southeast part of taiwan island this is the area through which many typhoons passed during 1979 2013 as shown in fig 13 because the parametric typhoon model improved the accuracy of wind fields during the typhoon events over the un modified ecmwf winds it is reasonable that the extreme waves generated by ecmwf t wind data were more accurate than those generated by ecmwf wind data 5 2 2 directional distribution of extreme waves because the directional distribution of extreme waves is of great importance for engineering designs especially for infrastructure in coastal areas extreme waves in six landward directional sectors e n ne s se and sw were chosen for the study coming direction for waves because the waves generated by ecmwf t data were more accurate than those generated by ecmwf data only the extreme waves from ecmwf t data are presented and discussed here fig 16 shows the spatial distributions of extreme waves in the six directions extreme waves in e and se directions generally had the largest values followed by those in s direction northerly extreme waves were the smallest the large waves higher than 20 m mainly occurred in the open deep water areas particularly the area east and south east of taiwan island similar to those shown in fig 15 b for the extreme waves in e direction the results showed that larger waves could penetrate much closer to the shore such as the areas in the eastern coast of china adjacent to taiwan island the extreme waves in se direction exhibited a similar trend because the large typhoon induced waves in this study area were mostly from the east or south east directions along which a large fetch was available for waves to develop and propagate shoreward in the region 5 2 3 distribution of seasonal extreme waves in the northwest pacific ocean typhoons generally occur in the summer and autumn seasons and cold storm waves occur in the winter and spring seasons therefore typhoon waves may feature strong seasonality which was also examined in this study fig 17 shows the 100 year return period wave heights generated by ecmwf t winds in spring march april and may summer june july and august autumn september october and november and winter january february and december seasons it can be clearly seen that the extreme wave heights were the smallest in the spring season whereas larger extreme waves occurred in the summer and autumn seasons resulting from the frequent occurrence of the typhoon events the largest extreme waves occurred in the east and south east of taiwan island which is under the path of the majority of the typhoons shown in fig 13 it should be noted that the extreme waves in winter were relatively larger than those in summer in the northern area such as in the bohai sea and part of the yellow sea which indicates the existence and impacts of cold winter storms in winter in the north part of the china coasts 5 2 4 extreme waves at nearshore stations extreme waves were gradually reduced shoreward as shown in fig 15 and became low in the nearshore areas however they remain important for the design of coastal engineering projects especially at locations of important coastal infrastructure to examine the accuracy of the estimated extreme waves in the coastal area the hind casted extreme wave heights with a 100 year return period were compared with the field measurements taken at several nearshore wave observation stations along the coast of china the availability of the field data at these stations is summarized in table 2 and the locations are marked in fig 1 fig 18 shows the comparisons of the computed extreme wave heights with the measurements in 6 main directional sectors along the coasts of china the observational data denoted as obs in fig 18 were calculated from the long term measurements at those stations as listed in table 2 note that the measurement data in some directions were unavailable and are missing in fig 18 the results show the general pattern of the extreme wave distributions along the coast of china clearly showing that the extreme wave heights were relatively small in the northern region and large in the southern region in all directions for the locations in the south the extreme waves were the largest in e direction followed by ne and se directions because those areas were exposed to the open seas toward the east so that waves from those directions could directly propagate to the shore over a large fetch without being sheltered in n direction the nearshore extreme waves at the mid eastern coast of china were large and decreased southwards whereas the nearshore extreme waves in s direction exhibited an opposite trend the variations can be attributed to the orientation of the shorelines and impacts on wave propagation it is also interesting that large extreme waves existed in sw direction although the extreme waves in this direction may often be ignored in engineering designs the smaller nearshore extreme waves in the northern coasts from laohutan to lianyungang the coastal areas of bohai sea and yellow sea are believed to be because of the fewer occurrences of typhoons and shallower water depths in those areas fig 18 shows that the simulated extreme wave heights agreed well with the observational data at the nearshore locations the extreme wave heights computed by the ecmwf data were underestimated in most of the observation stations whereas the extreme wave heights computed by the ecmwf t data again clearly indicated an improvement in yielding the extreme values in the nearshore area despite the discrepancies between the measurements and the model results at some stations for example the extreme waves from the model were obviously underestimated in dachen from n to e directions and overestimated in nanji in sw and se directions because the resolution of the computational mesh was insufficiently fine to represent the rapid variation of the bathymetry in the nearshore areas further refinement will be required in future study 6 extreme surges to examine the extreme surge the water levels computed in the tide only case case to were subtracted from those computed in the cases with the combined tide and wave conditions case wc1 case wc2 the water level differences surge levels calculated were then analysed and the annual maxima over the 35 year period were used to estimate the extreme surge levels for a 100 year return period at each grid point in the model domain 6 1 distribution of extreme surges fig 19 shows the distributions of 100 year return period surges driven by ecmwf and ecmwf t data over the study region comparing the surges generated by the un modified ecmwf and ecmwf t data their distribution patterns are largely similar the surge levels generated by the ecmwf t data were slightly larger as expected the extreme surges increased towards the coastal waters when water depth decreased larger 100 year return period extreme surges were found along the coastline of china from the south of shandong peninsula to the hainan island fig 1 up to 2 m in general but as large as over 4 m in some areas the extreme surge levels appear to be closely related to the local bathymetry the surge level was larger when the water depth was smaller and the extreme surge contours often coincided with the water depth contours the simulation results suggest that the coastal area in the radial sandy ridge area off the jiangsu coast hangzhou bay and the north of the qiongzhou strait tend to have the relatively large extreme surges two particular areas were chosen to illustrate the impacts the area adjacent to the hangzhou bay and the area adjacent to the qiongzhou strait as indicated in fig 19 a fig 20 shows the extreme surges in those two areas generated by both ecmwf and ecmwf t data the shape of the coastline and the change of the water depth affected the surge level for example in hangzhou bay shown in fig 20 a and b the funnel shape of the coastline resulted in the concentration of tidal energy and extremely large surges inside the bay additionally surges were higher in the area where typhoons frequently occurred such as in the north of qiongzhou strait see fig 20 c and d the differences in surges in the area adjacent to hangzhou bay were insignificant whereas there were noticeable differences for surges in the area adjacent to the qiongzhou strait the tide surge interactions could also make a great contribution to extreme surges in these areas feng and tsimplis 2014 zhang and sheng 2015 although this is outside the scope of this paper 6 2 extreme surges at nearshore stations to compare the model results with the field measurements in the nearshore areas specifically the sea level observations at 10 tide gauges as listed in the uhslc database caldwell et al 2015 were used the database contains the measurements for more than 25 years the gumbel distribution was applied to the measured surge levels to estimate the extreme values with a 100 year return period the non tidal components were extracted from the measured sea levels at these locations using the t tide package introduced in section 4 3 the comparison of 100 year return period surges between measured data and simulated data driven by ecmwf and ecmwf t are shown in fig 21 in general the computed surge levels at all stations were close to those from measurements and those generated by the ecmwf t winds were in better agreement except lvsi station which may be due to the complicated currents there among all 10 stations the lvsi zhapo and haikou stations appeared to have the largest values of extreme surge over 2 m these three stations are located in the large extreme surge domain discovered in the mapped extreme surge field in section 6 1 in general the surges along the coast of china were slightly underestimated which may have been caused by the rapidly changing water depth and the coarse grid in the nearshore area along the coast of china moreover to some extent the wind discrepancies may have also affected the simulated results however the extreme surges simulated by the ecmwf t data were generally better than those simulated by the original ecmwf data which further confirms the superiority of modified ecmwf data in the simulation of extreme events in the coastal region of china 7 conclusions this study used the coupled hydrodynamic model fvcom and the wave model fvcom swave to simulate long term waves and surges for the 35 years from 1979 to 2013 and to estimate the 100 year return period extreme waves and surges in the northwest pacific ocean region the model was forced by tidal conditions provided by the tpxo 7 2 database and atmospheric conditions provided by both the original ecmwf reanalysis data ecmwf and the modified ecmwf data ecmwf t with a parametric typhoon model to improve the representation of typhoon events the model was validated with field measurements of waves and surges the results demonstrated that the waves and surges generated by ecmwf t were in better agreement with the measurements and the adequate implementation of the parametric wave model the 35 year mean wave heights in the region showed that waves were high in the south and gradually deceased northwards the largest mean wave heights were located in the area east of taiwan island the extreme waves and surges with a 100 year return period in the region were estimated from the computed wave heights and surge levels over the 35 year period using the gumbel distribution the results of the spatial distribution showed that the extreme waves in the study area generally decreased northward and shoreward similar to the mean wave height distributions the maximum extreme wave heights were also found southeast of taiwan island with values up to 23 m the distributions of directional and seasonal extreme waves were also examined the extreme waves in e se and ne directions and in summer and autumn seasons appeared to have larger values in most of the deep open water areas the extreme waves in the sw direction were also found to have large values which indicated a significant wave propagation parallel to the shoreline in the southern coast of china the extreme surge levels were found to be significant in the nearshore areas particularly at the coasts in the jiangsu radial sandy ridge area hangzhou bay and north of the qiongzhou strait the extreme surges appeared to coincide with the water depth contours which indicates the effects of local bathymetry on surges the results of the 100 year return period wave heights and surges were compared with those calculated from the long term observational data at a number of locations along the coast of china the comparisons showed that the waves and surges generated by the modified ecmwf data ecmwf t by the parametric typhoon model agreed better with the measurements and were more accurate than those generated by the original ecmwf reanalysis data this study provided detailed insights into the distribution of extreme waves and surges in the northwest pacific ocean especially the coast of china it has also provided a simple yet effective method to modify the surface forcing the ecmwf reanalysis data in this case when simulating waves and water levels with typhoon events the details of the extreme waves and surges obtained from this study can be easily used for engineering designs at the given locations of interest by longitude and latitude the simulation results in the coastal area may be further improved with the refinement of the unstructured mesh of the area of interest

23554,this study investigates infragravity motions on a two dimensional fringing reef with a concave topography using a wave resolving nonlinear boussinesq wave model the effect of bathymetric nonlinearity on spatial variations of infragravity waves is studied from shore normal incident random waves the model is first verified from cross shore alongshore significant wave height wave setup and infragravity wave height measured in laboratory experiments the modeled velocity is further examined to elucidate the infragravity wave current field wavenumber frequency velocity spectra show that cross shore infragravity motions are controlled by the leaky waves while alongshore infragravity motions exhibit edge waves characteristics additionally high mode edge waves prevail on the entire infragravity frequency band while low mode edge waves are dominant at very low frequencies furthermore the model results illustrate the spatial and temporal variability of wave induced nearshore currents alongshore and cross shore flows accompanying with circulation cells and rip currents the infragavity wave current field is nearly identical to the mean current field and the circulations develop at the same spatial scale as the reef flat keywords infragravity waves edge waves circulation fringing reef 1 introduction infragravity waves are long period about 20 200 s water surface motions that govern nearshore energy on the beach comparable to the energy within short period swell and sea typically 4 20 s the long wave oscillations accompanied by short waves could enhance wave overtopping and run up at shores which results in inundation and shore erosion field measurements indicate that nearshore infragravity motions are a complex mixture of progressive long waves leaky waves and edge waves huntley et al 1981 oltman shay and guza 1987 leaky waves are generated by shore normal propagating long waves that reflect from the shore and then radiate seaward edge waves are trapped close to the shore by multiple reflections from the shoreline and offshore refraction which progress alongshore and have variance maxima at the shoreline and an exponentially decaying cross shore variance profile of nodes and antinodes while the length scales of leaky waves fit well with the cross shore spacing of nearshore bars spatial scales of edge waves are correlated to alongshore morphological features i e rhythmic and crescentic bar patterns consequently infragravity motions are believed to have an important effect on the cross shore and alongshore morphological development short waves dominate the ecological and geological development of reef environments such as the fate of sediments and pollutants organism distribution nutrient uptake overall productivity dispersal and recruitment of larvae however scientific research on reefs has recently became increasingly focused on long period infragravity waves numerous hydrodynamic studies on reefs have proposed that infragravity energy becomes dominant because most short waves break as they propagate over the shallow forereef or reef edge and continue to dissipate by bottom friction along the wide reef flat hardy and young 1996 lugo fernández et al 1998 brander et al 2004 samosorn and woodroffe 2008 additionally infragravity waves may play an important role in sediment transport on the reef flat pomeroy et al 2015 moreover sediment particles may be driven far away since long period infragravity oscillations can act as a sediment transport agent through advection similarly to quasi steady mean currents e g aagaard and greenwood 2008 therefore infragravity waves may have more prominent effect than short waves on sediment transport and nearshore morphological evolution in coral reef environments with the projected climate changes sea level rise and decrease in the frictional characteristics of the reef bottom may adversely affect the communities and resources in fringing reef linked coasts madin and connolly 2006 an important reason can be attributed to resonant amplification of infragravity waves on reefs which cause extensive reef coast inundation under energetic storm conditions péquignet et al 2009 strong infragravity energy would bring a serious natural hazard particularly for low lying reef islands for example in super typhoon haiyan strong coupling of long period infragravity waves and short period swell produced extreme runup which caused extensive inundation at coasts of the philippines shimozono et al 2015 therefore understanding infragravity wave hydrodynamics on reefs is important for emergency management land use planning hazard assessment and coastal protection a number of numerical models with laboratory experiments have been developed to explore the characteristics and generation of infragravity waves on fringing reefs ma et al 2014 nwogu and demirbilek 2010 su et al 2015 sheremet et al 2011 the infragravity energy over the reefs can reasonably be predicted from verified breaking and bottom friction parameters however these studies reduced reef platforms to a one dimensional cross shore profile which does not account for the two dimensional complexity of reef bathymetry and directional wave propagation behavior previous studies have proposed that alongshore non uniformities in sandy beaches would be important in view of the potential coupling between infragravity conditions and underlying bathymetry bowen and inman 1971 holman and bowen 1984 reniers et al 2006 in reality reef topography is more complex than beaches in both cross shore and alongshore directions although field measurements have been undertaken to investigate infragravity waves on the fringing reefs these observations gave little information about the alongshore variation of infragravity wave conditions because the measurements were restricted to the cross shore direction becker et al 2016 péquignet et al 2014 pomeroy et al 2012 reef morphology would promote wave refraction and diffraction which have an implication on the reef island formation mandlier and kench 2012 inhomogeneous infragravity field on reefs is expected winter et al 2017 proposed that highly variable rocky reef bathymetry might produce both cross shore and alongshore standing waves therefore the reef morphology was as important as offshore wave conditions to accurately characterize infragravity energy on reef systems cheriton et al 2016 van dongeren et al 2013 utilized the numerical model xbeach to investigate infragravity waves over the two dimensional 2 d fringing reef bottom friction coefficients for short waves and current infragravity waves in the model were assumed independent and had to be calibrated separately their model calculations revealed that leaky waves were dominant in the cross shore direction the primary aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics of infragravity waves on a 2 d spatial variable fringing reef bathymetry this question is addressing using a wave resolving nonlinear boussinesq model because the model can resolve each individual wave in shallow water and nonlinear wave wave interactions as well as wave current interaction chen et al 2003 the model was in good agreement with wave heights mean water level and infragravity waves by one dimensional prototype flume measurements for reefs su et al 2015 the present study is interested in infragravity field on a 2 d non uniform fringing reef because its topographic feature could complicate the wave and current fields comprehensive field experiments that involve measurements of two dimensional infragravity field in reef environments are limited therefore this investigation adopts laboratory measurements of waves on a reef in a wave basin conducted by the coastal and hydraulic laboratory u s army corps of engineers smith et al 2012 the work was initiated by the surge and wave island modeling studies program and performed extensive laboratory experiments to understand the wave hydrodynamics in reef systems as well as build databases for model verifications the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the laboratory experiments the numerical model and model setup section 3 presents the model verification in which it is compared with the laboratory observations and model results of velocity fields section 4 discuss the behaviours of spatial variations of infragravity velocity and current field finally section 5 concludes this study of the role of infragravity motions in the fringing reef 2 methodology 2 1 numerical modeling a fully nonlinear and dispersive wave model funwave tvd developed by shi et al 2012 is used to numerically simulate water surface height and velocities on the reef the model solves the fully nonlinear boussinesq equations using a hybrid finite volume finite difference scheme and incorporates a moving reference level the governing equations in funwave tvd are organized in a well balanced conservative form and are numerically solved using a high order shock capturing tvd scheme this improvement enables the model to simulate wave breaking and associated wave energy dissipation without relying on empirical formulations in addition the model employs a third order strong stability preserving runge kutta method for adaptive time stepping a robust wetting drying scheme captures the moving shoreline these improvements improve the robustness of the model in predicting nearshore wave processes including wave shoaling refraction diffraction breaking and wave run up as well as wave induced circulation and rip currents on the beaches shi et al 2012 in other words the model considers fully coupled wave and current interaction the mass conservation and horizontal momentum equations of governing equations are given by 1 η t h η u α u 2 0 2 u α t u α u α g η v 1 v 2 v 3 r s r f 0 where the subscript t denotes time differentiation x y is the horizontal gradient operator η is the free surface elevation h is the still water depth h is the velocity at a reference elevation z α 0 53 h 0 47 η u 2 is the depth averaged contribution to the horizontal velocity field which is given by 3 u 2 1 h η h η u 2 z d z z α 2 2 1 6 h 2 h η η 2 b z α 1 2 h η a u 2 represents the depth dependent correction of the velocity at o μ 2 μ h l where l is the wave length can be written as 4 u 2 z z α z a 1 2 z α 2 z 2 b where a h u α and b u α v 1 and v 2 are dispersive boussinesq terms v 3 accounts for the second order effect of the vertical vorticity r s represents the subgrid lateral turbulent mixing and r f is the bottom friction parameterized as a quadratic drag law 5 r f c d h η u α u α where c d represents the bottom friction coefficient the equation has been expressed in terms of u α instead of the velocity at the bottom to minimize the computation time therefore the value of c d in the model would be slightly different than those calibrated based on the bottom velocity with the conservative form the governing equations can be solved by using a local riemann solver a fourth order muscl tvd scheme yamamoto et al 1998 is employed to evaluate the fluxes at cell interfaces wave breaking is modeled by locally switching the boussinesq equations to the nonlinear shallow water equations when the froude number exceeds a certain threshold shi et al 2012 this approach was proven to be robust for describing wave breaking and associated wave energy dissipation the model is parallelized using the message passing interface mpi with non blocking communication 2 2 model setup the model was calibrated by using two dimensional wave basin laboratory measurements conducted under the surge and wave island modeling studies program smith et al 2012 which was designed to study wave breaking energy dissipation wave setup and runup over fringing reefs a fringing reef platform was built on a wave basin with length 51 8 m width 29 0 m and depth 1 5 m the fringing reef can be characterized as the forereef with compound slopes of 1 4 and 1 13 composed of a 7 30 m wide sloping 1 100 reef flat linking to a 1 10 beach slope the central part of the outer reef has a concave topography this topographic feature leads to alongshore variation at the reef edge and outer reef flat the acrylic glass was installed on the reef surface paint mixed with roughening agent was applied to the reef surface for the rough surface cases this study adopted the smooth surface case fig 1 depicts the reef bathymetry of the laboratory experiments thirteen wave gauges were installed both across and along the reef where seven wave gauges were positioned in the cross shore direction of the central reef and six wave gauges were deployed in the alongshore of the reef flat the cross shore and alongshore array reasonably captured the spatial characteristics of wave field fig 1 displays the locations of the wave gauges detailed descriptions of the laboratory experiments can be referred to smith et al 2012 although the experiments contained low mid and high water levels alongshore wave gauges were unable to record water surface elevation data owing to insufficient water depth at the low and mid water levels to ensure that all the wave gauges could be used in model calibration this study only adopted cases with high water level the numerical simulation applied exactly the same computational domain as the laboratory experiments namely 16 0 m in the cross shore direction 12 2 m in the alongshore direction the model domain was discretized into 400 300 computation grid cells by using a rectangular grid with 0 04 m resolution offshore waves were generated on the left side of the domain by using an internal wave maker a sponger layer 1 2 m with the thickness of 30 grids was placed along the left hand side boundary to absorb wave energy radiating from the beach and forereef to minimize the effects of the lateral boundaries periodic boundary conditions were set at the lateral boundaries the model was forced with normally incident random waves time series of free surface elevations follow a tma wave spectrum with a significant wave height h s of 0 1 m and a peak period t p of 0 99 s the model outputs include time series of free surface elevation and velocity components with a time interval of 0 05 s the model run time was 800 s and the last 620 s model outputs after reaching a quasi steady state were used for post processing analysis spectral analysis was performed on continuous records of 12400 samples 620 s using a 2048 point 102 4 s hanning window with 50 overlap providing 12 degrees of freedom and a frequency resolution of 0 0098 hz 3 model results 3 1 comparison with laboratory measurements su et al 2015 applied the funwave tvd model to study the one dimensional physical laboratory measurements in which the bathymetric profile was the cross shore section of the present 2d reef at y 7 5 m see fig 1 the bottom friction coefficient c d was found to be a key parameter determining the wave energy distribution over the reef and also needed to be calibrated on the present 2d reef the model was validated with varying values ranging between o 10 2 and o 100 which are spatially uniform over the reef the value of the coefficient was set within the empirical range based on previous studies for reef bottom roughness rosman and hench 2011 the model was calibrated with cross shore distributions of physical features including significant wave height wave setup and infragravity wave height to quantify model predictions a measure of model skill proposed by willmott 1982 is used 6 model skill 1 i 1 n x mod i x meas i 2 i 1 n x mod i x meas x meas i x meas 2 where x m e a s is the measured value x mod is the modeled value overbar is the average and n is the number of wave gauge used for the comparison fig 2 presents the model skills with different c d for three physical properties of waves overall model performance is fairly good average model skills for significant wave height wave setup and infragravity wave height are 0 98 0 90 and 0 73 respectively the significant wave height and wave setup are captured well by the model with c d 0 2 which is consistent with that in our pervious investigation su et al 2015 although the model skill for infragravity wave height is not as good the value of 0 72 is acceptable for model prediction the following sections present model results of c d 0 2 fig 3 shows comparisons of modeled and measured cross shore significant wave height wave setup and infragravity wave height the figure reveals that the cross shore variation of wave height was in excellent agreement with the measurements fig 3a wave height was almost constant on the seaward of the forereef indicating that shoaling was not obvious as waves approach the reef edge x 30 5 m the wave height apparently decreased and continued to decay with onshore propagation across the reef flat the model accurately captures the dissipative processes of wave breaking and bottom friction over the reef fig 3b presents model data comparison of wave setup the mean water surface level decline slightly in front of the reef edge and then rose towards the inner reef flat the trend of the mean water surface level was in good agreement with the measurements the most significant discrepancy between measurements and simulations was found around the breaking point i e around the reef edge fig 3c shows the model data comparison of infragravity wave height the measured data demonstrates an increase during shoaling on the forereef and nearly a constant on the reef flat notably the model overpredicted the infragravity wave height particularly within the reef flat the overprediction also occurred in 1d reef simulation by su et al 2015 fig 4 depicts model data comparisons of alongshore significant wave height wave setup and infragravity wave height the computed wave heights agree fairly well with the measurements fig 4a the alongshore distribution reveals that the wave height is higher at the central cross shore reef y 6 0 m than at the neighboring reef indicating that the alongshore variation of wave height is associated with changes in the alongshore water depth this finding can be attributed to the relatively deeper depth at the central cross shore reef which leads to breaking waves moving shoreward compared with other positions in the alongshore array fig 4b shows the computed wave setup the mean surface elevation is slightly lower at the central reef than in the neighboring zones the alongshore variation of wave setup tends to generate converging pressure gradients fig 4c compares the modeled and measured alongshore infragravity wave heights the smallest measured infragravity wave height was at the central reef while the smallest modeled value is located at the downcoast the model slightly overestimated most results at all wave gauges except w8 3 2 spatial and temporal behaviors of infragravity waves natural fringing reefs have spatial variations in morphology in both cross shore and alongshore directions therefore wave refraction would complicate the random wave fields fig 5 a illustrates a snapshot of the simulated water surface elevation at time t 610 s the wave crests are represented by the lighter blue areas the figure shows the long crested waves bend when they propagate over the central reef the oblique wave refraction pattern is mainly induced by the alongshore variation of reef topography fig 5b displays the spatial distribution of significant wave height the central outer reef flat is an area of relatively high wave height fig 6 illustrates the modeled wave setup for the entire domain significantly wave setup suggests spatial variations at the forereef and reef flat zones obviously the wave breaking is the cause of cross shore variation of radiation stresses that result in wave setdown before breaking and setup after breaking depression of mean water surface elevation occurs along the zone of reef edge x 30 0 m from which mean water surface elevation increases shoreward due to the concave reef topography varying breaking locations result in the alongshore gradient of the mean water surface elevation the highest wave setup appears near the shoreline around x 38 0 m and y 7 5 m the resultant pressure gradient is a dominant driving force for reef nearshore circulations as suggested by lowe et al 2010 fig 7 shows the modeled infragravity wave height for the whole domain two alongshore zones have energetic infragravity wave height namely the inner reef flat and the beach the maximum infragravity wave heights distribute along the shoreline which corresponds to the field observations in the high tide case péquignet et al 2009 significant infragravity waves distribute broadly on the reef flat and the largest appear at the inner reef flat x 36 0 37 0 m interestingly two peaks located at approximately at y 4 0 m and y 10 5 m this diagnostic is similar to two anti nodes of a standing wave motion in the alongshore direction however the exact wavelength cannot be determined with only one node mapped at the reef edge x 30 0 m infragravity waves were relatively higher at the up and down coast and lower around the central reef in contrast with the energetic ingrafravity energy zones low energy zones occurred at the outer reef flat x 30 0 31 5 m and the inner reef flat x 37 5 m especially at the concave reef x 31 0 m and y 5 0 m these zones denote the node structure of cross shore infragravity motions wave groups composed of individual wave components have temporal variability in wave envelope modulations of wave groups on the time scale commonly discussed in the literature are associated with infragravity motions fig 8 a presents computed modulated wave envelope energy as a function of time at the central cross shore transect the wave envelope was obtained by the hilbert transform of water surface elevation time series the space time wave energy modulation shows a sequence of wave groups with different energy in the time domain the modulation declines significantly once the wave envelope propagates over the reef edge indicating that wave envelope is destroyed by wave breaking wave groups accompanying higher waves break at the reef edge would generate free infragravity waves by the time varying breakpoint symonds et al 1982 fig 8b displays the temporal variation of infragravity surface elevation at the central cross shore transect the infragravity surface elevation was obtained by the low pass filtering f 0 5f p of time series water surface elevation combinations of incident long waves sloping upward in the positive x direction and reflected long waves sloping upward in the negative x direction result in spatial and temporal variations of infragravity motions the incident long waves are dominant on the forereef as shown by the clearly upward sloping contours wave caustics are exhibited over the reef flat this feature is typically caused by standing waves comprising of an incident bound long wave a free long wave and a reflected free long wave fig 9 presents the contour plot of cross correlations between infragravity elevation at cross shore locations and short wave envelope at the offshore wave gauge w1 for three cross shore transects at y 1 5 m 6 0 m and 10 5 m this plot shows that a strong negative correlation extends from offshore to the middle reef flat consistent with previous reef studies su et al 2015 pomeroy et al 2012 van dongeren et al 2013 this feature is in agreement with the theoretical prediction of bound long waves accompanying the short wave groups longuet higgins and stewart 1962 moving further shoreward the negative correlation gradually decreases to nearly zero around the middle reef flat x 35 0 m the correlation considerably diminishes close to the shore because wave breaking apparently destroys the formation of the short wave envelope within the reef flat short wave breaking reduces the amplitude of bound long waves longuet higgins and stewart 1962 additionally a strong positive correlation develops prior to the negative correlation from the forereef to the shore this phenomenon occurs because the infragravity waves are generated by the time varying breaking forcing symonds et al 1982 which is consistent with the findings in previous studies su et al 2015 pomeroy et al 2012 van dongeren et al 2013 distinct from the previous studies this study shows a significant positive correlation lagging the negative correlation from offshore which has not been proposed in the previous reef observations and simulations this feature is possible owing to free long waves generated in the neighboring reef the detailed standing wave pattern is shown using an alternative approach with wave velocity fig 10 illustrates the contour plots of the cross correlations of the infragravity wave velocity and elevation at the same location for three cross shore transects y 1 5 m 6 0 m and 10 5 m the infragravity wave velocity is obtained from the low pass filtered f 0 5f p time series cross shore velocity a strong positive correlation is observed from offshore extending to the beach and the maximum occurs around the reef edge the seaward correlations have a strong positive correlation lagging from the beach and a strong negative correlation beyond the beach this symmetric correlation pattern indicates that a standing infragravity wave is generated on the reef flat this behavior is similar to previous observations for rip channel beach macmahan et al 2004a chen et al 1999 all three cross shore transects have this feature above analyses illustrate the cross shore infragravity elevation and velocity motions the alongshore velocity field was then investigated to identify edge wave motions if the wave field is homogeneous in the alongshore direction and stationary in time during the measurement period then the characteristics of edge waves can be described using a two dimensional energy spectrum which gives the wave energy as a function of both frequency and wavenumber on a plane beach linear shallow water theory predicts the edge wave dispersion relation given by huntley et al 1981 7 f 2 g k y 2 π 2 n 1 m where f is the frequency g is gravity n is the edge wave mode number m is the beach slope and k y is the alongshore wavenumber defined as 1 l y where l y denotes the alongshore wavelength leaky waves occupy a continuum of smaller alongshore wavenumbers in the range 8 2 π f 2 g k y 2 π f 2 g a previous study showed that the existence of a broad banded edge wave field on open coastal beaches and edge waves and leaky waves would coexist at a certain frequency oltman shay and guza 1987 as mentioned above fig 7 presents the infragravity energy distribution along the reef to find the alongshore infragravity motions the wave characteristics can be examined by using the edge wave dispersion relation fig 11 shows the cross shore and alongshore velocity wavenumber frequency k y f spectra estimated with the modeled cross shore and alongshore velocity time series at the outer reef flat alongshore transect at x 32 5 m analytical dispersion relation solutions for the leaky waves eq 8 and edge waves eq 7 with four lowest modes n 0 1 2 and 3 are drawn the distribution of spectral energy at positive and negative wavenumbers represents waves moving downward and upward most infragravity energy in the cross shore velocity k y f spectrum is clustered within the leaky wave mode region indicating that the leaky waves are dominant fig 11a the low energy around f 0 21 hz is associated with the nodal structure of the cross shore standing infragravity waves the alongshore velocity k y f spectrum displays the energy distribution outside the bounds of the leaky wave region fig 11b i e the presence of edge waves additionally the energy at lower frequency band f 0 2 hz fits the dispersion curves and the energy at higher frequency band f 0 2 hz distributes in the higher mode edge wave region n 3 although the incident waves are shore normal alongshore infragravity waves are generated additionally significant energy below the frequency 0 05 hz with k y 0 7 was observed in both cross shore and alongshore velocity k y f spectra the very low frequency energy outside the infragravity band i e outside the zero mode edge wave curves refers to the energy with relatively long alongshore length scales for both the cross shore and alongshore motions high infragravity energy regions at the reef edge and inner reef flat were also examined figs 12 and 13 show cross shore and alongshore velocity wavenumber frequency spectra at the inner reef flat alongshore transect at x 35 5 m and around the reef edge alongshore transect at x 31 0 m respectively similar to the result at the outer reef flat see fig 11 the spectra indicate that the cross shore velocity k y f spectrum is dominated by leaky waves and the alongshore velocity k y f spectrum is dominated by edge waves the cross shore velocity spectral energy distributes broader at the inner reef flat than that at the reef edge which has energy appearance on the high mode edge waves regions the comparison of alongshore k y f spectra at the inner reef flat and reef edge demonstrates that the energy distribution is broader at the low frequency band at the reef edge than that at the inner reef however present results reveal that edge waves are significant on the reef in contrast to the modeling result by van dongeren et al 2013 who found that cross shore progressive infragravity waves were the dominant wave motions at a fringing reef system ningaloo reef western australia significant energy with very low frequency f 0 05 hz lying outside the infragravity wave region i e outside the zero mode edge wave dispersion curves is present at three alongshore transects researchers have observed very low frequency energy on sandy beaches reniers et al 2007 macmahan et al 2004b and in reef environments cheriton et al 2016 péquignet et al 2014 the generation of the very low frequency waves is associated with shear instability in the alongshore current oltman shay et al 1989 and the rotational motion of the transient rip currents and vortices in the wave averaged current reniers et al 2004 4 discussion huntley et al 1981 concluded that low mode edge waves contribute significantly to the alongshore currents while high mode edge waves and leaky waves prevail in onshore offshore currents on sandy beaches rip currents have been observed at the node of edge wave holman and bowen 1984 the present wavenumber frequency spectral plots demonstrate that both edge waves and leaky waves are dominant on the reef therefore detailed maps of current flow pattern including cross shore and alongshore currents on the reef are worth illustrating fig 14 shows the modeled mean wave induced current field which is obtained by time averaging the computed fluid particle velocity of the last 620 s computation time the current pattern clearly reveals three significant circulation cells with spatial complexity of onshore offshore directed flow and alongshore flow the onshore currents concentrate at the central inner reef flat and then diverge as a pair of opposing circulation cells around the upcoast center x 35 0 m and y 9 5 m and downcoast center x 36 0 m and y 5 5 m significantly the length scale of both circulation cells is linked to the reef flat morphology which is approximately 4 0 m in width part of the offshore directed currents of both circulation cells merge into intense seaward currents in the region of the concave reef this current pattern namely rip current indicates that the water mass on the reef flat returns offshore through the deeper reef wave propagation encountering the concave fringing reef is analogous to the classic problem of wave transformation through a rip channel beach for example chen et al 1999 used the boussinesq model to simulate the rip currents on the beach characterized by deeper cross shore oriented rip channels incised in shallower shore connected shoals noticeably the rip currents flow obliquely and then form alongshore currents along the forereef in addition the alongshore currents are predominately from the downcoast meandering along the reef edge the alongshore currents are tied to the reef edge contour indicating that the reef currents are controlled by the reef topography because the incident waves do not obliquely propagate shoreward moreover part of the alongshore currents turn shoreward then generate a circulation cell at the outer reef x 31 5 m and y 9 5 m with 3 0 4 0 m length scale as the same as the previous circulation cells wave induced mean currents on the reef are highly dependent on wave transformation and dissipation including setup and setdown of the mean water level mass flux between wave crest and trough rip currents and infragravity motions özkan haller and kirby 1999 presented numerical studies indicating that the rip current is unstable resulting in oscillating rip currents and the alongshore movement of vortices associated with the rip current rip current oscillations result from alongshore non uniformities of incoming waves and topography for example breaking waves cause non uniformity of the radiation stresses in the alongshore direction and contribute to the complexity of the circulation pattern additionally temporal variation of wave groups would influence wave breaking and the corresponding circulations fig 8a shows high amplitude wave groups appearing within the present infragravity time scale wave periods greater than 2 0 s circulations with this time scale can not be presented in fig 14 because these short period fluctuations are smoothed out in the 620 s averaging time to illustrate the detailed circulation patterns in the infragravity period time fig 15 displays lagrangian current fields modeled at t 600 s t 605 s t 610 s and t 615 s over an infragravity wave period and their corresponding vorticity fields the current field is obtained by time averaging of the computed fluid particle velocity the vorticity is defined as 9 ζ v x u y where u v denote the modeled instantaneous velocity over three wave periods 3t p the numerical results show temporal and spatial variabilities in the rip current system like the mean wave induced currents fig 14 the alongshore currents meander along the forereef upward combined with strong rip currents at the concave reef interactions between the offshore directed rip currents and incident waves are likely to increase wave heights moving breaking points seaward furthermore wave refraction due to the underlying currents would cause spatial variation of radiation stresses in the alongshore direction and result in a complex circulation pattern chen et al 1999 these snapshots confirm that the alongshore currents as well as the rip currents have reached quasi steady state to view the long period infragravity motions fig 16 depicts the modeled mean infragravity wave currents the infragravity wave current velocities are obtained from the low band filtered f 0 5f p time series cross shore and alongshore velocities this model indicates that circulation eddies locate identically to the mean wave induced currents see fig 14 with two at the reef flat and one at the forereef the spatial scale of infragravity circulation cells is on the order of reef flat width additionally the path of meandering alongshore currents is coupled to the reef edge morphology this phenomenon indicates that the current pattern on the fringing reef is characteristic of an infragravity motion the nearly symmetric spectral energy at alongshore velocity wavenumber frequency spectra fig 11b fig 12b and fig 13b indicating that wave propagation upcoast and downcoast can be attributed to alongshore currents of the infragravity circulation eddies spatial variation of infragravity wave height is correlated with the current field for example the low infragravity wave heights at the central reef flat is a result of intense cross shore shoreward infragravity currents by the balance of momentum flux see fig 7 5 conclusions low frequency infragravity motions on a two dimensional fringing reef with a steepening landward face are investigated by using a nonlinear wave resolving boussinesq model funwave tvd the model simulations agree fairly well with the laboratory measurements including cross shore alongshore distributions of significant wave height wave setup and infragravity wave height the spatial and temporal variabilities of infragrgavity waves are studied by calculating the cross correlations between infragravity elevation and short wave envelops as well as the wavenumber frequency velocity spectra the cross correlations clearly reveal cross shore infragravity standing motions the cross shore wavenumber frequency velocity spectra demonstrate the dominance of leaky waves the alongshore wavenumber frequency velocity spectra indicate that edge waves are significant components of infragravity motions edge waves with high modes are dominant on the entire infragravity frequency band but edge waves with low modes are concentrated at very low frequencies upcoast and downcoast edge wave dispersion curves implied that waves propagate upward and downward on the reef the time averaged currents reveal circulation cells and rip currents on the reef system located at the reef flat and forereef alongshore currents in a meandering pattern couple to the underlying bathymetry under the incident shore normal waves indicative of the effects of reef morphology on wave and current characteristics additionally the study find that the length scale of infragravity circulation on the reef are on the order of reef flat width acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the ministry of science and technology of the republic of china taiwan for financially supporting this research

23554,this study investigates infragravity motions on a two dimensional fringing reef with a concave topography using a wave resolving nonlinear boussinesq wave model the effect of bathymetric nonlinearity on spatial variations of infragravity waves is studied from shore normal incident random waves the model is first verified from cross shore alongshore significant wave height wave setup and infragravity wave height measured in laboratory experiments the modeled velocity is further examined to elucidate the infragravity wave current field wavenumber frequency velocity spectra show that cross shore infragravity motions are controlled by the leaky waves while alongshore infragravity motions exhibit edge waves characteristics additionally high mode edge waves prevail on the entire infragravity frequency band while low mode edge waves are dominant at very low frequencies furthermore the model results illustrate the spatial and temporal variability of wave induced nearshore currents alongshore and cross shore flows accompanying with circulation cells and rip currents the infragavity wave current field is nearly identical to the mean current field and the circulations develop at the same spatial scale as the reef flat keywords infragravity waves edge waves circulation fringing reef 1 introduction infragravity waves are long period about 20 200 s water surface motions that govern nearshore energy on the beach comparable to the energy within short period swell and sea typically 4 20 s the long wave oscillations accompanied by short waves could enhance wave overtopping and run up at shores which results in inundation and shore erosion field measurements indicate that nearshore infragravity motions are a complex mixture of progressive long waves leaky waves and edge waves huntley et al 1981 oltman shay and guza 1987 leaky waves are generated by shore normal propagating long waves that reflect from the shore and then radiate seaward edge waves are trapped close to the shore by multiple reflections from the shoreline and offshore refraction which progress alongshore and have variance maxima at the shoreline and an exponentially decaying cross shore variance profile of nodes and antinodes while the length scales of leaky waves fit well with the cross shore spacing of nearshore bars spatial scales of edge waves are correlated to alongshore morphological features i e rhythmic and crescentic bar patterns consequently infragravity motions are believed to have an important effect on the cross shore and alongshore morphological development short waves dominate the ecological and geological development of reef environments such as the fate of sediments and pollutants organism distribution nutrient uptake overall productivity dispersal and recruitment of larvae however scientific research on reefs has recently became increasingly focused on long period infragravity waves numerous hydrodynamic studies on reefs have proposed that infragravity energy becomes dominant because most short waves break as they propagate over the shallow forereef or reef edge and continue to dissipate by bottom friction along the wide reef flat hardy and young 1996 lugo fernández et al 1998 brander et al 2004 samosorn and woodroffe 2008 additionally infragravity waves may play an important role in sediment transport on the reef flat pomeroy et al 2015 moreover sediment particles may be driven far away since long period infragravity oscillations can act as a sediment transport agent through advection similarly to quasi steady mean currents e g aagaard and greenwood 2008 therefore infragravity waves may have more prominent effect than short waves on sediment transport and nearshore morphological evolution in coral reef environments with the projected climate changes sea level rise and decrease in the frictional characteristics of the reef bottom may adversely affect the communities and resources in fringing reef linked coasts madin and connolly 2006 an important reason can be attributed to resonant amplification of infragravity waves on reefs which cause extensive reef coast inundation under energetic storm conditions péquignet et al 2009 strong infragravity energy would bring a serious natural hazard particularly for low lying reef islands for example in super typhoon haiyan strong coupling of long period infragravity waves and short period swell produced extreme runup which caused extensive inundation at coasts of the philippines shimozono et al 2015 therefore understanding infragravity wave hydrodynamics on reefs is important for emergency management land use planning hazard assessment and coastal protection a number of numerical models with laboratory experiments have been developed to explore the characteristics and generation of infragravity waves on fringing reefs ma et al 2014 nwogu and demirbilek 2010 su et al 2015 sheremet et al 2011 the infragravity energy over the reefs can reasonably be predicted from verified breaking and bottom friction parameters however these studies reduced reef platforms to a one dimensional cross shore profile which does not account for the two dimensional complexity of reef bathymetry and directional wave propagation behavior previous studies have proposed that alongshore non uniformities in sandy beaches would be important in view of the potential coupling between infragravity conditions and underlying bathymetry bowen and inman 1971 holman and bowen 1984 reniers et al 2006 in reality reef topography is more complex than beaches in both cross shore and alongshore directions although field measurements have been undertaken to investigate infragravity waves on the fringing reefs these observations gave little information about the alongshore variation of infragravity wave conditions because the measurements were restricted to the cross shore direction becker et al 2016 péquignet et al 2014 pomeroy et al 2012 reef morphology would promote wave refraction and diffraction which have an implication on the reef island formation mandlier and kench 2012 inhomogeneous infragravity field on reefs is expected winter et al 2017 proposed that highly variable rocky reef bathymetry might produce both cross shore and alongshore standing waves therefore the reef morphology was as important as offshore wave conditions to accurately characterize infragravity energy on reef systems cheriton et al 2016 van dongeren et al 2013 utilized the numerical model xbeach to investigate infragravity waves over the two dimensional 2 d fringing reef bottom friction coefficients for short waves and current infragravity waves in the model were assumed independent and had to be calibrated separately their model calculations revealed that leaky waves were dominant in the cross shore direction the primary aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics of infragravity waves on a 2 d spatial variable fringing reef bathymetry this question is addressing using a wave resolving nonlinear boussinesq model because the model can resolve each individual wave in shallow water and nonlinear wave wave interactions as well as wave current interaction chen et al 2003 the model was in good agreement with wave heights mean water level and infragravity waves by one dimensional prototype flume measurements for reefs su et al 2015 the present study is interested in infragravity field on a 2 d non uniform fringing reef because its topographic feature could complicate the wave and current fields comprehensive field experiments that involve measurements of two dimensional infragravity field in reef environments are limited therefore this investigation adopts laboratory measurements of waves on a reef in a wave basin conducted by the coastal and hydraulic laboratory u s army corps of engineers smith et al 2012 the work was initiated by the surge and wave island modeling studies program and performed extensive laboratory experiments to understand the wave hydrodynamics in reef systems as well as build databases for model verifications the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the laboratory experiments the numerical model and model setup section 3 presents the model verification in which it is compared with the laboratory observations and model results of velocity fields section 4 discuss the behaviours of spatial variations of infragravity velocity and current field finally section 5 concludes this study of the role of infragravity motions in the fringing reef 2 methodology 2 1 numerical modeling a fully nonlinear and dispersive wave model funwave tvd developed by shi et al 2012 is used to numerically simulate water surface height and velocities on the reef the model solves the fully nonlinear boussinesq equations using a hybrid finite volume finite difference scheme and incorporates a moving reference level the governing equations in funwave tvd are organized in a well balanced conservative form and are numerically solved using a high order shock capturing tvd scheme this improvement enables the model to simulate wave breaking and associated wave energy dissipation without relying on empirical formulations in addition the model employs a third order strong stability preserving runge kutta method for adaptive time stepping a robust wetting drying scheme captures the moving shoreline these improvements improve the robustness of the model in predicting nearshore wave processes including wave shoaling refraction diffraction breaking and wave run up as well as wave induced circulation and rip currents on the beaches shi et al 2012 in other words the model considers fully coupled wave and current interaction the mass conservation and horizontal momentum equations of governing equations are given by 1 η t h η u α u 2 0 2 u α t u α u α g η v 1 v 2 v 3 r s r f 0 where the subscript t denotes time differentiation x y is the horizontal gradient operator η is the free surface elevation h is the still water depth h is the velocity at a reference elevation z α 0 53 h 0 47 η u 2 is the depth averaged contribution to the horizontal velocity field which is given by 3 u 2 1 h η h η u 2 z d z z α 2 2 1 6 h 2 h η η 2 b z α 1 2 h η a u 2 represents the depth dependent correction of the velocity at o μ 2 μ h l where l is the wave length can be written as 4 u 2 z z α z a 1 2 z α 2 z 2 b where a h u α and b u α v 1 and v 2 are dispersive boussinesq terms v 3 accounts for the second order effect of the vertical vorticity r s represents the subgrid lateral turbulent mixing and r f is the bottom friction parameterized as a quadratic drag law 5 r f c d h η u α u α where c d represents the bottom friction coefficient the equation has been expressed in terms of u α instead of the velocity at the bottom to minimize the computation time therefore the value of c d in the model would be slightly different than those calibrated based on the bottom velocity with the conservative form the governing equations can be solved by using a local riemann solver a fourth order muscl tvd scheme yamamoto et al 1998 is employed to evaluate the fluxes at cell interfaces wave breaking is modeled by locally switching the boussinesq equations to the nonlinear shallow water equations when the froude number exceeds a certain threshold shi et al 2012 this approach was proven to be robust for describing wave breaking and associated wave energy dissipation the model is parallelized using the message passing interface mpi with non blocking communication 2 2 model setup the model was calibrated by using two dimensional wave basin laboratory measurements conducted under the surge and wave island modeling studies program smith et al 2012 which was designed to study wave breaking energy dissipation wave setup and runup over fringing reefs a fringing reef platform was built on a wave basin with length 51 8 m width 29 0 m and depth 1 5 m the fringing reef can be characterized as the forereef with compound slopes of 1 4 and 1 13 composed of a 7 30 m wide sloping 1 100 reef flat linking to a 1 10 beach slope the central part of the outer reef has a concave topography this topographic feature leads to alongshore variation at the reef edge and outer reef flat the acrylic glass was installed on the reef surface paint mixed with roughening agent was applied to the reef surface for the rough surface cases this study adopted the smooth surface case fig 1 depicts the reef bathymetry of the laboratory experiments thirteen wave gauges were installed both across and along the reef where seven wave gauges were positioned in the cross shore direction of the central reef and six wave gauges were deployed in the alongshore of the reef flat the cross shore and alongshore array reasonably captured the spatial characteristics of wave field fig 1 displays the locations of the wave gauges detailed descriptions of the laboratory experiments can be referred to smith et al 2012 although the experiments contained low mid and high water levels alongshore wave gauges were unable to record water surface elevation data owing to insufficient water depth at the low and mid water levels to ensure that all the wave gauges could be used in model calibration this study only adopted cases with high water level the numerical simulation applied exactly the same computational domain as the laboratory experiments namely 16 0 m in the cross shore direction 12 2 m in the alongshore direction the model domain was discretized into 400 300 computation grid cells by using a rectangular grid with 0 04 m resolution offshore waves were generated on the left side of the domain by using an internal wave maker a sponger layer 1 2 m with the thickness of 30 grids was placed along the left hand side boundary to absorb wave energy radiating from the beach and forereef to minimize the effects of the lateral boundaries periodic boundary conditions were set at the lateral boundaries the model was forced with normally incident random waves time series of free surface elevations follow a tma wave spectrum with a significant wave height h s of 0 1 m and a peak period t p of 0 99 s the model outputs include time series of free surface elevation and velocity components with a time interval of 0 05 s the model run time was 800 s and the last 620 s model outputs after reaching a quasi steady state were used for post processing analysis spectral analysis was performed on continuous records of 12400 samples 620 s using a 2048 point 102 4 s hanning window with 50 overlap providing 12 degrees of freedom and a frequency resolution of 0 0098 hz 3 model results 3 1 comparison with laboratory measurements su et al 2015 applied the funwave tvd model to study the one dimensional physical laboratory measurements in which the bathymetric profile was the cross shore section of the present 2d reef at y 7 5 m see fig 1 the bottom friction coefficient c d was found to be a key parameter determining the wave energy distribution over the reef and also needed to be calibrated on the present 2d reef the model was validated with varying values ranging between o 10 2 and o 100 which are spatially uniform over the reef the value of the coefficient was set within the empirical range based on previous studies for reef bottom roughness rosman and hench 2011 the model was calibrated with cross shore distributions of physical features including significant wave height wave setup and infragravity wave height to quantify model predictions a measure of model skill proposed by willmott 1982 is used 6 model skill 1 i 1 n x mod i x meas i 2 i 1 n x mod i x meas x meas i x meas 2 where x m e a s is the measured value x mod is the modeled value overbar is the average and n is the number of wave gauge used for the comparison fig 2 presents the model skills with different c d for three physical properties of waves overall model performance is fairly good average model skills for significant wave height wave setup and infragravity wave height are 0 98 0 90 and 0 73 respectively the significant wave height and wave setup are captured well by the model with c d 0 2 which is consistent with that in our pervious investigation su et al 2015 although the model skill for infragravity wave height is not as good the value of 0 72 is acceptable for model prediction the following sections present model results of c d 0 2 fig 3 shows comparisons of modeled and measured cross shore significant wave height wave setup and infragravity wave height the figure reveals that the cross shore variation of wave height was in excellent agreement with the measurements fig 3a wave height was almost constant on the seaward of the forereef indicating that shoaling was not obvious as waves approach the reef edge x 30 5 m the wave height apparently decreased and continued to decay with onshore propagation across the reef flat the model accurately captures the dissipative processes of wave breaking and bottom friction over the reef fig 3b presents model data comparison of wave setup the mean water surface level decline slightly in front of the reef edge and then rose towards the inner reef flat the trend of the mean water surface level was in good agreement with the measurements the most significant discrepancy between measurements and simulations was found around the breaking point i e around the reef edge fig 3c shows the model data comparison of infragravity wave height the measured data demonstrates an increase during shoaling on the forereef and nearly a constant on the reef flat notably the model overpredicted the infragravity wave height particularly within the reef flat the overprediction also occurred in 1d reef simulation by su et al 2015 fig 4 depicts model data comparisons of alongshore significant wave height wave setup and infragravity wave height the computed wave heights agree fairly well with the measurements fig 4a the alongshore distribution reveals that the wave height is higher at the central cross shore reef y 6 0 m than at the neighboring reef indicating that the alongshore variation of wave height is associated with changes in the alongshore water depth this finding can be attributed to the relatively deeper depth at the central cross shore reef which leads to breaking waves moving shoreward compared with other positions in the alongshore array fig 4b shows the computed wave setup the mean surface elevation is slightly lower at the central reef than in the neighboring zones the alongshore variation of wave setup tends to generate converging pressure gradients fig 4c compares the modeled and measured alongshore infragravity wave heights the smallest measured infragravity wave height was at the central reef while the smallest modeled value is located at the downcoast the model slightly overestimated most results at all wave gauges except w8 3 2 spatial and temporal behaviors of infragravity waves natural fringing reefs have spatial variations in morphology in both cross shore and alongshore directions therefore wave refraction would complicate the random wave fields fig 5 a illustrates a snapshot of the simulated water surface elevation at time t 610 s the wave crests are represented by the lighter blue areas the figure shows the long crested waves bend when they propagate over the central reef the oblique wave refraction pattern is mainly induced by the alongshore variation of reef topography fig 5b displays the spatial distribution of significant wave height the central outer reef flat is an area of relatively high wave height fig 6 illustrates the modeled wave setup for the entire domain significantly wave setup suggests spatial variations at the forereef and reef flat zones obviously the wave breaking is the cause of cross shore variation of radiation stresses that result in wave setdown before breaking and setup after breaking depression of mean water surface elevation occurs along the zone of reef edge x 30 0 m from which mean water surface elevation increases shoreward due to the concave reef topography varying breaking locations result in the alongshore gradient of the mean water surface elevation the highest wave setup appears near the shoreline around x 38 0 m and y 7 5 m the resultant pressure gradient is a dominant driving force for reef nearshore circulations as suggested by lowe et al 2010 fig 7 shows the modeled infragravity wave height for the whole domain two alongshore zones have energetic infragravity wave height namely the inner reef flat and the beach the maximum infragravity wave heights distribute along the shoreline which corresponds to the field observations in the high tide case péquignet et al 2009 significant infragravity waves distribute broadly on the reef flat and the largest appear at the inner reef flat x 36 0 37 0 m interestingly two peaks located at approximately at y 4 0 m and y 10 5 m this diagnostic is similar to two anti nodes of a standing wave motion in the alongshore direction however the exact wavelength cannot be determined with only one node mapped at the reef edge x 30 0 m infragravity waves were relatively higher at the up and down coast and lower around the central reef in contrast with the energetic ingrafravity energy zones low energy zones occurred at the outer reef flat x 30 0 31 5 m and the inner reef flat x 37 5 m especially at the concave reef x 31 0 m and y 5 0 m these zones denote the node structure of cross shore infragravity motions wave groups composed of individual wave components have temporal variability in wave envelope modulations of wave groups on the time scale commonly discussed in the literature are associated with infragravity motions fig 8 a presents computed modulated wave envelope energy as a function of time at the central cross shore transect the wave envelope was obtained by the hilbert transform of water surface elevation time series the space time wave energy modulation shows a sequence of wave groups with different energy in the time domain the modulation declines significantly once the wave envelope propagates over the reef edge indicating that wave envelope is destroyed by wave breaking wave groups accompanying higher waves break at the reef edge would generate free infragravity waves by the time varying breakpoint symonds et al 1982 fig 8b displays the temporal variation of infragravity surface elevation at the central cross shore transect the infragravity surface elevation was obtained by the low pass filtering f 0 5f p of time series water surface elevation combinations of incident long waves sloping upward in the positive x direction and reflected long waves sloping upward in the negative x direction result in spatial and temporal variations of infragravity motions the incident long waves are dominant on the forereef as shown by the clearly upward sloping contours wave caustics are exhibited over the reef flat this feature is typically caused by standing waves comprising of an incident bound long wave a free long wave and a reflected free long wave fig 9 presents the contour plot of cross correlations between infragravity elevation at cross shore locations and short wave envelope at the offshore wave gauge w1 for three cross shore transects at y 1 5 m 6 0 m and 10 5 m this plot shows that a strong negative correlation extends from offshore to the middle reef flat consistent with previous reef studies su et al 2015 pomeroy et al 2012 van dongeren et al 2013 this feature is in agreement with the theoretical prediction of bound long waves accompanying the short wave groups longuet higgins and stewart 1962 moving further shoreward the negative correlation gradually decreases to nearly zero around the middle reef flat x 35 0 m the correlation considerably diminishes close to the shore because wave breaking apparently destroys the formation of the short wave envelope within the reef flat short wave breaking reduces the amplitude of bound long waves longuet higgins and stewart 1962 additionally a strong positive correlation develops prior to the negative correlation from the forereef to the shore this phenomenon occurs because the infragravity waves are generated by the time varying breaking forcing symonds et al 1982 which is consistent with the findings in previous studies su et al 2015 pomeroy et al 2012 van dongeren et al 2013 distinct from the previous studies this study shows a significant positive correlation lagging the negative correlation from offshore which has not been proposed in the previous reef observations and simulations this feature is possible owing to free long waves generated in the neighboring reef the detailed standing wave pattern is shown using an alternative approach with wave velocity fig 10 illustrates the contour plots of the cross correlations of the infragravity wave velocity and elevation at the same location for three cross shore transects y 1 5 m 6 0 m and 10 5 m the infragravity wave velocity is obtained from the low pass filtered f 0 5f p time series cross shore velocity a strong positive correlation is observed from offshore extending to the beach and the maximum occurs around the reef edge the seaward correlations have a strong positive correlation lagging from the beach and a strong negative correlation beyond the beach this symmetric correlation pattern indicates that a standing infragravity wave is generated on the reef flat this behavior is similar to previous observations for rip channel beach macmahan et al 2004a chen et al 1999 all three cross shore transects have this feature above analyses illustrate the cross shore infragravity elevation and velocity motions the alongshore velocity field was then investigated to identify edge wave motions if the wave field is homogeneous in the alongshore direction and stationary in time during the measurement period then the characteristics of edge waves can be described using a two dimensional energy spectrum which gives the wave energy as a function of both frequency and wavenumber on a plane beach linear shallow water theory predicts the edge wave dispersion relation given by huntley et al 1981 7 f 2 g k y 2 π 2 n 1 m where f is the frequency g is gravity n is the edge wave mode number m is the beach slope and k y is the alongshore wavenumber defined as 1 l y where l y denotes the alongshore wavelength leaky waves occupy a continuum of smaller alongshore wavenumbers in the range 8 2 π f 2 g k y 2 π f 2 g a previous study showed that the existence of a broad banded edge wave field on open coastal beaches and edge waves and leaky waves would coexist at a certain frequency oltman shay and guza 1987 as mentioned above fig 7 presents the infragravity energy distribution along the reef to find the alongshore infragravity motions the wave characteristics can be examined by using the edge wave dispersion relation fig 11 shows the cross shore and alongshore velocity wavenumber frequency k y f spectra estimated with the modeled cross shore and alongshore velocity time series at the outer reef flat alongshore transect at x 32 5 m analytical dispersion relation solutions for the leaky waves eq 8 and edge waves eq 7 with four lowest modes n 0 1 2 and 3 are drawn the distribution of spectral energy at positive and negative wavenumbers represents waves moving downward and upward most infragravity energy in the cross shore velocity k y f spectrum is clustered within the leaky wave mode region indicating that the leaky waves are dominant fig 11a the low energy around f 0 21 hz is associated with the nodal structure of the cross shore standing infragravity waves the alongshore velocity k y f spectrum displays the energy distribution outside the bounds of the leaky wave region fig 11b i e the presence of edge waves additionally the energy at lower frequency band f 0 2 hz fits the dispersion curves and the energy at higher frequency band f 0 2 hz distributes in the higher mode edge wave region n 3 although the incident waves are shore normal alongshore infragravity waves are generated additionally significant energy below the frequency 0 05 hz with k y 0 7 was observed in both cross shore and alongshore velocity k y f spectra the very low frequency energy outside the infragravity band i e outside the zero mode edge wave curves refers to the energy with relatively long alongshore length scales for both the cross shore and alongshore motions high infragravity energy regions at the reef edge and inner reef flat were also examined figs 12 and 13 show cross shore and alongshore velocity wavenumber frequency spectra at the inner reef flat alongshore transect at x 35 5 m and around the reef edge alongshore transect at x 31 0 m respectively similar to the result at the outer reef flat see fig 11 the spectra indicate that the cross shore velocity k y f spectrum is dominated by leaky waves and the alongshore velocity k y f spectrum is dominated by edge waves the cross shore velocity spectral energy distributes broader at the inner reef flat than that at the reef edge which has energy appearance on the high mode edge waves regions the comparison of alongshore k y f spectra at the inner reef flat and reef edge demonstrates that the energy distribution is broader at the low frequency band at the reef edge than that at the inner reef however present results reveal that edge waves are significant on the reef in contrast to the modeling result by van dongeren et al 2013 who found that cross shore progressive infragravity waves were the dominant wave motions at a fringing reef system ningaloo reef western australia significant energy with very low frequency f 0 05 hz lying outside the infragravity wave region i e outside the zero mode edge wave dispersion curves is present at three alongshore transects researchers have observed very low frequency energy on sandy beaches reniers et al 2007 macmahan et al 2004b and in reef environments cheriton et al 2016 péquignet et al 2014 the generation of the very low frequency waves is associated with shear instability in the alongshore current oltman shay et al 1989 and the rotational motion of the transient rip currents and vortices in the wave averaged current reniers et al 2004 4 discussion huntley et al 1981 concluded that low mode edge waves contribute significantly to the alongshore currents while high mode edge waves and leaky waves prevail in onshore offshore currents on sandy beaches rip currents have been observed at the node of edge wave holman and bowen 1984 the present wavenumber frequency spectral plots demonstrate that both edge waves and leaky waves are dominant on the reef therefore detailed maps of current flow pattern including cross shore and alongshore currents on the reef are worth illustrating fig 14 shows the modeled mean wave induced current field which is obtained by time averaging the computed fluid particle velocity of the last 620 s computation time the current pattern clearly reveals three significant circulation cells with spatial complexity of onshore offshore directed flow and alongshore flow the onshore currents concentrate at the central inner reef flat and then diverge as a pair of opposing circulation cells around the upcoast center x 35 0 m and y 9 5 m and downcoast center x 36 0 m and y 5 5 m significantly the length scale of both circulation cells is linked to the reef flat morphology which is approximately 4 0 m in width part of the offshore directed currents of both circulation cells merge into intense seaward currents in the region of the concave reef this current pattern namely rip current indicates that the water mass on the reef flat returns offshore through the deeper reef wave propagation encountering the concave fringing reef is analogous to the classic problem of wave transformation through a rip channel beach for example chen et al 1999 used the boussinesq model to simulate the rip currents on the beach characterized by deeper cross shore oriented rip channels incised in shallower shore connected shoals noticeably the rip currents flow obliquely and then form alongshore currents along the forereef in addition the alongshore currents are predominately from the downcoast meandering along the reef edge the alongshore currents are tied to the reef edge contour indicating that the reef currents are controlled by the reef topography because the incident waves do not obliquely propagate shoreward moreover part of the alongshore currents turn shoreward then generate a circulation cell at the outer reef x 31 5 m and y 9 5 m with 3 0 4 0 m length scale as the same as the previous circulation cells wave induced mean currents on the reef are highly dependent on wave transformation and dissipation including setup and setdown of the mean water level mass flux between wave crest and trough rip currents and infragravity motions özkan haller and kirby 1999 presented numerical studies indicating that the rip current is unstable resulting in oscillating rip currents and the alongshore movement of vortices associated with the rip current rip current oscillations result from alongshore non uniformities of incoming waves and topography for example breaking waves cause non uniformity of the radiation stresses in the alongshore direction and contribute to the complexity of the circulation pattern additionally temporal variation of wave groups would influence wave breaking and the corresponding circulations fig 8a shows high amplitude wave groups appearing within the present infragravity time scale wave periods greater than 2 0 s circulations with this time scale can not be presented in fig 14 because these short period fluctuations are smoothed out in the 620 s averaging time to illustrate the detailed circulation patterns in the infragravity period time fig 15 displays lagrangian current fields modeled at t 600 s t 605 s t 610 s and t 615 s over an infragravity wave period and their corresponding vorticity fields the current field is obtained by time averaging of the computed fluid particle velocity the vorticity is defined as 9 ζ v x u y where u v denote the modeled instantaneous velocity over three wave periods 3t p the numerical results show temporal and spatial variabilities in the rip current system like the mean wave induced currents fig 14 the alongshore currents meander along the forereef upward combined with strong rip currents at the concave reef interactions between the offshore directed rip currents and incident waves are likely to increase wave heights moving breaking points seaward furthermore wave refraction due to the underlying currents would cause spatial variation of radiation stresses in the alongshore direction and result in a complex circulation pattern chen et al 1999 these snapshots confirm that the alongshore currents as well as the rip currents have reached quasi steady state to view the long period infragravity motions fig 16 depicts the modeled mean infragravity wave currents the infragravity wave current velocities are obtained from the low band filtered f 0 5f p time series cross shore and alongshore velocities this model indicates that circulation eddies locate identically to the mean wave induced currents see fig 14 with two at the reef flat and one at the forereef the spatial scale of infragravity circulation cells is on the order of reef flat width additionally the path of meandering alongshore currents is coupled to the reef edge morphology this phenomenon indicates that the current pattern on the fringing reef is characteristic of an infragravity motion the nearly symmetric spectral energy at alongshore velocity wavenumber frequency spectra fig 11b fig 12b and fig 13b indicating that wave propagation upcoast and downcoast can be attributed to alongshore currents of the infragravity circulation eddies spatial variation of infragravity wave height is correlated with the current field for example the low infragravity wave heights at the central reef flat is a result of intense cross shore shoreward infragravity currents by the balance of momentum flux see fig 7 5 conclusions low frequency infragravity motions on a two dimensional fringing reef with a steepening landward face are investigated by using a nonlinear wave resolving boussinesq model funwave tvd the model simulations agree fairly well with the laboratory measurements including cross shore alongshore distributions of significant wave height wave setup and infragravity wave height the spatial and temporal variabilities of infragrgavity waves are studied by calculating the cross correlations between infragravity elevation and short wave envelops as well as the wavenumber frequency velocity spectra the cross correlations clearly reveal cross shore infragravity standing motions the cross shore wavenumber frequency velocity spectra demonstrate the dominance of leaky waves the alongshore wavenumber frequency velocity spectra indicate that edge waves are significant components of infragravity motions edge waves with high modes are dominant on the entire infragravity frequency band but edge waves with low modes are concentrated at very low frequencies upcoast and downcoast edge wave dispersion curves implied that waves propagate upward and downward on the reef the time averaged currents reveal circulation cells and rip currents on the reef system located at the reef flat and forereef alongshore currents in a meandering pattern couple to the underlying bathymetry under the incident shore normal waves indicative of the effects of reef morphology on wave and current characteristics additionally the study find that the length scale of infragravity circulation on the reef are on the order of reef flat width acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the ministry of science and technology of the republic of china taiwan for financially supporting this research
