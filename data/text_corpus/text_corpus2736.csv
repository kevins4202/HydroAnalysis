13680,this work investigated cr vi adsorption onto pristine and iron modified hydrochar psh and psh fe15 respectively which were generated from paper waste sludge the results indicate that the hydrothermal carbonization temperature of 200 c was the most suitable for hydrochar production the batch experiments and the adsorption isotherm and kinetic of cr vi onto psh and psh fe15 were conducted and used to elucidate the adsorption mechanisms the results demonstrate that the cr vi adsorption capacity and efficiency onto both psh and psh fe15 reached equilibrium after 120 min at ph 3 and an initial cr vi concentration of 60 mg l in this condition the adsorption capacities were 5 94 mg g and 8 67 mg g and the removal efficiencies were 39 62 and 57 80 for psh and psh fe15 respectively the adsorption processes were well described by the sips and redlich peterson isotherm models with r2 of 0 9895 0 9987 and 0 9947 and 0 9981 for psh and psh fe15 respectively and pseudo second order kinetic model with r2 of 0 98412 and 0 99681 respectively for psh and psh fe15 the analysis of characteristics of psh and psh fe15 indicates the rough and heterogamous surface structures moreover there was presence of iron ions on psh fe15 based on eds analysis and appearance of oxygen containing surface functional groups recorded through ftir results finally it was observed that the reduction of cr vi to cr iii caused by iron ions on psm fe15 s surface and the presence of oh groups resulting in the precipitation of cr oh 3 on the hydrochar s surface was the main mechanism of cr vi adsorption onto psh fe15 keywords adsorption cr vi hydrochar iron paper waste sludge 1 introduction human beings life is now threatened by water pollution resulted from unmanaged heavy metals contamination 1 in water and wastewater medium chromium exists in two oxidation states cr iii and cr vi however the cr vi is recorded to be 100 times as poisonous as cr iii because of its high solubility and mobility in water 2 3 the hexavalent chromium cr vi is a strong oxidizing agent with a high toxicity causing dangerous potential health risks such as cancer due to its easily penetration into cell membranes hence the united states environmental protection agency set up the chromate allowable maximum concentration in drinking water at 0 05 mg l and 0 10 mg l in fresh water chemical compounds of chromium are the source of highly hazardous contaminants which were released into receiving water bodies from a range wide of industries including shoes textile dyeing electroplating tanning mining fertilizer and timber storage 4 therefore it is necessary to remove cr vi from these industrial effluents to reach the national standard or lower levels before discharging into the environment 5 in reported literatures there are several potential approaches for cr vi treatment from industrial wastewater effluents such as ion exchange chemical coagulation solvent extraction electrochemical degassing reverse osmosis anion exchange and adsorption 6 9 among aforementioned methods adsorption is the most popular method for removal cr vi thanks to its high efficiency simple design low operation cost and generated sludge feasible separation of various pollutants from water medium 10 11 nowadays the trend of utilization solid wastes to fabricate adsorption materials for treatment of contaminants has widely been studied by scholars among these solid wastes the carbon constituted materials such as fertilizer waste 12 rice husk 12 13 ocimum americanum 14 industrial waste olive oil 2 roots of eichhornia crassipes 15 peanut shells 16 distilled mud 17 walnut shell 18 activated carbon based on active mud adas 19 paper mill sludge 20 were recently reported to be highly effective adsorbents in extracting cr vi from water and wastewater despite possessing the high cr vi adsorption capacity but costly fabrication due to their excellent carbonization temperature leaded to limitation in their practical applications in recent years hydrochar has emerged as a novel adsorbent for removal of various pollutants from water and wastewater thanks to its simple fabrication at low temperature 150 350 c 21 large number of oxygen containing groups on surface and effective adsorption thus the hydrochar can be applied as potential alternative adsorbent for removal of trace metals from water medium pb2 cd2 and cu2 22 the hydrochar has produced from various materials mainly from biomass with different cellulose hemicellulose and lignin ratios comprising the sawdust applied to enhance the pb ii adsorption from water 23 sucrose and starch 24 coconut shell based hydrochars 25 banana peels 25 lawn grass containing high cellulose hemicellulose contents 26 cellulose carbon 24 sewage sludge to clean solid fuel 27 lignin cellulose d xylose and wood meal 28 hydrochar prepared from prosopis africana shell for removal of pb2 and cd2 22 nonetheless the pristine hydrochar possesses a low amount of surface functional groups non porous material and low surface area 29 30 resulting in a low removal efficiency of pollutants hence it is necessary to modify hydrochar by various methods to enhance adsorption capacity towards contaminants after modifying specific surface area pore size of hydrochar can be improved remarkably besides the modified hydrochar has a noticeably growth in oxygen containing surface functional groups and a drop in aromatic groups 31 32 for instance cymbopogon schoenanthus l spreng hydrochar was modified by h2o2 to remove copper from aqueous solution 33 hydrochar derived from peanut hull modified by h2o2 enhanced removal of pb2 with a adsorption capacity higher 20 times in comparison with pristine hydrochar 22 82 mg g compared with 0 88 mg g 34 although there have recently been a large number of studies about fabrication of hydrochar from various carbon containing materials but thus far there is no study using paper waste sludge from primary settling tank to produce hydrochar and modify the obtained pristine hydrochar by iron iii chloride for cr vi removal from aqueous solution despite its potentials besides there has been an increasing concern in the paper industry owing to a huge amount of solid waste discharged during production process which then turned into waste sludge and collected in the primary settling tank in the wastewater treatment plant this sludge has been treated by various methods such as land filling fertilization and combustion however these treatment methods are costly and limited in terms of land and air pollution therefore the utilization of the paper waste sludge for production of adsorbent to treat cr vi in wastewater should be considered an alternative solution to solve both solid waste management problem and wastewater treatment the aim of this study therefore was to develop a novel hydrochar produced from paper waste sludge by hydrothermal carbonization with the support of naoh solution the pristine hydrochar was then modified by iron iii chloride to enhance the adsorption capacity and efficiency of cr vi cr vi adsorption capacities of both pristine and iron modified hydrochars were investigated using batch experiments several parameters that play important roles in adsorption processes of cr vi onto hydrochars were also evaluated including hydrothermal carbonization temperatures solution ph contact time and initial cr vi concentration the adsorption isothermal and kinetic as well as mechanism of cr vi onto hydrochars have also been investigated and discussed by quantitative results and multiple characterizations of hydrochars 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the artificial wastewater containing cr vi at various concentrations was prepared from potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 by diluting of a stock cr vi solution with a initial concentration of 100 mg l with distilled water all chemicals used in this study consisting of potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 sulphuric acid sodium hydroxide and ferrous chloric fecl3 6h2o were purchased from sigma aldrich all chemicals were analytical grade 2 2 iron modified hydrochar derived from paper waste sludge 2 2 1 preparation of hydrochar paper waste sludge which was discharged with a rate of 300 kg day was the main material in this study the paper waste sludge was collected from the primary settling tank in wastewater treatment plant of hoang van thu paper joint stock company located in thai nguyen city thai nguyen province vietnam in order to reuse sludge for production of hydrochar the sludge was dried under sunlight for 2 days afterward a hydrothermal carbonization process of dried paper sludge was implemented in a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave according to procedure as follows at the beginning of process 10 g of dried sludge was mixed with 40 ml of naoh 0 25 m this mixture then was baked in an electric furnace at various temperature in ranges from 200 250 c during 24 h to assess the influence of hydrothermal carbonization temperature onto production of psh for adsorption of cr vi from aqueous solution the obtained paper waste sludge hydrochar was then stabilized at the ambient temperature in the next step the obtained hydrochar was filtered to remove the residues from the mixture of paper waste sludge hydrochar following that the filtered hydrochar was washed by deionized water to continuously discard residual materials before was dried at 105 c in 2 h finally the post dried hydrochar was sieved so as to obtain hydrochar particles with the size of 0 5 mm in diameter the pristine hydrochar was stored in the plastic bags and labelled as psh the psh was used for next adsorption experiments of cr vi 2 2 2 preparation of iron modified hydrochar the above achieved pristine hydrochar was continuously modified with iron iii chloride with the purpose of growing adsorption capacity of cr vi from aqueous solution in order to reach this objective psh was impregnated in fe3 solution the first step involved modifying psh 3 g of the pristine sludge hydrochar psh was put into a heat resistant triangle flask containing 10 ml fecl3 6h2o with a certainly content the ratios of iron psh were 5 10 15 and 20 w w the containers were then sealed and agitated for 4 h by an air stirrer operating at 80 c as soon as the procedure finished the obtained mixtures were cooled until room temperature before being filtered to separate the solid phase from liquid phase the obtained solid phase containing mixture of psh and iron was then washed with distilled water to make sure that all residual iron ions were discarded and the left of mixture was the iron modified hydrochar labelled as psh fe subsequently the psh fe was dried at 70 c in 12 h or overnight in a drying cabinet finally the obtained dried modified hydrochars psh fe were preserved in plastic bags and were labelled as psh fe psh fe5 psh fe10 psh fe15 psh fe20 for upcoming cr vi adsorption experiments 2 3 characteristics analysis of hydrochar the attributes of psh and psh fe before and after adsorption of cr vi from aqueous solution were evaluated by the brunauer emmett teller method bet bet builder ssa 4300 scanning electron microscopic sem images using an energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy machine hitachi s 4800 and x ray diffraction xrd and fourier transform infrared ftir using a spectroscopy machine ft ir 6300 operating at 4000 500 cm 1 wavelength while the point of zero charge phpzc was determined by the shift method zhao et al 2016 2 4 batch adsorption experiments batch experiments were employed to examine the effects of hydrothermal carbonization temperature on hydrochar fabrication impregnation ratios of mixture of iron psh on cr vi adsorption onto psh and solution ph contact time and initial cr vi concentration on adsorption of cr vi onto pristine and modified hydrochars the aim of these experiments was to find out optimal conditions for adsorption of cr vi onto hydrochar and to study dynamic of adsorption process the influence of hydrothermal carbonization temperature on hydrochar fabrication was conducted at the experimental conditions using triangle flask of 50 ml containing 25 ml of an initial cr vi concentration of 30 mg l and a psh dosage of 0 1 g which was produced at the various hydrothermal carbonization temperatures of 200 225 and 250 c at solution ph of 6 5 the flasks were then shaken at 120 rpm for 30 min for investigation the effect of impregnation ratios of mixture of iron psh on cr vi adsorption onto psh to find out the optimal modification ratio for fabrication of modified hydrochar the various impregnation ratios of fe ions and paper sludge hydrochar were 0 5 10 15 20 w w other experimental conditions included the initial cr vi concentration of 30 mg l contact time of 60 min and a shaking speed of 120 rpm under the initial ph condition of 6 5 the obtained iron modified paper waste sludge hydrochars were labeled as psh psh fe5 psh fe10 psh fe15 and psh fe20 the effects of solution ph 3 0 9 0 at initial cr vi of 30 mg l adsorbent dosage of 2 g l and contact time of 60 min contact time 5 0 240 0 min for 2 g l of adsorbent dosage initial cr vi of 30 mg l and the above determined most suitable ph value and initial cr vi concentrations 10 80 mg l for 2 g l of adsorbent dosage at the above determined most suitable ph and contact time on cr vi adsorption onto psh and psh fe were performed in 50 ml erlenmeyer flasks each flask contained 25 ml of a cr vi solution at certainly concentrations and 2 g l of hydrochar dosage these flasks were then agitated at 120 rpm using an agitator ph 4a china at the room temperature 25 2 c the ph values were adjusted by adding 0 1 m hydrosulfate acid or sodium hydroxide the samples containing cr vi were taken out from flasks at interval time and were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane to separate absorbent from solution the residual cr vi concentrations in the filtrates were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes model ultima expert horiba france the adsorption capacity of cr vi onto hydrochar was computed using two equations as follows 1 q t c o c t v m 2 q e c o c e v m where c0 ct and ce mg l are concentrations of cr vi at the beginning time any time t and equilibrium respectively v l is the volume of solution and m g is the weight of the hydrochar the qt and qe are denoted the cr vi amount adsorbed onto absorbent at any time t and at equilibrium mg g all experiments were triplicated 2 5 desorption experiment the reusability of the iron modified paper waste sludge hydrochar after adsorption of cr vi was studied by the regeneration of active sites on psh fe15 firstly the psh fe15 after cr vi adsorption was separated from supernatant using 0 45 μm filtration membrane in the next step the amount of 2 0 g of the psh fe15 was mixed with 25 ml naoh 1 m in erlenmeyer flasks and shaken at 120 rpm at 30 c during 24 h the mixture was then filtrated and obtained psh fe15 was dried at 80 c under vacuum condition before used to evaluate of its reusability for cr vi adsorption five adsorption desorption cycles were performed in this experiment 2 6 adsorption isotherm and kinetic the isothermal analysis of cr vi adsorption onto psh and psh fe was evaluated through four models of langmuir freundlich sips and redlich peterson theoretically the langmuir model describes monolayer adsorption 35 whereas the freundlich isotherm model provides multilayer adsorption and the sips isotherm is the combination of both freundlich and langmuir isothermal models 36 37 the redlich peterson r p isotherm model suggested a three parameter adsorption isotherm equation and when α value in the r p equation equals 1 its form is the same as the langmuir equation and becomes similar with freundlich isotherm as the α value closes to 0 38 the following eqs 3 4 5 and 6 are applied to compute the parameters of the langmuir freundlich sips and redlich peterson isotherm models respectively 3 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 4 q e k f c e 1 n 5 q e q

illustrates the clearly effect of the hydrothermal carbonization temperature hct on fabrication of psh for cr vi adsorption from aqueous solution what stands out from data in fig 1 is that at the hydrothermal carbonization temperature of 200 c the cr vi adsorption capacity of psh was 4 60 mg g corresponding with a cr vi removal efficiency reached 30 72 the cr vi adsorption capacity onto psh decreased when increasing the reaction temperature which made the efficiency of adsorbent produced at 200 c the highest one more specifically a growth of hct by 25 c triggered a drop in adsorption capacity and efficiency of cr vi onto psh respectively by 0 76 mg g and 5 13 the last record was at 250 c when the adsorption capacity of psh plummeted to the lowest value of 2 13 mg g consequently the recorded efficiency was only 14 21 the results can be explained that when hydrothermal carbonization temperature went up the nitrogen n and sulfur s constituents containing in the paper waste sludge pws were easily converted into nox and sox resulting in a drop in n s in pws 39 40 moreover a problem involving in the rise of htc causing the loss of solid mass occurred owing to the effect of water in the hydrolysis reaction 40 an another reason to explain for these results was that hemicellulose and lignin could be completely hydrolyzed at the reaction temperature of 180 200 c while cellulose at more than 220 c would possibly be over oxidized 41 but the main constituents of paper waste sludge are hemicellulose and lignin 20 thus the most suitable hydrothermal carbonization temperature for generation of pristine hydrochar derived from paper waste sludge was 200 c this hydrothermal carbonization temperature was then used for follow up production of paper sludge hydrochar to conduct the further experiments the result was well consistent with the findings of gorzin and abadi 2018 20 with the most suitable htc for paper sludge derived hydrochar production was 210 c and jaruwat et al 2018 40 for hydrochar production from cattail leaves with optimal htc was 200 c 3 2 effect of impregnation ratio on cr vi adsorption to improve cr vi adsorption onto hydrochar the pristine hydrochar psh was modified by iron ions fe3 at various impregnation ratios of fe3 psh the results are depicted in fig 2 as can be seen from fig 2 with each impregnation ratio the adsorption capacity of iron modified paper waste sludge hydrochar for cr vi varied distinctly more importantly in every recorded time the more fe3 ions were attached into psh the higher adsorption capacity and efficiency of cr vi onto absorbent attained from the data in fig 2 it is clear that the cr vi adsorption capacity and efficiency onto sole psh was the lowest overall what stands out from data in fig 2 is that there were remarkably upward trends in the adsorption capacity of cr vi onto hydrochar when the impregnation ratio between iron and psh went up from 5 to 20 over the 100 min of contact time period between 0 and 100 min the growth in terms of adsorption capacity was significant when psh was impregnated with 5 and 10 of fe which resulted in correspondingly higher cr vi removal efficiencies however the adsorption capacity was sharply accelerated for modified psh with the impregnation ratio of 15 the adsorption capacity of cr vi onto adsorbent continued grow when the impregnation ratio went up to 20 but the growth rate was inconsiderable compared to the different impregnation ratios among psh fe5 psh fe10 and psh fe15 notably the adsorption capacity of psh fe20 was even recorded to be lower than that of psh fe15 after 60 min of adsorption time specifically after 60 min of contact time the adsorption capacity of psh fe15 was 5 56 mg g corresponding to the cr vi removal efficiency of 74 08 while the adsorption capacity of psh fe20 was only 5 53 mg g resulting in a proportional fall by 0 33 in terms of cr vi removal efficiency in co operation with cost benefit analysis this result offered a crucial meaning for determining the most appropriate impregnation ratio of fe and psh for cr vi adsorption the reasons which can be explained for the growth in adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of cr vi onto iron modified paper waste sludge hydrochar was due to the presence of iron oxides in the psh fe s surface corresponding to the sphere complex form of cr vi 42 and affinity of cl anions towards hcro4 cro4 2 and cr2o7 2 anions 43 nonetheless the adsorption capacity of cr vi onto modified hydrochar had the insignificantly rise when increasing the impregnation ratio to 20 of iron this was because of the saturation in the active sites on psh fe20 s surface causing cr vi ions could not attach onto the adsorbent surface 44 therefore it was evident that 15 of fe should be the most suitable impregnation ratio for modifying psh and the psh fe15 would be used to perform further investigation experiments 3 3 effect of ph in order to assess the effect of solution ph on the adsorption of cr vi from aqueous solution experiments were carried out with psh and psh fe15 as adsorbents and a range of ph from 3 to 9 other experimental conditions included the contact time of 60 min and shaking speed of 120 rpm the sample was put in a 50 ml triangular flask containing 25 ml of solution cr vi with a concentration of 30 mg l and 0 2 g l dosage of each psh or psh fe15 the solution ph was one of the most important parameters which profound affected on the cr vi adsorption capacity and efficiency onto adsorbent on account of its effects on adsorbent s surface charge and chromium ions existing status in solution leading to differences in adsorption process of cr vi at various ph values the study results about the influence of solution ph on cr vi adsorption onto the both pristine hydrochar psh and iron modified hydrochar psh fe15 are illustrated in fig 3 from fig 3 it is clear that as ph value increased both employed adsorbents shared a similar drop tendency in interaction between adsorbent particles and chromium irons particularly the adsorption capacity of both psh and psh fe15 was maximum at solution ph of 3 in general the cr vi adsorption capacity and efficiency onto both hydrochars witnessed a gradual drop when the ph rose despite possessing the similar trend in decrease of cr vi adsorption capacity and efficiency when solution ph increased but it is obvious that psh fe 15 had a much higher adsorption efficiency than that of psh regarding specific data provided by fig 3 at ph equal to 3 the cr vi adsorption capacities onto psh fe15 and psh were 6 24 mg g and 2 98 mg g equivalent with the cr vi removal efficiencies of 83 17 and 39 75 respectively after having dropped by a continual growth in terms of ph the adsorption capacities of psh and psh fe15 achieved only 1 13 mg g and 4 27 mg g respectively at ph of 9 the increase of ph value resulted in a total drop by 24 72 and 26 25 for the removal efficiencies of psh and psh fe15 respectively compared to those at ph 3 it can be explained that most cr vi ions exist in the forms of hcro4 cro4 2 or cr2o7 2 which depend on solution ph initial cr vi concentrations and redox potential 45 the major species of cr vi were hcro4 and cr2o7 2 under the acidic condition with ph between 1 0 and 4 0 44 in this condition the number of h ions surrounded the surface of psh and psh fe15 dominated leading promotion of electrostatic attraction between adsorbent surface s positive charges and chromium anions in solution therefore the high adsorption capacities of psh and psh fe15 for cr vi were obtained at low ph in contrast the surface of psh and psh fe15 was negatively charged and the oh dominated in the high solution ph hence the adsorption capacities of psh and psh fe15 decreased when increasing solution ph values as a result it is possible to conclude that 3 is the most effective ph value for the cr vi adsorption onto psh based adsorbents the analogous results were reported by akram et al 2017 46 for adsorption of cr vi onto biocomposite hoang et al 2019 44 for cr vi removal using magnetic modified biochar derived from raw corncob shi et al 2018a 38 for cr vi adsorption using biochar modified by fe3o4 sio2 nh2 particles 3 4 effect of contact time the fig 4 illustrates data about the adsorption capacity and efficiency of cr vi onto psh and psh fe15 over a 240 min period of contact time between 0 and 240 min what stands out from data in fig 4 is that there was a dramatic rise in initial 30 min period and a steady upward trend from 30 min onwards of adsorption process in cr vi adsorption capacity and efficiency for both psh and psh fe15 the adsorption rate was gradually dropped and reached equilibrium at 120 min of reaction time for both psh and psh fe15 towards cr vi adsorption onto psh the equilibrium adsorption capacity and efficiency respectively achieved 3 76 mg g and 50 17 whereas the equilibrium adsorption capacity and efficiency of cr vi onto psh fe15 were 5 68 mg g and 75 67 respectively the adsorption capacity and efficiency decreased afterwards when contact time exceeded 120 min this is because the availability of active sites on the adsorbent s surface were almost depleted in the initial period the active sites were fully available leading to 100 interactions between chromium ions and adsorbent particles were achieved 47 while the number of available active sites droped in the next period afterwards equilibrium point triggering less chromium anions adsorbed onto hydrochar surface due to more intense competition for active sites 48 the adsorption capacity and efficiency of cr vi onto psh fe15 were better compared with sole psh thanks to the presence of fe ions attached on psh resulting in a reduction of cr vi into cr iii and formed precipitation of cr oh 3 on adsorbent s surface by oh groups the presence role of fe ions would be discussed more detail in the section of adsorption mechanism as a result of this experiment 120 min was concluded to be the most suitable reaction time for removal of cr vi by both psh and psh fe15 from aqueous solution the similar trends were recorded in previous work of cr vi adsorption by various 49 3 5 effect of initial cr vi concentration the fig 5 highlights data about the changes of cr vi adsorption capacity and efficiency over different cr vi initial concentrations it can be seen from the fig 5 that the higher initial cr vi concentration was applied the higher adsorption capacity attained whereas adsorption efficiency had conversely trend this tendency occurred for both employed adsorbents specifically the adsorption capacity of cr vi onto both psh and psh fe15 saw a significant increase in the initial period of adsorption process reaching from 1 82 mg g to 5 94 mg g for psh and 2 41 mg g to 8 67 mg g for psh fe15 which correspond to a rise in the initial cr vi concentration from 10 mg l to 60 mg l however the adsorption capacity then reached a plateau at initial cr vi concentration 80 mg l on the other hand the cr vi removal efficiency reduced from 72 7 29 75 for psh and from 96 3 44 81 for psh fe15 as the initial cr vi concentration increased from 10 to 80 mg l the trend was because the driving force of the concentration gradient went up leading to higher adsorption capacities when growing the initial cr vi concentration within aqueous solution on the contrary the number of active sites were limited due to the fixed amount of psh and psh fe15 particles in the solution while initial cr vi concentration continued to increase moreover the higher initial cr vi concentration was the lower the ratio of available active sites on the adsorbent was and the higher competition was which triggered the lower cr vi removal efficiency in summary the adsorption capacities of psh and psh fe15 reached equilibrium at the initial cr vi concentration of 60 mg l the reports of using magnetic modified biochar derived from raw corncob 44 and activated carbon prepared from mango kernel activated with h3po4 50 for adsorption of cr vi from aqueous solution also concluded the analogous trends as of this study 3 6 adsorption isotherm the adsorption equilibrium isotherm data play an important role in explain the mechanism of the adsorption process the study of the adsorption equilibrium was tested using four models namely langmuir freundlich sips and redlich peterson as the equilibrium concentration of cr vi ions equilibrium solution ph and contact time affected on the amount of cr vi ions attached onto hydrochar thus the adsorption isotherm should be described as the equilibrium amount of cr vi ions versus the equilibrium cr vi concentrations at a constant equilibrium solution ph and contact time fig 6 describes the cr vi adsorption isotherms onto psh and psh fe15 and the adsorption isotherm parameters were presented in table 1 it can be seen from the calculated data of all four adsorption isotherm models that the r2 values of the langmuir freundlich sips and redlich peterson models were 0 9812 0 9315 0 9895 and 0 9947 for psh and 0 9869 0 9519 0 9987 and 0 9981 for psh fe15 respectively generally all four isotherm models well fit to the experimental data of four models the redlich peterson model fit best with the experimental data with a r2 of 0 9947 and 0 9981 for psh and psh fe15 respectively while the freundlich model fit worse with experimental data with a r2 of 0 9315 and 0 9519 for psh and psh fe15 respectively the calculated qm values of the langmuir and sips models respectively were 9 22 and 7 29 mg g for psh and 14 33 and 10 45 mg g for psh fe15 these results indicate that the calculated data were close to experimental data qmexp of 5 94 mg g for psh and 8 67 mg g for psh fe15 of two models the sips model is the better fit to the experimental data in the study the adsorption of cr vi onto hydrochar was also favorable with langmuir sips and redlich peterson models due to the rl 1 kf value 1 the 1 n b values 1 k and g 1 51 this shows that the main adsorption processes of cr vi onto psh and phs fe15 were monolayer homogeneous 44 and hybrid process 38 similar reports were presented from some studies about cr vi removal by magnetic biochars 44 52 3 7 adsorption kinetics in study about of adsorption kinetic the adsorption kinetic data in the initial contact time periods play a vital role in fitting precise modeling and having valid conclusions about the adsorption mechanisms besides the adsorption kinetic study is also important in determination of the adsorption efficiency for practical applications in this study the adsorption dynamic of cr vi onto both psh and psh fe15 was described using the pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso models to obtain insight regarding the rate of adsorption the obtained adsorption kinetic data by plotting of cr vi adsorption onto the psh and psh fe15 against the contact time are illustrated in fig 7 and table 2 overall what stands out from the data in fig 7 and table 2 is that both pfo and pso were appropriate to describe the rate of cr vi adsorption onto psh and psh fe15 with a high r2 9 5 furthermore calculated qe values for both pfo and pso fitted well with the experimental data 3 76 mg g and 5 68 mg g for psh and psh fe15 respectively nevertheless the calculated results of adsorption kinetic illustrate that the correlation coefficient r2 values of pso model were slightly higher than those of pfo for both psh and psh fe15 hence it is suggested that the cr vi adsorption onto both psh and psh fe15 was dominated by the chemical interactions i e ion exchange and electrostatic interaction between cr vi ions and psh and psh fe15 s surface 53 and chemical sorption process is the rate limiting step of the cr vi ions adsorption by both psh and psh fe15 these results were the similar with other previous works in cr vi adsorption onto chitosan 54 and magnetic modified biochar 3 44 3 8 characteristics of paper waste sludge hydrochar and adsorption mechanism study fig 8 presents the scanning electron micrograph of psh phs fe15 before and after cr vi adsorption it can be seen that there was a very rough and heterogeneous surface structure presented on both psh and psh fe15 before fig 8a b and after fig 8c d adsorption of cr vi from aqueous solution fig 8 also indicates that the modified paper sludge hydrochar psh fe15 before and after adsorption had a more porous and rougher structure than that of psh before and after cr vi adsorption moreover the diameter of modified paper sludge hydrochar psh fe15 was smaller than that of the original psh due to the effect of fe3 ions during loading on psh which leaded to an increase in bet surface and the pore volume of psh fe15 4 1564 m² g and 0 02889 cm³ g respectively compared to psh 2 2236 m² g and 0 0093 cm³ g respectively the results of eds analysis fig 9 illustrate the elemental compositions of psh and psh fe15 before and after cr vi adsorption the main elements of psh before and after adsorption were c 44 49 and 41 31 respectively and o 38 52 and 47 05 respectively fig 8a and c the following element was ca with 10 71 and 5 10 in psh before and after adsorption respectively there also were al si and na elements in hydrochar however the elemental composition of psh varied after modified by fecl3 fig 8b and d there was the presence of fe3 and cl ions in psh fe15 before and after adsorption which proved that iron oxide particles were successfully loaded on the hydrochar surface besides the chromium element also presented in psh fe15 after adsorption fig 8d in addition the dominant functional groups on the surface of psh psh fe15 before and after adsorption were provided by the ftir spectra fig 10 a there was the vibration of oh stretching appeared at a peak of 3640 3689 cm 1 for both psh and psh fe15 before and after adsorption however the peaks of psh prior to the adsorption process were not clear compared to psh after adsorption the peaks from 3500 3900 cm 1 proved the presence of oh groups 55 the peaks from 536 876 cm 1 psh psh fe15 before and after 1554 cm 1 psh after psh fe15 before and after and 2538 2929 cm 1 indicate the presence of c h groups besides there were the appearance of cc groups at peaks of 1790 and 1798 cm 1 in psh before and after adsorption and cc groups at peaks ranging from 2349 to 2520 cm 1 in both psh and psh fe15 before and after adsorption the co groups were also observed at peaks from 1020 to 1159 cm 1 on psh and psh fe15 before and after adsorption in general the peaks in psh fe15 were more clearer than those of psh due to the presence of the iron ions on psh fe15 s surface improving the psh s textural properties 56 adsorption mechanisms of cr vi onto hydrochar could be observed through data about adsorption isotherm adsorption kinetic textural characteristics of adsorbent and phpzc values towards cr vi adsorption onto modified activated carbon valentín reyes et al 2019 57 proposed four main mechanisms including anion exchange by basic functional group sites the reduction of cr vi to cr iii by electron donor functional groups a three steps surface interaction mechanism i anionic adsorption ii reduction mechanism of cr vi into cr iii by adjacent electron donor and iii cr iii is released to the solution by electrostatic repulsion and the last mechanism involving coupled reduction adsorption in this study the calculation and analysis of adsorption isotherm kinetic and phpzc values demonstrate that the cr vi adsorption process onto hydrochar was controlled by three main mechanisms 1 adsorption coupled reduction caused by presence of fe3 ions in psh fe15 to yield precipitation of cr oh 3 2 anion exchange between cl on the hydrochar s surface with chromate or dichromate ions 3 electrostatic interaction between the cr vi anions and positively charged functional groups of psh and psh fe15 due to phpzc solution ph value the adsorption was also controlled by monolayer homogeneous and hybrid processes the cr vi adsorption onto psh and psh fe15 might involve the reduction of cr vi to cr iii due to the acidic condition of experimental conduction with ph of 3 which led to the substitution of fe ii and fe iii with cr iii 58 the reduction of cr vi to cr iii can be described through eqs 9 and 10 44 the carboxyl groups of psh and psh fe15 also supported the reduction of cr vi to cr iii through π electrons 9 3fe2 hcro4 7h 3fe3 4h2o cr3 10 cro4 2 8h 3e cr3 4h2o the precipitation of cr oh 3 could occur due to the effect of presence of fe ii on the psh fe15 this can be explained that in this adsorption process fe2 was easily oxidized to fe3 and cr vi was reduced into cr iii and the reduction of cr vi occurred during oxidation of fe2 leading to release cr iii which combined with oh groups on psh fe15 to yield precipitation of cr oh 3 onto hydrochar s surface the eds data proved the presence of cr element in the psh fe15 after cr vi adsorption fig 9d this means that cr iii was successfully precipitated onto the surface of psh fe15 during adsorption process moreover the ftir results ascertained that the presence of oh groups electron donor groups on the surface of psh and psh fe15 fig 10a which interacted with cr iii leading to precipitation of cr oh 3 on the adsorbent s surface 52 similar works reported cr vi adsorption mechanism at acidic condition using fe3o4 sio2 nh2 modified biochar 38 and iron modified bamboo and poplar derived biochar 59 and iron modified corncob biochar 44 also the eds results illustrated the presence of cl on psh fe15 which led to anion exchange between cl on the hydrochar s surface with chromate or dichromate ions in addition the phpzc of psh psh fe15 before and after adsorption respectively were 7 67 7 14 and 7 37 6 77 fig 10b and all were higher than solution ph value of 3 this means that the surface of psh and psh fe15 became predominantly positively charged favoring the adsorption of cr vi oxyanion ions from the solution through electrostatic attraction in this study all adsorption processes occurred under acidic conditions ph of 3 in acidic condition cr vi exists mainly in the forms of hcro4 and cr2o7 2 triggering the mainly adsorption mechanism of cr vi by electrostatic attraction between positively surface of psh and phs fe15 and these anions after cr vi adsorption there was a drop in the phpzc of both psh psh fe15 due to attraction of hcro4 and cr2o7 2 fig 8b and d show that the surfaces of phs fe15 before and after adsorption were more porous and rougher structure that those of psh also the bet surface and pore volume of psh fe15 were also higher than those of psh thus the psh fe15 was better adsorbent for cr vi than psh however hydrochar is non porous material thus the role of pore filling mechanism in cr vi adsorption onto psh and psh fe15 considered negligible 40 in this study to confirm the feasibility of the modified hydrochar for the removal of cr vi from industry effluents the cr vi adsorption capacity onto modified hydrochar was compared with those of several adsorbents in removal of cr vi which were documented in previous studies and the results are summarized in table 3 what stands out from data in table 3 is that there have had no studies which investigated the use of iron modified psh for the cr vi removal from aqueous solutions up to now the cr vi maximum adsorption capacities qmax of psh fe15 were higher than those of many other adsorbents including freshwater snail shell derived biosorbent 60 acid treated palm flower originated biosorbent 61 and mango kernel derived activated carbon activated with h3po4 50 meanwhile the adsorption capacities of the hydrochar in this study were similar to that of salix biomass derived hydrochar 62 nonetheless some adsorbents expressed higher cr vi adsorption capacities than those of hydrochars in this study specifically coconut shell derived activated carbon loading silver nanoparticles 63 magnetic modified corncob biochar 44 paper mill sludge derived activated carbon 20 corncob originated hydrochar modified by polyethylene imine 49 however almost cr vi adsorption processes of previous documented studies occurred at higher temperature than that of in this study besides the optimal solution ph for the cr vi adsorption in this study was analogue to those for the cr vi adsorption of various previous reported studies these comparison results illustrated that psh fe15 are feasible low cost and high effective for removal of cr vi from wastewater 3 9 reusability to evaluate the reusability of paper waste sludge hydrochar the regeneration of psh fe15 after adsorption of cr vi was examined the filtrates were used to separate and collect psh fe15 after cr vi adsorption afterward the regeneration of active sites of psh fe15 was conducted by mixing 2 0 g of psh fe15 after cr vi adsorption with 25 ml naoh 1 m during 24 h psh fe15 were then filtrated and dried at 80 c under vacuum condition before the evaluation of its reuse for cr vi adsorption the processes were repeated 5 times the results of reuasability of psh fe15 are presented in fig 11 it can be seen that cr vi adsorption efficiency of psh fe15 droped slowly in five regeneration cycles from 78 25 52 18 at 5th cycle it can be explained that the adsorption capacity fell due to the loss of functional groups and incomplete desorption 64 this result illustrates that psh fe15 was the potential material that can be used and reused for cr vi adsorption from polluted water 4 conclusions in this study both pristine and iron modified hydrochar psh and psh fe15 produced from paper waste sludge offered promising capabilities as low cost adsorbents for cr vi removal from aqueous solution psh fabricated at reaction temperature of 200 c provided the maximum cr vi adsorption capacity psh fe15 was modified by the suitable mass rate of 15 between psh and fe the adsorption capacity and efficiency of psh and psh fe15 for cr vi from aqueous solution reached the maximum at ph contact time and initial cr ci concentration of 3 120 min and 60 mg l respectively iron modified hydorchar psh fe15 provided a higher efficiency in cr vi adsorption compared to pristine hydrochar psh in the suitable adsorption conditions the maximum adsorption capacities of psh and psh fe15 achieved 5 94 mg g and 8 67 mg g accompanied by the removal efficiency of 39 62 and 57 80 respectively the sips and redlich peterson isotherms and pseudo second order kinetic model fit the best experimental data corresponding to the chemical interactions ion exchange and electrostatic interaction the main mechanisms of cr vi adsorption onto psh and psh fe15 were the reduction of cr vi to cr iii based on presence of fe ions on the hydrochar s surface which leaded the precipitation of cr iii by oh groups in form of cr oh 3 on the hydrochar s surface specially modified hydrochar reusability was five cycles with a negligible drop in adsorption efficiency of cr vi these results suggested the paper waste sludge hydrochar can be applied as low cost

13680,this work investigated cr vi adsorption onto pristine and iron modified hydrochar psh and psh fe15 respectively which were generated from paper waste sludge the results indicate that the hydrothermal carbonization temperature of 200 c was the most suitable for hydrochar production the batch experiments and the adsorption isotherm and kinetic of cr vi onto psh and psh fe15 were conducted and used to elucidate the adsorption mechanisms the results demonstrate that the cr vi adsorption capacity and efficiency onto both psh and psh fe15 reached equilibrium after 120 min at ph 3 and an initial cr vi concentration of 60 mg l in this condition the adsorption capacities were 5 94 mg g and 8 67 mg g and the removal efficiencies were 39 62 and 57 80 for psh and psh fe15 respectively the adsorption processes were well described by the sips and redlich peterson isotherm models with r2 of 0 9895 0 9987 and 0 9947 and 0 9981 for psh and psh fe15 respectively and pseudo second order kinetic model with r2 of 0 98412 and 0 99681 respectively for psh and psh fe15 the analysis of characteristics of psh and psh fe15 indicates the rough and heterogamous surface structures moreover there was presence of iron ions on psh fe15 based on eds analysis and appearance of oxygen containing surface functional groups recorded through ftir results finally it was observed that the reduction of cr vi to cr iii caused by iron ions on psm fe15 s surface and the presence of oh groups resulting in the precipitation of cr oh 3 on the hydrochar s surface was the main mechanism of cr vi adsorption onto psh fe15 keywords adsorption cr vi hydrochar iron paper waste sludge 1 introduction human beings life is now threatened by water pollution resulted from unmanaged heavy metals contamination 1 in water and wastewater medium chromium exists in two oxidation states cr iii and cr vi however the cr vi is recorded to be 100 times as poisonous as cr iii because of its high solubility and mobility in water 2 3 the hexavalent chromium cr vi is a strong oxidizing agent with a high toxicity causing dangerous potential health risks such as cancer due to its easily penetration into cell membranes hence the united states environmental protection agency set up the chromate allowable maximum concentration in drinking water at 0 05 mg l and 0 10 mg l in fresh water chemical compounds of chromium are the source of highly hazardous contaminants which were released into receiving water bodies from a range wide of industries including shoes textile dyeing electroplating tanning mining fertilizer and timber storage 4 therefore it is necessary to remove cr vi from these industrial effluents to reach the national standard or lower levels before discharging into the environment 5 in reported literatures there are several potential approaches for cr vi treatment from industrial wastewater effluents such as ion exchange chemical coagulation solvent extraction electrochemical degassing reverse osmosis anion exchange and adsorption 6 9 among aforementioned methods adsorption is the most popular method for removal cr vi thanks to its high efficiency simple design low operation cost and generated sludge feasible separation of various pollutants from water medium 10 11 nowadays the trend of utilization solid wastes to fabricate adsorption materials for treatment of contaminants has widely been studied by scholars among these solid wastes the carbon constituted materials such as fertilizer waste 12 rice husk 12 13 ocimum americanum 14 industrial waste olive oil 2 roots of eichhornia crassipes 15 peanut shells 16 distilled mud 17 walnut shell 18 activated carbon based on active mud adas 19 paper mill sludge 20 were recently reported to be highly effective adsorbents in extracting cr vi from water and wastewater despite possessing the high cr vi adsorption capacity but costly fabrication due to their excellent carbonization temperature leaded to limitation in their practical applications in recent years hydrochar has emerged as a novel adsorbent for removal of various pollutants from water and wastewater thanks to its simple fabrication at low temperature 150 350 c 21 large number of oxygen containing groups on surface and effective adsorption thus the hydrochar can be applied as potential alternative adsorbent for removal of trace metals from water medium pb2 cd2 and cu2 22 the hydrochar has produced from various materials mainly from biomass with different cellulose hemicellulose and lignin ratios comprising the sawdust applied to enhance the pb ii adsorption from water 23 sucrose and starch 24 coconut shell based hydrochars 25 banana peels 25 lawn grass containing high cellulose hemicellulose contents 26 cellulose carbon 24 sewage sludge to clean solid fuel 27 lignin cellulose d xylose and wood meal 28 hydrochar prepared from prosopis africana shell for removal of pb2 and cd2 22 nonetheless the pristine hydrochar possesses a low amount of surface functional groups non porous material and low surface area 29 30 resulting in a low removal efficiency of pollutants hence it is necessary to modify hydrochar by various methods to enhance adsorption capacity towards contaminants after modifying specific surface area pore size of hydrochar can be improved remarkably besides the modified hydrochar has a noticeably growth in oxygen containing surface functional groups and a drop in aromatic groups 31 32 for instance cymbopogon schoenanthus l spreng hydrochar was modified by h2o2 to remove copper from aqueous solution 33 hydrochar derived from peanut hull modified by h2o2 enhanced removal of pb2 with a adsorption capacity higher 20 times in comparison with pristine hydrochar 22 82 mg g compared with 0 88 mg g 34 although there have recently been a large number of studies about fabrication of hydrochar from various carbon containing materials but thus far there is no study using paper waste sludge from primary settling tank to produce hydrochar and modify the obtained pristine hydrochar by iron iii chloride for cr vi removal from aqueous solution despite its potentials besides there has been an increasing concern in the paper industry owing to a huge amount of solid waste discharged during production process which then turned into waste sludge and collected in the primary settling tank in the wastewater treatment plant this sludge has been treated by various methods such as land filling fertilization and combustion however these treatment methods are costly and limited in terms of land and air pollution therefore the utilization of the paper waste sludge for production of adsorbent to treat cr vi in wastewater should be considered an alternative solution to solve both solid waste management problem and wastewater treatment the aim of this study therefore was to develop a novel hydrochar produced from paper waste sludge by hydrothermal carbonization with the support of naoh solution the pristine hydrochar was then modified by iron iii chloride to enhance the adsorption capacity and efficiency of cr vi cr vi adsorption capacities of both pristine and iron modified hydrochars were investigated using batch experiments several parameters that play important roles in adsorption processes of cr vi onto hydrochars were also evaluated including hydrothermal carbonization temperatures solution ph contact time and initial cr vi concentration the adsorption isothermal and kinetic as well as mechanism of cr vi onto hydrochars have also been investigated and discussed by quantitative results and multiple characterizations of hydrochars 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the artificial wastewater containing cr vi at various concentrations was prepared from potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 by diluting of a stock cr vi solution with a initial concentration of 100 mg l with distilled water all chemicals used in this study consisting of potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 sulphuric acid sodium hydroxide and ferrous chloric fecl3 6h2o were purchased from sigma aldrich all chemicals were analytical grade 2 2 iron modified hydrochar derived from paper waste sludge 2 2 1 preparation of hydrochar paper waste sludge which was discharged with a rate of 300 kg day was the main material in this study the paper waste sludge was collected from the primary settling tank in wastewater treatment plant of hoang van thu paper joint stock company located in thai nguyen city thai nguyen province vietnam in order to reuse sludge for production of hydrochar the sludge was dried under sunlight for 2 days afterward a hydrothermal carbonization process of dried paper sludge was implemented in a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave according to procedure as follows at the beginning of process 10 g of dried sludge was mixed with 40 ml of naoh 0 25 m this mixture then was baked in an electric furnace at various temperature in ranges from 200 250 c during 24 h to assess the influence of hydrothermal carbonization temperature onto production of psh for adsorption of cr vi from aqueous solution the obtained paper waste sludge hydrochar was then stabilized at the ambient temperature in the next step the obtained hydrochar was filtered to remove the residues from the mixture of paper waste sludge hydrochar following that the filtered hydrochar was washed by deionized water to continuously discard residual materials before was dried at 105 c in 2 h finally the post dried hydrochar was sieved so as to obtain hydrochar particles with the size of 0 5 mm in diameter the pristine hydrochar was stored in the plastic bags and labelled as psh the psh was used for next adsorption experiments of cr vi 2 2 2 preparation of iron modified hydrochar the above achieved pristine hydrochar was continuously modified with iron iii chloride with the purpose of growing adsorption capacity of cr vi from aqueous solution in order to reach this objective psh was impregnated in fe3 solution the first step involved modifying psh 3 g of the pristine sludge hydrochar psh was put into a heat resistant triangle flask containing 10 ml fecl3 6h2o with a certainly content the ratios of iron psh were 5 10 15 and 20 w w the containers were then sealed and agitated for 4 h by an air stirrer operating at 80 c as soon as the procedure finished the obtained mixtures were cooled until room temperature before being filtered to separate the solid phase from liquid phase the obtained solid phase containing mixture of psh and iron was then washed with distilled water to make sure that all residual iron ions were discarded and the left of mixture was the iron modified hydrochar labelled as psh fe subsequently the psh fe was dried at 70 c in 12 h or overnight in a drying cabinet finally the obtained dried modified hydrochars psh fe were preserved in plastic bags and were labelled as psh fe psh fe5 psh fe10 psh fe15 psh fe20 for upcoming cr vi adsorption experiments 2 3 characteristics analysis of hydrochar the attributes of psh and psh fe before and after adsorption of cr vi from aqueous solution were evaluated by the brunauer emmett teller method bet bet builder ssa 4300 scanning electron microscopic sem images using an energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy machine hitachi s 4800 and x ray diffraction xrd and fourier transform infrared ftir using a spectroscopy machine ft ir 6300 operating at 4000 500 cm 1 wavelength while the point of zero charge phpzc was determined by the shift method zhao et al 2016 2 4 batch adsorption experiments batch experiments were employed to examine the effects of hydrothermal carbonization temperature on hydrochar fabrication impregnation ratios of mixture of iron psh on cr vi adsorption onto psh and solution ph contact time and initial cr vi concentration on adsorption of cr vi onto pristine and modified hydrochars the aim of these experiments was to find out optimal conditions for adsorption of cr vi onto hydrochar and to study dynamic of adsorption process the influence of hydrothermal carbonization temperature on hydrochar fabrication was conducted at the experimental conditions using triangle flask of 50 ml containing 25 ml of an initial cr vi concentration of 30 mg l and a psh dosage of 0 1 g which was produced at the various hydrothermal carbonization temperatures of 200 225 and 250 c at solution ph of 6 5 the flasks were then shaken at 120 rpm for 30 min for investigation the effect of impregnation ratios of mixture of iron psh on cr vi adsorption onto psh to find out the optimal modification ratio for fabrication of modified hydrochar the various impregnation ratios of fe ions and paper sludge hydrochar were 0 5 10 15 20 w w other experimental conditions included the initial cr vi concentration of 30 mg l contact time of 60 min and a shaking speed of 120 rpm under the initial ph condition of 6 5 the obtained iron modified paper waste sludge hydrochars were labeled as psh psh fe5 psh fe10 psh fe15 and psh fe20 the effects of solution ph 3 0 9 0 at initial cr vi of 30 mg l adsorbent dosage of 2 g l and contact time of 60 min contact time 5 0 240 0 min for 2 g l of adsorbent dosage initial cr vi of 30 mg l and the above determined most suitable ph value and initial cr vi concentrations 10 80 mg l for 2 g l of adsorbent dosage at the above determined most suitable ph and contact time on cr vi adsorption onto psh and psh fe were performed in 50 ml erlenmeyer flasks each flask contained 25 ml of a cr vi solution at certainly concentrations and 2 g l of hydrochar dosage these flasks were then agitated at 120 rpm using an agitator ph 4a china at the room temperature 25 2 c the ph values were adjusted by adding 0 1 m hydrosulfate acid or sodium hydroxide the samples containing cr vi were taken out from flasks at interval time and were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane to separate absorbent from solution the residual cr vi concentrations in the filtrates were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes model ultima expert horiba france the adsorption capacity of cr vi onto hydrochar was computed using two equations as follows 1 q t c o c t v m 2 q e c o c e v m where c0 ct and ce mg l are concentrations of cr vi at the beginning time any time t and equilibrium respectively v l is the volume of solution and m g is the weight of the hydrochar the qt and qe are denoted the cr vi amount adsorbed onto absorbent at any time t and at equilibrium mg g all experiments were triplicated 2 5 desorption experiment the reusability of the iron modified paper waste sludge hydrochar after adsorption of cr vi was studied by the regeneration of active sites on psh fe15 firstly the psh fe15 after cr vi adsorption was separated from supernatant using 0 45 μm filtration membrane in the next step the amount of 2 0 g of the psh fe15 was mixed with 25 ml naoh 1 m in erlenmeyer flasks and shaken at 120 rpm at 30 c during 24 h the mixture was then filtrated and obtained psh fe15 was dried at 80 c under vacuum condition before used to evaluate of its reusability for cr vi adsorption five adsorption desorption cycles were performed in this experiment 2 6 adsorption isotherm and kinetic the isothermal analysis of cr vi adsorption onto psh and psh fe was evaluated through four models of langmuir freundlich sips and redlich peterson theoretically the langmuir model describes monolayer adsorption 35 whereas the freundlich isotherm model provides multilayer adsorption and the sips isotherm is the combination of both freundlich and langmuir isothermal models 36 37 the redlich peterson r p isotherm model suggested a three parameter adsorption isotherm equation and when α value in the r p equation equals 1 its form is the same as the langmuir equation and becomes similar with freundlich isotherm as the α value closes to 0 38 the following eqs 3 4 5 and 6 are applied to compute the parameters of the langmuir freundlich sips and redlich peterson isotherm models respectively 3 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 4 q e k f c e 1 n 5 q e q

illustrates the clearly effect of the hydrothermal carbonization temperature hct on fabrication of psh for cr vi adsorption from aqueous solution what stands out from data in fig 1 is that at the hydrothermal carbonization temperature of 200 c the cr vi adsorption capacity of psh was 4 60 mg g corresponding with a cr vi removal efficiency reached 30 72 the cr vi adsorption capacity onto psh decreased when increasing the reaction temperature which made the efficiency of adsorbent produced at 200 c the highest one more specifically a growth of hct by 25 c triggered a drop in adsorption capacity and efficiency of cr vi onto psh respectively by 0 76 mg g and 5 13 the last record was at 250 c when the adsorption capacity of psh plummeted to the lowest value of 2 13 mg g consequently the recorded efficiency was only 14 21 the results can be explained that when hydrothermal carbonization temperature went up the nitrogen n and sulfur s constituents containing in the paper waste sludge pws were easily converted into nox and sox resulting in a drop in n s in pws 39 40 moreover a problem involving in the rise of htc causing the loss of solid mass occurred owing to the effect of water in the hydrolysis reaction 40 an another reason to explain for these results was that hemicellulose and lignin could be completely hydrolyzed at the reaction temperature of 180 200 c while cellulose at more than 220 c would possibly be over oxidized 41 but the main constituents of paper waste sludge are hemicellulose and lignin 20 thus the most suitable hydrothermal carbonization temperature for generation of pristine hydrochar derived from paper waste sludge was 200 c this hydrothermal carbonization temperature was then used for follow up production of paper sludge hydrochar to conduct the further experiments the result was well consistent with the findings of gorzin and abadi 2018 20 with the most suitable htc for paper sludge derived hydrochar production was 210 c and jaruwat et al 2018 40 for hydrochar production from cattail leaves with optimal htc was 200 c 3 2 effect of impregnation ratio on cr vi adsorption to improve cr vi adsorption onto hydrochar the pristine hydrochar psh was modified by iron ions fe3 at various impregnation ratios of fe3 psh the results are depicted in fig 2 as can be seen from fig 2 with each impregnation ratio the adsorption capacity of iron modified paper waste sludge hydrochar for cr vi varied distinctly more importantly in every recorded time the more fe3 ions were attached into psh the higher adsorption capacity and efficiency of cr vi onto absorbent attained from the data in fig 2 it is clear that the cr vi adsorption capacity and efficiency onto sole psh was the lowest overall what stands out from data in fig 2 is that there were remarkably upward trends in the adsorption capacity of cr vi onto hydrochar when the impregnation ratio between iron and psh went up from 5 to 20 over the 100 min of contact time period between 0 and 100 min the growth in terms of adsorption capacity was significant when psh was impregnated with 5 and 10 of fe which resulted in correspondingly higher cr vi removal efficiencies however the adsorption capacity was sharply accelerated for modified psh with the impregnation ratio of 15 the adsorption capacity of cr vi onto adsorbent continued grow when the impregnation ratio went up to 20 but the growth rate was inconsiderable compared to the different impregnation ratios among psh fe5 psh fe10 and psh fe15 notably the adsorption capacity of psh fe20 was even recorded to be lower than that of psh fe15 after 60 min of adsorption time specifically after 60 min of contact time the adsorption capacity of psh fe15 was 5 56 mg g corresponding to the cr vi removal efficiency of 74 08 while the adsorption capacity of psh fe20 was only 5 53 mg g resulting in a proportional fall by 0 33 in terms of cr vi removal efficiency in co operation with cost benefit analysis this result offered a crucial meaning for determining the most appropriate impregnation ratio of fe and psh for cr vi adsorption the reasons which can be explained for the growth in adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of cr vi onto iron modified paper waste sludge hydrochar was due to the presence of iron oxides in the psh fe s surface corresponding to the sphere complex form of cr vi 42 and affinity of cl anions towards hcro4 cro4 2 and cr2o7 2 anions 43 nonetheless the adsorption capacity of cr vi onto modified hydrochar had the insignificantly rise when increasing the impregnation ratio to 20 of iron this was because of the saturation in the active sites on psh fe20 s surface causing cr vi ions could not attach onto the adsorbent surface 44 therefore it was evident that 15 of fe should be the most suitable impregnation ratio for modifying psh and the psh fe15 would be used to perform further investigation experiments 3 3 effect of ph in order to assess the effect of solution ph on the adsorption of cr vi from aqueous solution experiments were carried out with psh and psh fe15 as adsorbents and a range of ph from 3 to 9 other experimental conditions included the contact time of 60 min and shaking speed of 120 rpm the sample was put in a 50 ml triangular flask containing 25 ml of solution cr vi with a concentration of 30 mg l and 0 2 g l dosage of each psh or psh fe15 the solution ph was one of the most important parameters which profound affected on the cr vi adsorption capacity and efficiency onto adsorbent on account of its effects on adsorbent s surface charge and chromium ions existing status in solution leading to differences in adsorption process of cr vi at various ph values the study results about the influence of solution ph on cr vi adsorption onto the both pristine hydrochar psh and iron modified hydrochar psh fe15 are illustrated in fig 3 from fig 3 it is clear that as ph value increased both employed adsorbents shared a similar drop tendency in interaction between adsorbent particles and chromium irons particularly the adsorption capacity of both psh and psh fe15 was maximum at solution ph of 3 in general the cr vi adsorption capacity and efficiency onto both hydrochars witnessed a gradual drop when the ph rose despite possessing the similar trend in decrease of cr vi adsorption capacity and efficiency when solution ph increased but it is obvious that psh fe 15 had a much higher adsorption efficiency than that of psh regarding specific data provided by fig 3 at ph equal to 3 the cr vi adsorption capacities onto psh fe15 and psh were 6 24 mg g and 2 98 mg g equivalent with the cr vi removal efficiencies of 83 17 and 39 75 respectively after having dropped by a continual growth in terms of ph the adsorption capacities of psh and psh fe15 achieved only 1 13 mg g and 4 27 mg g respectively at ph of 9 the increase of ph value resulted in a total drop by 24 72 and 26 25 for the removal efficiencies of psh and psh fe15 respectively compared to those at ph 3 it can be explained that most cr vi ions exist in the forms of hcro4 cro4 2 or cr2o7 2 which depend on solution ph initial cr vi concentrations and redox potential 45 the major species of cr vi were hcro4 and cr2o7 2 under the acidic condition with ph between 1 0 and 4 0 44 in this condition the number of h ions surrounded the surface of psh and psh fe15 dominated leading promotion of electrostatic attraction between adsorbent surface s positive charges and chromium anions in solution therefore the high adsorption capacities of psh and psh fe15 for cr vi were obtained at low ph in contrast the surface of psh and psh fe15 was negatively charged and the oh dominated in the high solution ph hence the adsorption capacities of psh and psh fe15 decreased when increasing solution ph values as a result it is possible to conclude that 3 is the most effective ph value for the cr vi adsorption onto psh based adsorbents the analogous results were reported by akram et al 2017 46 for adsorption of cr vi onto biocomposite hoang et al 2019 44 for cr vi removal using magnetic modified biochar derived from raw corncob shi et al 2018a 38 for cr vi adsorption using biochar modified by fe3o4 sio2 nh2 particles 3 4 effect of contact time the fig 4 illustrates data about the adsorption capacity and efficiency of cr vi onto psh and psh fe15 over a 240 min period of contact time between 0 and 240 min what stands out from data in fig 4 is that there was a dramatic rise in initial 30 min period and a steady upward trend from 30 min onwards of adsorption process in cr vi adsorption capacity and efficiency for both psh and psh fe15 the adsorption rate was gradually dropped and reached equilibrium at 120 min of reaction time for both psh and psh fe15 towards cr vi adsorption onto psh the equilibrium adsorption capacity and efficiency respectively achieved 3 76 mg g and 50 17 whereas the equilibrium adsorption capacity and efficiency of cr vi onto psh fe15 were 5 68 mg g and 75 67 respectively the adsorption capacity and efficiency decreased afterwards when contact time exceeded 120 min this is because the availability of active sites on the adsorbent s surface were almost depleted in the initial period the active sites were fully available leading to 100 interactions between chromium ions and adsorbent particles were achieved 47 while the number of available active sites droped in the next period afterwards equilibrium point triggering less chromium anions adsorbed onto hydrochar surface due to more intense competition for active sites 48 the adsorption capacity and efficiency of cr vi onto psh fe15 were better compared with sole psh thanks to the presence of fe ions attached on psh resulting in a reduction of cr vi into cr iii and formed precipitation of cr oh 3 on adsorbent s surface by oh groups the presence role of fe ions would be discussed more detail in the section of adsorption mechanism as a result of this experiment 120 min was concluded to be the most suitable reaction time for removal of cr vi by both psh and psh fe15 from aqueous solution the similar trends were recorded in previous work of cr vi adsorption by various 49 3 5 effect of initial cr vi concentration the fig 5 highlights data about the changes of cr vi adsorption capacity and efficiency over different cr vi initial concentrations it can be seen from the fig 5 that the higher initial cr vi concentration was applied the higher adsorption capacity attained whereas adsorption efficiency had conversely trend this tendency occurred for both employed adsorbents specifically the adsorption capacity of cr vi onto both psh and psh fe15 saw a significant increase in the initial period of adsorption process reaching from 1 82 mg g to 5 94 mg g for psh and 2 41 mg g to 8 67 mg g for psh fe15 which correspond to a rise in the initial cr vi concentration from 10 mg l to 60 mg l however the adsorption capacity then reached a plateau at initial cr vi concentration 80 mg l on the other hand the cr vi removal efficiency reduced from 72 7 29 75 for psh and from 96 3 44 81 for psh fe15 as the initial cr vi concentration increased from 10 to 80 mg l the trend was because the driving force of the concentration gradient went up leading to higher adsorption capacities when growing the initial cr vi concentration within aqueous solution on the contrary the number of active sites were limited due to the fixed amount of psh and psh fe15 particles in the solution while initial cr vi concentration continued to increase moreover the higher initial cr vi concentration was the lower the ratio of available active sites on the adsorbent was and the higher competition was which triggered the lower cr vi removal efficiency in summary the adsorption capacities of psh and psh fe15 reached equilibrium at the initial cr vi concentration of 60 mg l the reports of using magnetic modified biochar derived from raw corncob 44 and activated carbon prepared from mango kernel activated with h3po4 50 for adsorption of cr vi from aqueous solution also concluded the analogous trends as of this study 3 6 adsorption isotherm the adsorption equilibrium isotherm data play an important role in explain the mechanism of the adsorption process the study of the adsorption equilibrium was tested using four models namely langmuir freundlich sips and redlich peterson as the equilibrium concentration of cr vi ions equilibrium solution ph and contact time affected on the amount of cr vi ions attached onto hydrochar thus the adsorption isotherm should be described as the equilibrium amount of cr vi ions versus the equilibrium cr vi concentrations at a constant equilibrium solution ph and contact time fig 6 describes the cr vi adsorption isotherms onto psh and psh fe15 and the adsorption isotherm parameters were presented in table 1 it can be seen from the calculated data of all four adsorption isotherm models that the r2 values of the langmuir freundlich sips and redlich peterson models were 0 9812 0 9315 0 9895 and 0 9947 for psh and 0 9869 0 9519 0 9987 and 0 9981 for psh fe15 respectively generally all four isotherm models well fit to the experimental data of four models the redlich peterson model fit best with the experimental data with a r2 of 0 9947 and 0 9981 for psh and psh fe15 respectively while the freundlich model fit worse with experimental data with a r2 of 0 9315 and 0 9519 for psh and psh fe15 respectively the calculated qm values of the langmuir and sips models respectively were 9 22 and 7 29 mg g for psh and 14 33 and 10 45 mg g for psh fe15 these results indicate that the calculated data were close to experimental data qmexp of 5 94 mg g for psh and 8 67 mg g for psh fe15 of two models the sips model is the better fit to the experimental data in the study the adsorption of cr vi onto hydrochar was also favorable with langmuir sips and redlich peterson models due to the rl 1 kf value 1 the 1 n b values 1 k and g 1 51 this shows that the main adsorption processes of cr vi onto psh and phs fe15 were monolayer homogeneous 44 and hybrid process 38 similar reports were presented from some studies about cr vi removal by magnetic biochars 44 52 3 7 adsorption kinetics in study about of adsorption kinetic the adsorption kinetic data in the initial contact time periods play a vital role in fitting precise modeling and having valid conclusions about the adsorption mechanisms besides the adsorption kinetic study is also important in determination of the adsorption efficiency for practical applications in this study the adsorption dynamic of cr vi onto both psh and psh fe15 was described using the pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso models to obtain insight regarding the rate of adsorption the obtained adsorption kinetic data by plotting of cr vi adsorption onto the psh and psh fe15 against the contact time are illustrated in fig 7 and table 2 overall what stands out from the data in fig 7 and table 2 is that both pfo and pso were appropriate to describe the rate of cr vi adsorption onto psh and psh fe15 with a high r2 9 5 furthermore calculated qe values for both pfo and pso fitted well with the experimental data 3 76 mg g and 5 68 mg g for psh and psh fe15 respectively nevertheless the calculated results of adsorption kinetic illustrate that the correlation coefficient r2 values of pso model were slightly higher than those of pfo for both psh and psh fe15 hence it is suggested that the cr vi adsorption onto both psh and psh fe15 was dominated by the chemical interactions i e ion exchange and electrostatic interaction between cr vi ions and psh and psh fe15 s surface 53 and chemical sorption process is the rate limiting step of the cr vi ions adsorption by both psh and psh fe15 these results were the similar with other previous works in cr vi adsorption onto chitosan 54 and magnetic modified biochar 3 44 3 8 characteristics of paper waste sludge hydrochar and adsorption mechanism study fig 8 presents the scanning electron micrograph of psh phs fe15 before and after cr vi adsorption it can be seen that there was a very rough and heterogeneous surface structure presented on both psh and psh fe15 before fig 8a b and after fig 8c d adsorption of cr vi from aqueous solution fig 8 also indicates that the modified paper sludge hydrochar psh fe15 before and after adsorption had a more porous and rougher structure than that of psh before and after cr vi adsorption moreover the diameter of modified paper sludge hydrochar psh fe15 was smaller than that of the original psh due to the effect of fe3 ions during loading on psh which leaded to an increase in bet surface and the pore volume of psh fe15 4 1564 m² g and 0 02889 cm³ g respectively compared to psh 2 2236 m² g and 0 0093 cm³ g respectively the results of eds analysis fig 9 illustrate the elemental compositions of psh and psh fe15 before and after cr vi adsorption the main elements of psh before and after adsorption were c 44 49 and 41 31 respectively and o 38 52 and 47 05 respectively fig 8a and c the following element was ca with 10 71 and 5 10 in psh before and after adsorption respectively there also were al si and na elements in hydrochar however the elemental composition of psh varied after modified by fecl3 fig 8b and d there was the presence of fe3 and cl ions in psh fe15 before and after adsorption which proved that iron oxide particles were successfully loaded on the hydrochar surface besides the chromium element also presented in psh fe15 after adsorption fig 8d in addition the dominant functional groups on the surface of psh psh fe15 before and after adsorption were provided by the ftir spectra fig 10 a there was the vibration of oh stretching appeared at a peak of 3640 3689 cm 1 for both psh and psh fe15 before and after adsorption however the peaks of psh prior to the adsorption process were not clear compared to psh after adsorption the peaks from 3500 3900 cm 1 proved the presence of oh groups 55 the peaks from 536 876 cm 1 psh psh fe15 before and after 1554 cm 1 psh after psh fe15 before and after and 2538 2929 cm 1 indicate the presence of c h groups besides there were the appearance of cc groups at peaks of 1790 and 1798 cm 1 in psh before and after adsorption and cc groups at peaks ranging from 2349 to 2520 cm 1 in both psh and psh fe15 before and after adsorption the co groups were also observed at peaks from 1020 to 1159 cm 1 on psh and psh fe15 before and after adsorption in general the peaks in psh fe15 were more clearer than those of psh due to the presence of the iron ions on psh fe15 s surface improving the psh s textural properties 56 adsorption mechanisms of cr vi onto hydrochar could be observed through data about adsorption isotherm adsorption kinetic textural characteristics of adsorbent and phpzc values towards cr vi adsorption onto modified activated carbon valentín reyes et al 2019 57 proposed four main mechanisms including anion exchange by basic functional group sites the reduction of cr vi to cr iii by electron donor functional groups a three steps surface interaction mechanism i anionic adsorption ii reduction mechanism of cr vi into cr iii by adjacent electron donor and iii cr iii is released to the solution by electrostatic repulsion and the last mechanism involving coupled reduction adsorption in this study the calculation and analysis of adsorption isotherm kinetic and phpzc values demonstrate that the cr vi adsorption process onto hydrochar was controlled by three main mechanisms 1 adsorption coupled reduction caused by presence of fe3 ions in psh fe15 to yield precipitation of cr oh 3 2 anion exchange between cl on the hydrochar s surface with chromate or dichromate ions 3 electrostatic interaction between the cr vi anions and positively charged functional groups of psh and psh fe15 due to phpzc solution ph value the adsorption was also controlled by monolayer homogeneous and hybrid processes the cr vi adsorption onto psh and psh fe15 might involve the reduction of cr vi to cr iii due to the acidic condition of experimental conduction with ph of 3 which led to the substitution of fe ii and fe iii with cr iii 58 the reduction of cr vi to cr iii can be described through eqs 9 and 10 44 the carboxyl groups of psh and psh fe15 also supported the reduction of cr vi to cr iii through π electrons 9 3fe2 hcro4 7h 3fe3 4h2o cr3 10 cro4 2 8h 3e cr3 4h2o the precipitation of cr oh 3 could occur due to the effect of presence of fe ii on the psh fe15 this can be explained that in this adsorption process fe2 was easily oxidized to fe3 and cr vi was reduced into cr iii and the reduction of cr vi occurred during oxidation of fe2 leading to release cr iii which combined with oh groups on psh fe15 to yield precipitation of cr oh 3 onto hydrochar s surface the eds data proved the presence of cr element in the psh fe15 after cr vi adsorption fig 9d this means that cr iii was successfully precipitated onto the surface of psh fe15 during adsorption process moreover the ftir results ascertained that the presence of oh groups electron donor groups on the surface of psh and psh fe15 fig 10a which interacted with cr iii leading to precipitation of cr oh 3 on the adsorbent s surface 52 similar works reported cr vi adsorption mechanism at acidic condition using fe3o4 sio2 nh2 modified biochar 38 and iron modified bamboo and poplar derived biochar 59 and iron modified corncob biochar 44 also the eds results illustrated the presence of cl on psh fe15 which led to anion exchange between cl on the hydrochar s surface with chromate or dichromate ions in addition the phpzc of psh psh fe15 before and after adsorption respectively were 7 67 7 14 and 7 37 6 77 fig 10b and all were higher than solution ph value of 3 this means that the surface of psh and psh fe15 became predominantly positively charged favoring the adsorption of cr vi oxyanion ions from the solution through electrostatic attraction in this study all adsorption processes occurred under acidic conditions ph of 3 in acidic condition cr vi exists mainly in the forms of hcro4 and cr2o7 2 triggering the mainly adsorption mechanism of cr vi by electrostatic attraction between positively surface of psh and phs fe15 and these anions after cr vi adsorption there was a drop in the phpzc of both psh psh fe15 due to attraction of hcro4 and cr2o7 2 fig 8b and d show that the surfaces of phs fe15 before and after adsorption were more porous and rougher structure that those of psh also the bet surface and pore volume of psh fe15 were also higher than those of psh thus the psh fe15 was better adsorbent for cr vi than psh however hydrochar is non porous material thus the role of pore filling mechanism in cr vi adsorption onto psh and psh fe15 considered negligible 40 in this study to confirm the feasibility of the modified hydrochar for the removal of cr vi from industry effluents the cr vi adsorption capacity onto modified hydrochar was compared with those of several adsorbents in removal of cr vi which were documented in previous studies and the results are summarized in table 3 what stands out from data in table 3 is that there have had no studies which investigated the use of iron modified psh for the cr vi removal from aqueous solutions up to now the cr vi maximum adsorption capacities qmax of psh fe15 were higher than those of many other adsorbents including freshwater snail shell derived biosorbent 60 acid treated palm flower originated biosorbent 61 and mango kernel derived activated carbon activated with h3po4 50 meanwhile the adsorption capacities of the hydrochar in this study were similar to that of salix biomass derived hydrochar 62 nonetheless some adsorbents expressed higher cr vi adsorption capacities than those of hydrochars in this study specifically coconut shell derived activated carbon loading silver nanoparticles 63 magnetic modified corncob biochar 44 paper mill sludge derived activated carbon 20 corncob originated hydrochar modified by polyethylene imine 49 however almost cr vi adsorption processes of previous documented studies occurred at higher temperature than that of in this study besides the optimal solution ph for the cr vi adsorption in this study was analogue to those for the cr vi adsorption of various previous reported studies these comparison results illustrated that psh fe15 are feasible low cost and high effective for removal of cr vi from wastewater 3 9 reusability to evaluate the reusability of paper waste sludge hydrochar the regeneration of psh fe15 after adsorption of cr vi was examined the filtrates were used to separate and collect psh fe15 after cr vi adsorption afterward the regeneration of active sites of psh fe15 was conducted by mixing 2 0 g of psh fe15 after cr vi adsorption with 25 ml naoh 1 m during 24 h psh fe15 were then filtrated and dried at 80 c under vacuum condition before the evaluation of its reuse for cr vi adsorption the processes were repeated 5 times the results of reuasability of psh fe15 are presented in fig 11 it can be seen that cr vi adsorption efficiency of psh fe15 droped slowly in five regeneration cycles from 78 25 52 18 at 5th cycle it can be explained that the adsorption capacity fell due to the loss of functional groups and incomplete desorption 64 this result illustrates that psh fe15 was the potential material that can be used and reused for cr vi adsorption from polluted water 4 conclusions in this study both pristine and iron modified hydrochar psh and psh fe15 produced from paper waste sludge offered promising capabilities as low cost adsorbents for cr vi removal from aqueous solution psh fabricated at reaction temperature of 200 c provided the maximum cr vi adsorption capacity psh fe15 was modified by the suitable mass rate of 15 between psh and fe the adsorption capacity and efficiency of psh and psh fe15 for cr vi from aqueous solution reached the maximum at ph contact time and initial cr ci concentration of 3 120 min and 60 mg l respectively iron modified hydorchar psh fe15 provided a higher efficiency in cr vi adsorption compared to pristine hydrochar psh in the suitable adsorption conditions the maximum adsorption capacities of psh and psh fe15 achieved 5 94 mg g and 8 67 mg g accompanied by the removal efficiency of 39 62 and 57 80 respectively the sips and redlich peterson isotherms and pseudo second order kinetic model fit the best experimental data corresponding to the chemical interactions ion exchange and electrostatic interaction the main mechanisms of cr vi adsorption onto psh and psh fe15 were the reduction of cr vi to cr iii based on presence of fe ions on the hydrochar s surface which leaded the precipitation of cr iii by oh groups in form of cr oh 3 on the hydrochar s surface specially modified hydrochar reusability was five cycles with a negligible drop in adsorption efficiency of cr vi these results suggested the paper waste sludge hydrochar can be applied as low cost high effective and fully promising adsorbents for removal of cr vi from water medium declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgement this research is

13681,two bacterial strains belonging to the genus shinella were isolated from the activated sludge of a domestic wastewater treatment plant and could autotrophically oxidize as iii to as v under aerobic conditions kinetic studies indicated that the autotrophic as iii oxidation rate of both strains matched the monod model well and strain vka3 exhibited higher kinetic parameters compared to strain vka4 μmax 124 16 μm h and ks 4407 19 μm vs μmax 59 00 μm h and ks 1787 03 μm the versatility of both strains was expressed through their flexible growth under heterotrophic conditions in the presence of yeast extract and anaerobic as iii coupled with denitrification both strains can oxidize sb iii to sb v under aerobic conditions the arsenite oxidase aioa gene which might be involved in as iii and sb iii oxidation was detected in the isolated strains this study demonstrated that the versatile bacteria with potential applications for bioremediation of as and sb could be obtained from an easily accessible microbiological source abbreviations pcr polymerase chain reaction ncbi national center for biotechnology information keywords monod model microbial oxidation arsenite antimonite activated sludges 1 introduction arsenic as is a well known toxic metalloid found in the upper crust of the earth owing to its toxicity it was previously used as a wood preservative to prevent the growth of insects bacteria and fungi 1 and as an antibiotic in medicals 2 it is also used in a variety of alloys and has many applications in the electronics industry owing to its chemical properties 3 the extensive use of as compounds has resulted in the continuous accumulation of as in the natural environment the serious health problems 4 caused by chronic exposure to as have not only driven the scientific community to study as remediation technologies but have also resulted in more guidelines being established for as levels in products used by humans together with sb an element in the same group that shares some similar characteristics as was included in the priority pollutant list by environmental protection agencies in many countries the world health organization provided the guideline value of 10 μg l for as 5 and 5 μg l for sb 6 in drinking water despite occurring ubiquitously in many chemical forms only the inorganic forms of as and sb exhibit an acute toxic effect on human health 7 8 inorganic as and sb are commonly found in trivalent as iii and sb iii and pentavalent as v and sb v oxidation states in the natural environment 7 9 although both as and sb are non essential elements for living organisms some microorganisms can metabolize their compounds to detoxify them or use their compounds as partial or sole energy sources 10 the microbial oxidation of as iii to as v and sb iii to sb v would help reduce their toxicity and change their mobility in the environment some treatment technologies show a more positive reduction efficiency on the pentavalent forms of as and sb than the trivalent forms 11 13 the coupling of microbial oxidation of as iii to as v followed by as v adsorption on goethite has been successfully demonstrated 14 a phylogenetically widespread range of as iii and sb iii oxidizing bacteria was isolated and investigated for their performance under both autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions 15 17 some of them can perform anaerobic as iii and sb iii oxidation coupled with denitrification 17 20 most of them originated from as and sb contaminated samples such as mine soils 21 22 and tailings 23 and contaminated soils 17 waters 24 and sediments 18 25 in the research on the pathway of as iii oxidation the aioa gene was widely recognized to encodes arsenite oxidase large subunit it was extensively used as a biomarker to evaluate the abundance and diversity of as iii oxidizing microorganisms in various aquatic and soil environments 26 although a different pathway of as iii and sb iii oxidation was implicated 23 27 a recent study found that arsenite oxidase could also function as antimonite oxidase 28 besides the aioa gene was detected in many newly isolated sb iii oxidizing bacteria 17 18 therefore the arsenite oxidase large subunit was believed to be partially involved and functions as an antimonite oxidase in this study an activated sludge from a domestic wastewater treatment plant was introduced for the enrichment and isolation of autotrophic as iii oxidizing bacteria the kinetic model of microbial as iii oxidation was also investigated the versatile application of the isolated strain was tested by heterotrophic growth in the presence of organic matter and anaerobic growth with nitrate as the sole electron acceptor the application of the isolated bacteria for bioremediation was tested using sb iii the evolutionary history of the newly isolated strain was studied through 16s rrna sequencing and the arsenite oxidase aioa gene which is usually involved in as iii and sb iii oxidation was characterized 2 material and methods 2 1 autotrophic as iii oxidizing bacterial enrichment and isolation activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant was inoculated into a minimal medium 24 29

mm was added to the culture from the stock solution of naaso2 bicarbonate as 0 5 g l nahco3 was supplied as an inorganic carbon source for chemolithoautotrophic bacterial growth after 1 week of incubation in a shaking incubator at 25 c and 200 rpm the enrichment culture was subcultured to the fresh medium with an inoculum ratio of 1 the subcultivation was conductedthrice consecutively using the same medium added with as iii and bicarbonate as above the enrichment culture was serially diluted and spread on an agar plate containing the same constituents as the enrichment medium colonies appearing on the plate after 5 d of incubation at 25 c were selected and purified by continuous streaking on new agar plates until pure cultures were obtained the pure cultures were then transferred to liquid medium for subsequent experiments 2 2 aerobic as iii oxidation with and without yeast extract to investigate the heterotrophic growth of the newly isolated autotrophic as iii oxidizing bacteria 0 1 yeast extract was additionally added to the minimal medium the aerobic growth of isolated bacteria with and without yeast extract was tested with 2 mm as iii all experiments were conducted in triplicate and incubated at 25 c and 200 rpm samples were periodically taken from cultures and the cell growth and as iii and as v concentrations were measured an abiotic control in which no bacterium was inoculated was simultaneously included in each experiment to confirm the microbial reaction 2 3 kinetics of autotrophic as iii oxidation by the isolated bacteria the kinetics of autotrophic as iii oxidation by the isolated bacteria was investigated at 25 c and 200 rpm with the initial as iii concentration range of 50 10 000 μm the kinetic rate of microbial as iii oxidation was calculated according to the following empirical monod equation μ μ m a x s k s s where μ μm h is the specific as iii oxidation rate of bacteria μmax μm h is the maximum specific as iii oxidation rate s μm is the initial molar concentration of as iii and ks μm is the half velocity constant the ks value represents the initial as iii concentration at which the obtained specific as iii oxidation rate is half of μmax the ks and μmax were obtained from the eadie hofstee plot the obtained values were then optimized using solver in microsoft excel 2 4 anaerobic as iii oxidation with nitrate as the sole electron acceptor the anaerobic growth of the isolated autotrophic as iii oxidizing bacteria was tested using nitrate as nano3 as the sole electron acceptor the experiment was conducted using the serum bottle with a working volume of 100 ml the headspace was purged with argon gas for 20 min to remove the air the test was carried out with 1 mm as iii and 1 4 mm no3 at 25 c and 200 rpm samples were periodically taken for monitoring cell growth and the as iii as v no3 and no2 levels 2 5 aerobic sb iii oxidation by the newly isolated as iii oxidizing bacteria to test the aerobic sb iii oxidation ability of the newly isolated as iii oxidizing bacteria the bacteria were cultured in the same medium under the same condition for aerobic as iii oxidation as mentioned earlier but 200 μm sb iii as ksbc4h4o7 0 5h2o was added to the culture instead of as iii the culture was incubated at 25 c and 200 rpm and samples were taken for monitoring the cell growth and sb iii and sb v levels 2 6 analytical techniques the cell growth in each culture was estimated by measuring the optical density of the culture medium at a wavelength of 600 nm using a spectrophotometer uv vis double beam model uvd 3200 labomed inc los angeles ca usa the as iii and as v concentrations were determined using a dionexultimate 3000 high performance liquid chromatography system thermo fisher scientific inc waltham ma usa as described in our previous studies 24 the total soluble as in the culture was calculated as the sum of as iii and as v the sb v no2 and no3 concentrations were determined using an ion chromatography system ic dx 300 dionex sunnyvale ca usa according to the protocol described previously 17 the total sb concentration was determined by a laser ablation microprobe inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer lam icp ms perkin elmer elan drc e up 213 massachusetts usa the sb iii concentration was calculated as the difference between the total sb and the sb v concentration 2 7 genomic analysis and phylogenetic study colonies of isolated bacteria grown on agar plates were collected for dna extraction using the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio lab carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s protocol dna samples were used as a template for further genomic analysis to determine the evolutionary history of the isolated bacteria the 16s rrna gene of each bacterium was amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr with universal primers eub 8 f and eub 1392r according to a protocol described in our previous studies 31 the arsenite oxidation aioa gene of each isolated bacterium was detected using pcr with primer set 2 which was designed and utilized in previous studies 17 24 26 the pcr products were then purified and sequenced using solgent co deajeon korea the obtained sequences were searched on the national center for biotechnology information ncbi bethesda md usa database to look for close relatives the phylogenetic relationship of the newly isolated bacteria with their closest relatives and previously reported as iii oxidizing bacteria and sb iii oxidizing bacteria were analyzed using mega x 32 phylogenetic trees based on the 16s rrna sequence and the aioa protein sequence were constructed using clustalw 33 and the neighbor joining method 34 2 8 genbank accession numbers the partial 16s rrna sequences of strains vka1 vka2 vka3 and vka4 have been deposited in genbank under accession numbers mt754792 mt754793 mt754794 and mt754795 respectively the genbank accession numbers for the partial aioa genes from strain vka3 and vka4 are mt755610 and mt755611 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 isolation of new as iii oxidizing bacteria after spreading the enrichment culture from the activated sludge four morphologically different colonies were selected and purified by continuous streaking on fresh agar plates through the analysis of the 16s rrna gene these isolates were found to be different strains vka1 vka2 vka3 and vka4 after cultivating them in minimal medium amended with 1 mm as iii only strains vka3 and vka4 exhibited the as iii oxidation ability whereas strain vka1 and vka2 grew well in the presence of as iii representing that strains vka1 and vka2 are as resistant bacteria therefore autotrophic as iii oxidizing bacterial strains vka3 and vka4 were further investigated as potential bacteria for environmental as remediation 3 2 aerobic as iii oxidation by newly isolated bacteria grown autotrophically and heterotrophically autotrophic oxidation of 2 mm as iii by strain vka3 was completed within 60 h of incubation corresponding to an as iii removal rate of 33 33 μm h whereas it took 72 h for strain vka4 for complete oxidation of 2 mm as iii corresponding to an as iii removal rate of 27 78 μm h fig 1 the as iii removal rates of strains vka3 and vka4 were lower than that of acinetobacter sp jhs3 isolated from an as contaminated soil 24 but higher than that of klebsiella sp jhw3 isolated from as contaminated water 24 there was also a slight difference in the growth pattern of both strains the cell density of strain vka4 reached a higher value than that of strain vka3 during the incubation the increase in cell density of each bacterial culture was entirely correlated with the oxidation of as iii indicating the dependence of cell growth on as iii oxidation which inferred the chemolithoautotrophic growth of both strains the removal of as iii was well matched with the formation of as v in each culture at every sampling point revealing that there were no intermediate metabolites of as between as iii and as v besides the stabilization of total as concentration in the culture during the incubation indicated that neither as biosorption nor as precipitation occurred in the culture the concentration of as iii in the abiotic control without bacterial inoculation remained constant until the end of incubation confirming that the as iii oxidation by both strains vka3 and vka4 were microbially catalyzed in the presence of 0 1 yeast heterotrophic growth of both strains vka3 and vka4 can rapidly remove 2 mm as iii within 27 h fig 2 similar to other facultative chemolithoautotrophic as iii oxidizing bacteria 24 35 the growth of strain vka3 and vka4 were significantly accelerated when being provided with yeast extract the corresponding rate of as iii removal was 74 07 μm h which is much higher than the autotrophic growth of both strains like the autotrophic growth cell density of strain vka4 was higher than that of vka3 during the incubation however the cell density of both strains was nearly 10 fold higher than those under the autotrophic condition this phenomenon was well reported previously with the facultative chemolithoautotrophic as iii oxidizing bacteria isolated from mine tailings 35 36 under heterotrophic growth neither biosorption nor bioprecipitation of as occurred which is confirmed by the stabilization of total as until the end of the test both bacterial strains were easily adapted to heterotrophic condition even though they were isolated through an autotrophic protocol which indicated that they might flexibly perform as iii oxidation regardless of the presence of organic matters in the contaminated water source 3 3 kinetics of aerobically autotrophic as iii oxidation the kinetics of as iii oxidation for both the isolated bacteria were completely different fig 3 however the r2 values obtained from the eadie hofstee plot for each strain indicated that the kinetics of as iii oxidation for both strains fit well with the monod model for the growth of microorganisms the maximum specific as iii oxidation rate μmax of strain vka3 calculated from experimental data was 2 fold higher than that of strain vka4 124 16 μm h vs 59 00 μm h and the ks value of vka3 was 2 5 fold higher than that of strain vka4 4407 19 μm vs 1787 03 μm this indicated that strain vka3 required quite a high initial as iii concentration to achieve the maximum as iii oxidation rate the kinetic parameters ks and μmax of both strains were slightly lower after optimization to fit the monod model table 1 the kinetic parameters of strain vka3 were similar to those of klebsiella sp jhw3 isolated from as contaminated water 24 similarly the kinetic parameters of strain vka4 were similar to those of acinetobacter sp jhs3 isolated from as contaminated soil 24 the ks value of strain vka3 was much higher than that of the majority of as iii oxidizing bacteria reported in the previous studies table 1 however the μmax values of strain vka3 and vka4 were significantly lower than those of achromobacter sp spb 31 and bordetella sp spb 24 37 the lowest ks value of as iii oxidation kinetics was reported to be 3 39 μm which is from agrobacterium albertimagni aol15 isolated from hot creek california 38 in general the kinetics of as iii oxidation by both isolated strains are moderately high when compared to other reported strains in the literature they can be potential strains for further applications in bioremediation of water source highly contaminated with as because the high oxidation rate was obtained at high initial as iii concentration under the aerobic condition strain vka3 would be a better option for future studies due to its higher as iii oxidation rate 3 4 anaerobic as iii oxidation by the newly isolated bacteria vka3 and vka4 strains can grow anaerobically and autotrophically oxidize as iii to as v using nitrate as the sole electron acceptor fig 4 however the anaerobic growth of both strains resulted in a much lower cell density compared to the aerobic growth of both strains the maximum cell densities of strains vka3 and vka4 in the anaerobic cultivation were 0 067 abs and 0 063 abs respectively the stabilization of total as in both strain cultures indicated that neither biosorption nor bioprecipitation of as occurred during the anaerobic growth of the strains as iii oxidation coupled with nitrate reduction makes these strains the potential microorganisms for bioremediation of groundwater and soil contaminated with both as and nitrate considering the as iii oxidation rate and as iii oxidation efficiency the anaerobic as iii oxidation by strain vka4 was better than that by strain vka3 which is the opposite to the aerobic as iii oxidation by these strains the lag phase in the growth of vka3 was clearly observed within the initial 36 h indicating the acclimation stage of strain vka3 during the transition from aerobic to anaerobic conditions fig 4 a neither significant cell growth nor as iii oxidation was observed in the initial 36 h however the cell density of strain vka3 increased rapidly from 0 005 abs to 0 067 abs within the next 48 h of incubation and slightly decreased at the end of incubation during this stage 1 4 mm no3 n was completely reduced and 0 19 mm no2 n was obtained as the intermediate metabolite of nitrate reduction at the 48 h sampling point neither no3 n nor no2 n were present at the end of the test imbalance to no3 n reduction only 0 48 mm as iii was oxidized to as v although the equivalent electron acceptors through no3 n were much higher in number than the equivalent electron donors required for complete as iii oxidation it revealed that a part of no3 n might be consumed by strain vka3 through an assimilatory pathway simultaneously with a dissimilatory reduction therefore the as iii oxidation ceased when no more electron acceptors were available in the culture a higher ratio of no3 n should be provided for the growth of strain vka3 under anaerobic conditions 39 this is similar to the growth requirement of klebsiella sp jhw3 24 under the same conditions contrary to strain vka3 strain vka4 could completely oxidize 1 1 mm as iii after 120 h of incubation fig 4 b no3 n was also reduced simultaneously with the oxidation of as iii and no3 n did not accumulate in the culture medium at the end of the test interestingly no no2 n was detected during the growth of strain vka4 indicating that no3 n reduction by strain vka4 occurred through a different pathway as compared to strain vka3 no3 n might be directly reduced to gaseous forms of nitrogen and not via the intermediate metabolite no2 n the cell density of strain vka4 under anaerobic conditions reached the maximum value after 60 h and it remained at a steady state until the end of the incubation the mechanism of anaerobic nitrate reduction by strain vka4 was quite different from those by arsenite oxidizing bacteria reported in the literature 19 20 40 most of the previous studies detected nitrite an intermediate metabolite of nitrate during the growth of as iii oxidizing denitrifying isolates 3 5 oxidation of sb iii to sb v by the newly isolated arsenite oxidizing bacteria strains vka3 and vka4 can oxidize sb iii to sb v under aerobic conditions fig 5 strain vka3 completely eliminated 200 μm of sb iii within 66 h of incubation whereas strain vka4 achieved the same in 54 h the microbial oxidation of sb iii to sb v by both strains was certified by the stable concentration of sb iii in the abiotic control without bacterial inoculation similar to the growth with as iii either biosorption or bioprecipitation of sb was observed in the culture of strains vka3 and vka4 which is indicated through the stable concentration of total sb during the incubation this is different from some previous studies on microbial sb iii oxidation which suggested that the difference in the total sb level between the start and the end of the experiment was due to biosorption or bioprecipitation 17 18 25 the increase in the concentration of sb v in both bacterial strain cultures corresponded well with the decreases in the sb iii concentration revealing that no intermediate metabolites were produced between sb iii and sb v in either culture the maximum cell density of strain vka3 with sb iii was similar to that obtained in the culture with as iii the maximum cell density of strain vka4 with sb iii was higher than that of the same strain cultured with as iii sb iii oxidation can be observed in the culture of strain vka3 only after 18 h when the cell density was partially developed the lag phase of sb iii oxidation was even longer in the culture of strain vka4 in which sb iii oxidation started after 30 h of incubation however the corresponding sb iii oxidation rate of strain vka4 was higher than that of strain vka3 3 87 μm h vs 3 17 μm h opposite results were obtained for the aerobic growth with as iii the sb iii oxidation rates of strains vka3 and vka4 were nearly half those of shinella sp nls1 and ensifer sp nls4 17 however these sb iii oxidation rates by strains vka3 and vka4 were much higher than those reported by other studies on microbial sb iii oxidation under the same conditions 18 21 23 25 27 the ability of sb iii oxidation with a considerably high reaction rate expressed the potential of widespread utilization of these newly isolated as iii oxidizing bacteria for environmental remediation this is because the natural water and soil are not only contaminated with as but also many other co contaminants sb is a common co contaminant of as in the natural environment 41 44 3 6 phylogenetic study of the newly isolated as iii oxidizing bacteria phylogenetic analysis indicated that three of the isolated bacteria i e the as resistant bacterial strain vka2 and the two as iii oxidizing bacterial strains vka3 and vka4 were affiliated with alphaproteobacteria whereas the as resistant bacterial strain vka1 was affiliated with actinobacteria fig 6 strain vka1 shared 100 sequence similarity with both rhodococcus degradans strain ccm 4446 and rhodococcus qingshengii jcm 15 477 based on 99 query coverage further on the same query coverage the sequence of strain vka1 showed 99 37 similarity to nocardia coeliaca strain dsm 44595 it could be said that strain vka1 represents a strain of the genus rhodococcus strain vka2 fell within the cluster of the genus ochrobactrum it shared high sequence similarity with different species of this genus including ochrobactrum lupini strain lup21 99 92 ochrobactrum tritici strain scii24 99 59 and ochrobactrum thiophenivorans strain dsm 7216 98 53 based on 100 query coverage therefore strain vka2 could be a new strain of the genus ochrobactrum it is interesting that strains vka3 and vka4 were affiliated with two different branches within the cluster of the genus shinella they shared 97 92 sequence similarity based on 99 sequence coverage this indicated that they could belong to different species of the same genus the difference between the strains with respect to their in growth patterns in the presence of as iii and sb iii once again confirmed that they are different strains the closest relative of strain vka3 was shinella yambaruensis strain ms4 which shared 99 83 sequence identity and with bootstrap support of 100 moreover strain vka3 exhibited a high sequence similarity 98 34 to shinella fusca strain dc 196 strain vka4 showed the highest sequence similarity 99 90 to shinella curvata strain c3 other relatives of strain vka4 were shinella granuli strain ch06 98 93 sequence identity and shinella zoogloeoides strain atcc 19 623 98 44 sequence identity in the phylogenetic tree fig 6 strain vka4 was affiliated with a separate branch which was clustered with another branch containing shinella sp strain nls1 99 bootstrap strain vka4 shared 100 sequence similarity based on 87 query coverage with shinella sp strain nls1 which is a previously reported sb iii oxidizing bacterium 17 strain vka3 shared 97 40 sequence similarity based on 99 query coverage with strain nls1 in a previous study 17 strain nls1 isolated from sb contaminated soil was reported to oxidize sb iii and as iii simultaneously however this strain cannot grow anaerobically which is in contrast to strains vka3 and vka4 isolated from activated sludge in this study further strains vka3 and vka4 shared 96 59 87 coverage and 97 96 sequence similarity 74 coverage respectively to shinella sp strain c23 which is a chemolithoautotrophic as iii oxidizing bacteria isolated from mine tailings 45 from this study two more bacteria oxidizing both as iii and sb iii were added to the genus shinella of the class alphaproteobacteria fig 6 shows that most of the newly added sb iii oxidizing bacteria belong to betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria whereas more as iii oxidizing bacteria belong to alphaproteobacteria more studies are required to update the diversity of as iii and sb iii oxidizing bacteria 3 7 characterization of the aioa gene in the isolated bacteria pcr experiments with primers for amplifying aioa arsenite oxidase indicated that strains vka3 and vka4 possess the aioa gene this matched the results obtained in a previous study with another strain of the genus shinella isolated from sb contaminated soil 17 strains vka3 vka4 and nls1 possess the aioa gene and can perform as iii and sb iii oxidation in aerobic conditions this demonstrated that arsenite oxidase aioa can also function as antimonite oxidase 28 however this does not imply that a bacterium possessing the aioa gene can perform aerobic as iii and sb iii oxidation it has been reported in a previous study 18 that strain idsbo 1 possessing the aioa gene cannot perform aerobic sb iii oxidation the aerobic sb iii oxidation could also be catalyzed by a different pathway 23 27 46 in the phylogenetic tree of protein sequences obtained from the amplified aioa gene of vka3 vka4 and other related as iii sb iii oxidizing bacteria fig 7 vka3 and vka4 were clustered into a separate branch with 63 bootstrap the aioa protein sequences of strains vka3 and vka4 shared 100 similarity with 99 query coverage they also show high similarity to the proteins sequences of shinella sp nls1 96 97 and shinella sp strain c23 96 36 despite belonging to the same genus the aioa protein sequences of strains vka3 and vka4 shared only 86 14 identity with the aioa protein of shinella sp strain cug3 whereas they exhibited high identity with the proteins from other genera including agrobacterium 97 59 27 ochrobactrum 96 39 rhizobium 96 97 45 and pseudomonas 96 97 45 4 conclusions this study successfully isolated and cultivated chemolithoautotrophic as iii oxidizing bacteria from the activated sludge of a wastewater treatment plant which is an easily accessible microbial source both the isolated strains vka3 and vka4 were determined to be different strains belonging to the genus shinella they are facultative autotrophic bacteria that flexibly grow heterotrophically in the presence of organic matter or grow anaerobically and perform as iii oxidation coupled with nitrate reduction their growth and as iii oxidation rates were enhanced even during heterotrophic growth with yeast extract strain vka3 exhibited higher kinetic parameters which are more relevant than those of strain vka4 for future applications both these versatile bacteria can also oxidize sb iii to sb v under aerobic conditions and they can potentially be used for bioremediation of as and sb under various conditions the arsenite oxidase large subunit aioa gene expressed in both isolates was believed to be the factor that controls both as iii and sb iii oxidation more detailed studies are required to clarify the actual pathway of as iii and sb iii oxidation by these isolated strains declaration of competing

13681,two bacterial strains belonging to the genus shinella were isolated from the activated sludge of a domestic wastewater treatment plant and could autotrophically oxidize as iii to as v under aerobic conditions kinetic studies indicated that the autotrophic as iii oxidation rate of both strains matched the monod model well and strain vka3 exhibited higher kinetic parameters compared to strain vka4 μmax 124 16 μm h and ks 4407 19 μm vs μmax 59 00 μm h and ks 1787 03 μm the versatility of both strains was expressed through their flexible growth under heterotrophic conditions in the presence of yeast extract and anaerobic as iii coupled with denitrification both strains can oxidize sb iii to sb v under aerobic conditions the arsenite oxidase aioa gene which might be involved in as iii and sb iii oxidation was detected in the isolated strains this study demonstrated that the versatile bacteria with potential applications for bioremediation of as and sb could be obtained from an easily accessible microbiological source abbreviations pcr polymerase chain reaction ncbi national center for biotechnology information keywords monod model microbial oxidation arsenite antimonite activated sludges 1 introduction arsenic as is a well known toxic metalloid found in the upper crust of the earth owing to its toxicity it was previously used as a wood preservative to prevent the growth of insects bacteria and fungi 1 and as an antibiotic in medicals 2 it is also used in a variety of alloys and has many applications in the electronics industry owing to its chemical properties 3 the extensive use of as compounds has resulted in the continuous accumulation of as in the natural environment the serious health problems 4 caused by chronic exposure to as have not only driven the scientific community to study as remediation technologies but have also resulted in more guidelines being established for as levels in products used by humans together with sb an element in the same group that shares some similar characteristics as was included in the priority pollutant list by environmental protection agencies in many countries the world health organization provided the guideline value of 10 μg l for as 5 and 5 μg l for sb 6 in drinking water despite occurring ubiquitously in many chemical forms only the inorganic forms of as and sb exhibit an acute toxic effect on human health 7 8 inorganic as and sb are commonly found in trivalent as iii and sb iii and pentavalent as v and sb v oxidation states in the natural environment 7 9 although both as and sb are non essential elements for living organisms some microorganisms can metabolize their compounds to detoxify them or use their compounds as partial or sole energy sources 10 the microbial oxidation of as iii to as v and sb iii to sb v would help reduce their toxicity and change their mobility in the environment some treatment technologies show a more positive reduction efficiency on the pentavalent forms of as and sb than the trivalent forms 11 13 the coupling of microbial oxidation of as iii to as v followed by as v adsorption on goethite has been successfully demonstrated 14 a phylogenetically widespread range of as iii and sb iii oxidizing bacteria was isolated and investigated for their performance under both autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions 15 17 some of them can perform anaerobic as iii and sb iii oxidation coupled with denitrification 17 20 most of them originated from as and sb contaminated samples such as mine soils 21 22 and tailings 23 and contaminated soils 17 waters 24 and sediments 18 25 in the research on the pathway of as iii oxidation the aioa gene was widely recognized to encodes arsenite oxidase large subunit it was extensively used as a biomarker to evaluate the abundance and diversity of as iii oxidizing microorganisms in various aquatic and soil environments 26 although a different pathway of as iii and sb iii oxidation was implicated 23 27 a recent study found that arsenite oxidase could also function as antimonite oxidase 28 besides the aioa gene was detected in many newly isolated sb iii oxidizing bacteria 17 18 therefore the arsenite oxidase large subunit was believed to be partially involved and functions as an antimonite oxidase in this study an activated sludge from a domestic wastewater treatment plant was introduced for the enrichment and isolation of autotrophic as iii oxidizing bacteria the kinetic model of microbial as iii oxidation was also investigated the versatile application of the isolated strain was tested by heterotrophic growth in the presence of organic matter and anaerobic growth with nitrate as the sole electron acceptor the application of the isolated bacteria for bioremediation was tested using sb iii the evolutionary history of the newly isolated strain was studied through 16s rrna sequencing and the arsenite oxidase aioa gene which is usually involved in as iii and sb iii oxidation was characterized 2 material and methods 2 1 autotrophic as iii oxidizing bacterial enrichment and isolation activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant was inoculated into a minimal medium 24 29 containing 0 1 g l nh4cl 0 1 g l kh2po4 0 012 g l cacl2 2h2o 0 05 g l kcl 1 ml l vitamin solution gamborg s vitamin solution 1000 merck kgaa darmstadt germany and 1 ml l mineral solution 30 as iii 1 mm was added to the culture from the stock solution of naaso2 bicarbonate as 0 5 g l nahco3 was supplied as an inorganic carbon source for chemolithoautotrophic bacterial growth after 1 week of incubation in a shaking incubator at 25 c and 200 rpm the enrichment culture was subcultured to the fresh medium with an inoculum ratio of 1 the subcultivation was conductedthrice consecutively using the same medium added with as iii and bicarbonate as above the enrichment culture was serially diluted and spread on an agar plate containing the same constituents as the enrichment medium colonies appearing on the plate after 5 d of incubation at 25 c were selected and purified by continuous streaking on new agar plates until pure cultures were obtained the pure cultures were then transferred to liquid medium for subsequent experiments 2 2 aerobic as iii oxidation with and without yeast extract to investigate the heterotrophic growth of the newly isolated autotrophic as iii oxidizing bacteria 0 1 yeast extract was additionally added to the minimal medium the aerobic growth of isolated bacteria with and without yeast extract was tested with 2 mm as iii all experiments were conducted in triplicate and incubated at 25 c and 200 rpm samples were periodically taken from cultures and the cell growth and as iii and as v concentrations were measured an abiotic control in which no bacterium was inoculated was simultaneously included in each experiment to confirm the microbial reaction 2 3 kinetics of autotrophic as iii oxidation by the isolated bacteria the kinetics of autotrophic as iii oxidation by the isolated bacteria was investigated at 25 c and 200 rpm with the initial as iii concentration range of 50 10 000 μm the kinetic rate of microbial as iii oxidation was calculated according to the following empirical monod equation μ μ m a x s k s s where μ μm h is the specific as iii oxidation rate of bacteria μmax μm h is the maximum specific as iii oxidation rate s μm is the initial molar concentration of as iii and ks μm is the half velocity constant the ks value represents the initial as iii concentration at which the obtained specific as iii oxidation rate is half of μmax the ks and μmax were obtained from the eadie hofstee plot the obtained values were then optimized using solver in microsoft excel 2 4 anaerobic as iii oxidation with nitrate as the sole electron acceptor the anaerobic growth of the isolated autotrophic as iii oxidizing bacteria was tested using nitrate as nano3 as the sole electron acceptor the experiment was conducted using the serum bottle with a working volume of 100 ml the headspace was purged with argon gas for 20 min to remove the air the test was carried out with 1 mm as iii and 1 4 mm no3 at 25 c and 200 rpm samples were periodically taken for monitoring cell growth and the as iii as v no3 and no2 levels 2 5 aerobic sb iii oxidation by the newly isolated as iii oxidizing bacteria to test the aerobic sb iii oxidation ability of the newly isolated as iii oxidizing bacteria the bacteria were cultured in the same medium under the same condition for aerobic as iii oxidation as mentioned earlier but 200 μm sb iii as ksbc4h4o7 0 5h2o was added to the culture instead of as iii the culture was incubated at 25 c and 200 rpm and samples were taken for monitoring the cell growth and sb iii and sb v levels 2 6 analytical techniques the cell growth in each culture was estimated by measuring the optical density of the culture medium at a wavelength of 600 nm using a spectrophotometer uv vis double beam model uvd 3200 labomed inc los angeles ca usa the as iii and as v concentrations were determined using a dionexultimate 3000 high performance liquid chromatography system thermo fisher scientific inc waltham ma usa as described in our previous studies 24 the total soluble as in the culture was calculated as the sum of as iii and as v the sb v no2 and no3 concentrations were determined using an ion chromatography system ic dx 300 dionex sunnyvale ca usa according to the protocol described previously 17 the total sb concentration was determined by a laser ablation microprobe inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer lam icp ms perkin elmer elan drc e up 213 massachusetts usa the sb iii concentration was calculated as the difference between the total sb and the sb v concentration 2 7 genomic analysis and phylogenetic study colonies of isolated bacteria grown on agar plates were collected for dna extraction using the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio lab carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s protocol dna samples were used as a template for further genomic analysis to determine the evolutionary history of the isolated bacteria the 16s rrna gene of each bacterium was amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr with universal primers eub 8 f and eub 1392r according to a protocol described in our previous studies 31 the arsenite oxidation aioa gene of each isolated bacterium was detected using pcr with primer set 2 which was designed and utilized in previous studies 17 24 26 the pcr products were then purified and sequenced using solgent co deajeon korea the obtained sequences were searched on the national center for biotechnology information ncbi bethesda md usa database to look for close relatives the phylogenetic relationship of the newly isolated bacteria with their closest relatives and previously reported as iii oxidizing bacteria and sb iii oxidizing bacteria were analyzed using mega x 32 phylogenetic trees based on the 16s rrna sequence and the aioa protein sequence were constructed using clustalw 33 and the neighbor joining method 34 2 8 genbank accession numbers the partial 16s rrna sequences of strains vka1 vka2 vka3 and vka4 have been deposited in genbank under accession numbers mt754792 mt754793 mt754794 and mt754795 respectively the genbank accession numbers for the partial aioa genes from strain vka3 and vka4 are mt755610 and mt755611 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 isolation of new as iii oxidizing bacteria after spreading the enrichment culture from the activated sludge four morphologically different colonies were selected and purified by continuous streaking on fresh agar plates through the analysis of the 16s rrna gene these isolates were found to be different strains vka1 vka2 vka3 and vka4 after cultivating them in minimal medium amended with 1 mm as iii only strains vka3 and vka4 exhibited the as iii oxidation ability whereas strain vka1 and vka2 grew well in the presence of as iii representing that strains vka1 and vka2 are as resistant bacteria therefore autotrophic as iii oxidizing bacterial strains vka3 and vka4 were further investigated as potential bacteria for environmental as remediation 3 2 aerobic as iii oxidation by newly isolated bacteria grown autotrophically and heterotrophically autotrophic oxidation of 2 mm as iii by strain vka3 was completed within 60 h of incubation corresponding to an as iii removal rate of 33 33 μm h whereas it took 72 h for strain vka4 for complete oxidation of 2 mm as iii corresponding to an as iii removal rate of 27 78 μm h fig 1 the as iii removal rates of strains vka3 and vka4 were lower than that of acinetobacter sp jhs3 isolated from an as contaminated soil 24 but higher than that of klebsiella sp jhw3 isolated from as contaminated water 24 there was also a slight difference in the growth pattern of both strains the cell density of strain vka4 reached a higher value than that of strain vka3 during the incubation the increase in cell density of each bacterial culture was entirely correlated with the oxidation of as iii indicating the dependence of cell growth on as iii oxidation which inferred the chemolithoautotrophic growth of both strains the removal of as iii was well matched with the formation of as v in each culture at every sampling point revealing that there were no intermediate metabolites of as between as iii and as v besides the stabilization of total as concentration in the culture during the incubation indicated that neither as biosorption nor as precipitation occurred in the culture the concentration of as iii in the abiotic control without bacterial inoculation remained constant until the end of incubation confirming that the as iii oxidation by both strains vka3 and vka4 were microbially catalyzed in the presence of 0 1 yeast heterotrophic growth of both strains vka3 and vka4 can rapidly remove 2 mm as iii within 27 h fig 2 similar to other facultative chemolithoautotrophic as iii oxidizing bacteria 24 35 the growth of strain vka3 and vka4 were significantly accelerated when being provided with yeast extract the corresponding rate of as iii removal was 74 07 μm h which is much higher than the autotrophic growth of both strains like the autotrophic growth cell density of strain vka4 was higher than that of vka3 during the incubation however the cell density of both strains was nearly 10 fold higher than those under the autotrophic condition this phenomenon was well reported previously with the facultative chemolithoautotrophic as iii oxidizing bacteria isolated from mine tailings 35 36 under heterotrophic growth neither biosorption nor bioprecipitation of as occurred which is confirmed by the stabilization of total as until the end of the test both bacterial strains were easily adapted to heterotrophic condition even though they were isolated through an autotrophic protocol which indicated that they might flexibly perform as iii oxidation regardless of the presence of organic matters in the contaminated water source 3 3 kinetics of aerobically autotrophic as iii oxidation the kinetics of as iii oxidation for both the isolated bacteria were completely different fig 3 however the r2 values obtained from the eadie hofstee plot for each strain indicated that the kinetics of as iii oxidation for both strains fit well with the monod model for the growth of microorganisms the maximum specific as iii oxidation rate μmax of strain vka3 calculated from experimental data was 2 fold higher than that of strain vka4 124 16 μm h vs 59 00 μm h and the ks value of vka3 was 2 5 fold higher than that of strain vka4 4407 19 μm vs 1787 03 μm this indicated that strain vka3 required quite a high initial as iii concentration to achieve the maximum as iii oxidation rate the kinetic parameters ks and μmax of both strains were slightly lower after optimization to fit the monod model table 1 the kinetic parameters of strain vka3 were similar to those of klebsiella sp jhw3 isolated from as contaminated water 24 similarly the kinetic parameters of strain vka4 were similar to those of acinetobacter sp jhs3 isolated from as contaminated soil 24 the ks value of strain vka3 was much higher than that of the majority of as iii oxidizing bacteria reported in the previous studies table 1 however the μmax values of strain vka3 and vka4 were significantly lower than those of achromobacter sp spb 31 and bordetella sp spb 24 37 the lowest ks value of as iii oxidation kinetics was reported to be 3 39 μm which is from agrobacterium albertimagni aol15 isolated from hot creek california 38 in general the kinetics of as iii oxidation by both isolated strains are moderately high when compared to other reported strains in the literature they can be potential strains for further applications in bioremediation of water source highly contaminated with as because the high oxidation rate was obtained at high initial as iii concentration under the aerobic condition strain vka3 would be a better option for future studies due to its higher as iii oxidation rate 3 4 anaerobic as iii oxidation by the newly isolated bacteria vka3 and vka4 strains can grow anaerobically and autotrophically oxidize as iii to as v using nitrate as the sole electron acceptor fig 4 however the anaerobic growth of both strains resulted in a much lower cell density compared to the aerobic growth of both strains the maximum cell densities of strains vka3 and vka4 in the anaerobic cultivation were 0 067 abs and 0 063 abs respectively the stabilization of total as in both strain cultures indicated that neither biosorption nor bioprecipitation of as occurred during the anaerobic growth of the strains as iii oxidation coupled with nitrate reduction makes these strains the potential microorganisms for bioremediation of groundwater and soil contaminated with both as and nitrate considering the as iii oxidation rate and as iii oxidation efficiency the anaerobic as iii oxidation by strain vka4 was better than that by strain vka3 which is the opposite to the aerobic as iii oxidation by these strains the lag phase in the growth of vka3 was clearly observed within the initial 36 h indicating the acclimation stage of strain vka3 during the transition from aerobic to anaerobic conditions fig 4 a neither significant cell growth nor as iii oxidation was observed in the initial 36 h however the cell density of strain vka3 increased rapidly from 0 005 abs to 0 067 abs within the next 48 h of incubation and slightly decreased at the end of incubation during this stage 1 4 mm no3 n was completely reduced and 0 19 mm no2 n was obtained as the intermediate metabolite of nitrate reduction at the 48 h sampling point neither no3 n nor no2 n were present at the end of the test imbalance to no3 n reduction only 0 48 mm as iii was oxidized to as v although the equivalent electron acceptors through no3 n were much higher in number than the equivalent electron donors required for complete as iii oxidation it revealed that a part of no3 n might be consumed by strain vka3 through an assimilatory pathway simultaneously with a dissimilatory reduction therefore the as iii oxidation ceased when no more electron acceptors were available in the culture a higher ratio of no3 n should be provided for the growth of strain vka3 under anaerobic conditions 39 this is similar to the growth requirement of klebsiella sp jhw3 24 under the same conditions contrary to strain vka3 strain vka4 could completely oxidize 1 1 mm as iii after 120 h of incubation fig 4 b no3 n was also reduced simultaneously with the oxidation of as iii and no3 n did not accumulate in the culture medium at the end of the test interestingly no no2 n was detected during the growth of strain vka4 indicating that no3 n reduction by strain vka4 occurred through a different pathway as compared to strain vka3 no3 n might be directly reduced to gaseous forms of nitrogen and not via the intermediate metabolite no2 n the cell density of strain vka4 under anaerobic conditions reached the maximum value after 60 h and it remained at a steady state until the end of the incubation the mechanism of anaerobic nitrate reduction by strain vka4 was quite different from those by arsenite oxidizing bacteria reported in the literature 19 20 40 most of the previous studies detected nitrite an intermediate metabolite of nitrate during the growth of as iii oxidizing denitrifying isolates 3 5 oxidation of sb iii to sb v by the newly isolated arsenite oxidizing bacteria strains vka3 and vka4 can oxidize sb iii to sb v under aerobic conditions fig 5 strain vka3 completely eliminated 200 μm of sb iii within 66 h of incubation whereas strain vka4 achieved the same in 54 h the microbial oxidation of sb iii to sb v by both strains was certified by the stable concentration of sb iii in the abiotic control without bacterial inoculation similar to the growth with as iii either biosorption or bioprecipitation of sb was observed in the culture of strains vka3 and vka4 which is indicated through the stable concentration of total sb during the incubation this is different from some previous studies on microbial sb iii oxidation which suggested that the difference in the total sb level between the start and the end of the experiment was due to biosorption or bioprecipitation 17 18 25 the increase in the concentration of sb v in both bacterial strain cultures corresponded well with the decreases in the sb iii concentration revealing that no intermediate metabolites were produced between sb iii and sb v in either culture the maximum cell density of strain vka3 with sb iii was similar to that obtained in the culture with as iii the maximum cell density of strain vka4 with sb iii was higher than that of the same strain cultured with as iii sb iii oxidation can be observed in the culture of strain vka3 only after 18 h when the cell density was partially developed the lag phase of sb iii oxidation was even longer in the culture of strain vka4 in which sb iii oxidation started after 30 h of incubation however the corresponding sb iii oxidation rate of strain vka4 was higher than that of strain vka3 3 87 μm h vs 3 17 μm h opposite results were obtained for the aerobic growth with as iii the sb iii oxidation rates of strains vka3 and vka4 were nearly half those of shinella sp nls1 and ensifer sp nls4 17 however these sb iii oxidation rates by strains vka3 and vka4 were much higher than those reported by other studies on microbial sb iii oxidation under the same conditions 18 21 23 25 27 the ability of sb iii oxidation with a considerably high reaction rate expressed the potential of widespread utilization of these newly isolated as iii oxidizing bacteria for environmental remediation this is because the natural water and soil are not only contaminated with as but also many other co contaminants sb is a common co contaminant of as in the natural environment 41 44 3 6 phylogenetic study of the newly isolated as iii oxidizing bacteria phylogenetic analysis indicated that three of the isolated bacteria i e the as resistant bacterial strain vka2 and the two as iii oxidizing bacterial strains vka3 and vka4 were affiliated with alphaproteobacteria whereas the as resistant bacterial strain vka1 was affiliated with actinobacteria fig 6 strain vka1 shared 100 sequence similarity with both rhodococcus degradans strain ccm 4446 and rhodococcus qingshengii jcm 15 477 based on 99 query coverage further on the same query coverage the sequence of strain vka1 showed 99 37 similarity to nocardia coeliaca strain dsm 44595 it could be said that strain vka1 represents a strain of the genus rhodococcus strain vka2 fell within the cluster of the genus ochrobactrum it shared high sequence similarity with different species of this genus including ochrobactrum lupini strain lup21 99 92 ochrobactrum tritici strain scii24 99 59 and ochrobactrum thiophenivorans strain dsm 7216 98 53 based on 100 query coverage therefore strain vka2 could be a new strain of the genus ochrobactrum it is interesting that strains vka3 and vka4 were affiliated with two different branches within the cluster of the genus shinella they shared 97 92 sequence similarity based on 99 sequence coverage this indicated that they could belong to different species of the same genus the difference between the strains with respect to their in growth patterns in the presence of as iii and sb iii once again confirmed that they are different strains the closest relative of strain vka3 was shinella yambaruensis strain ms4 which shared 99 83 sequence identity and with bootstrap support of 100 moreover strain vka3 exhibited a high sequence similarity 98 34 to shinella fusca strain dc 196 strain vka4 showed the highest sequence similarity 99 90 to shinella curvata strain c3 other relatives of strain vka4 were shinella granuli strain ch06 98 93 sequence identity and shinella zoogloeoides strain atcc 19 623 98 44 sequence identity in the phylogenetic tree fig 6 strain vka4 was affiliated with a separate branch which was clustered with another branch containing shinella sp strain nls1 99 bootstrap strain vka4 shared 100 sequence similarity based on 87 query coverage with shinella sp strain nls1 which is a previously reported sb iii oxidizing bacterium 17 strain vka3 shared 97 40 sequence similarity based on 99 query coverage with strain nls1 in a previous study 17 strain nls1 isolated from sb contaminated soil was reported to oxidize sb iii and as iii simultaneously however this strain cannot grow anaerobically which is in contrast to strains vka3 and vka4 isolated from activated sludge in this study further strains vka3 and vka4 shared 96 59 87 coverage and 97 96 sequence similarity 74 coverage respectively to shinella sp strain c23 which is a chemolithoautotrophic as iii oxidizing bacteria isolated from mine tailings 45 from this study two more bacteria oxidizing both as iii and sb iii were added to the genus shinella of the class alphaproteobacteria fig 6 shows that most of the newly added sb iii oxidizing bacteria belong to betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria whereas more as iii oxidizing bacteria belong to alphaproteobacteria more studies are required to update the diversity of as iii and sb iii oxidizing bacteria 3 7 characterization of the aioa gene in the isolated bacteria pcr experiments with primers for amplifying aioa arsenite oxidase indicated that strains vka3 and vka4 possess the aioa gene this matched the results obtained in a previous study with another strain of the genus shinella isolated from sb contaminated soil 17 strains vka3 vka4 and nls1 possess the aioa gene and can perform as iii and sb iii oxidation in aerobic conditions this demonstrated that arsenite oxidase aioa can also function as antimonite oxidase 28 however this does not imply that a bacterium possessing the aioa gene can perform aerobic as iii and sb iii oxidation it has been reported in a previous study 18 that strain idsbo 1 possessing the aioa gene cannot perform aerobic sb iii oxidation the aerobic sb iii oxidation could also be catalyzed by a different pathway 23 27 46 in the phylogenetic tree of protein sequences obtained from the amplified aioa gene of vka3 vka4 and other related as iii sb iii oxidizing bacteria fig 7 vka3 and vka4 were clustered into a separate branch with 63 bootstrap the aioa protein sequences of strains vka3 and vka4 shared 100 similarity with 99 query coverage they also show high similarity to the proteins sequences of shinella sp nls1 96 97 and shinella sp strain c23 96 36 despite belonging to the same genus the aioa protein sequences of strains vka3 and vka4 shared only 86 14 identity with the aioa protein of shinella sp strain cug3 whereas they exhibited high identity with the proteins from other genera including agrobacterium 97 59 27 ochrobactrum 96 39 rhizobium 96 97 45 and pseudomonas 96 97 45 4 conclusions this study successfully isolated and cultivated chemolithoautotrophic as iii oxidizing bacteria from the activated sludge of a wastewater treatment plant which is an easily accessible microbial source both the isolated strains vka3 and vka4 were determined to be different strains belonging to the genus shinella they are facultative autotrophic bacteria that flexibly grow heterotrophically in the presence of organic matter or grow anaerobically and perform as iii oxidation coupled with nitrate reduction their growth and as iii oxidation rates were enhanced even during heterotrophic growth with yeast extract strain vka3 exhibited higher kinetic parameters which are more relevant than those of strain vka4 for future applications both these versatile bacteria can also oxidize sb iii to sb v under aerobic conditions and they can potentially be used for bioremediation of as and sb under various conditions the arsenite oxidase large subunit aioa gene expressed in both isolates was believed to be the factor that controls both as iii and sb iii oxidation more detailed studies are required to clarify the actual pathway of as iii and sb iii oxidation by these isolated strains declaration of competing

13682,increased use of antibiotics has led to the contamination of the water bodies pharmaceutically active compounds can lead to severe effects including the production of antibiotic resistant microbes endocrine disruption toxicity to aquatic organisms and genotoxicity though the antibiotics are found in the aquatic environment at a very low concentration ranging from nanogram to microgram per liter but exert adverse effects and contribute to pollution a global medical crisis is unfolding as antibiotics lose effectiveness against a growing number of bacterial pathogens among the antibiotics amoxicillin is one of the frequently used antibiotics for the treatment of both gram positive and negative bacteria including the infections of the middle ear it is most commonly used in human and veterinary medicine around the world amoxicillin s impact on human health and the environment is uncertain hence it is regarded as an emerging contaminant wastewater treatment plants wwtps do not efficiently remove amoxicillin which contributes to its presence in drinking water and water bodies various physicochemical processes and bioremediation are used for the removal of amoxicillin but antibiotics being hydrophobic and lipophilic are recalcitrant to degradation and cannot be completely removed from the environment but in depth studies are important for the development of better and sustainable technology for cleaner environment the present review gives an insight into the amoxicillin detection development of resistance along with its impact and ecotoxicity on living beings amoxicillin removal using physicochemical parameters nanoparticles phytoremediation and via the use of bacteria and algae have been discussed in the paper keywords antibiotics amoxicillin antimicrobial resistance ecotoxicity remediation 1 introduction antibiotic provides benefits for veterinary poultry livestock and agriculture simultaneously increasing the risk of resistance by creating a pool of resistant microbes 1 antibiotics are used mainly to treat microbial infections by inhibiting the growth of protozoa bacteria and fungi around 260 drugs are listed as critical for human medicine by the world health organization who 2 antibiotics play a vital role in livestock industries and agriculture 3 their use in the industries eventually leads to the release in the environment fig 1 shows the mode of entry of antibiotics into the environment the antibiotics may be directly released via the application of veterinary medicine to surface water veterinary antibiotics have been detected in the drinking water sewage groundwater and surface water 4 indirect methods for antibiotic contamination include the spreading of manure in agriculture which will find its way into the water during wash off in rainfall penicillin produced by fungi penicillium was the first natural antibiotic currently synthetic antibiotics that are produced using chemical synthesis are used for ex sulfamethoxazole the penicillin group is one of the most important groups of antibiotics used in medicine and veterinary as a feed additive they account for 70 of the antibiotics consumed in many countries 5 the semi synthetic penicillin type antibiotic known as aminopenicillins has an extra amine group that includes the likes of amoxicillin ampicillin bacampicillin epicillin metampicillin they are amongst the most consumed antibiotics beta lactams are used subsequently and discharged continuously therefore amoxicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics have been detected at μg l levels in drainage 6 amoxicillin belongs to the beta lactam group of antibiotics it is active against a broad spectrum of gram negative and positive bacteria it is used to treat respiratory urinary gastrointestinal and skin infections caused by bacteria 7 amoxicillin is used for the treatment and prevention of animal diseases and used as a growth promoter for veterinary animals including fishes and cattle 8 amoxicillin is highly unstable and subjected to hydrolysis and rapid degradation into various degradation products 9 the beta lactam ring is susceptible to cleavage by various biotic and abiotic processes amoxicillin alone or in combination with clavulanic acid is the most frequently prescribed medications in european countries 10 it is a semi synthetic antibiotic derived from amino penicillin it acts by inhibiting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall due to the extensive use of amoxicillin bacteria have developed resistance against them the salt clavulanic acid is used in combination with amoxicillin to enhance the effectiveness of the antibiotic clavulanic acid is a beta lactamase inhibitor the daily dosage prescribed for amoxicillin is in the range of 750 2250 mg day which is higher as compared to the other antibiotics the metabolic degradation rate is low therefore it is expected to be a major antibiotic secreted in the wastewater in india amoxicillin along with its degradation products is reported in sewage treatment plants stps effluent at 62 ng l 11 escherichia clostridium klebsiella shigella salmonella and proteus are bacterial genera susceptible to amoxicillin 12 according to the who reports in 2015 amoxicillin is one of the most essential medicines used in basic health care major metabolites of amoxicillin include amoxicilloic acid and piperazine 2 5 dione the metabolites have no antimicrobial activity 13 the average half life of amoxicillin is approximately 1 5 h renal excretion of the antibiotic takes place which means that most of the antibiotic nearly 80 is excreted via urine and is secreted via milk 14 to improve its absorption amoxicillin is chemically modified from ampicillin a closed bottle test was performed to assess amoxicillin degradation by alexy et al 15 and it was found that only 5 of amoxicillin was degraded after 28 days of incubation therefore it was concluded that the amoxicillin as compared to other antibiotics would not get degraded efficiently in surface water and wwtps antibiotics presence in the environment especially in sediments surface water and groundwater is frequently reported 16 rapid urbanization and industrialization have resulted in the antibiotics contamination of in water bodies excretion of unmetabolized antibiotics by living beings is the main source of antibiotic pollution other sources include the unused drugs disposal from the pharmaceutical industries 17 discharge of hospital wastewater increases the load of resistant bacteria in the environment according to kummerer 18 the metabolism of these antibiotics varies greatly some of the antibiotics get metabolized 90 whereas others are only10 metabolized the antibiotics which are not metabolized get excreted in the feces and urine in the wastewater and animals can be used as a fertilizer or directly released in the water 19 the antibiotics and their unmetabolized by products come in contact with the environment and affect the evolution of the bacterial community s structure 20 the over exposure of the environment with antibiotics and the interaction of the args and arbs with the ecosystem is yet to be understood according to who the antibiotics spread is one of the serious threats in the 21st century antimicrobial resistance ar poses a great challenge for healthcare workers frequent hospital visits and routine surgeries increase the risk of microbial infections antibiotics help to expand the resources for the resistant bacteria by aiding in the elimination of susceptible bacterial populations and by reducing the competition 21 antibiotics exert selection pressure that favors resistant bacterial populations antibiotic resistance has become a cause of global concern for animal and human health the antibiotic s performance is decreased drastically by the resistance which renders them ineffective against infectious microbes 22 extensive misuse of antibiotics increases the prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb harboring the args 23 horizontal gene transfer hgt has a significant contribution to the spread of antibiotic resistance hgt includes the plasmid induced conjugation transformation and transduction via bacteriophage 24 the present review puts a light on the amoxicillin contamination in environmental matrices amoxicillin induced resistance in bacteria its ecotoxicity and recent trends in the removal of amoxicillin 2 detection of amoxicillin in environmental samples pharmaceuticals are emerging contaminants detected in wastewater marine water freshwater and soil sediments 25 antibiotics have been detected in various environmental matrices including rivers groundwater lakes drinking water and treatment plants they are present in the range of ng l to μg l in the sewage and hospital waste aminopenicillins are the most consumed antibiotics therefore present in large amounts in surface water and wastewater but these compounds are most difficult to trace the beta lactam ring opens up and the parent compound is likely to get degraded amoxicillin and amoxicillin diketopiperazine 2 5 is found in 3 out of 8 wwtps in italy amoxicillin is found in the wwtps in latina 15 ng l varese olona 25 ng l and palermo 120 ng l in the uk amoxicillin is detected in 3 wwtps 56 60 ng l in cardiff 198 245 ng l in trefforest estate 39 49 ng l in merthyr tydfil in brisbane australia amoxicillin is found in the effluent 30 ng l and sewage 280 ng l of water treatment plants 26 in india studies by sodhi et al 27 showed the amoxicillin and its metabolites penicillic acid detection in the river yamuna which is a major source of drinking water for a population of over 13 million in the raw sewage treatment plant stp in delhi india amoxicillin is detected up to 172 ng l whereas the concentration is reduced to 62 5 ng l after treatment 28 studies by velpandian et al 29 also showed the presence of amoxicillin 0 18 μg l in aquifers and surface table 1 shows the occurrence of amoxicillin all over the world amoxicillin is a potential carcinogen and mutagen adverse effects are seen at high doses it is widely used in animal feed therefore frequently detected in animal tissues and milk samples it is used as an additive in various food such as chicken fish etc 33 the ubiquitous distribution of amoxicillin in the environment makes it necessary to develop reliable and sensitive methods for their detection in environmental samples amoxicillin and clavulanic acid can be detected using enzymatic assays colorimetric methods spectroscopy spectrometry immunological assays and chromatographic techniques 34 chromatographic techniques such as high performance liquid chromatography hplc along with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms were used extensively but the maintenance of the instrument is required along with the analysis for data interpretation and stabilization time table 2 shows the overview of different chromatographic techniques for the detection of amoxicillin in environmental samples new analytical methods have been developed such as the use of multivariate calibration provides high accuracy and requires no electrochemical procedures 39 muller and co workers reported an easy and fast method for amoxicillin quantification in pharmaceutical formulations based on partial least squares regression pls calibration the proposed method validation was done against liquid chromatography 40 amoxicillin quantification along with clavulanic acid was detected by muller et al 41 using multivariate calibration which showed high precision and accuracy hplc studies are carried out to detect the presence of amoxicillin in different matrices for obtaining a lower detection limit 41 mostly the hplc employs c18 columns uv detectors and reverse phase mode with acetonitrile or methanol as a mobile phase in phosphate buffer at ph of 4 6 the complex conditions include post column derivatization and ion pairing the amoxicillin distribution in gastric juice is reported by zhang and co workers 42 earlier microbiological assays were performed for penicillin detection in animal feed this method has no specificity as no clear distinction can be made between ampicillin and amoxicillin to overcome the challenges posed by microbiological methods chromatography and capillary electrophoresis was used as an alternative 43 antibiotic detection in the field of medicine is important because of the use of counterfeit drugs 44 recently studies by marakaeva kosyreva reported the use of a paper based method for amoxicillin detection in 10 min with the use of fehling s and ninhydrin reagent colorimetric detection is the basic principle for the detection of the test antibiotic a linear correlation was found in the antibiotic concentration and colorimetric parameters for the determination of antibiotics in the food samples such as meat and milk commercial kits have been developed the advantages include the quick analysis up to 10 min of amoxicillin and sensitivity up to 20 μg kg another rapid analytical method for the detection of antibiotics is the surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers technique which employs the use of the raman technique along with the sers phenomenon which enhances the scattering effect thus overcoming the low sensitivity of the raman technique this technique requires no sample preparation 45 3 amoxicillin induced resistance in bacteria antimicrobial resistance takes place when the bacteria continue to thrive in the presence of antibiotics and the inability of the bacteria to grow due to exposure to antibiotics 46 bacterium harbors resistance through various clinically relevant mechanisms 47 microorganisms generally acquire antibiotic resistance by genetic changes but sometimes they do so by non genetic mechanisms 48 antibiotic resistance has become a serious global health problem bacteria acquire resistance via antibiotic detoxification intracellular accumulation of antibiotics antibiotic target substitution and protection amoxicillin is reported in the aquatic system with a concentration of 6 94 μg l the major concern is the generation of amoxicillin resistant genes due to long term exposure to amoxicillin 49 amoxicillin is an extended spectrum antibiotic that acts by inhibiting the peptidoglycan polymers cross which are important components of both the gram negative and gram positive bacteria 50 the bacteria overcome the amoxicillin stress by several mechanisms in gram negative bacteria beta lactamase production is the most important mechanism 51 the gram negative bacteria produce a metallo beta lactamase which has a broad range of activity the beta lactamase inhibitors such as sulbactam and clavulanic acid are used to broaden the activity of amoxicillin especially to broaden the amoxicillin s spectrum in organisms that produce the enzyme beta lactamase 52 these beta lactamase inhibitors irreversibly bind to the catalytic site of the beta lactamase of the bacteria leading to the resistance to the amoxicillin s beta lactam ring beta lactams acquire resistance through the beta lactamases production plasmid mediated transfer of ampc enzymes extended spectrum beta lactamases esbls blatem blashv blactxm esbl genes carbapenemases stenotrophomonas maltophila is resistant to carbapenems which is due to the presence of metallo beta lactamases mbl l1 53 in gram positive bacteria mutations in the penicillin binding proteins pbps and a decrease in the outer membrane proteins oprd expression leads to the lower penetration of the drug 54 in staphylococcus aureus the resistance is because of beta lactamase and mediated mainly by plasmids which leads to the reduction in the activity of antibacterial drugs 55 the antibiotic binding sites in the pbps form a new protein pbp 2a which helps in the development of resistance by promoting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall expression of femx in s aureus which directly or indirectly regulates the metabolism and peptidoglycan structure results in abnormal cell wall thickening leading to resistance against amoxicillin many unknown genes also help in developing antibiotic resistance under stress conditions 56 helicobacter pylori are associated with gastric ulcers and adenocarcinoma 57 h pylori is resistant to many antibiotics including the likes of rifampin 58 or amoxicillin 59 one of the mechanisms for resistance to amoxicillin in h pylori is the decrease in the affinity for amoxicillin by pbp1 protein and a decreased uptake of beta lactams 60 beta lactamase inhibitors such as augmentin a brand name for amoxicillin and clavulanic acid and sulbactam are also produced however bacteria resistant to augmentin produce beta lactamase which swamps the clavulanic acid from augmentin sulbactam is another beta lactamase inhibitor but it is less potent than augmentin against staphylococci tazobactam which is an analog of sulbactam has proved to be equally effective as a clavulanate for beta lactam inhibition 4 molecular study of microorganisms on amoxicillin beta lactams such as penicillin amoxicillin ampicillin cefuroxime cloxacillin act by inhibiting the cell wall synthesis the genes which are involved include the ade bla mec cme and mex in staphylococcus aureus the resistance is conferred by the beta lactamase production the production of the enzyme is mediated by the plasmids it hydrolyzes the beta lactam structure and inhibits their bactericidal 61 the gram negative bacteria confers resistance to amoxicillin by the production of beta lactamase enzyme whereas the gram positive bacteria prefer the penicillin binding protein pbp based resistance mechanisms pbp 2b plays an important role in conferring amoxicillin resistance in bacteria 62 the mutations in the active site of beta lactams gives rise to new beta lactamase enzymes ex the extended spectrum beta lactamases esbls tem 3 evolution which degrades the cephalosporins the beta lactamases are present on mobile genetic elements and some of them are also present on the chromosomes of the enterobacteriaceae family mainly as silent genes 63 one of the studies by qureshi et al 64 was performed to study the evolution of amoxicillin resistance of h pylori and studying the resistance mechanisms used by h pylori against increasing concentrations of amoxicillin in vitro they concluded that resistance among gram negative bacteria is due to the inactivation of amoxicillin by the enzyme beta lactamases diminishing efflux and permeability and pbp alterations the study by meng et al 65 was designed to observe the effect of amoxicillin on the microbial community and to study the spread of args in the wastewater system an expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor treating the artificial amoxicillin manufacture wastewater was run for 241 days the functional microbes analysis was done using 454 pyrosequencing the args were studied ex tem 1 ctx m 1 class i integrons oxa 1 oxa 2 oxa 10 were also studied in sludge samples some genera such as aminobacterium spirochaeta cloacibacillus aided in the degradation of amines and sugars it was also observed that with increasing amoxicillin concentration there was a change in the relative quantification of beta lactam resistance genes vertical gene transfer is regarded as the main driver in the args rather than hgts in the artificial amoxicillin manufacture wastewater system gram negative bacteria are resistant to beta lactams whereas gram positive bacteria are sensitive to them 65 amoxicillin degradation products were studied by gozlan et al 9 they identified a single degradation product i e amoxicillin oxide under solar irradiation amoxicillin acid and 2 5 diketopiperazine detected on photocatalytic treatment the use of the photo fenton process for the treatment of toxic compounds can be used as an alternative amoxicillin is effectively degraded under different conditions such as treatment with h2o2 uv o3 tio2 photo fenton processes 66 three possible pathways are suggested for amoxicillin degradation hydroxylation is the first pathway which involves the addition of the hydroxyl group at the position c5 c7 c11 c15 and c16 another pathway for the amoxicillin degradation involves the opening of the beta lactam ring and yields the penicilloic acid stereoisomers further decarboxylation reaction yields the intermediates c3 and c4 which were also detected during hydrolysis reaction the third degradation pathway yields the isobaric derivative of amoxicillin i e the amoxicillin diketopiperazine 2 5 generated by the opening of the beta lactam ring followed by further rearrangement of the molecule 67 amoxicillin degradation and the intermediates produced is influenced by iron species feso4 produces a higher number of intermediates as compared to feox intermediates produced under feox were degraded after 10 min except the c13 which was degraded after 45 min while in feso4presence between 15 and 60 min were necessary 5 ecotoxicity of amoxicillin and its impact on living organisms antibiotics on reaching the drinking water can cause extreme allergy to species that are sensitive which includes human beings soil and water contaminated with lower antibiotic concentration may give rise to arbs antibiotics are excreted from the urine 75 of antibiotics ingested by animals are excreted through feces and urine 68 the degradation products the metabolites of amoxicillin are much more persistent and more toxic than the parent compound ampicillin and amoxicillin elimination rate ranges from 60 to 90 antibiotics are designed for the treatment of infectious diseases and to target the specific pathways in animals and humans but effect the non target organisms 17 amoxicillin is a threat to terrestrial and aquatic life however limited data are available for its toxicity to living beings it is used widely in food animals therefore the amoxicillin residues in the food producing animals are the cause of global concern at a higher dose amoxicillin is found to be a potential mutagen carcinogen and teratogen the study by park choi 69 investigated the ecological effects of the antibiotics used in veterinary in daphnia magna oryzias latipes vibrio fischeri moina macrocopa the risk was calculated using measured environmental concentrations mecs for the antibiotics and the predicted no effect concentration pnec of the antibiotics that are tested which is derived from the toxicity values of these antibiotics in this study ecological hazards of major veterinary antibiotics were assessed using standard aquatic toxicity model species representing various trophic levels including vibrio fischeri daphnia magna moina macrocopa and oryzias latipes the ecological risk of these compounds was calculated and it was found that amoxicillin is classified as a high risk compound among the antimicrobials 69 antibiotics on reaching the drinking water can cause extreme allergy to species that are sensitive which includes human beings beta lactam is persistent in the water and soil and gets degraded in the soil at different water potentials which indicates the occurrence of resistant bacteria extensive use of antibiotics has led to an increase in the bacterial reluctant mechanism which gives rise to multidrug resistant bacteria 70 studies have been carried out in bacteria ex clostridium lactobacillus escherichia coli enterococcus which showed that in response to the stress of antibiotics such as penicillin amoxicillin erythromycin ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole the metabolic activities of the bacteria are affected 71 antibiotics are persistent in the environment thereby impacting the non target organisms by affecting the biogeochemical cycles in the aquatic environment it creates an ecological imbalance by producing toxic effects on the aquatic organisms alters the plant growth changes in the sex ratios in the higher animals abnormalities in the anatomy of many organisms 72 bioaccumulation of the amoxicillin in the fish tissues which can be consumed as food thereby causing undesirable effects on the human leading to immunoallergic responses and can induce the bacterial resistant genes in fish tissues amoxicillin is toxic to the fish oryzias latipes and at 96 h the lc50 was recorded to be 1000 mg l 69 however amoxicillin is highly toxic to synechococcus leopoliensis blue green algae having lc50 of 1 56 μg l at 96 h up to the concentration of 50 ng l 50 mg l 73 amoxicillin exposure to the embryo and adults of danio rerio leads to structural deformities especially in the tail region along with abnormal development of fish and modifications in the normal enzyme functioning in adults 74 amoxicillin inhibits catalase production in the brain and gills and can induce glutathione transferase production in the tissues cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa exposure to amoxicillin can lead to an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species ṛos amoxicillin exposure can also injure the dna leading to an increase in ros production 75 amoxicillin is phytotoxic to spirodela polyrhiza duckweed it induces phytotoxic stress to plants a significant effect on vegetative growth was observed the activity of the oxidative stress enzymes such as catalase superoxide dismutase sod was observed 76 in conclusion there is still a lack of information on the ecotoxicity profile of amoxicillin literature survey reports on the amoxicillin effect on aquatic flora and fauna are scarce which is due to the low toxicity of amoxicillin because many cases are associated with an ec50 value of up to 1000 mg l 74 table 3 summarises the toxicity of amoxicillin on the aquatic ecosystem 6 wwtps in the spread of antibiotic resistance wwtps are important for sustainable development high organic loads and contaminants such as antibiotics are removed from the environment with the use of wwtps wwtp execution avoids the harmful microbes spread and eutrophication of water bodies 78 the wwtps are considered to be hotspots for antibiotic resistance and the spread of args studies show that wwtps can positively affect the selection of args and arbs spread the antibiotics are persistent in the environment and recalcitrant compounds therefore provide difficulty for wastewater treatment args provide a challenge for the treatment of wastewater 79 wastewater is the fundamental reservoir of the arbs and args therefore it is necessary to study the wwtp s influence in the spread of arbs and args 80 wwtps have abundant nutrients carbon sources nitrate content and oxygen wherein bacteria can be adsorbed stable temperature of 15 20 ph of 6 6 7 4 81 the antibiotic residues favor the selection of arbs in urban wwtps the wwtps provides a bacterial cell interaction along with nutrient supply which aids in the horizontal gene transfer of args 82 arbs released in the environment through the urban wwtps effluents can lead to harmful diseases in living beings along with the spread of args via hgt several methods for reducing the arbs and args in urban wwtps such as treatment with ultra violet radiation ozonation adsorption chlorination among others can be employed but reactivation of these arbs and args can take place the hospital and domestic waste discharge the arbs and antibiotics into the wwtps 83 the wwtps are critical in the spread of antibiotic resistance which is based on these factors concentrations of the antibiotic residues are high in the treated effluent the args arbs and the antibiotic residues are discharged into the municipal wwtps the favorable conditions are provided for the spread of the resistant genes by hgt and selection of resistance genes in the wwtps 84 wwtps effluents are one of the main drivers for the spread and propagation of resistance genes in the environment 85 7 recent trends in the remediation of amoxicillin the production of antibiotics has accelerated with the increase in the development of novel methodologies and that has led to enhanced contamination of antibiotic levels in the environment the antibiotic residues as a result of human activities in the water bodies are difficult to be treated antibiotic residues find their way into the environment without much further processing therefore it has become the need of the hour to develop remediation processes for monitoring the high level of antibiotics 8 biodegradation of amoxicillin amoxicillin is not adequately removed in the wwtp it gets introduced into the groundwater and surface water which can lead to the development of chronic resistance in the aquatic flora and fauna due to long term exposure to small quantities of the antibiotic 86 several mechanisms including hydrolysis adsorption photolysis oxidation reduction are involved in the removal of amoxicillin from wastewater 87 a generalized pathway showing the degradation of amoxicillin is shown in fig 2 these mechanisms are not cost effective and many problems are encountered in the processing 88 antibiotics biodegradation is economical and completely degrades amoxicillin in any environment such as sludge groundwater soil and sediments 89 the biodegradation of amoxicillin depends on various environmental parameters such as temperature ph nitrogen and carbon sources solid retention time srt and microbial activity 90 bacteria such as rhodococcus b30 91 and microcystis aeruginosa 92 can degrade amoxicillin biodegradation of 17 antibiotics was checked based on the zahn wellens test and amoxicillin showed partial degradation with the formation of stable metabolites while the penicillin showed 87 degradation 93 bacteria including staphylococcus aureus 94 escherichia coli 95 acinetobacter 96 helicobacter pylori 97 are resistant to amoxicillin therefore it is a big challenge to remove antibiotic from the environment the bacteria that can survive and thrive in the presence of amoxicillin can be exploited for amoxicillin removal bacteria belonging to the genus stenotrophomonas and alcaligenes were able to remove amoxicillin in m9 minimal media in 14 days and lc ms ms was employed for confirming the degradation products and metabolites including benzoic acid and penicillic acid were detected 27 98 amoxicillin can be degraded using beta lactamase producing bacteria ex enterobacter sp corynebacterium sp 43 bacillus subtilis 76 7 flavobacterium sp 41 acinetobacter lwoffi 74 3 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 77 8 were able to degrade 60 ppm of amoxicillin many other strains of bacteria such as escherichia coli achromobacter sp vibrio sp micrococcus sp are also shown to degrade amoxicillin amoxicillin is reported to be resistant to alcaligenes acinetobacter citrobacter pseudomonas klebsiella serratia and proteus 99 9 bioremediation limitations and scope pharmaceutical wastewater can be treated by bioremediation microorganisms are ubiquitous in water but their action is not effective which might be due to a lack of phosphorous or nitrogen 100 bioremediation is limited to biodegradable pollutants which can make it difficult for the treatment xenobiotics the pilot scale studies extrapolation to a large scale is difficult the end product of the bioremediation is toxic as compared to the untreated antibiotic itself 101 however the technique is highly versatile bioremediation can be conjugated with another physical biological or chemical method to improve its efficiency a sequential reactor can be designed to nullify any possibilities of the residue generation or the occurrence of recalcitrant compounds in the effluents generated 102 10 microalgae based technology for amoxicillin removal microalgae based removal offers several advantages such as fixation of carbon dioxide removal of contaminants saving the nutrients input and development of algae derived products 103 in one of the studies by villar navarro et al 104 33 antibiotics having an average concentration of 223 μg l were shown to be removed in a high rate algal pond hrap which was dominated by coelastrum sp 105 the algal based removal of the antibiotics is based on the antibiotic induced inhibition of the microalgae it has been reported that antibiotics inhibit the enzyme activities such as superoxide dismutase and catalase along with the synthesis of chlorophyll pigments which affect algal growth 103 the ec50 value is calculated to determine the inhibitory effect of the antibiotics on microalgae the microalgae are resistant to the antibiotics because the ec50 value is higher than the actual concentration of antibiotics in wastewater the amoxicillin concentration is 1 34 μg l in wwtp pseudokirchneriellasubcapitata is highly resistant to amoxicillin even 2000 mg l of the amoxicillin resulted in 10 inhibition of the algal growth 1 34 μg l of amoxicillin is present in the effluent of wwtp and at 96 h ec50 50 is achieved when treated with p subcapitata and an ec50 value of 56 3 was reached at the end of 72 h when treated with anabaena sp cpb4337 105 growth based ec50 value is used to assess the toxicity of the antibiotics to the microalgae other essential activities such as antioxidant system carotenoid biosynthesis and photosynthesis are also affected by the antibiotics and might be more indicative than the ec50 value chlorella pyrenoidosa also has a potential in the removal of amoxicillin over 100 of 100 300 mg l amoxicillin removal is observed by c pyrenoidosa at hrt of 48 h in bg11 medium 106 c pyrenoidosa along with fenton oxidation can remove 93 3 of amoxicillin 1 g l at 48 h scenedesmus obliquus along with uv radiation at 280 nm can remove up to 99 of 100 mg l of amoxicillin 107 the removal mechanisms involved are photodegradation hydrolysis and biodegradation adsorption and accumulation in adsorption antibiotics passively bind to the solid material the adsorbent used can be nano materials activated carbon and biochar 108 antibiotics can bind to the microalgae via the use of functional groups such as cellulose or proteins this is an extracellular process the binding of the antibiotic to the microalgae cell wall depends on the type of antibiotics hydrophilicity and functional groups 108 accumulation is an intracellular process antibiotics can cross the cell membranes of algae and can be assimilated by cells 109 antibiotics might induce the formation of ros to control metabolism at nominal concentration but in excess can lead to cell death accumulation is followed by biodegradation and both these steps together can lead to complete assimilation of antibiotics the biodegradation involves both intracellular and extracellular degradation of antibiotics the intracellular process involves adsorption of antibiotics on algae transmitted to the algal cell wall and action of intracellular enzymes for breaking the antibiotics 110 whereas the algal metabolites ex extracellular enzymes break the antibiotic and end products get metabolized antibiotic degradation using algal species involves two metabolism process co metabolic and metabolic patterns in the co metabolic pattern non specific enzymes and additional carbon and nitrogen sources are required for antibiotic degradation whereas in the metabolic process antibiotic acts as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen along with specific enzymes help in degradation 111 many reactions including oxidation reduction and hydrolysis are employed for antibiotic degradation 112 photodegradation is another process employed by the microalgae for antibiotics degradation direct photolysis involves antibiotic degradation using light whereas indirect degradation takes place via the algal components in the presence of light 113 the photodegradation is not effective for antibiotics recalcitrant to light hydrolysis also helps in antibiotic degradation in beta lactam antibiotics the hydrolysis of the beta lactam ring leads to the opening of the beta lactam ring 114 the hydrolysis reaction depends on temperature and ph algae growth alters the culture ph and affects the hydrolysis reactions hydrophilicity and polarity facilitate the solubilization of antibiotics and biodegradation by microalgae 111 irradiation using uv rays is used in the treatment of wastewater as a disinfectant step enhanced antibiotic removal is seen in treatment with uv it directly or indirectly influences photodegradation which helps in advanced removal direct photolysis can be applied for the removal of light sensitive antibiotics photons are absorbed by antibiotics which helps in breaking the bonds between antibiotics 115 the uv radiations may harm algal growth therefore it is advisable to use the uv mutated algal species advanced oxidation is also used to enhance antibiotic removal by microalgae fenton reactions coupled with h2o2 fe ii are used to enhance antibiotic degradation 116 indirect photodegradation using fe iii induces the formation of reactive oxygen species which assists the removal by microalgae 117 in conclusion microalgae assisted removal of amoxicillin is efficient in antibiotic removal biodegradation adsorption hydrolysis accumulation and photodegradation are involved in the effective removal of amoxicillin integrating the microalgae treatment with other treatment processes such as advanced oxidation uv irradiation along with the bacteria and fungi consortia can lead to effective amoxicillin removal 11 role of nanoparticles in amoxicillin removal in the last decade nanotechnology has made a significant contribution to the scientific community environmental nano remediation is an important branch that involves the use of reactive nanoscale material for the remediation of pollutants the high reactivity and small size make them an excellent candidate for the detoxification of contaminants from the groundwater and soil 118 the nanoparticles can get infiltrated in small pores of soil and can suspend in the water a study by machado et al 119 used zero valent iron gnzvis for the removal of amoxicillin these particles are used as a catalyst for the fenton reactions and as reductants it can degrade 100 of amoxicillin in an aqueous solution when used as a reductant in a ratio of 1 15 amoxicillin gnzvi and as a catalyst in the fenton s reaction in 1 13 1 amoxicillin h202 gnzvi 118 gnzvi is produced with sodium borohydride the natural extracts aids in the enhanced degradation of amoxicillin in fenton s reaction nanoparticles act as a catalyst and 100 degradation was achieved in 15 min whereas in the soil gnzvi acts as a reducing agent and due to the parallel reaction of the nanoparticle with the soil matrix degradation efficiency was found to be decreased to 60 and complete degradation was achieved after 1800 h it is the need of the hour to focus on the development of novel remediation strategies which helps to overcome the problem of amoxicillin resistant bacteria electrochemical remediation can be used to treat the contaminants in wastewater low cost easy handling and high efficiency are the few factors that make it a promising method 120 radicals generated by electrochemical oxidation are used for the complete mineralization of antibiotics 121 the disadvantage being the contamination risk of electrodes such as ti and pbo2 by heavy metals mainly because of leaching from the anode of otherwise highly efficient electrodes carbon electrodes having a lesser cost and pose a lesser risk to the environment could be used as an alternative 122 the electrode material is an important parameter that governs the efficiency of electrochemical remediation along with the current density and the ph 123 in the study by brito et al 124 the electrochemical remediation was seen and the by products which were generated by the remediation were monitored using mass spectrometry and the toxicity evaluation was done on the zebrafish embryos 12 amoxicillin removal using adsorbents several methods including photocatalytic degradation advanced oxidation electron degradation and adsorption are used for amoxicillin removal 125 the adsorption is the most preferred method as it is more effective because it restricts pollutants transportation into the water systems 126 many adsorbents such as activated carbons porous polymers magnetic graphene oxide activated carbon magnetic fe3o4 activated carbon nanocomposite are used the study by chaba nomngongo 125 showed the removal of amoxicillin using a combination of zinc oxide nanoparticles and carbon nanofilters zno cnf nano adsorbent the carbon nanofilters were used due to their anisotropic properties pore size and high adsorption 127 zinc oxide nanoparticles were used due to their stability non toxic behavior and eco friendliness 128 the hydrothermal method was used to prepare the zno cnf nano adsorbent the interaction between the nano adsorbent and the amoxicillin was studied using the langmuir freundlich equation it was concluded that the nanocomposites can be regenerated and reused up to 15 times activated carbon can be used to remove toxic compounds from the environment 129 contaminants can be removed using an adsorbent as it is simple and feasible to use not expensive and is not affected by the contaminant toxicity therefore adsorption is an efficient technology the adsorption process depends on the adsorbent and contaminants characteristics 130 activated carbon is used to remove contaminants because of its surface area and porosity the disadvantage of using activated adsorbents is its high cost one of the studies by putra et al 131 performed a study to check the adsorption capacity of amoxicillin on bentonite at different ph values the adsorption capacity was found to be more at higher ph xing zha et al 132 also studied the amoxicillin removal from aqueous solutions using bentonite modified using a cationic surfactant such as octadecyl amine and hexadecyl trimethyl they observed that it has the highest adsorption capacity 13 amoxicillin removal by carbon adsorbent mainly the carbon adsorbents are used as they are resistant to alkali and acid stable and have high adsorption capacity to improve the adsorption capacity of adsorbents the chemical modifying agents are added however they can lead to secondary pollution and are costly 133 one of the studies by yu et al 134 used the powdery puffed waterfowl feather ppwf doped phragmites australis a novel carbon based adsorbent for the removal of amoxicillin from the water phragmites australis is grown in wetlands has a high carbon content the ppwf is a protein waste that is used as a modifier and can increase the functional groups of carbon adsorbents the undoped pac and ppwf doped fpac carbon adsorbents were synthesized to test the adsorption of amoxicillin and cephalexin the adsorption capacities were calculated and it was observed that fpac has a higher adsorption capacity as compared to pac the adsorption kinetics followed pseudo second order for amoxicillin and cephalexin the antibiotics are adsorbed via chemisorption i e covalent bonding and electrostatic attraction 13 1 adsorptive removal of antibiotics using acid activated carbon from prosopis juliflora emerging contaminants such as antibiotics can be removed from aqueous solutions using activated carbon is less reported adsorptive removal of ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin from single and binary adsorption systems with the use of adsorptive carbon procured from the woods of prosopis juliflora in binary adsorption the antibiotics have an antagonistic and synergistic influence on each other many parameters influence the efficient adsorption of the antibiotic such as the antibiotic concentration ph of the solution containing the antibiotic incubation temperature of the sorbent sorbate and the dose of prosopis juliflora the study results show that amoxicillin has a synergistic effect on ciprofloxacin adsorption whereas ciprofloxacin has an antagonistic effect on the adsorption of amoxicillin in binary adsorption studies in a single adsorption system prosopis juliflora has langmuir maximum adsorption of 714 29 mg g for amoxicillin and 250 mg g for ciprofloxacin 135 prosopis juliflora can be recycled and reused for 4 cycles desorption is done with 0 1 naoh and a minimal effect is seen on antibiotic adsorption over the plant s surface of the co existing anions and cations 136 prosopis juliflora was treated with acid which is followed by pyrolysis for the production of acid activated carbon prosopis juliflora for the removal of amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin the acid activated carbon obtained from the woods of the plant prosopis juliflora is economical and cheap for antibiotic removal it is an efficient alternative as compared to commonly used adsorbents in conclusion prosopis juliflora proved to be effective in the removal of amoxicillin and can be used for the remediation of other pollutants also 137 antibiotics can be removed partially from wastewaters using conventional methods 138 anaerobic treatment processes can aid in removing antibiotics from wastewater 139 advanced oxidation membrane bioreactors adsorption using activated adsorption and activated sludge can aid in the removal of pollutants 140 in the process for contaminants treatment some of them get adsorbed onto the sludge whereas others are biodegraded using microbes and discharged as effluent subsequently the removal processes include adsorption biodegradation volatilization and hydrolysis for the removal of antibiotics such as tetracycline and sulphonamides it was found that the adsorption and biodegradation was the primary route for antibiotics removal 141 142 the removal of arb and arg in the wwtp depends on the type of reactors and treatment technology 143 the aerobic reactors or the aerobic anaerobic reactors combination can effectively remove arg aerobic anaerobic reactors can effectively remove arg than anaerobic reactors in the activated sludge system the microbes are removed using longer hydraulic retention times whereas exposure for a long period can favor the exchange of arg and leads to resistance against multiple drugs 79 biological treatment and advanced treatment such as photo fenton membrane filtration coagulation chlorination and ultraviolet radiation can be used for antibiotics removal 96 14 activated sludge process for amoxicillin removal beta lactams are persistent and recalcitrant to degradation they are present at high concentrations in the environment as high as 100 mg l 144 beta lactam antibiotics are detected in drinking water groundwater and surface water 145 the antibiotic and antibiotic transformation products can lead to args production 146 the activated sludge process can be used for antibiotic removal from the environment one of the studies by baghapour et al 147 showed the amoxicillin removal from the aqueous solution via the use of submerged biological aerated filters sbaf different amoxicillin concentrations were used to check the degradation using aerobic consortia at high amoxicillin influent the 35 removal was reached it was concluded that degradation was dependent on the amount of amoxicillin in the influent wastewater strength and hydraulic retention times therefore three different hrt were taken 3 h 6 h and 12 h the amoxicillin removal was increased at long hrt and at 12 h the removal was reached to almost 50 147 the mixed aerobic culture was used for the amoxicillin treatment from aqueous solutions the degradation of amoxicillin was dependent on the hrts amoxicillin concentration in the influent and the wastewater strength sbaf was desirable for the degradation of amoxicillin in the aqueous environment 147 15 amoxicillin removal using advanced oxidation processes aop for the treatment of wastewater and waters advanced oxidation processes aops have been employed 148 aops have been shown to contribute significantly to the degradation of nonbiodegradable and recalcitrant organic pollutants the hydroxyl radicals ho production in solutions is the main basis of the oxidation processes the ho is a strong oxidizing agent in the aop the phase transfer of the pollutant takes place along with its destruction many methods have been employed for the degradation of and mineralization of amoxicillin which includes the likes of photo fenton fenton ozonation uv h2o2 uv o3 uv o3 fe2 uv h2o2 o3 uv h2o2 fe2 149 among all the aops the ozonation is the most efficient in mineralization and degradation of amoxicillin 150 radicals are generated by chemical electrochemical photochemical and photocatalytic reactions the organic compounds are hydroxylated until they get mineralized completely 151 in laboratory scale experiments the uv and uv h2o2 treatments are widely being used 99 of amoxicillin removal is reported via the use of fenton s process 152 the major disadvantage of fenton s process is the sludge formation because of the iron molecules added to the system the most efficient aops is ozonation and catalytic ozonation and eliminates amoxicillin within short reaction times aqueous amoxicillin 100 μg l 100 mg l can get eliminated in 30 60 min by the processes such as uv h2o2 zno uv h2o2 uv tio2 uv h2o2 tio2 under several doses of uv for achieving 50 total organic carbon toc and 20 50 chemical oxygen demand cod removal it was important to extend the time of reaction 153 fenton processes involve h2o2 and fe2 which generate ho radicals fe3 gets regenerated when fe2 with excess of ooh and h2o2 154 the study by souza et al 155 compared the several aops o3 o3fe2 uv o3 fe2 o3 uv for amoxicillin degradation and mineralization in an aqueous solution mineralization efficiency is calculated in terms of toc aops were compared based on mineralization efficiency and amoxicillin removal the experimental results in the study showed that all the above mentioned aops led to the total amoxicillin degradation and mineral efficiency of all the processes were similar 56 61 at ph 11 ozonation was considered as the best amongst the aop as it does not require any catalyst or uv radiation it has been observed that ozonation produce 60 4 of toc removal at ph 11 in 1 h reaction time which further suggests that ozonation produces refractory products which cannot be easily oxidized further however the overall ecotoxicity is reduced 155 electrochemical oxidation of amoxicillin was carried out by brito et al 124 which showed that tap water anodes such as na2so4 and nacl solutions can help in the removal of amoxicillin and the toxicity of the residual amoxicillin was evaluated on the early life stages of zebrafish the intermediates generated after eo were analyzed using mass spectrometry and the antimicrobial activities of the intermediates were evaluated significant mortality was not observed in zebrafish on extended exposure to amoxicillin but affects the development of zebrafish i e an increase in the body length was observed 0 1 m nacl was more efficient in amoxicillin removal than 0 1 m na2so4 but 0 1 m na2so4 was more toxic as compared to 0 1 m nacl the antimicrobial activity of the amoxicillin was inhibited using a carbon modified titanium dioxide tio2 c electrode with 0 01 m nacl 124 in conclusion the optimization of the aops to improve their practicability and adaptability which includes the improvement of ozone or h2o2 utilization efficiency and enhancing the catalyst efficiency however more emphasis should be given to understand the mechanism of degradation of pollutants along with the generation of free radicals the potential application of aops can be studied to see the removal of args and arbs in wastewater wastewater is complicated as it contains multiple pollutants multiple antibiotics and many inorganic compounds which reduces the degradation efficiency of aops aops cannot efficiently degrade the antibiotics the biological treatment can be used in combination with the aops for enhancing the mineralization of pollutants the integrated approach can increase the processing efficiency of many folds and can lower the cost of operation 16 membrane bioreactor mbr for amoxicillin removal membrane bioreactors mbrs have the potential for the removal of emerging contaminants from wastewater in one of the studies by matsubara et al 2020 amoxicillin removal was seen from synthetic wastewater using mbrs a continuous flow pre denitrification pilot unit a o mbr was used for amoxicillin removal 100 μg l of amoxicillin was added to the influent hrt of 40 h was used 156 high resolution mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography revealed the presence of five degradation products of amoxicillin in the effluent wastewater the dissolved organic carbon doc and cod removal efficiency were unchanged after amoxicillin addition whereas the hrt was reduced the amoxicillin concentration up to 100 μg l could not even inhibit the aerobic heterotrophic bacteria present in the biomass of mbr 157 it was observed that the removal of amoxicillin was increased with increasing a o mbr hrt which makes the amoxicillin available for degradation via adsorption of amoxicillin fraction in large amounts to the sludge in conclusion in pilot scale bioreactor studies hrt plays a vital role in the removal of non conventional pollutants higher hrts than usual should be used for amoxicillin removal the largest amoxicillin fraction 68 was removed using biodegradation and adsorption in the a o mbr system ecotoxicity assays were also performed which shows that the e coli was less resistant and pseudomonas fluorescents are more resistant to the residues of amoxicillin 158 17 conclusion antibiotics play a vital role in the healthcare of living organisms antibiotic contamination has increased the risk of antimicrobial resistance the failure of wwtp to eliminate the antibiotics and their residue has further accelerated the risk of antimicrobial resistance in the health sector multidrug resistance args and arb is a huge threat amoxicillin is widely used to treat bacterial infections in humans and animals increasing resistance against amoxicillin has rendered it ineffective although certain methods have been applied for amoxicillin removal physicochemical methods and aops for antibiotic removal have certain limitations such as the formation of toxic by products inefficiency and higher cost alternatively bioremediation has been researched extensively which includes in situ methods such as phytoremediation and ex situ methods such as mbr bioremediation techniques have the potential can be a means of sustainable management of wastewater the molecular study of microorganisms can help in a better way to understand the metabolic pathways which can assist in designing techniques to overcome the limitations faced by bioremediation another process that can be used to overcome the nutrients scarce for the microorganisms is bio stimulation this process can help to provide nutrients for the microbial consortium for the bioremediation of pollutants nanomaterials are an emerging field aids to improve the efficacy of microorganisms by lowering the activation energy and increasing the surface area antibiotics being hydrophobic and lipophilic cannot be completely removed from the environment but in depth studies are

13682,increased use of antibiotics has led to the contamination of the water bodies pharmaceutically active compounds can lead to severe effects including the production of antibiotic resistant microbes endocrine disruption toxicity to aquatic organisms and genotoxicity though the antibiotics are found in the aquatic environment at a very low concentration ranging from nanogram to microgram per liter but exert adverse effects and contribute to pollution a global medical crisis is unfolding as antibiotics lose effectiveness against a growing number of bacterial pathogens among the antibiotics amoxicillin is one of the frequently used antibiotics for the treatment of both gram positive and negative bacteria including the infections of the middle ear it is most commonly used in human and veterinary medicine around the world amoxicillin s impact on human health and the environment is uncertain hence it is regarded as an emerging contaminant wastewater treatment plants wwtps do not efficiently remove amoxicillin which contributes to its presence in drinking water and water bodies various physicochemical processes and bioremediation are used for the removal of amoxicillin but antibiotics being hydrophobic and lipophilic are recalcitrant to degradation and cannot be completely removed from the environment but in depth studies are important for the development of better and sustainable technology for cleaner environment the present review gives an insight into the amoxicillin detection development of resistance along with its impact and ecotoxicity on living beings amoxicillin removal using physicochemical parameters nanoparticles phytoremediation and via the use of bacteria and algae have been discussed in the paper keywords antibiotics amoxicillin antimicrobial resistance ecotoxicity remediation 1 introduction antibiotic provides benefits for veterinary poultry livestock and agriculture simultaneously increasing the risk of resistance by creating a pool of resistant microbes 1 antibiotics are used mainly to treat microbial infections by inhibiting the growth of protozoa bacteria and fungi around 260 drugs are listed as critical for human medicine by the world health organization who 2 antibiotics play a vital role in livestock industries and agriculture 3 their use in the industries eventually leads to the release in the environment fig 1 shows the mode of entry of antibiotics into the environment the antibiotics may be directly released via the application of veterinary medicine to surface water veterinary antibiotics have been detected in the drinking water sewage groundwater and surface water 4 indirect methods for antibiotic contamination include the spreading of manure in agriculture which will find its way into the water during wash off in rainfall penicillin produced by fungi penicillium was the first natural antibiotic currently synthetic antibiotics that are produced using chemical synthesis are used for ex sulfamethoxazole the penicillin group is one of the most important groups of antibiotics used in medicine and veterinary as a feed additive they account for 70 of the antibiotics consumed in many countries 5 the semi synthetic penicillin type antibiotic known as aminopenicillins has an extra amine group that includes the likes of amoxicillin ampicillin bacampicillin epicillin metampicillin they are amongst the most consumed antibiotics beta lactams are used subsequently and discharged continuously therefore amoxicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics have been detected at μg l levels in drainage 6 amoxicillin belongs to the beta lactam group of antibiotics it is active against a broad spectrum of gram negative and positive bacteria it is used to treat respiratory urinary gastrointestinal and skin infections caused by bacteria 7 amoxicillin is used for the treatment and prevention of animal diseases and used as a growth promoter for veterinary animals including fishes and cattle 8 amoxicillin is highly unstable and subjected to hydrolysis and rapid degradation into various degradation products 9 the beta lactam ring is susceptible to cleavage by various biotic and abiotic processes amoxicillin alone or in combination with clavulanic acid is the most frequently prescribed medications in european countries 10 it is a semi synthetic antibiotic derived from amino penicillin it acts by inhibiting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall due to the extensive use of amoxicillin bacteria have developed resistance against them the salt clavulanic acid is used in combination with amoxicillin to enhance the effectiveness of the antibiotic clavulanic acid is a beta lactamase inhibitor the daily dosage prescribed for amoxicillin is in the range of 750 2250 mg day which is higher as compared to the other antibiotics the metabolic degradation rate is low therefore it is expected to be a major antibiotic secreted in the wastewater in india amoxicillin along with its degradation products is reported in sewage treatment plants stps effluent at 62 ng l 11 escherichia clostridium klebsiella shigella salmonella and proteus are bacterial genera susceptible to amoxicillin 12 according to the who reports in 2015 amoxicillin is one of the most essential medicines used in basic health care major metabolites of amoxicillin include amoxicilloic acid and piperazine 2 5 dione the metabolites have no antimicrobial activity 13 the average half life of amoxicillin is approximately 1 5 h renal excretion of the antibiotic takes place which means that most of the antibiotic nearly 80 is excreted via urine and is secreted via milk 14 to improve its absorption amoxicillin is chemically modified from ampicillin a closed bottle test was performed to assess amoxicillin degradation by alexy et al 15 and it was found that only 5 of amoxicillin was degraded after 28 days of incubation therefore it was concluded that the amoxicillin as compared to other antibiotics would not get degraded efficiently in surface water and wwtps antibiotics presence in the environment especially in sediments surface water and groundwater is frequently reported 16 rapid urbanization and industrialization have resulted in the antibiotics contamination of in water bodies excretion of unmetabolized antibiotics by living beings is the main source of antibiotic pollution other sources include the unused drugs disposal from the pharmaceutical industries 17 discharge of hospital wastewater increases the load of resistant bacteria in the environment according to kummerer 18 the metabolism of these antibiotics varies greatly some of the antibiotics get metabolized 90 whereas others are only10 metabolized the antibiotics which are not metabolized get excreted in the feces and urine in the wastewater and animals can be used as a fertilizer or directly released in the water 19 the antibiotics and their unmetabolized by products come in contact with the environment and affect the evolution of the bacterial community s structure 20 the over exposure of the environment with antibiotics and the interaction of the args and arbs with the ecosystem is yet to be understood according to who the antibiotics spread is one of the serious threats in the 21st century antimicrobial resistance ar poses a great challenge for healthcare workers frequent hospital visits and routine surgeries increase the risk of microbial infections antibiotics help to expand the resources for the resistant bacteria by aiding in the elimination of susceptible bacterial populations and by reducing the competition 21 antibiotics exert selection pressure that favors resistant bacterial populations antibiotic resistance has become a cause of global concern for animal and human health the antibiotic s performance is decreased drastically by the resistance which renders them ineffective against infectious microbes 22 extensive misuse of antibiotics increases the prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb harboring the args 23 horizontal gene transfer hgt has a significant contribution to the spread of antibiotic resistance hgt includes the plasmid induced conjugation transformation and transduction via bacteriophage 24 the present review puts a light on the amoxicillin contamination in environmental matrices amoxicillin induced resistance in bacteria its ecotoxicity and recent trends in the removal of amoxicillin 2 detection of amoxicillin in environmental samples pharmaceuticals are emerging contaminants detected in wastewater marine water freshwater and soil sediments 25 antibiotics have been detected in various environmental matrices including rivers groundwater lakes drinking water and treatment plants they are present in the range of ng l to μg l in the sewage and hospital waste aminopenicillins are the most consumed antibiotics therefore present in large amounts in surface water and wastewater but these compounds are most difficult to trace the beta lactam ring opens up and the parent compound is likely to get degraded amoxicillin and amoxicillin diketopiperazine 2 5 is found in 3 out of 8 wwtps in italy amoxicillin is found in the wwtps in latina 15 ng l varese olona 25 ng l and palermo 120 ng l in the uk amoxicillin is detected in 3 wwtps 56 60 ng l in cardiff 198 245 ng l in trefforest estate 39 49 ng l in merthyr tydfil in brisbane australia amoxicillin is found in the effluent 30 ng l and sewage 280 ng l of water treatment plants 26 in india studies by sodhi et al 27 showed the amoxicillin and its metabolites penicillic acid detection in the river yamuna which is a major source of drinking water for a population of over 13 million in the raw sewage treatment plant stp in delhi india amoxicillin is detected up to 172 ng l whereas the concentration is reduced to 62 5 ng l after treatment 28 studies by velpandian et al 29 also showed the presence of amoxicillin 0 18 μg l in aquifers and surface table 1 shows the occurrence of amoxicillin all over the world amoxicillin is a potential carcinogen and mutagen adverse effects are seen at high doses it is widely used in animal feed therefore frequently detected in animal tissues and milk samples it is used as an additive in various food such as chicken fish etc 33 the ubiquitous distribution of amoxicillin in the environment makes it necessary to develop reliable and sensitive methods for their detection in environmental samples amoxicillin and clavulanic acid can be detected using enzymatic assays colorimetric methods spectroscopy spectrometry immunological assays and chromatographic techniques 34 chromatographic techniques such as high performance liquid chromatography hplc along with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms were used extensively but the maintenance of the instrument is required along with the analysis for data interpretation and stabilization time table 2 shows the overview of different chromatographic techniques for the detection of amoxicillin in environmental samples new analytical methods have been developed such as the use of multivariate calibration provides high accuracy and requires no electrochemical procedures 39 muller and co workers reported an easy and fast method for amoxicillin quantification in pharmaceutical formulations based on partial least squares regression pls calibration the proposed method validation was done against liquid chromatography 40 amoxicillin quantification along with clavulanic acid was detected by muller et al 41 using multivariate calibration which showed high precision and accuracy hplc studies are carried out to detect the presence of amoxicillin in different matrices for obtaining a lower detection limit 41 mostly the hplc employs c18 columns uv detectors and reverse phase mode with acetonitrile or methanol as a mobile phase in phosphate buffer at ph of 4 6 the complex conditions include post column derivatization and ion pairing the amoxicillin distribution in gastric juice is reported by zhang and co workers 42 earlier microbiological assays were performed for penicillin detection in animal feed this method has no specificity as no clear distinction can be made between ampicillin and amoxicillin to overcome the challenges posed by microbiological methods chromatography and capillary electrophoresis was used as an alternative 43 antibiotic detection in the field of medicine is important because of the use of counterfeit drugs 44 recently studies by marakaeva kosyreva reported the use of a paper based method for amoxicillin detection in 10 min with the use of fehling s and ninhydrin reagent colorimetric detection is the basic principle for the detection of the test antibiotic a linear correlation was found in the antibiotic concentration and colorimetric parameters for the determination of antibiotics in the food samples such as meat and milk commercial kits have been developed the advantages include the quick analysis up to 10 min of amoxicillin and sensitivity up to 20 μg kg another rapid analytical method for the detection of antibiotics is the surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers technique which employs the use of the raman technique along with the sers phenomenon which enhances the scattering effect thus overcoming the low sensitivity of the raman technique this technique requires no sample preparation 45 3 amoxicillin induced resistance in bacteria antimicrobial resistance takes place when the bacteria continue to thrive in the presence of antibiotics and the inability of the bacteria to grow due to exposure to antibiotics 46 bacterium harbors resistance through various clinically relevant mechanisms 47 microorganisms generally acquire antibiotic resistance by genetic changes but sometimes they do so by non genetic mechanisms 48 antibiotic resistance has become a serious global health problem bacteria acquire resistance via antibiotic detoxification intracellular accumulation of antibiotics antibiotic target substitution and protection amoxicillin is reported in the aquatic system with a concentration of 6 94 μg l the major concern is the generation of amoxicillin resistant genes due to long term exposure to amoxicillin 49 amoxicillin is an extended spectrum antibiotic that acts by inhibiting the peptidoglycan polymers cross which are important components of both the gram negative and gram positive bacteria 50 the bacteria overcome the amoxicillin stress by several mechanisms in gram negative bacteria beta lactamase production is the most important mechanism 51 the gram negative bacteria produce a metallo beta lactamase which has a broad range of activity the beta lactamase inhibitors such as sulbactam and clavulanic acid are used to broaden the activity of amoxicillin especially to broaden the amoxicillin s spectrum in organisms that produce the enzyme beta lactamase 52 these beta lactamase inhibitors irreversibly bind to the catalytic site of the beta lactamase of the bacteria leading to the resistance to the amoxicillin s beta lactam ring beta lactams acquire resistance through the beta lactamases production plasmid mediated transfer of ampc enzymes extended spectrum beta lactamases esbls blatem blashv blactxm esbl genes carbapenemases stenotrophomonas maltophila is resistant to carbapenems which is due to the presence of metallo beta lactamases mbl l1 53 in gram positive bacteria mutations in the penicillin binding proteins pbps and a decrease in the outer membrane proteins oprd expression leads to the lower penetration of the drug 54 in staphylococcus aureus the resistance is because of beta lactamase and mediated mainly by plasmids which leads to the reduction in the activity of antibacterial drugs 55 the antibiotic binding sites in the pbps form a new protein pbp 2a which helps in the development of resistance by promoting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall expression of femx in s aureus which directly or indirectly regulates the metabolism and peptidoglycan structure results in abnormal cell wall thickening leading to resistance against amoxicillin many unknown genes also help in developing antibiotic resistance under stress conditions 56 helicobacter pylori are associated with gastric ulcers and adenocarcinoma 57 h pylori is resistant to many antibiotics including the likes of rifampin 58 or amoxicillin 59 one of the mechanisms for resistance to amoxicillin in h pylori is the decrease in the affinity for amoxicillin by pbp1 protein and a decreased uptake of beta lactams 60 beta lactamase inhibitors such as augmentin a brand name for amoxicillin and clavulanic acid and sulbactam are also produced however bacteria resistant to augmentin produce beta lactamase which swamps the clavulanic acid from augmentin sulbactam is another beta lactamase inhibitor but it is less potent than augmentin against staphylococci tazobactam which is an analog of sulbactam has proved to be equally effective as a clavulanate for beta lactam inhibition 4 molecular study of microorganisms on amoxicillin beta lactams such as penicillin amoxicillin ampicillin cefuroxime cloxacillin act by inhibiting the cell wall synthesis the genes which are involved include the ade bla mec cme and mex in staphylococcus aureus the resistance is conferred by the beta lactamase production the production of the enzyme is mediated by the plasmids it hydrolyzes the beta lactam structure and inhibits their bactericidal 61 the gram negative bacteria confers resistance to amoxicillin by the production of beta lactamase enzyme whereas the gram positive bacteria prefer the penicillin binding protein pbp based resistance mechanisms pbp 2b plays an important role in conferring amoxicillin resistance in bacteria 62 the mutations in the active site of beta lactams gives rise to new beta lactamase enzymes ex the extended spectrum beta lactamases esbls tem 3 evolution which degrades the cephalosporins the beta lactamases are present on mobile genetic elements and some of them are also present on the chromosomes of the enterobacteriaceae family mainly as silent genes 63 one of the studies by qureshi et al 64 was performed to study the evolution of amoxicillin resistance of h pylori and studying the resistance mechanisms used by h pylori against increasing concentrations of amoxicillin in vitro they concluded that resistance among gram negative bacteria is due to the inactivation of amoxicillin by the enzyme beta lactamases diminishing efflux and permeability and pbp alterations the study by meng et al 65 was designed to observe the effect of amoxicillin on the microbial community and to study the spread of args in the wastewater system an expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor treating the artificial amoxicillin manufacture wastewater was run for 241 days the functional microbes analysis was done using 454 pyrosequencing the args were studied ex tem 1 ctx m 1 class i integrons oxa 1 oxa 2 oxa 10 were also studied in sludge samples some genera such as aminobacterium spirochaeta cloacibacillus aided in the degradation of amines and sugars it was also observed that with increasing amoxicillin concentration there was a change in the relative quantification of beta lactam resistance genes vertical gene transfer is regarded as the main driver in the args rather than hgts in the artificial amoxicillin manufacture wastewater system gram negative bacteria are resistant to beta lactams whereas gram positive bacteria are sensitive to them 65 amoxicillin degradation products were studied by gozlan et al 9 they identified a single degradation product i e amoxicillin oxide under solar irradiation amoxicillin acid and 2 5 diketopiperazine detected on photocatalytic treatment the use of the photo fenton process for the treatment of toxic compounds can be used as an alternative amoxicillin is effectively degraded under different conditions such as treatment with h2o2 uv o3 tio2 photo fenton processes 66 three possible pathways are suggested for amoxicillin degradation hydroxylation is the first pathway which involves the addition of the hydroxyl group at the position c5 c7 c11 c15 and c16 another pathway for the amoxicillin degradation involves the opening of the beta lactam ring and yields the penicilloic acid stereoisomers further decarboxylation reaction yields the intermediates c3 and c4 which were also detected during hydrolysis reaction the third degradation pathway yields the isobaric derivative of amoxicillin i e the amoxicillin diketopiperazine 2 5 generated by the opening of the beta lactam ring followed by further rearrangement of the molecule 67 amoxicillin degradation and the intermediates produced is influenced by iron species feso4 produces a higher number of intermediates as compared to feox intermediates produced under feox were degraded after 10 min except the c13 which was degraded after 45 min while in feso4presence between 15 and 60 min were necessary 5 ecotoxicity of amoxicillin and its impact on living organisms antibiotics on reaching the drinking water can cause extreme allergy to species that are sensitive which includes human beings soil and water contaminated with lower antibiotic concentration may give rise to arbs antibiotics are excreted from the urine 75 of antibiotics ingested by animals are excreted through feces and urine 68 the degradation products the metabolites of amoxicillin are much more persistent and more toxic than the parent compound ampicillin and amoxicillin elimination rate ranges from 60 to 90 antibiotics are designed for the treatment of infectious diseases and to target the specific pathways in animals and humans but effect the non target organisms 17 amoxicillin is a threat to terrestrial and aquatic life however limited data are available for its toxicity to living beings it is used widely in food animals therefore the amoxicillin residues in the food producing animals are the cause of global concern at a higher dose amoxicillin is found to be a potential mutagen carcinogen and teratogen the study by park choi 69 investigated the ecological effects of the antibiotics used in veterinary in daphnia magna oryzias latipes vibrio fischeri moina macrocopa the risk was calculated using measured environmental concentrations mecs for the antibiotics and the predicted no effect concentration pnec of the antibiotics that are tested which is derived from the toxicity values of these antibiotics in this study ecological hazards of major veterinary antibiotics were assessed using standard aquatic toxicity model species representing various trophic levels including vibrio fischeri daphnia magna moina macrocopa and oryzias latipes the ecological risk of these compounds was calculated and it was found that amoxicillin is classified as a high risk compound among the antimicrobials 69 antibiotics on reaching the drinking water can cause extreme allergy to species that are sensitive which includes human beings beta lactam is persistent in the water and soil and gets degraded in the soil at different water potentials which indicates the occurrence of resistant bacteria extensive use of antibiotics has led to an increase in the bacterial reluctant mechanism which gives rise to multidrug resistant bacteria 70 studies have been carried out in bacteria ex clostridium lactobacillus escherichia coli enterococcus which showed that in response to the stress of antibiotics such as penicillin amoxicillin erythromycin ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole the metabolic activities of the bacteria are affected 71 antibiotics are persistent in the environment thereby impacting the non target organisms by affecting the biogeochemical cycles in the aquatic environment it creates an ecological imbalance by producing toxic effects on the aquatic organisms alters the plant growth changes in the sex ratios in the higher animals abnormalities in the anatomy of many organisms 72 bioaccumulation of the amoxicillin in the fish tissues which can be consumed as food thereby causing undesirable effects on the human leading to immunoallergic responses and can induce the bacterial resistant genes in fish tissues amoxicillin is toxic to the fish oryzias latipes and at 96 h the lc50 was recorded to be 1000 mg l 69 however amoxicillin is highly toxic to synechococcus leopoliensis blue green algae having lc50 of 1 56 μg l at 96 h up to the concentration of 50 ng l 50 mg l 73 amoxicillin exposure to the embryo and adults of danio rerio leads to structural deformities especially in the tail region along with abnormal development of fish and modifications in the normal enzyme functioning in adults 74 amoxicillin inhibits catalase production in the brain and gills and can induce glutathione transferase production in the tissues cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa exposure to amoxicillin can lead to an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species ṛos amoxicillin exposure can also injure the dna leading to an increase in ros production 75 amoxicillin is phytotoxic to spirodela polyrhiza duckweed it induces phytotoxic stress to plants a significant effect on vegetative growth was observed the activity of the oxidative stress enzymes such as catalase superoxide dismutase sod was observed 76 in conclusion there is still a lack of information on the ecotoxicity profile of amoxicillin literature survey reports on the amoxicillin effect on aquatic flora and fauna are scarce which is due to the low toxicity of amoxicillin because many cases are associated with an ec50 value of up to 1000 mg l 74 table 3 summarises the toxicity of amoxicillin on the aquatic ecosystem 6 wwtps in the spread of antibiotic resistance wwtps are important for sustainable development high organic loads and contaminants such as antibiotics are removed from the environment with the use of wwtps wwtp execution avoids the harmful microbes spread and eutrophication of water bodies 78 the wwtps are considered to be hotspots for antibiotic resistance and the spread of args studies show that wwtps can positively affect the selection of args and arbs spread the antibiotics are persistent in the environment and recalcitrant compounds therefore provide difficulty for wastewater treatment args provide a challenge for the treatment of wastewater 79 wastewater is the fundamental reservoir of the arbs and args therefore it is necessary to study the wwtp s influence in the spread of arbs and args 80 wwtps have abundant nutrients carbon sources nitrate content and oxygen wherein bacteria can be adsorbed stable temperature of 15 20 ph of 6 6 7 4 81 the antibiotic residues favor the selection of arbs in urban wwtps the wwtps provides a bacterial cell interaction along with nutrient supply which aids in the horizontal gene transfer of args 82 arbs released in the environment through the urban wwtps effluents can lead to harmful diseases in living beings along with the spread of args via hgt several methods for reducing the arbs and args in urban wwtps such as treatment with ultra violet radiation ozonation adsorption chlorination among others can be employed but reactivation of these arbs and args can take place the hospital and domestic waste discharge the arbs and antibiotics into the wwtps 83 the wwtps are critical in the spread of antibiotic resistance which is based on these factors concentrations of the antibiotic residues are high in the treated effluent the args arbs and the antibiotic residues are discharged into the municipal wwtps the favorable conditions are provided for the spread of the resistant genes by hgt and selection of resistance genes in the wwtps 84 wwtps effluents are one of the main drivers for the spread and propagation of resistance genes in the environment 85 7 recent trends in the remediation of amoxicillin the production of antibiotics has accelerated with the increase in the development of novel methodologies and that has led to enhanced contamination of antibiotic levels in the environment the antibiotic residues as a result of human activities in the water bodies are difficult to be treated antibiotic residues find their way into the environment without much further processing therefore it has become the need of the hour to develop remediation processes for monitoring the high level of antibiotics 8 biodegradation of amoxicillin amoxicillin is not adequately removed in the wwtp it gets introduced into the groundwater and surface water which can lead to the development of chronic resistance in the aquatic flora and fauna due to long term exposure to small quantities of the antibiotic 86 several mechanisms including hydrolysis adsorption photolysis oxidation reduction are involved in the removal of amoxicillin from wastewater 87 a generalized pathway showing the degradation of amoxicillin is shown in fig 2 these mechanisms are not cost effective and many problems are encountered in the processing 88 antibiotics biodegradation is economical and completely degrades amoxicillin in any environment such as sludge groundwater soil and sediments 89 the biodegradation of amoxicillin depends on various environmental parameters such as temperature ph nitrogen and carbon sources solid retention time srt and microbial activity 90 bacteria such as rhodococcus b30 91 and microcystis aeruginosa 92 can degrade amoxicillin biodegradation of 17 antibiotics was checked based on the zahn wellens test and amoxicillin showed partial degradation with the formation of stable metabolites while the penicillin showed 87 degradation 93 bacteria including staphylococcus aureus 94 escherichia coli 95 acinetobacter 96 helicobacter pylori 97 are resistant to amoxicillin therefore it is a big challenge to remove antibiotic from the environment the bacteria that can survive and thrive in the presence of amoxicillin can be exploited for amoxicillin removal bacteria belonging to the genus stenotrophomonas and alcaligenes were able to remove amoxicillin in m9 minimal media in 14 days and lc ms ms was employed for confirming the degradation products and metabolites including benzoic acid and penicillic acid were detected 27 98 amoxicillin can be degraded using beta lactamase producing bacteria ex enterobacter sp corynebacterium sp 43 bacillus subtilis 76 7 flavobacterium sp 41 acinetobacter lwoffi 74 3 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 77 8 were able to degrade 60 ppm of amoxicillin many other strains of bacteria such as escherichia coli achromobacter sp vibrio sp micrococcus sp are also shown to degrade amoxicillin amoxicillin is reported to be resistant to alcaligenes acinetobacter citrobacter pseudomonas klebsiella serratia and proteus 99 9 bioremediation limitations and scope pharmaceutical wastewater can be treated by bioremediation microorganisms are ubiquitous in water but their action is not effective which might be due to a lack of phosphorous or nitrogen 100 bioremediation is limited to biodegradable pollutants which can make it difficult for the treatment xenobiotics the pilot scale studies extrapolation to a large scale is difficult the end product of the bioremediation is toxic as compared to the untreated antibiotic itself 101 however the technique is highly versatile bioremediation can be conjugated with another physical biological or chemical method to improve its efficiency a sequential reactor can be designed to nullify any possibilities of the residue generation or the occurrence of recalcitrant compounds in the effluents generated 102 10 microalgae based technology for amoxicillin removal microalgae based removal offers several advantages such as fixation of carbon dioxide removal of contaminants saving the nutrients input and development of algae derived products 103 in one of the studies by villar navarro et al 104 33 antibiotics having an average concentration of 223 μg l were shown to be removed in a high rate algal pond hrap which was dominated by coelastrum sp 105 the algal based removal of the antibiotics is based on the antibiotic induced inhibition of the microalgae it has been reported that antibiotics inhibit the enzyme activities such as superoxide dismutase and catalase along with the synthesis of chlorophyll pigments which affect algal growth 103 the ec50 value is calculated to determine the inhibitory effect of the antibiotics on microalgae the microalgae are resistant to the antibiotics because the ec50 value is higher than the actual concentration of antibiotics in wastewater the amoxicillin concentration is 1 34 μg l in wwtp pseudokirchneriellasubcapitata is highly resistant to amoxicillin even 2000 mg l of the amoxicillin resulted in 10 inhibition of the algal growth 1 34 μg l of amoxicillin is present in the effluent of wwtp and at 96 h ec50 50 is achieved when treated with p subcapitata and an ec50 value of 56 3 was reached at the end of 72 h when treated with anabaena sp cpb4337 105 growth based ec50 value is used to assess the toxicity of the antibiotics to the microalgae other essential activities such as antioxidant system carotenoid biosynthesis and photosynthesis are also affected by the antibiotics and might be more indicative than the ec50 value chlorella pyrenoidosa also has a potential in the removal of amoxicillin over 100 of 100 300 mg l amoxicillin removal is observed by c pyrenoidosa at hrt of 48 h in bg11 medium 106 c pyrenoidosa along with fenton oxidation can remove 93 3 of amoxicillin 1 g l at 48 h scenedesmus obliquus along with uv radiation at 280 nm can remove up to 99 of 100 mg l of amoxicillin 107 the removal mechanisms involved are photodegradation hydrolysis and biodegradation adsorption and accumulation in adsorption antibiotics passively bind to the solid material the adsorbent used can be nano materials activated carbon and biochar 108 antibiotics can bind to the microalgae via the use of functional groups such as cellulose or proteins this is an extracellular process the binding of the antibiotic to the microalgae cell wall depends on the type of antibiotics hydrophilicity and functional groups 108 accumulation is an intracellular process antibiotics can cross the cell membranes of algae and can be assimilated by cells 109 antibiotics might induce the formation of ros to control metabolism at nominal concentration but in excess can lead to cell death accumulation is followed by biodegradation and both these steps together can lead to complete assimilation of antibiotics the biodegradation involves both intracellular and extracellular degradation of antibiotics the intracellular process involves adsorption of antibiotics on algae transmitted to the algal cell wall and action of intracellular enzymes for breaking the antibiotics 110 whereas the algal metabolites ex extracellular enzymes break the antibiotic and end products get metabolized antibiotic degradation using algal species involves two metabolism process co metabolic and metabolic patterns in the co metabolic pattern non specific enzymes and additional carbon and nitrogen sources are required for antibiotic degradation whereas in the metabolic process antibiotic acts as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen along with specific enzymes help in degradation 111 many reactions including oxidation reduction and hydrolysis are employed for antibiotic degradation 112 photodegradation is another process employed by the microalgae for antibiotics degradation direct photolysis involves antibiotic degradation using light whereas indirect degradation takes place via the algal components in the presence of light 113 the photodegradation is not effective for antibiotics recalcitrant to light hydrolysis also helps in antibiotic degradation in beta lactam antibiotics the hydrolysis of the beta lactam ring leads to the opening of the beta lactam ring 114 the hydrolysis reaction depends on temperature and ph algae growth alters the culture ph and affects the hydrolysis reactions hydrophilicity and polarity facilitate the solubilization of antibiotics and biodegradation by microalgae 111 irradiation using uv rays is used in the treatment of wastewater as a disinfectant step enhanced antibiotic removal is seen in treatment with uv it directly or indirectly influences photodegradation which helps in advanced removal direct photolysis can be applied for the removal of light sensitive antibiotics photons are absorbed by antibiotics which helps in breaking the bonds between antibiotics 115 the uv radiations may harm algal growth therefore it is advisable to use the uv mutated algal species advanced oxidation is also used to enhance antibiotic removal by microalgae fenton reactions coupled with h2o2 fe ii are used to enhance antibiotic degradation 116 indirect photodegradation using fe iii induces the formation of reactive oxygen species which assists the removal by microalgae 117 in conclusion microalgae assisted removal of amoxicillin is efficient in antibiotic removal biodegradation adsorption hydrolysis accumulation and photodegradation are involved in the effective removal of amoxicillin integrating the microalgae treatment with other treatment processes such as advanced oxidation uv irradiation along with the bacteria and fungi consortia can lead to effective amoxicillin removal 11 role of nanoparticles in amoxicillin removal in the last decade nanotechnology has made a significant contribution to the scientific community environmental nano remediation is an important branch that involves the use of reactive nanoscale material for the remediation of pollutants the high reactivity and small size make them an excellent candidate for the detoxification of contaminants from the groundwater and soil 118 the nanoparticles can get infiltrated in small pores of soil and can suspend in the water a study by machado et al 119 used zero valent iron gnzvis for the removal of amoxicillin these particles are used as a catalyst for the fenton reactions and as reductants it can degrade 100 of amoxicillin in an aqueous solution when used as a reductant in a ratio of 1 15 amoxicillin gnzvi and as a catalyst in the fenton s reaction in 1 13 1 amoxicillin h202 gnzvi 118 gnzvi is produced with sodium borohydride the natural extracts aids in the enhanced degradation of amoxicillin in fenton s reaction nanoparticles act as a catalyst and 100 degradation was achieved in 15 min whereas in the soil gnzvi acts as a reducing agent and due to the parallel reaction of the nanoparticle with the soil matrix degradation efficiency was found to be decreased to 60 and complete degradation was achieved after 1800 h it is the need of the hour to focus on the development of novel remediation strategies which helps to overcome the problem of amoxicillin resistant bacteria electrochemical remediation can be used to treat the contaminants in wastewater low cost easy handling and high efficiency are the few factors that make it a promising method 120 radicals generated by electrochemical oxidation are used for the complete mineralization of antibiotics 121 the disadvantage being the contamination risk of electrodes such as ti and pbo2 by heavy metals mainly because of leaching from the anode of otherwise highly efficient electrodes carbon electrodes having a lesser cost and pose a lesser risk to the environment could be used as an alternative 122 the electrode material is an important parameter that governs the efficiency of electrochemical remediation along with the current density and the ph 123 in the study by brito et al 124 the electrochemical remediation was seen and the by products which were generated by the remediation were monitored using mass spectrometry and the toxicity evaluation was done on the zebrafish embryos 12 amoxicillin removal using adsorbents several methods including photocatalytic degradation advanced oxidation electron degradation and adsorption are used for amoxicillin removal 125 the adsorption is the most preferred method as it is more effective because it restricts pollutants transportation into the water systems 126 many adsorbents such as activated carbons porous polymers magnetic graphene oxide activated carbon magnetic fe3o4 activated carbon nanocomposite are used the study by chaba nomngongo 125 showed the removal of amoxicillin using a combination of zinc oxide nanoparticles and carbon nanofilters zno cnf nano adsorbent the carbon nanofilters were used due to their anisotropic properties pore size and high adsorption 127 zinc oxide nanoparticles were used due to their stability non toxic behavior and eco friendliness 128 the hydrothermal method was used to prepare the zno cnf nano adsorbent the interaction between the nano adsorbent and the amoxicillin was studied using the langmuir freundlich equation it was concluded that the nanocomposites can be regenerated and reused up to 15 times activated carbon can be used to remove toxic compounds from the environment 129 contaminants can be removed using an adsorbent as it is simple and feasible to use not expensive and is not affected by the contaminant toxicity therefore adsorption is an efficient technology the adsorption process depends on the adsorbent and contaminants characteristics 130 activated carbon is used to remove contaminants because of its surface area and porosity the disadvantage of using activated adsorbents is its high cost one of the studies by putra et al 131 performed a study to check the adsorption capacity of amoxicillin on bentonite at different ph values the adsorption capacity was found to be more at higher ph xing zha et al 132 also studied the amoxicillin removal from aqueous solutions using bentonite modified using a cationic surfactant such as octadecyl amine and hexadecyl trimethyl they observed that it has the highest adsorption capacity 13 amoxicillin removal by carbon adsorbent mainly the carbon adsorbents are used as they are resistant to alkali and acid stable and have high adsorption capacity to improve the adsorption capacity of adsorbents the chemical modifying agents are added however they can lead to secondary pollution and are costly 133 one of the studies by yu et al 134 used the powdery puffed waterfowl feather ppwf doped phragmites australis a novel carbon based adsorbent for the removal of amoxicillin from the water phragmites australis is grown in wetlands has a high carbon content the ppwf is a protein waste that is used as a modifier and can increase the functional groups of carbon adsorbents the undoped pac and ppwf doped fpac carbon adsorbents were synthesized to test the adsorption of amoxicillin and cephalexin the adsorption capacities were calculated and it was observed that fpac has a higher adsorption capacity as compared to pac the adsorption kinetics followed pseudo second order for amoxicillin and cephalexin the antibiotics are adsorbed via chemisorption i e covalent bonding and electrostatic attraction 13 1 adsorptive removal of antibiotics using acid activated carbon from prosopis juliflora emerging contaminants such as antibiotics can be removed from aqueous solutions using activated carbon is less reported adsorptive removal of ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin from single and binary adsorption systems with the use of adsorptive carbon procured from the woods of prosopis juliflora in binary adsorption the antibiotics have an antagonistic and synergistic influence on each other many parameters influence the efficient adsorption of the antibiotic such as the antibiotic concentration ph of the solution containing the antibiotic incubation temperature of the sorbent sorbate and the dose of prosopis juliflora the study results show that amoxicillin has a synergistic effect on ciprofloxacin adsorption whereas ciprofloxacin has an antagonistic effect on the adsorption of amoxicillin in binary adsorption studies in a single adsorption system prosopis juliflora has langmuir maximum adsorption of 714 29 mg g for amoxicillin and 250 mg g for ciprofloxacin 135 prosopis juliflora can be recycled and reused for 4 cycles desorption is done with 0 1 naoh and a minimal effect is seen on antibiotic adsorption over the plant s surface of the co existing anions and cations 136 prosopis juliflora was treated with acid which is followed by pyrolysis for the production of acid activated carbon prosopis juliflora for the removal of amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin the acid activated carbon obtained from the woods of the plant prosopis juliflora is economical and cheap for antibiotic removal it is an efficient alternative as compared to commonly used adsorbents in conclusion prosopis juliflora proved to be effective in the removal of amoxicillin and can be used for the remediation of other pollutants also 137 antibiotics can be removed partially from wastewaters using conventional methods 138 anaerobic treatment processes can aid in removing antibiotics from wastewater 139 advanced oxidation membrane bioreactors adsorption using activated adsorption and activated sludge can aid in the removal of pollutants 140 in the process for contaminants treatment some of them get adsorbed onto the sludge whereas others are biodegraded using microbes and discharged as effluent subsequently the removal processes include adsorption biodegradation volatilization and hydrolysis for the removal of antibiotics such as tetracycline and sulphonamides it was found that the adsorption and biodegradation was the primary route for antibiotics removal 141 142 the removal of arb and arg in the wwtp depends on the type of reactors and treatment technology 143 the aerobic reactors or the aerobic anaerobic reactors combination can effectively remove arg aerobic anaerobic reactors can effectively remove arg than anaerobic reactors in the activated sludge system the microbes are removed using longer hydraulic retention times whereas exposure for a long period can favor the exchange of arg and leads to resistance against multiple drugs 79 biological treatment and advanced treatment such as photo fenton membrane filtration coagulation chlorination and ultraviolet radiation can be used for antibiotics removal 96 14 activated sludge process for amoxicillin removal beta lactams are persistent and recalcitrant to degradation they are present at high concentrations in the environment as high as 100 mg l 144 beta lactam antibiotics are detected in drinking water groundwater and surface water 145 the antibiotic and antibiotic transformation products can lead to args production 146 the activated sludge process can be used for antibiotic removal from the environment one of the studies by baghapour et al 147 showed the amoxicillin removal from the aqueous solution via the use of submerged biological aerated filters sbaf different amoxicillin concentrations were used to check the degradation using aerobic consortia at high amoxicillin influent the 35 removal was reached it was concluded that degradation was dependent on the amount of amoxicillin in the influent wastewater strength and hydraulic retention times therefore three different hrt were taken 3 h 6 h and 12 h the amoxicillin removal was increased at long hrt and at 12 h the removal was reached to almost 50 147 the mixed aerobic culture was used for the amoxicillin treatment from aqueous solutions the degradation of amoxicillin was dependent on the hrts amoxicillin concentration in the influent and the wastewater strength sbaf was desirable for the degradation of amoxicillin in the aqueous environment 147 15 amoxicillin removal using advanced oxidation processes aop for the treatment of wastewater and waters advanced oxidation processes aops have been employed 148 aops have been shown to contribute significantly to the degradation of nonbiodegradable and recalcitrant organic pollutants the hydroxyl radicals ho production in solutions is the main basis of the oxidation processes the ho is a strong oxidizing agent in the aop the phase transfer of the pollutant takes place along with its destruction many methods have been employed for the degradation of and mineralization of amoxicillin which includes the likes of photo fenton fenton ozonation uv h2o2 uv o3 uv o3 fe2 uv h2o2 o3 uv h2o2 fe2 149 among all the aops the ozonation is the most efficient in mineralization and degradation of amoxicillin 150 radicals are generated by chemical electrochemical photochemical and photocatalytic reactions the organic compounds are hydroxylated until they get mineralized completely 151 in laboratory scale experiments the uv and uv h2o2 treatments are widely being used 99 of amoxicillin removal is reported via the use of fenton s process 152 the major disadvantage of fenton s process is the sludge formation because of the iron molecules added to the system the most efficient aops is ozonation and catalytic ozonation and eliminates amoxicillin within short reaction times aqueous amoxicillin 100 μg l 100 mg l can get eliminated in 30 60 min by the processes such as uv h2o2 zno uv h2o2 uv tio2 uv h2o2 tio2 under several doses of uv for achieving 50 total organic carbon toc and 20 50 chemical oxygen demand cod removal it was important to extend the time of reaction 153 fenton processes involve h2o2 and fe2 which generate ho radicals fe3 gets regenerated when fe2 with excess of ooh and h2o2 154 the study by souza et al 155 compared the several aops o3 o3fe2 uv o3 fe2 o3 uv for amoxicillin degradation and mineralization in an aqueous solution mineralization efficiency is calculated in terms of toc aops were compared based on mineralization efficiency and amoxicillin removal the experimental results in the study showed that all the above mentioned aops led to the total amoxicillin degradation and mineral efficiency of all the processes were similar 56 61 at ph 11 ozonation was considered as the best amongst the aop as it does not require any catalyst or uv radiation it has been observed that ozonation produce 60 4 of toc removal at ph 11 in 1 h reaction time which further suggests that ozonation produces refractory products which cannot be easily oxidized further however the overall ecotoxicity is reduced 155 electrochemical oxidation of amoxicillin was carried out by brito et al 124 which showed that tap water anodes such as na2so4 and nacl solutions can help in the removal of amoxicillin and the toxicity of the residual amoxicillin was evaluated on the early life stages of zebrafish the intermediates generated after eo were analyzed using mass spectrometry and the antimicrobial activities of the intermediates were evaluated significant mortality was not observed in zebrafish on extended exposure to amoxicillin but affects the development of zebrafish i e an increase in the body length was observed 0 1 m nacl was more efficient in amoxicillin removal than 0 1 m na2so4 but 0 1 m na2so4 was more toxic as compared to 0 1 m nacl the antimicrobial activity of the amoxicillin was inhibited using a carbon modified titanium dioxide tio2 c electrode with 0 01 m nacl 124 in conclusion the optimization of the aops to improve their practicability and adaptability which includes the improvement of ozone or h2o2 utilization efficiency and enhancing the catalyst efficiency however more emphasis should be given to understand the mechanism of degradation of pollutants along with the generation of free radicals the potential application of aops can be studied to see the removal of args and arbs in wastewater wastewater is complicated as it contains multiple pollutants multiple antibiotics and many inorganic compounds which reduces the degradation efficiency of aops aops cannot efficiently degrade the antibiotics the biological treatment can be used in combination with the aops for enhancing the mineralization of pollutants the integrated approach can increase the processing efficiency of many folds and can lower the cost of operation 16 membrane bioreactor mbr for amoxicillin removal membrane bioreactors mbrs have the potential for the removal of emerging contaminants from wastewater in one of the studies by matsubara et al 2020 amoxicillin removal was seen from synthetic wastewater using mbrs a continuous flow pre denitrification pilot unit a o mbr was used for amoxicillin removal 100 μg l of amoxicillin was added to the influent hrt of 40 h was used 156 high resolution mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography revealed the presence of five degradation products of amoxicillin in the effluent wastewater the dissolved organic carbon doc and cod removal efficiency were unchanged after amoxicillin addition whereas the hrt was reduced the amoxicillin concentration up to 100 μg l could not even inhibit the aerobic heterotrophic bacteria present in the biomass of mbr 157 it was observed that the removal of amoxicillin was increased with increasing a o mbr hrt which makes the amoxicillin available for degradation via adsorption of amoxicillin fraction in large amounts to the sludge in conclusion in pilot scale bioreactor studies hrt plays a vital role in the removal of non conventional pollutants higher hrts than usual should be used for amoxicillin removal the largest amoxicillin fraction 68 was removed using biodegradation and adsorption in the a o mbr system ecotoxicity assays were also performed which shows that the e coli was less resistant and pseudomonas fluorescents are more resistant to the residues of amoxicillin 158 17 conclusion antibiotics play a vital role in the healthcare of living organisms antibiotic contamination has increased the risk of antimicrobial resistance the failure of wwtp to eliminate the antibiotics and their residue has further accelerated the risk of antimicrobial resistance in the health sector multidrug resistance args and arb is a huge threat amoxicillin is widely used to treat bacterial infections in humans and animals increasing resistance against amoxicillin has rendered it ineffective although certain methods have been applied for amoxicillin removal physicochemical methods and aops for antibiotic removal have certain limitations such as the formation of toxic by products inefficiency and higher cost alternatively bioremediation has been researched extensively which includes in situ methods such as phytoremediation and ex situ methods such as mbr bioremediation techniques have the potential can be a means of sustainable management of wastewater the molecular study of microorganisms can help in a better way to understand the metabolic pathways which can assist in designing techniques to overcome the limitations faced by bioremediation another process that can be used to overcome the nutrients scarce for the microorganisms is bio stimulation this process can help to provide nutrients for the microbial consortium for the bioremediation of pollutants nanomaterials are an emerging field aids to improve the efficacy of microorganisms by lowering the activation energy and increasing the surface area antibiotics being hydrophobic and lipophilic cannot be completely removed from the environment but in depth studies are

13683,in this paper a general strategy is presented for optimizing water resources in industrial activities taking into account fluctuations of water flow streams and water contents in feed and products as well as in the utility system indeed considering fluctuations can be of primary importance for several water intensive industries such as the food or the paper pulp industry furthermore whenever the water balance includes the water content of products as is typically the case for the food industry fluctuations in the composition of products can considerably affect the overall balance due to water being a major component of many foods therefore the currently used optimization strategies that disregard water fluctuations can lead to a severe bias in the water balance and thus overlook the potential of water recovery and reuse including this aspect in widely used algorithms for process monitoring data reconciliation and optimization might lead to a possibly prohibitive increase in the computational burden in particular it is shown in this paper that the resulting optimization algorithm should solve a dynamic non convex stochastic mixed integer nonlinear programming problem to tackle this typically np hard problem a strategy has been developed that combines ordinal optimization for dealing with statistical information and nonlinear non convex deterministic algorithms the outlined strategy has been applied to a complex process in the food industry production of starch and starch based products the results seem to confirm the general validity of the

keywords food processing water reuse wastewater reduction mathematical optimization data reconciliation circular economy 1 introduction water is the main component of almost all living species and a key element in human life indeed practically all human activities depend directly or indirectly on water on a global average the main water demanding sectors are agriculture industries and urbanization absorbing around 70 20 and 10 of the amount withdrawn from water resources respectively 1 in particular the demand for water from industries worldwide is expected to increase by 400 in 2050 2 in view of the rapid growth in global industrialization while several industrial sectors can be considered water intensive including electrochemical processes 3 the garment and textile the pulp paper and the automotive industry 4 the industrial food sector defined as the set of industrial activities that process agricultural and farming raw materials is one of the most demanding industrial activities in terms of water since water contributes on average about 80 of the total weight of food materials it determines the majority of its properties structure appearance taste and stability and the ways in which a product can be processed in addition to being an ingredient in a large number of products water generally enters the food industry similarly to most other industrial activities in two main ways i process applications e g as a reactant and ii non process applications e g resources and washing cooling and heating 5 the pressure for reducing the amount of water consumed is further increased by the ever stricter regulations on wastewater discharges which force continuously rising standards of best available technologies bats and or a simultaneous increase of effluent taxes some examples of this twofold strategy can be found in jetoo 6 and möller gulland et al 7 indeed highly polluted wastewater is produced in significant quantities by the processing industry which can cause intense damages to the environment especially if accidentally discharged 8 the food industry is no exception as relevant amounts of organic compounds nitrogen phosphorous and heavy metals are released with wastewater in particular depending on the different food processed noukeu et al 9 report for the mentioned substances the following concentration ranges mg l cod 457 357 725 nh4 1 23 2925 po4 3 3 567 3240 pb 0 083 1 025 cd 0 052 0 158 the improper release of wastewaters with similar amounts of contaminants can severely pollute the water resources of the soil surface and underground requiring specific reclamation strategies to contain remove the contamination 10 12 additionally as for the meat industry 13 wastewater may also contain chromium and tannins that are directly involved in the deaths of aquatic animals 14 15 the water footprint and water neutrality concepts were introduced to estimate the pressure of a specific product or an industrial activity on water resources however while the former does not provide any information on how to reduce water consumption or its impact on the environment the latter still has some drawbacks which hinder its establishment as a strong and meaningful concept 16 indeed the definition of water neutrality as the requirement that for every new development the total water use in the region after development must be equal to or less than total water use in the region before development is generally considered to be potentially ambiguous as key issues such as development and region are not clearly specified 17 in principle the techniques developed for general applications with a view to optimizing water consumption can be applied to the food industry provided the amount of water in final products is duly taken into account water pinch analysis wpa and mathematical optimization are two alternative or complementary strategies that are frequently used to minimize water consumption and wastewater generation indeed while the latter approach is more rigorous and general because it does not require the approximations contained in the pinch analysis e g constant activity and transfer coefficients it can occasionally lead to convergence problems thus the two methods can be employed alternatively after considering the complexity of the model and the consequences of the simplifications contained in the pinch analysis or complementarily using the results provided by the pinch analysis as starting values for the subsequent optimization problem the steadily increasing price of water over 40 from 2010 to 2015 in the largest usa cities 18 has forced both process designers and plant operators to consider treatment efficiency as well as potential reuse and recycling options as key issues in the general optimization procedure unlike the energy case savings in freshwater and wastewater in countries where availability of water still does not constitute a particular problem are unlikely on their own to justify the cost of carrying out a detailed water pinch study and implementing the recommended projects this results in a slower integration of these concepts into the standard industrial design procedures particularly in the case of retrofit projects focused on existing facilities furthermore water networks subjected to existing and not recently built industrial complexes typically only have the minimum instrumentation required by the operation and measurements of most of the water flows are not available this lack of information hampers the implementation of retrofit projects starting from the data extraction phase when it is essential to assess with good reliability the freshwater grades and flow rates supplied to the process units and to treatment facilities in the current state 19 undeniably this trend is not uniform in all cases there are some industrial sectors for example wood pulp and paper that involve a relevant consumption of freshwater and regional areas for example the middle east where water scarcity hampers industrial development or where the actual cost of freshwater is in absolute terms higher or comparable to the cost of energy that have seen the flourishing of various project and applications aimed at optimizing this resource however in the food industry additional difficulties arise from the multiple use of water in particular because of the frequent incorporation of water streams into products which adds further limits to the quality of the water circulating in the plant and their use regeneration before being discharged this also leads to the impossibility to directly measure the water content of process streams raw materials intermediate and finished products which is then considered jointly to the flowrate of the process streams nevertheless fluctuations in the mixed streams due a variable water content should be properly addressed in the overall data reconciliation process because they can have an incidence even higher than measurement errors in process streams especially in the presence of evaporation losses which cannot be measured and involve a compensation effect that might hide the unbalances due to water content oscillations in this contribution the focus is in particular on the development of a suitable model for the optimal management of water resources which allows considering water content fluctuations in both feed streams and products and is to be considered the main result of the work indeed water balances can be considerably affected by the presence of comparatively large fluctuations of streams and product compositions neglecting them can lead to a suboptimal operational performance of the control system and consequently to an increased water consumption as verified in the industrial case considered the reconciliation of dynamic data has been analyzed using different approaches such as those based on kalman filtering 20 or modified versions of it bai et al 2006 52 on nonlinear programming algorithms for the minimization of deviations on least squares over a pre determined time window 21 and on integral methods as suggested by bagajewicz and jiang 22 their use implies the knowledge of the analytical model of the process typically given by a dae system the selection of a limited time window and the impossibility of monitoring the presence of sources and sinks such as unit hold up fluctuations and leaks unfortunately in the case analyzed the use of the overall process model could hardly be taken into consideration due to the prohibitive computational effort necessary to simulate the high dimensional non convex severely nonlinear problem resulting from the model of complex and frequently approximately known set of reactions that take place in the process similarly the time window that could be considered is given by the frequency of quality control tests that determine the water content of products which turns out to be much higher than the one required by methods that compute time derivatives using discretization techniques however the water content fluctuations in the product which correspond to sinks and leaks in the approaches described are indeed available on a statistical basis these three basic differences require the use of a different approach that will be illustrated in the following section the next section provides information on the difficulties underlying this type of optimization problem while section 3 illustrates the overall mathematical model highlighting the differences with respect to processes where no additional uncertainty is present due to fluctuating amounts of water in the products subsequently the application of the model developed to a real case study is outlined general information on the considered plant is provided a real bio refinery for raw maize processing along with some results obtained using the procedure described in this document the amount of information is limited for reasons of confidentiality since corn refineries are among the major water demanding food industries requiring approximately 4300 million m3 of freshwater and producing about 3800 million m3 of wastewater worldwide 5 the application of suitable solutions for the management of water consumption and wastewater generation in these industrial units can be of great importance the development of practical methodologies to optimize the use of water resources even in complex but relevant activities as in the case of the food industry will become increasingly critical in the coming decades and is also in line with strategies such as the circular economy the recourse to bats and the near zero discharge of hazardous wastes 23 a transition to a circular economy could create significant synergies for the widespread adoption of water reuse as an alternative water supply overcoming many of the barriers that water reuse is still facing ranging from public perception to price and regulatory challenges 2 theory 2 1 fundamentals in water consumption minimization management water recovery and reuse are the bases of most industrial water and wastewater management strategies this entails the use of a consumer of water effluent as a supply source for another consumer of water sink without treatment direct reuse or after partial treatments regeneration reuse 24 if originally these water network optimization methods were basically special cases of a mass exchanger network problem men 25 generalization of the original pinch analysis for heat integration 26 a specific water pinch analysis was soon developed using proper graphical procedures for targeting and design 27 the procedure consists of two phases the minimum targeting of freshwater and the design retrofit of the network for each of which several different techniques have been proposed 5 wpa problems 28 are generally addressed using mainly two approaches fixed load mostly studied in the nineties and fixed flow rate more recent applications 19 the first approach focuses primarily on removing the impurity load from the rich stream while the process water ﬂow requirement is a secondary concern and depends on the contaminants removal targets the second approach addresses the issue from the point of view of the water sink and the source rather than focusing on removing the impurity load the ﬂow rate is the main constraint of the system as for the energy pinch various tools have been proposed to define water recovery targets 29 advanced applications also make use of enhanced software tools to highlight and optimize the water network by maximizing water reuse providing for partial regeneration and effluent treatment opportunities 19 in replacement of pinch analysis or as integration mathematical programming methods can be used 30 these approaches are relying on the creation of a water network superstructure which includes all viable structural options and allow considering all the complexities e g cost objective function multiple contaminants operational limitations etc useful to extend their applicability to industrial cases including total site analysis 31 a thorough analysis on water resources optimization can be found in foo 29 jeżowski 32 and klemeš 33 in general an optimization problem can be formulated as linear programming lp non linear programming nlp or mixed integer non linear programming minlp however the optimal design should be identified using an optimization algorithm that can handle proper nonlinear objective functions which are generally non convex and constraints accommodating both continuous and discrete variables 34 the resulting algorithm is a minlp optimization solver and can lead to the overall optimal solution of the network among solvers of this type baron branch and reduce optimization navigator is the most used 35 2 2 food industry and fluctuating water the food industry requires a significant and continuous supply of freshwater as a separating agent e g extraction absorption stripping etc as a washing medium for the removal of contaminants for auxiliary scopes steam heating water cooling power generation as a raw material to be integrated into the finished products the contribution of the last item of this list is frequently limited however in some processes as in the case considered to validate the model it can represent a significant element of the overall water balance see section 4 2 in addition fluctuations in the water content of the products give rise to corresponding variations in both feed water and wastewater due to the water balance and the presence of feedback control the concomitance of all these operations within the same industrial plant involves the management of separate networks with different grades of water as well as the availability of water treatments that allow the production of suitable amounts of water streams with the required levels of purity in this complex scenario the global water material balance of a system must account for both pure water streams which can be of different types and handled through separated networks because of different levels of contaminants and mixed streams such as raw materials and products containing water the mixed streams water content is not typically constant as it is subject to variations related to the operating conditions of the process and the quality of the feedstock however it is not measured concurrently with the other data used to carry out the reconciliation process rather it is to be estimated using the statistical information provided by the quality control analysis consequently the usual techniques for data reconciliation and for minimizing the overall water consumption cannot take account of these fluctuations this is due to the monitoring system being designed for steady state operations in other words the model used for adjusting the data collected does not account for deviations from the design specifications accordingly the model presented in this paper has been extended to include the statistical information of the quality control analysis further difficulties arise when water is only a system utility due to a double constraint on the quantity of contaminants transported to water streams the quality of the products and the concentration of wastewater that may need regenerating before being discharged moreover the rectification of the process data as well as the following optimization has to deal with the possible serious non linearities arising from considering chemical reactions in the balance equations as shown in the following section all these difficulties can only be overcome through appropriate modifications of the algorithms for both monitoring and optimizing the process 3 materials and methods the mathematical model developed consists of two successive phases first the reconciliation procedure needed to consider the actual process variables in the optimization phase is suitably generalized to accommodate fluctuating water sinks section 3 1 subsequently appropriate modifications in the usual process optimization algorithms are examined to include fluctuating water sinks in the products in the actual optimization section 3 2 3 1 the reconciliation of process data data reconciliation is a statistical procedure that in return for adequate information e g on the structure of the random errors of the measured flow rates provides indications to adjust the measured values and estimate the unmeasured streams in order to balance both measured and unmeasured values identify gross errors and detect leaks and losses 36 for steady state processes suitable statistical objective functions typically relying on a likelihood criterion subject to constraints provided by material balances e g steady state conditions are used for the data rectification in some cases e g energy rectification some suitable strategies can be used to reduce the sensitivity of the process variables from the parameters involved 37 however for water resources problems in which only one component is considered the maximization can be carried out analytically on the set of linear equations provided by the mass balances allowing the detection and removal of gross errors defining with x the measurements of the flowrates of all the water streams of the process x and with x ˆ the corresponding rectified values they satisfy the set of steady state material balances 1 where a is the incidence matrix 1 a x ˆ 0 the number of rows m and columns n of a are given by the number of units subject to material balance and the total number of process streams included respectively the generic element a i j is defined as 1 or 1 depending on the stream j entering or leaving the unit i respectively while is 0 otherwise however as said the fluctuating water in products i e some of the x ˆ in 1 is not measured online alongside with the other flow measurements determining the net input value x rather samples are periodically collected to determine the water content though a quality control procedure therefore though their average statistical properties in the time interval corresponding to the sampling rate are available as well as information on their variance covariance the relevant data has to be suitably adjusted indeed these water content fluctuations detected in the quality control procedure can be elaborated to determine the relevant statistical information needed which in turn can be exploited to build an a priori likelihood function p 0 x ˆ p p 0 y of the type 2 2 p 0 y e y t v p 1 y with v being the variance covariance matrix of the process and the subscript p the index for the vectors of the product flow rate using the bayes theorem the a priori likelihood function 2 can be related to the distribution resulting from dynamic fluctuations 38 and the information provided by the measurements of x in this context the assumption of normal distribution for the experimental errors of the water content measurements provides the following a posteriori likelihood function 3 whose solution is given in an equivalent way by the minimum of 4 subject to 5 3 e x ˆ x t v 1 x ˆ x e y t v p 1 y 4 x ˆ x t v 1 x ˆ x y t v p 1 y 5 a x ˆ y the problem 4 5 can be solved in closed form for x ˆ 6 x ˆ a t v p 1 a v 1 1 v 1 x the matrix projection approach 39 can be used for the reconciliation of the identifiable values among the measurements that are eventually missing while the evaluation of the matrix v p is performed directly through the quality control system the incidence matrix v can be determined establishing an ad hoc tuning procedure 40 making use of the usual chi tests to deduce the missing statistical information by the deviations from steady state conditions due to the variation of hold ups in particular the following optimization criterion can be derived if the train of measurements including q data sets has a constrain on the sum of squared deviations to satisfy the chi square 7 φ q φ q 2 m i n φ q x q t a t v p 1 a v 1 1 v 1 i t v 1 a t v p 1 a v 1 1 v 1 i x q ν where q is the number of considered experimental samples ν is the dimension of x and i is the identity matrix a gauss newton algorithm can be exploited to perform the minimization with respect to the elements of v indeed though the distribution obtained by minimizing φ is as close as possible to the χ 2 distribution this may not be sufficient to satisfy the chi test the kolmogorov smirnov test can be exploited to check whether the experimental evidence available is adequate or the number of data sets should be increased 40 with the steps shown so far the general data reconciliation procedure for processes with an a priori products water content distribution has been fully outlined 3 2 the optimization of water resources as already stated the optimal design of food processes cannot fail to consider stochastic variables if fluctuations in the physico chemical properties and composition of the raw materials fed into the plants are to be taken into account likewise binary variables are required for the description of structural design alternatives as well as continuous parameters for the other unknown parameters of the process considering this the uncertainty of the supply conditions leads to a stochastic mixed integer nonlinear programming sminlp problem i e the optimal design problem can be formulated as follows 8 opt x y e s f x y s s t h x y s 0 g x y s 0 x r m y r n in 8 s r k is the vector of variables subject to a known probability distribution function while x and y are the operation and decision variables respectively the dependence of f scalar function h vector of the process equations and g vector of inequalities to exclude solutions unsuitable or physically impossible on x y and s stochastic parameters is non convex and highly nonlinear the objective function f is generally based on the minimization of the annualized costs of freshwater consumption and wastewater regeneration freshwater consumption due to the fluctuating water in products depends only on the properties of supply input however other contributions like evaporation and wastewater discharge downstream of the proper remediation treatments are linked to the process structure and the strategies of water reuse and recycling adopted and are consequently the result of the overall optimization task provided by eq 8 every instance of the vector s requires the resolution of an minlp problem 41 however due to the non convexity of the problem there may be more than one minimum with possibly very different values of the objective function making it necessary the adoption of an algorithm able to locate a global minimum in this regard the baron code 35 is probably the most frequently used solution it relies on a global optimization strategy exploiting a branch bound approach that is supposed to locate global optima under general assumptions thanks to a number of additional techniques to further reduce ranges of variables the code runs under the commercial gams environment 42 in the case study described below both baron and couenne were used for comparison the second code acronym of convex over and under envelopes for nonlinear estimation is a spatial branch bound algorithm based on minlp reformulation that uses branching bound reduction linearization and heuristics to find feasible solutions 43 comparing the two approaches no substantial differences were found in terms of efficiency and robustness which is a significant result considering that couenne is open source although the input file has to be specified in a mathematical programming language ampl syntax 44 on the other hand if the vector s is allowed to assume values corresponding to its probability distribution full stochastic mixed integer nonlinear programming sminlp has to be used if this is the case according to acevedo and pistikopoulos 45 numerical integration methods 46 are best used for small dimension problems whereas sample average methods generally based on monte carlo simulation techniques are more efficient for larger problems including process planning reactor design and risk analysis 47 to avoid further weighing the discussion please refer to ferrucci et al 48 for additional details in summary as the incorporation of minlp algorithms into a stochastic framework often implies an intractably high number of solutions to individual minlp problems the overall computational effort to solve them can be considerably reduced if ordinal optimization is used the ordinal optimization methodology 49 can be regarded as a general strategy that similarly to branch bound techniques reduces the domain of optimal solutions to a possibly small subset in which the actual solution is finally to be searched by preliminary specifying a suitable shortcut procedure on a case by case basis in this contribution a substantial relaxation of the integrality condition is considered as simplifying procedure in fact by reducing the tolerance the computational time of a sminlp can be decreased to the level of a simple minlp at this point simply by selecting the binary options discrete variables to the integer values closest to the values obtained by reducing the tolerance the problem can be turned into an snlp problem with a drastic reduction in computational load 3 3 case study definition the case study considered to test the original algorithms and strategies mentioned above is a bio refinery where raw corn is processed to obtain starches starch based products sugars and fermentations products marketed in various sectors such as food animal nutrition and the chemical and pharmaceutical industries a food industry company has expressed interest in a holistic study aimed at rationalizing the use of freshwater resources so as to minimize global demand and provided the necessary data despite the high level of attention dedicated by the corporate to the environmental impact of industrial activity nobody had ever done a complete study on the use of water resources the industrial complex began its activity more than sixty years ago and since its foundation the farm has grown up both in capacity and complexity and the consumption of freshwater has followed the same trend the current facility is a large scale plant involving eleven water units corresponding to six processing phases seven treatment units four for the preparation of incoming water and three for the treatment of wastewater and a main contaminant first phases are mainly physical processes like wet milling and dry milling while the subsequent steps are physico chemical chemical or biochemical processes acid and enzymatic starch liquefaction hydrolysis and fermentation the plant has a corn wet milling process separating the raw material into its constituent components starch 70 germ 4 fibre 2 and protein mainly gluten 10 50 the remaining part 14 is water the main corn refining processing steps namely wet milling co products separation and dry milling starch purification and drying are the most intense processes in terms of water and energy these three phases absorb 57 of the demand for freshwater and a similar percentage of energy heat and power generating respectively 48 and 37 of the overall wastewater and water evaporation loss a total of 4 2 tons of freshwater and 1 3 mw h of energy heat and power are needed to process one ton of raw corn resulting in the generation of 2 8 tons of wastewater and the evaporation of 1 5 tons in addition to the significant consumption of freshwater this industry is also characterised by high purity requirements and the need to manage different grades of freshwater in the same context fig 1 summarizes the available processes to treat the freshwater supplied to the complex and purify the wastewater before discharge superficial and deep aquifers from a nearby stream are mainly used to supply water to the plant with the public water network exploited only to a lesser extent based on its origin and use the incoming freshwater is subjected to different treatments deep aquifer water is directly used as raw water r for the production process superficial aquifer water is purified through filtration and subsequently fed into the raw water circuit nearby stream water is used for auxiliary purposes e g cooling service raw water is treated in reverse osmosis and softener units and demineralization columns anionic cationic decarburization to produce demineralized d and soft s water demineralized water is used to produce process steam p regardless of the type and grade just listed freshwater streams have a water content greater than 99 9 anyhow on the contrary mixed flows are defined in the specific case considered as follows feedstock raw corn average water content ranges between 13 and 15 depending on the origin and storage conditions intermediate products water content ranging between 10 and 85 depending on product and operating conditions finished products water content ranging between 0 and 54 depending on product and operating conditions chemicals water content ranging between 0 and 81 furthermore in the case of finished products it is also necessary to take into account the commercial specifications that bind the maximum water content of the various products therefore most laboratory tests related to the water content are carried out on finished products while less information is typically available to determine the water content of intermediate products a simplified diagram of the global process is shown in fig 2 the scheme details the grade of water consumed by each unit in addition the scheme highlights production consumption of recycled water y evaporation losses l and wastewater w generated by the product s washing treatments upon exiting the plant the wastewater undergoes anaerobic and aerobic treatments aimed at reducing its concentration of contaminants before being discharged fig 1 to simplify the representation the path of a single water recycling y entering or exiting the various blocks is shown in fig 2 dashed line in red but in practice there are multiple flows with different origins and purity levels typical examples are washing and purification water or exhaust steam consequently the specific level of contaminants of each water stream coming out of a process must be carefully considered in the context of the water optimization study both the main process and the freshwater treatments generate wastewater the amount produced to condition the incoming freshwater accounts for about 20 of the total wastewater production from the research point of view the case is stimulating because it requires tackling various issues that are sometimes not considered from a theoretical perspective but which occur in reality these problems which usually occur because the original complex designer did not provide the required monitoring equipment for the auxiliary systems could jeopardize the positive result of the optimization project 3 4 definition of the integrated water balance to perform a more in depth process analysis in the next phase highlighting potential areas of optimization a data reconciliation activity was performed that includes both freshwater treatments and primary process streams in the same environment the two systems are complex and intimately integrated and it is not advisable to model them separately due to the concomitant existence of material transfers from the water network to products and of significant evaporation losses this analysis led to the definition of an incidence matrix consisting of 20 nodes and 108 streams representing the total material balance of water from the aquifers to the treatment of wastewater including the process phases as mentioned the fluctuating water in mixed streams is included in the reconciliation procedure leading to the need to formulate hypotheses on the water content of each stream based on various factors related to changes in the quality of feedstock environmental and plant operating conditions the impact of these fluctuations in the overall process of data reconciliation can be even higher than that of measurement errors and must be addressed correctly also because of the compensation effects related to the presence of evaporation losses which could hide the imbalances due to oscillations of the water content 3 5 basic reconciliation software to manage the problem of data reconciliation the methodology outlined by crowe et al 39 was implemented firstly this method applies linear algebra techniques 51 to perform mathematical operations on the data matrices characteristic of the reconciliation model the developed software acquires the input data performs the reconciliation process and produces a report with the results to simplify the use of this tool for the company s technical staff an interface has been developed that allows to set the input values and to read the results from the ms excel environment 4 results and discussion the final objective of the study is to develop an adequate general strategy to maximize the amount of internal recycling in order to reduce the consumption of freshwater and the generation of wastewater in water demanding industrial activities also taking into account fluctuating water in the data reconciliation and optimization procedure in this regard the main and most important result of this contribution is the original methodology developed illustrated and discussed in the previous sections in support of this however below are some results obtained from the application of this method to the case study outlined above 4 1 reconciliation software prototype a prototype of the software developed to manage the reconciliation procedure was presented to the company for technical evaluation and approval fig 3 shows a sketch of the graphical user interface gui focused for clarity of exposure on the initial phases involving physical separation of the corn components wet milling co products separation and dry milling that altogether represent 57 of total demand for freshwater from the bio refinery this sub theme consists of 8 nodes and 43 streams 4 2 water content fluctuations in reconciliation as described in the previous paragraphs this reconciliation exercise focuses on the overall water balance including the amount of water contained in process streams therefore to this end it is necessary to consider in the same context both the streams of freshwater and mixed ones the peculiarity of this reconciliation problem is due to the impossibility of directly measuring the water content of the process streams raw materials intermediate and finished products that must be considered together with the flow rate of the process stream to estimate the flow of actual water entering the reconciliation process the existence of commercial specifications that restrict the maximum water content of the finished products does not mean that this quantity can be considered fixed but only that there is a higher level of attention on the production side to avoid out of specs production data on water content although with different sampling rates for different streams should always be available for normal quality control activities and the resulting statistical information can be applied to improve the efficiency of the reconciliation process following this advice and the methodology outlined in section 3 1 the reconciliation procedure successfully assessed for example the water recycling streams already in place from the dry milling to wet milling by product phases and from the by product to wet milling phase dashed red streams in fig 2 the flowrates of these recycled streams which are not directly measured are estimated to represent approximately 40 of the wet milling demand despite the availability of characterization data for finished products this information is considered sensitive due to its commercial implications and the company has decided not to disclose it in the context of this study however with reference to the sub theme of fig 3 the average flow stream adjustment was around 0 5 percent with some streams being changed by up to 4 4 percent this result is quite relevant considering that the reconciliation has been applied here only to some initial core phases of the process taking into account only the main flows which therefore are small in number and have high reliability of the measured value compared to the streams of the overall process moreover this also considers the water content in the products that as stated before in some applications can represent a significant element of the overall water balance in particular in the case considered to validate the model this value amounts to 3 of total water fed to the plant including all auxiliary systems such as washing and cooling of equipment and specifically to 16 5 of the treated water soft and demineralized fed to the production units the correct management of this contribution becomes even more important in the context of optimization considering the economic implications given that those are the most valuable water flows obtained downstream of specific treatments reverse osmosis softener units and demineralization columns in addition a separate management of fluctuations in the water content of the products in respect to the quantity from specifics as the one based on product quality control only can lead to bad complications in processes where the presence of water fluctuations in the products is not negligible as the current amount of water that goes into the products causes some other flow to be smaller or larger the control system could therefore provide to vary by means of feedback the input flow rates which would also fluctuate all of this would obviously have negative effects on water management and resource optimization as the level of knowledge and control of the process would result partly compromised this is why these fluctuations should be included in the optimization model which can therefore also consider in real time the variations they cause in the rest of the process with benefits that go beyond the concept of optimization being useful to ensure a better functioning of the overall process for example avoiding incorrect interventions by the control systems 4 3 water cascade analysis to quantify the maximum water recovery target obtainable in the case study a water cascade analysis wca was also carried out as a preliminary before the optimization phase the wca methodology 28 provides for the classification of cumulative flows of water consumption sinks and production streams sources with increasing levels of contaminants this particular arrangement and processing of data makes it possible to calculate the make up by ensuring the necessary supply of freshwater for each level of contaminant considered in the analysis the contaminant considered is cod chemical oxygen demand which is the amount of oxygen required for the total chemical oxidation of the compounds contained in the water sample although not the only one cod is one of the most relevant parameters considered within the industrial complex and for a preliminary analysis it is the one that best fits the purpose of this study unlike the reconciliation exercise described above which involved the concurrent evaluation of water and mixed streams raw materials or products containing water this analysis was carried out only on water streams in particular the wca elaborates on the case of the initial transformation phases wet milling and dry milling for corn steeping by products separation and final starch products respectively which absorb a total of 57 of the demand for freshwater as described in the previous sections the corn refining process requires three different types of water raw soft and demineralized however the only type of water supplied to the industrial complex is raw water that is fed to both the process and purification units it is therefore reasonable to simplify the analysis by correlating the other streams of purified water soft and demineralized water directly to the consumption of raw water to this end the following criteria have been applied taken from the results of the reconciliation phase the production of 1 ton of soft water involves the consumption of 1 176 tons of raw water and the generation of 0 176 tons of wastewater the production of 1 ton of reverse osmosis permeate involves the consumption of 1 461 tons of raw water and the generation of 0 461 tons of wastewater the production of 1 ton of demineralized water involves the consumption of 0 902 tons of reverse osmosis permeate and 0 488 tons of raw water and the generation of 0 350 tons of wastewater therefore considering the previous parameters an overall consumption of 1 350 tons of raw water after this preliminary processing the flow rates of the liquid water streams resulting from the reconciliation exercise were grouped by different levels of cod and accumulated so as to determine the total water consumption and production at each level the wca was considered for two different cases the basic case which assumes that it is not possible to increase the level of contaminant of the water streams sent to the process beyond current levels and does not provide treatments that reduce the cod to an acceptable level per unit of process the retrofit case which studies the impact of the addition of treatment units typically reverse osmosis reducing the contaminant content of some treatable waste streams the results of the wca have shown that the main part of the water demand is at raw water purity level and the sinks at mid purity levels are saturated confirming that in the basic case it is not possible to obtain water savings while maintaining the current constraints of cod for the water streams entering the process therefore the only way to save water is to treat wastewater streams to generate streams with low cod values the resulting demand for freshwater is equal to 187 4 tons h while the flow of wastewater is 105 8 tons h corresponding to 56 4 of the supply from the retrofit case it appears that the insertion of the purification facility would entail a reduction in the supply of freshwater of about 8 5 corresponding to 15 9 tons h a 12 7 reduction in wastewater production corresponding to 13 4 tons h 4 4 considerations on the optimization phase the confidentiality agreements in place with the company that provided the basic information used for this study do not allow reporting detailed results particularly on the outcomes of the optimization procedure however the overall results with an approximate 40 increase in the flowrate of the recycled stream that gives rise to an approximate 10 reduction in global water consumption in the industrial complex confirm the validity of the approach outlined which represents the main result of this work about this some considerations can be drawn 1 the objective function to be minimized is economic and should take into account the following cost elements o water supply o water treatment operation chemicals and energy o investment in water treatment facilities both for the water incoming and exiting the industrial complex 2 including fluctuating water in problems such as the one presented leads to problems generally sminlp that are difficult to solve with standard optimization algorithms which risk identifying sub optimal results the existence of multiple minima characterizes the objective function in correspondence of different regions of the solutions domain 3 to guarantee the success of the procedure the global target of the optimization problem must go from identification of the absolute global optima to identification of good enough solutions which is more acceptable also from an industrial perspective some tips suggestions for implementing the general strategy for achieving this goal consisted of o transforming integer variables into constrained real variables which helps to improve the solver performances o reducing the solution domain by dividing the problem into simpler sub problems to be optimized in parallel o identify an alternative algorithm to solve the problem by adapting it to its specific needs o resolve the problem in successive phases so as to introduce part of the constraints in a second phase after having identified the domain of feasible solutions having in mind what has been said so far the overall procedure can be visually summarized as reported in fig 4 5 conclusions due to pressure from national and supranational regulatory agencies to impose ever stricter standards in wastewater discharges and leading to rising global water prices the process industry faces a dramatic challenge to reduce water consumption while maintaining product quality standards and ensuring profitability and competitiveness therefore for the very survival of a number of processes the implementation of optimization procedures aimed at reducing their water footprint is becoming a crucial and unavoidable strategy although minimizing water plant consumption and optimizing wastewater treatment solutions are widespread in the process industry a comprehensive and integrated approach that includes the water content of products is often overlooked due to the difficulty of combining plant specifications with product quality tests and largely different time windows for the collection of the relevant data this can seriously affect the meaning of the overall optimization strategy whenever the water content of products is not negligible as in the case of the food industry this was the main result in the preliminary analysis of the industrial plant that was examined in our case study failure to integrate fluctuations in water content in products could lead to biased estimates of water flowrates across the plant due to incorrect mass balances and thus to suboptimal plant control system performance and severe shortcomings of wastewater treatment operations in both the design and operational phases with the additional risk of costly oversizing of treatment units or conversely of not respecting regulatory limits for contaminants in process wastewater the main contribution of this paper is precisely the development of a global approach capable of integrating all water inputs and outputs in a comprehensive model in order to provide a useful tool for designers and operation managers as a result of the initiatory character of this analysis a key value in itself further key values have been obtained first of all the need for a continuous flow of information between the departments of product quality tests and management centres was clearly identified as a fundamental prerequisite for a correct analysis second a computational strategy illustrated in two flowcharts was developed to address the resulting optimization task in fact the application of the usual standard algorithms both for the preliminary dynamic reconciliation analysis and for the subsequent optimization phase could hardly be considered due to the complexity of the resulting model to this end the problem of dynamic reconciliation related to the fluctuations of both the water content in the products and the retention volumes in the process units has been tackled using an algorithm so far limited to the fluctuations of hold ups similarly a specially trimmed algorithm was developed in order to reduce the resulting stochastic mixed integer nonlinear programming to a simplified version based on ordinal optimization in other words good enough conditions defined in terms of overall financial improvement compared to current conditions are sought rather than theoretical optimal conditions obtainable only through np hard algorithms the suitability of the method proposed is expected to depend on the structure of the process under consideration indeed while the key element of combining plant measurements and quality tests appears to be the core of the approach proposed in this paper small case by case changes could be introduced to improve optimization e g using a full non linear stochastic mixed integer algorithm in case small plants are analyzed thus removing one of the limitations of the present approach or on the contrary to reduce the computational burden by further simplifying the algorithm in case very large processes are considered in recent years the sustainability of energy consumption has been strengthened by an effort to integrate ever increasing domains and stakeholders by developing increasingly sophisticated algorithm to analyze so called total site scenarios likewise although the case study analyzed in this paper examined only one multi product plant future work will consider the possibility of extending the developed approach to total site water integration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13683,in this paper a general strategy is presented for optimizing water resources in industrial activities taking into account fluctuations of water flow streams and water contents in feed and products as well as in the utility system indeed considering fluctuations can be of primary importance for several water intensive industries such as the food or the paper pulp industry furthermore whenever the water balance includes the water content of products as is typically the case for the food industry fluctuations in the composition of products can considerably affect the overall balance due to water being a major component of many foods therefore the currently used optimization strategies that disregard water fluctuations can lead to a severe bias in the water balance and thus overlook the potential of water recovery and reuse including this aspect in widely used algorithms for process monitoring data reconciliation and optimization might lead to a possibly prohibitive increase in the computational burden in particular it is shown in this paper that the resulting optimization algorithm should solve a dynamic non convex stochastic mixed integer nonlinear programming problem to tackle this typically np hard problem a strategy has been developed that combines ordinal optimization for dealing with statistical information and nonlinear non convex deterministic algorithms the outlined strategy has been applied to a complex process in the food industry production of starch and starch based products the results seem to confirm the general validity of the

keywords food processing water reuse wastewater reduction mathematical optimization data reconciliation circular economy 1 introduction water is the main component of almost all living species and a key element in human life indeed practically all human activities depend directly or indirectly on water on a global average the main water demanding sectors are agriculture industries and urbanization absorbing around 70 20 and 10 of the amount withdrawn from water resources respectively 1 in particular the demand for water from industries worldwide is expected to increase by 400 in 2050 2 in view of the rapid growth in global industrialization while several industrial sectors can be considered water intensive including electrochemical processes 3 the garment and textile the pulp paper and the automotive industry 4 the industrial food sector defined as the set of industrial activities that process agricultural and farming raw materials is one of the most demanding industrial activities in terms of water since water contributes on average about 80 of the total weight of food materials it determines the majority of its properties structure appearance taste and stability and the ways in which a product can be processed in addition to being an ingredient in a large number of products water generally enters the food industry similarly to most other industrial activities in two main ways i process applications e g as a reactant and ii non process applications e g resources and washing cooling and heating 5 the pressure for reducing the amount of water consumed is further increased by the ever stricter regulations on wastewater discharges which force continuously rising standards of best available technologies bats and or a simultaneous increase of effluent taxes some examples of this twofold strategy can be found in jetoo 6 and möller gulland et al 7 indeed highly polluted wastewater is produced in significant quantities by the processing industry which can cause intense damages to the environment especially if accidentally discharged 8 the food industry is no exception as relevant amounts of organic compounds nitrogen phosphorous and heavy metals are released with wastewater in particular depending on the different food processed noukeu et al 9 report for the mentioned substances the following concentration ranges mg l cod 457 357 725 nh4 1 23 2925 po4 3 3 567 3240 pb 0 083 1 025 cd 0 052 0 158 the improper release of wastewaters with similar amounts of contaminants can severely pollute the water resources of the soil surface and underground requiring specific reclamation strategies to contain remove the contamination 10 12 additionally as for the meat industry 13 wastewater may also contain chromium and tannins that are directly involved in the deaths of aquatic animals 14 15 the water footprint and water neutrality concepts were introduced to estimate the pressure of a specific product or an industrial activity on water resources however while the former does not provide any information on how to reduce water consumption or its impact on the environment the latter still has some drawbacks which hinder its establishment as a strong and meaningful concept 16 indeed the definition of water neutrality as the requirement that for every new development the total water use in the region after development must be equal to or less than total water use in the region before development is generally considered to be potentially ambiguous as key issues such as development and region are not clearly specified 17 in principle the techniques developed for general applications with a view to optimizing water consumption can be applied to the food industry provided the amount of water in final products is duly taken into account water pinch analysis wpa and mathematical optimization are two alternative or complementary strategies that are frequently used to minimize water consumption and wastewater generation indeed while the latter approach is more rigorous and general because it does not require the approximations contained in the pinch analysis e g constant activity and transfer coefficients it can occasionally lead to convergence problems thus the two methods can be employed alternatively after considering the complexity of the model and the consequences of the simplifications contained in the pinch analysis or complementarily using the results provided by the pinch analysis as starting values for the subsequent optimization problem the steadily increasing price of water over 40 from 2010 to 2015 in the largest usa cities 18 has forced both process designers and plant operators to consider treatment efficiency as well as potential reuse and recycling options as key issues in the general optimization procedure unlike the energy case savings in freshwater and wastewater in countries where availability of water still does not constitute a particular problem are unlikely on their own to justify the cost of carrying out a detailed water pinch study and implementing the recommended projects this results in a slower integration of these concepts into the standard industrial design procedures particularly in the case of retrofit projects focused on existing facilities furthermore water networks subjected to existing and not recently built industrial complexes typically only have the minimum instrumentation required by the operation and measurements of most of the water flows are not available this lack of information hampers the implementation of retrofit projects starting from the data extraction phase when it is essential to assess with good reliability the freshwater grades and flow rates supplied to the process units and to treatment facilities in the current state 19 undeniably this trend is not uniform in all cases there are some industrial sectors for example wood pulp and paper that involve a relevant consumption of freshwater and regional areas for example the middle east where water scarcity hampers industrial development or where the actual cost of freshwater is in absolute terms higher or comparable to the cost of energy that have seen the flourishing of various project and applications aimed at optimizing this resource however in the food industry additional difficulties arise from the multiple use of water in particular because of the frequent incorporation of water streams into products which adds further limits to the quality of the water circulating in the plant and their use regeneration before being discharged this also leads to the impossibility to directly measure the water content of process streams raw materials intermediate and finished products which is then considered jointly to the flowrate of the process streams nevertheless fluctuations in the mixed streams due a variable water content should be properly addressed in the overall data reconciliation process because they can have an incidence even higher than measurement errors in process streams especially in the presence of evaporation losses which cannot be measured and involve a compensation effect that might hide the unbalances due to water content oscillations in this contribution the focus is in particular on the development of a suitable model for the optimal management of water resources which allows considering water content fluctuations in both feed streams and products and is to be considered the main result of the work indeed water balances can be considerably affected by the presence of comparatively large fluctuations of streams and product compositions neglecting them can lead to a suboptimal operational performance of the control system and consequently to an increased water consumption as verified in the industrial case considered the reconciliation of dynamic data has been analyzed using different approaches such as those based on kalman filtering 20 or modified versions of it bai et al 2006 52 on nonlinear programming algorithms for the minimization of deviations on least squares over a pre determined time window 21 and on integral methods as suggested by bagajewicz and jiang 22 their use implies the knowledge of the analytical model of the process typically given by a dae system the selection of a limited time window and the impossibility of monitoring the presence of sources and sinks such as unit hold up fluctuations and leaks unfortunately in the case analyzed the use of the overall process model could hardly be taken into consideration due to the prohibitive computational effort necessary to simulate the high dimensional non convex severely nonlinear problem resulting from the model of complex and frequently approximately known set of reactions that take place in the process similarly the time window that could be considered is given by the frequency of quality control tests that determine the water content of products which turns out to be much higher than the one required by methods that compute time derivatives using discretization techniques however the water content fluctuations in the product which correspond to sinks and leaks in the approaches described are indeed available on a statistical basis these three basic differences require the use of a different approach that will be illustrated in the following section the next section provides information on the difficulties underlying this type of optimization problem while section 3 illustrates the overall mathematical model highlighting the differences with respect to processes where no additional uncertainty is present due to fluctuating amounts of water in the products subsequently the application of the model developed to a real case study is outlined general information on the considered plant is provided a real bio refinery for raw maize processing along with some results obtained using the procedure described in this document the amount of information is limited for reasons of confidentiality since corn refineries are among the major water demanding food industries requiring approximately 4300 million m3 of freshwater and producing about 3800 million m3 of wastewater worldwide 5 the application of suitable solutions for the management of water consumption and wastewater generation in these industrial units can be of great importance the development of practical methodologies to optimize the use of water resources even in complex but relevant activities as in the case of the food industry will become increasingly critical in the coming decades and is also in line with strategies such as the circular economy the recourse to bats and the near zero discharge of hazardous wastes 23 a transition to a circular economy could create significant synergies for the widespread adoption of water reuse as an alternative water supply overcoming many of the barriers that water reuse is still facing ranging from public perception to price and regulatory challenges 2 theory 2 1 fundamentals in water consumption minimization management water recovery and reuse are the bases of most industrial water and wastewater management strategies this entails the use of a consumer of water effluent as a supply source for another consumer of water sink without treatment direct reuse or after partial treatments regeneration reuse 24 if originally these water network optimization methods were basically special cases of a mass exchanger network problem men 25 generalization of the original pinch analysis for heat integration 26 a specific water pinch analysis was soon developed using proper graphical procedures for targeting and design 27 the procedure consists of two phases the minimum targeting of freshwater and the design retrofit of the network for each of which several different techniques have been proposed 5 wpa problems 28 are generally addressed using mainly two approaches fixed load mostly studied in the nineties and fixed flow rate more recent applications 19 the first approach focuses primarily on removing the impurity load from the rich stream while the process water ﬂow requirement is a secondary concern and depends on the contaminants removal targets the second approach addresses the issue from the point of view of the water sink and the source rather than focusing on removing the impurity load the ﬂow rate is the main constraint of the system as for the energy pinch various tools have been proposed to define water recovery targets 29 advanced applications also make use of enhanced software tools to highlight and optimize the water network by maximizing water reuse providing for partial regeneration and effluent treatment opportunities 19 in replacement of pinch analysis or as integration mathematical programming methods can be used 30 these approaches are relying on the creation of a water network superstructure which includes all viable structural options and allow considering all the complexities e g cost objective function multiple contaminants operational limitations etc useful to extend their applicability to industrial cases including total site analysis 31 a thorough analysis on water resources optimization can be found in foo 29 jeżowski 32 and klemeš 33 in general an optimization problem can be formulated as linear programming lp non linear programming nlp or mixed integer non linear programming minlp however the optimal design should be identified using an optimization algorithm that can handle proper nonlinear objective functions which are generally non convex and constraints accommodating both continuous and discrete variables 34 the resulting algorithm is a minlp optimization solver and can lead to the overall optimal solution of the network among solvers of this type baron branch and reduce optimization navigator is the most used 35 2 2 food industry and fluctuating water the food industry requires a significant and continuous supply of freshwater as a separating agent e g extraction absorption stripping etc as a washing medium for the removal of contaminants for auxiliary scopes steam heating water cooling power generation as a raw material to be integrated into the finished products the contribution of the last item of this list is frequently limited however in some processes as in the case considered to validate the model it can represent a significant element of the overall water balance see section 4 2 in addition fluctuations in the water content of the products give rise to corresponding variations in both feed water and wastewater due to the water balance and the presence of feedback control the concomitance of all these operations within the same industrial plant involves the management of separate networks with different grades of water as well as the availability of water treatments that allow the production of suitable amounts of water streams with the required levels of purity in this complex scenario the global water material balance of a system must account for both pure water streams which can be of different types and handled through separated networks because of different levels of contaminants and mixed streams such as raw materials and products containing water the mixed streams water content is not typically constant as it is subject to variations related to the operating conditions of the process and the quality of the feedstock however it is not measured concurrently with the other data used to carry out the reconciliation process rather it is to be estimated using the statistical information provided by the quality control analysis consequently the usual techniques for data reconciliation and for minimizing the overall water consumption cannot take account of these fluctuations this is due to the monitoring system being designed for steady state operations in other words the model used for adjusting the data collected does not account for deviations from the design specifications accordingly the model presented in this paper has been extended to include the statistical information of the quality control analysis further difficulties arise when water is only a system utility due to a double constraint on the quantity of contaminants transported to water streams the quality of the products and the concentration of wastewater that may need regenerating before being discharged moreover the rectification of the process data as well as the following optimization has to deal with the possible serious non linearities arising from considering chemical reactions in the balance equations as shown in the following section all these difficulties can only be overcome through appropriate modifications of the algorithms for both monitoring and optimizing the process 3 materials and methods the mathematical model developed consists of two successive phases first the reconciliation procedure needed to consider the actual process variables in the optimization phase is suitably generalized to accommodate fluctuating water sinks section 3 1 subsequently appropriate modifications in the usual process optimization algorithms are examined to include fluctuating water sinks in the products in the actual optimization section 3 2 3 1 the reconciliation of process data data reconciliation is a statistical procedure that in return for adequate information e g on the structure of the random errors of the measured flow rates provides indications to adjust the measured values and estimate the unmeasured streams in order to balance both measured and unmeasured values identify gross errors and detect leaks and losses 36 for steady state processes suitable statistical objective functions typically relying on a likelihood criterion subject to constraints provided by material balances e g steady state conditions are used for the data rectification in some cases e g energy rectification some suitable strategies can be used to reduce the sensitivity of the process variables from the parameters involved 37 however for water resources problems in which only one component is considered the maximization can be carried out analytically on the set of linear equations provided by the mass balances allowing the detection and removal of gross errors defining with x the measurements of the flowrates of all the water streams of the process x and with x ˆ the corresponding rectified values they satisfy the set of steady state material balances 1 where a is the incidence matrix 1 a x ˆ 0 the number of rows m and columns n of a are given by the number of units subject to material balance and the total number of process streams included respectively the generic element a i j is defined as 1 or 1 depending on the stream j entering or leaving the unit i respectively while is 0 otherwise however as said the fluctuating water in products i e some of the x ˆ in 1 is not measured online alongside with the other flow measurements determining the net input value x rather samples are periodically collected to determine the water content though a quality control procedure therefore though their average statistical properties in the time interval corresponding to the sampling rate are available as well as information on their variance covariance the relevant data has to be suitably adjusted indeed these water content fluctuations detected in the quality control procedure can be elaborated to determine the relevant statistical information needed which in turn can be exploited to build an a priori likelihood function p 0 x ˆ p p 0 y of the type 2 2 p 0 y e y t v p 1 y with v being the variance covariance matrix of the process and the subscript p the index for the vectors of the product flow rate using the bayes theorem the a priori likelihood function 2 can be related to the distribution resulting from dynamic fluctuations 38 and the information provided by the measurements of x in this context the assumption of normal distribution for the experimental errors of the water content measurements provides the following a posteriori likelihood function 3 whose solution is given in an equivalent way by the minimum of 4 subject to 5 3 e x ˆ x t v 1 x ˆ x e y t v p 1 y 4 x ˆ x t v 1 x ˆ x y t v p 1 y 5 a x ˆ y the problem 4 5 can be solved in closed form for x ˆ 6 x ˆ a t v p 1 a v 1 1 v 1 x the matrix projection approach 39 can be used for the reconciliation of the identifiable values among the measurements that are eventually missing while the evaluation of the matrix v p is performed directly through the quality control system the incidence matrix v can be determined establishing an ad hoc tuning procedure 40 making use of the usual chi tests to deduce the missing statistical information by the deviations from steady state conditions due to the variation of hold ups in particular the following optimization criterion can be derived if the train of measurements including q data sets has a constrain on the sum of squared deviations to satisfy the chi square 7 φ q φ q 2 m i n φ q x q t a t v p 1 a v 1 1 v 1 i t v 1 a t v p 1 a v 1 1 v 1 i x q ν where q is the number of considered experimental samples ν is the dimension of x and i is the identity matrix a gauss newton algorithm can be exploited to perform the minimization with respect to the elements of v indeed though the distribution obtained by minimizing φ is as close as possible to the χ 2 distribution this may not be sufficient to satisfy the chi test the kolmogorov smirnov test can be exploited to check whether the experimental evidence available is adequate or the number of data sets should be increased 40 with the steps shown so far the general data reconciliation procedure for processes with an a priori products water content distribution has been fully outlined 3 2 the optimization of water resources as already stated the optimal design of food processes cannot fail to consider stochastic variables if fluctuations in the physico chemical properties and composition of the raw materials fed into the plants are to be taken into account likewise binary variables are required for the description of structural design alternatives as well as continuous parameters for the other unknown parameters of the process considering this the uncertainty of the supply conditions leads to a stochastic mixed integer nonlinear programming sminlp problem i e the optimal design problem can be formulated as follows 8 opt x y e s f x y s s t h x y s 0 g x y s 0 x r m y r n in 8 s r k is the vector of variables subject to a known probability distribution function while x and y are the operation and decision variables respectively the dependence of f scalar function h vector of the process equations and g vector of inequalities to exclude solutions unsuitable or physically impossible on x y and s stochastic parameters is non convex and highly nonlinear the objective function f is generally based on the minimization of the annualized costs of freshwater consumption and wastewater regeneration freshwater consumption due to the fluctuating water in products depends only on the properties of supply input however other contributions like evaporation and wastewater discharge downstream of the proper remediation treatments are linked to the process structure and the strategies of water reuse and recycling adopted and are consequently the result of the overall optimization task provided by eq 8 every instance of the vector s requires the resolution of an minlp problem 41 however due to the non convexity of the problem there may be more than one minimum with possibly very different values of the objective function making it necessary the adoption of an algorithm able to locate a global minimum in this regard the baron code 35 is probably the most frequently used solution it relies on a global optimization strategy exploiting a branch bound approach that is supposed to locate global optima under general assumptions thanks to a number of additional techniques to further reduce ranges of variables the code runs under the commercial gams environment 42 in the case study described below both baron and couenne were used for comparison the second code acronym of convex over and under envelopes for nonlinear estimation is a spatial branch bound algorithm based on minlp reformulation that uses branching bound reduction linearization and heuristics to find feasible solutions 43 comparing the two approaches no substantial differences were found in terms of efficiency and robustness which is a significant result considering that couenne is open source although the input file has to be specified in a mathematical programming language ampl syntax 44 on the other hand if the vector s is allowed to assume values corresponding to its probability distribution full stochastic mixed integer nonlinear programming sminlp has to be used if this is the case according to acevedo and pistikopoulos 45 numerical integration methods 46 are best used for small dimension problems whereas sample average methods generally based on monte carlo simulation techniques are more efficient for larger problems including process planning reactor design and risk analysis 47 to avoid further weighing the discussion please refer to ferrucci et al 48 for additional details in summary as the incorporation of minlp algorithms into a stochastic framework often implies an intractably high number of solutions to individual minlp problems the overall computational effort to solve them can be considerably reduced if ordinal optimization is used the ordinal optimization methodology 49 can be regarded as a general strategy that similarly to branch bound techniques reduces the domain of optimal solutions to a possibly small subset in which the actual solution is finally to be searched by preliminary specifying a suitable shortcut procedure on a case by case basis in this contribution a substantial relaxation of the integrality condition is considered as simplifying procedure in fact by reducing the tolerance the computational time of a sminlp can be decreased to the level of a simple minlp at this point simply by selecting the binary options discrete variables to the integer values closest to the values obtained by reducing the tolerance the problem can be turned into an snlp problem with a drastic reduction in computational load 3 3 case study definition the case study considered to test the original algorithms and strategies mentioned above is a bio refinery where raw corn is processed to obtain starches starch based products sugars and fermentations products marketed in various sectors such as food animal nutrition and the chemical and pharmaceutical industries a food industry company has expressed interest in a holistic study aimed at rationalizing the use of freshwater resources so as to minimize global demand and provided the necessary data despite the high level of attention dedicated by the corporate to the environmental impact of industrial activity nobody had ever done a complete study on the use of water resources the industrial complex began its activity more than sixty years ago and since its foundation the farm has grown up both in capacity and complexity and the consumption of freshwater has followed the same trend the current facility is a large scale plant involving eleven water units corresponding to six processing phases seven treatment units four for the preparation of incoming water and three for the treatment of wastewater and a main contaminant first phases are mainly physical processes like wet milling and dry milling while the subsequent steps are physico chemical chemical or biochemical processes acid and enzymatic starch liquefaction hydrolysis and fermentation the plant has a corn wet milling process separating the raw material into its constituent components starch 70 germ 4 fibre 2 and protein mainly gluten 10 50 the remaining part 14 is water the main corn refining processing steps namely wet milling co products separation and dry milling starch purification and drying are the most intense processes in terms of water and energy these three phases absorb 57 of the demand for freshwater and a similar percentage of energy heat and power generating respectively 48 and 37 of the overall wastewater and water evaporation loss a total of 4 2 tons of freshwater and 1 3 mw h of energy heat and power are needed to process one ton of raw corn resulting in the generation of 2 8 tons of wastewater and the evaporation of 1 5 tons in addition to the significant consumption of freshwater this industry is also characterised by high purity requirements and the need to manage different grades of freshwater in the same context fig 1 summarizes the available processes to treat the freshwater supplied to the complex and purify the wastewater before discharge superficial and deep aquifers from a nearby stream are mainly used to supply water to the plant with the public water network exploited only to a lesser extent based on its origin and use the incoming freshwater is subjected to different treatments deep aquifer water is directly used as raw water r for the production process superficial aquifer water is purified through filtration and subsequently fed into the raw water circuit nearby stream water is used for auxiliary purposes e g cooling service raw water is treated in reverse osmosis and softener units and demineralization columns anionic cationic decarburization to produce demineralized d and soft s water demineralized water is used to produce process steam p regardless of the type and grade just listed freshwater streams have a water content greater than 99 9 anyhow on the contrary mixed flows are defined in the specific case considered as follows feedstock raw corn average water content ranges between 13 and 15 depending on the origin and storage conditions intermediate products water content ranging between 10 and 85 depending on product and operating conditions finished products water content ranging between 0 and 54 depending on product and operating conditions chemicals water content ranging between 0 and 81 furthermore in the case of finished products it is also necessary to take into account the commercial specifications that bind the maximum water content of the various products therefore most laboratory tests related to the water content are carried out on finished products while less information is typically available to determine the water content of intermediate products a simplified diagram of the global process is shown in fig 2 the scheme details the grade of water consumed by each unit in addition the scheme highlights production consumption of recycled water y evaporation losses l and wastewater w generated by the product s washing treatments upon exiting the plant the wastewater undergoes anaerobic and aerobic treatments aimed at reducing its concentration of contaminants before being discharged fig 1 to simplify the representation the path of a single water recycling y entering or exiting the various blocks is shown in fig 2 dashed line in red but in practice there are multiple flows with different origins and purity levels typical examples are washing and purification water or exhaust steam consequently the specific level of contaminants of each water stream coming out of a process must be carefully considered in the context of the water optimization study both the main process and the freshwater treatments generate wastewater the amount produced to condition the incoming freshwater accounts for about 20 of the total wastewater production from the research point of view the case is stimulating because it requires tackling various issues that are sometimes not considered from a theoretical perspective but which occur in reality these problems which usually occur because the original complex designer did not provide the required monitoring equipment for the auxiliary systems could jeopardize the positive result of the optimization project 3 4 definition of the integrated water balance to perform a more in depth process analysis in the next phase highlighting potential areas of optimization a data reconciliation activity was performed that includes both freshwater treatments and primary process streams in the same environment the two systems are complex and intimately integrated and it is not advisable to model them separately due to the concomitant existence of material transfers from the water network to products and of significant evaporation losses this analysis led to the definition of an incidence matrix consisting of 20 nodes and 108 streams representing the total material balance of water from the aquifers to the treatment of wastewater including the process phases as mentioned the fluctuating water in mixed streams is included in the reconciliation procedure leading to the need to formulate hypotheses on the water content of each stream based on various factors related to changes in the quality of feedstock environmental and plant operating conditions the impact of these fluctuations in the overall process of data reconciliation can be even higher than that of measurement errors and must be addressed correctly also because of the compensation effects related to the presence of evaporation losses which could hide the imbalances due to oscillations of the water content 3 5 basic reconciliation software to manage the problem of data reconciliation the methodology outlined by crowe et al 39 was implemented firstly this method applies linear algebra techniques 51 to perform mathematical operations on the data matrices characteristic of the reconciliation model the developed software acquires the input data performs the reconciliation process and produces a report with the results to simplify the use of this tool for the company s technical staff an interface has been developed that allows to set the input values and to read the results from the ms excel environment 4 results and discussion the final objective of the study is to develop an adequate general strategy to maximize the amount of internal recycling in order to reduce the consumption of freshwater and the generation of wastewater in water demanding industrial activities also taking into account fluctuating water in the data reconciliation and optimization procedure in this regard the main and most important result of this contribution is the original methodology developed illustrated and discussed in the previous sections in support of this however below are some results obtained from the application of this method to the case study outlined above 4 1 reconciliation software prototype a prototype of the software developed to manage the reconciliation procedure was presented to the company for technical evaluation and approval fig 3 shows a sketch of the graphical user interface gui focused for clarity of exposure on the initial phases involving physical separation of the corn components wet milling co products separation and dry milling that altogether represent 57 of total demand for freshwater from the bio refinery this sub theme consists of 8 nodes and 43 streams 4 2 water content fluctuations in reconciliation as described in the previous paragraphs this reconciliation exercise focuses on the overall water balance including the amount of water contained in process streams therefore to this end it is necessary to consider in the same context both the streams of freshwater and mixed ones the peculiarity of this reconciliation problem is due to the impossibility of directly measuring the water content of the process streams raw materials intermediate and finished products that must be considered together with the flow rate of the process stream to estimate the flow of actual water entering the reconciliation process the existence of commercial specifications that restrict the maximum water content of the finished products does not mean that this quantity can be considered fixed but only that there is a higher level of attention on the production side to avoid out of specs production data on water content although with different sampling rates for different streams should always be available for normal quality control activities and the resulting statistical information can be applied to improve the efficiency of the reconciliation process following this advice and the methodology outlined in section 3 1 the reconciliation procedure successfully assessed for example the water recycling streams already in place from the dry milling to wet milling by product phases and from the by product to wet milling phase dashed red streams in fig 2 the flowrates of these recycled streams which are not directly measured are estimated to represent approximately 40 of the wet milling demand despite the availability of characterization data for finished products this information is considered sensitive due to its commercial implications and the company has decided not to disclose it in the context of this study however with reference to the sub theme of fig 3 the average flow stream adjustment was around 0 5 percent with some streams being changed by up to 4 4 percent this result is quite relevant considering that the reconciliation has been applied here only to some initial core phases of the process taking into account only the main flows which therefore are small in number and have high reliability of the measured value compared to the streams of the overall process moreover this also considers the water content in the products that as stated before in some applications can represent a significant element of the overall water balance in particular in the case considered to validate the model this value amounts to 3 of total water fed to the plant including all auxiliary systems such as washing and cooling of equipment and specifically to 16 5 of the treated water soft and demineralized fed to the production units the correct management of this contribution becomes even more important in the context of optimization considering the economic implications given that those are the most valuable water flows obtained downstream of specific treatments reverse osmosis softener units and demineralization columns in addition a separate management of fluctuations in the water content of the products in respect to the quantity from specifics as the one based on product quality control only can lead to bad complications in processes where the presence of water fluctuations in the products is not negligible as the current amount of water that goes into the products causes some other flow to be smaller or larger the control system could therefore provide to vary by means of feedback the input flow rates which would also fluctuate all of this would obviously have negative effects on water management and resource optimization as the level of knowledge and control of the process would result partly compromised this is why these fluctuations should be included in the optimization model which can therefore also consider in real time the variations they cause in the rest of the process with benefits that go beyond the concept of optimization being useful to ensure a better functioning of the overall process for example avoiding incorrect interventions by the control systems 4 3 water cascade analysis to quantify the maximum water recovery target obtainable in the case study a water cascade analysis wca was also carried out as a preliminary before the optimization phase the wca methodology 28 provides for the classification of cumulative flows of water consumption sinks and production streams sources with increasing levels of contaminants this particular arrangement and processing of data makes it possible to calculate the make up by ensuring the necessary supply of freshwater for each level of contaminant considered in the analysis the contaminant considered is cod chemical oxygen demand which is the amount of oxygen required for the total chemical oxidation of the compounds contained in the water sample although not the only one cod is one of the most relevant parameters considered within the industrial complex and for a preliminary analysis it is the one that best fits the purpose of this study unlike the reconciliation exercise described above which involved the concurrent evaluation of water and mixed streams raw materials or products containing water this analysis was carried out only on water streams in particular the wca elaborates on the case of the initial transformation phases wet milling and dry milling for corn steeping by products separation and final starch products respectively which absorb a total of 57 of the demand for freshwater as described in the previous sections the corn refining process requires three different types of water raw soft and demineralized however the only type of water supplied to the industrial complex is raw water that is fed to both the process and purification units it is therefore reasonable to simplify the analysis by correlating the other streams of purified water soft and demineralized water directly to the consumption of raw water to this end the following criteria have been applied taken from the results of the reconciliation phase the production of 1 ton of soft water involves the consumption of 1 176 tons of raw water and the generation of 0 176 tons of wastewater the production of 1 ton of reverse osmosis permeate involves the consumption of 1 461 tons of raw water and the generation of 0 461 tons of wastewater the production of 1 ton of demineralized water involves the consumption of 0 902 tons of reverse osmosis permeate and 0 488 tons of raw water and the generation of 0 350 tons of wastewater therefore considering the previous parameters an overall consumption of 1 350 tons of raw water after this preliminary processing the flow rates of the liquid water streams resulting from the reconciliation exercise were grouped by different levels of cod and accumulated so as to determine the total water consumption and production at each level the wca was considered for two different cases the basic case which assumes that it is not possible to increase the level of contaminant of the water streams sent to the process beyond current levels and does not provide treatments that reduce the cod to an acceptable level per unit of process the retrofit case which studies the impact of the addition of treatment units typically reverse osmosis reducing the contaminant content of some treatable waste streams the results of the wca have shown that the main part of the water demand is at raw water purity level and the sinks at mid purity levels are saturated confirming that in the basic case it is not possible to obtain water savings while maintaining the current constraints of cod for the water streams entering the process therefore the only way to save water is to treat wastewater streams to generate streams with low cod values the resulting demand for freshwater is equal to 187 4 tons h while the flow of wastewater is 105 8 tons h corresponding to 56 4 of the supply from the retrofit case it appears that the insertion of the purification facility would entail a reduction in the supply of freshwater of about 8 5 corresponding to 15 9 tons h a 12 7 reduction in wastewater production corresponding to 13 4 tons h 4 4 considerations on the optimization phase the confidentiality agreements in place with the company that provided the basic information used for this study do not allow reporting detailed results particularly on the outcomes of the optimization procedure however the overall results with an approximate 40 increase in the flowrate of the recycled stream that gives rise to an approximate 10 reduction in global water consumption in the industrial complex confirm the validity of the approach outlined which represents the main result of this work about this some considerations can be drawn 1 the objective function to be minimized is economic and should take into account the following cost elements o water supply o water treatment operation chemicals and energy o investment in water treatment facilities both for the water incoming and exiting the industrial complex 2 including fluctuating water in problems such as the one presented leads to problems generally sminlp that are difficult to solve with standard optimization algorithms which risk identifying sub optimal results the existence of multiple minima characterizes the objective function in correspondence of different regions of the solutions domain 3 to guarantee the success of the procedure the global target of the optimization problem must go from identification of the absolute global optima to identification of good enough solutions which is more acceptable also from an industrial perspective some tips suggestions for implementing the general strategy for achieving this goal consisted of o transforming integer variables into constrained real variables which helps to improve the solver performances o reducing the solution domain by dividing the problem into simpler sub problems to be optimized in parallel o identify an alternative algorithm to solve the problem by adapting it to its specific needs o resolve the problem in successive phases so as to introduce part of the constraints in a second phase after having identified the domain of feasible solutions having in mind what has been said so far the overall procedure can be visually summarized as reported in fig 4 5 conclusions due to pressure from national and supranational regulatory agencies to impose ever stricter standards in wastewater discharges and leading to rising global water prices the process industry faces a dramatic challenge to reduce water consumption while maintaining product quality standards and ensuring profitability and competitiveness therefore for the very survival of a number of processes the implementation of optimization procedures aimed at reducing their water footprint is becoming a crucial and unavoidable strategy although minimizing water plant consumption and optimizing wastewater treatment solutions are widespread in the process industry a comprehensive and integrated approach that includes the water content of products is often overlooked due to the difficulty of combining plant specifications with product quality tests and largely different time windows for the collection of the relevant data this can seriously affect the meaning of the overall optimization strategy whenever the water content of products is not negligible as in the case of the food industry this was the main result in the preliminary analysis of the industrial plant that was examined in our case study failure to integrate fluctuations in water content in products could lead to biased estimates of water flowrates across the plant due to incorrect mass balances and thus to suboptimal plant control system performance and severe shortcomings of wastewater treatment operations in both the design and operational phases with the additional risk of costly oversizing of treatment units or conversely of not respecting regulatory limits for contaminants in process wastewater the main contribution of this paper is precisely the development of a global approach capable of integrating all water inputs and outputs in a comprehensive model in order to provide a useful tool for designers and operation managers as a result of the initiatory character of this analysis a key value in itself further key values have been obtained first of all the need for a continuous flow of information between the departments of product quality tests and management centres was clearly identified as a fundamental prerequisite for a correct analysis second a computational strategy illustrated in two flowcharts was developed to address the resulting optimization task in fact the application of the usual standard algorithms both for the preliminary dynamic reconciliation analysis and for the subsequent optimization phase could hardly be considered due to the complexity of the resulting model to this end the problem of dynamic reconciliation related to the fluctuations of both the water content in the products and the retention volumes in the process units has been tackled using an algorithm so far limited to the fluctuations of hold ups similarly a specially trimmed algorithm was developed in order to reduce the resulting stochastic mixed integer nonlinear programming to a simplified version based on ordinal optimization in other words good enough conditions defined in terms of overall financial improvement compared to current conditions are sought rather than theoretical optimal conditions obtainable only through np hard algorithms the suitability of the method proposed is expected to depend on the structure of the process under consideration indeed while the key element of combining plant measurements and quality tests appears to be the core of the approach proposed in this paper small case by case changes could be introduced to improve optimization e g using a full non linear stochastic mixed integer algorithm in case small plants are analyzed thus removing one of the limitations of the present approach or on the contrary to reduce the computational burden by further simplifying the algorithm in case very large processes are considered in recent years the sustainability of energy consumption has been strengthened by an effort to integrate ever increasing domains and stakeholders by developing increasingly sophisticated algorithm to analyze so called total site scenarios likewise although the case study analyzed in this paper examined only one multi product plant future work will consider the possibility of extending the developed approach to total site water integration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13684,a novel z scheme ag2co3 ng heterojunction photocatalyst by employing n doped graphene ng was successfully synthesized with enhanced photocatalytic activity for microcystin lr mc lr degradation characterization results suggested that doping of n can promote the nucleation and crystallization of ag2co3 photocatalytic tests showed that ag2co3 ng with 30 wt n participation agon 1 30 showed the best photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation which could remove mc lr in 7 5 min superior to ag2co3 go composite multiple factors including dosage ph value mc lr concentration h2o2 and the coexistence of microcystis aeruginosa were studied to reveal the environmental impact on mc lr degradation results showed that oh o2 as well as co3 were the main ross in mc lr degradation the excellent reusability and stability of agon 1 30 were proved through five consecutive cycles of degradation therefore the z scheme ag2co3 ng heterojunction photocatalyst is a promising technique for mc lr remediation keywords z scheme photocatalyst n doped graphene microcystis lr degradation visible light 1 introduction cyanobacterial harmful algae blooms cyanohabs which is the result of increased inputs of nutrients by human activities frequently occurs in china over the last decade 1 microcystis is one of the most common bloom forming genera when cyanohabs occurs 2 toxins produced by cyanohabs may pose a significant threat to people through food web or by long term exposure to contaminated drinking water including skin diseases liver cancer or even death 3 much effort has been made to mitigate the effects of microcystins mcs which can be divided into physical 4 chemical 5 and biological 6 methods however microcystin lr mc lr a very stable toxin is difficult to remove by these traditional methods due to its loop structure and amino acid 7 8 it was reported that a c n co modified mesoporous tio2 composite was synthesized by a simple one pot method and successfully employed to remove mc lr under visible light 9 besides it was found that photo irradiation is effective in mcs degradation with the assist of reactive oxygen species ross e g oh 10 many reports have stated that oh with strong oxidizing ability played a main role in photo breakdown of mc lr especially in attacking the adda chain as well as the cyclic structure 11 13 therefore photocatalytic technology has been introduced as a promising approach for degrading cyanotoxins out of various semiconductors silver containing compounds e g ag3po4 ag3vo4 ag2cro4 and ag2co3 are considered as novel photocatalysts with small bandgap energy and high photocatalytic activity 14 19 it has been reported that the narrow bandgap could be attributed to the hybridized ag 4d and o 2p orbitals which raise the top position of the valence band vb and the conduction band cb position is relatively lower 20 moreover silver based compounds also show inhibitory potential in cyanotoxins wang et al 15 found that mclr was degraded into smaller molecules by agbr ag3po4 tio2 photocatalyst under solar light irradiation however silver containing compounds are unstable exposed to visible light irradiation because of the photocorrosion and thus deactivate photocatalysts 21 therefore it is necessary to find an appropriate co catalyst as photogenerated electrons acceptor before ag is reduced to metallic ag graphene oxide go a two dimensional honeycomb structure can serve as an ideal co catalyst 22 unfortunately due to the scarcity of limited band gap go has many restrains in further application 23 to overcome this problem the nitrogen doping has been proven to be an effective way to widen the band gap energy and tailor the electronic property and chemical reactivity of graphene which can be formed by three typical n bonding configurations i e pyridinic n np pyrrolic n npr and graphitic n ng to greatly improve its photocatalytic performance 24 26 n doping in the fabrication can also improve photocatalytic performance by enhancing the electronic and chemical properties 27 29 however the correlation between n doped ag2co3 go and mclr degradation under visible light remains unknown here the n doped ag2co3 go agon photocatalysts were employed to degrade mclr under visible light where the agon photocatalysts followed the z scheme mechanism possessing photocatalytic performance superior to the pristine ag2co3 go ago the introduction of nitrogen element enhanced the visible light absorption of go and greatly improve its electron transfer ability the photocatalytic performance of as prepared products on mc lr was systematically studied the possible degradation pathways of mc lr subjected to agon photocatalyst under visible light were evaluated and a possible degradation mechanism was also proposed 2 methods and materials 2 1 synthesis of ng n doped graphene ng was prepared by a facile method 30 firstly go was prefabricated according to hummers et al 31 subsequently 5 g l go was obtained by the assistance of ultrasound for 2 h a certain amount of urea 0 1 25 2 5 5 7 5 10 and 12 5 g was added into the solution and sonicated for 30 min after magnetically stirring for 2 h the mixture was transferred to a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave 80 ml and held at 180 c for 12 h the final product was centrifuged then washed by ultrapure water and dried at 45 c the collected samples were termed as go gon 1 5 gon 1 10 gon 1 20 gon 1 30 gon 1 40 and gon 1 50 respectively based on the weight ratio of n to go 2 2 synthesis of ag2co3 ng typically a series of different n wt go suspensions 1 g l was obtained 0 wt 5 wt 10 wt 20 wt 30 wt 40 wt and 50 wt by the assistance of ultrasound for 2 h subsequently 8 38 ml of the ng suspension was added into the silver nitrate solution and kept stirring for 12 h to get a mixture after that 100 ml of sodium carbonate solution was added drop by drop and kept stirring for 1 h the molar ratio of silver nitrate sodium carbonate 2 1 finally the final products were obtained after aging at 25 for 4 h the samples were named as ago agon 1 5 agon 1 10 agon 1 20 agon 1 30 agon 1 40 and agon 1 50 the ratio of ng to ag2co3was 1 wt 2 3 experimental set up photocatalytic experiments were performed in a home made photochemical reactor reported in previous study 32 as shown in fig s1 the metal halogen lamp philips 500 w with a uv filter λ 420 nm was kept at a distance of 15 cm from the surface of solution circulating water was used to cool the system to eliminate the thermal effects the light intensity measured to 74020 lx by a digital luxmeter jiading jd 3 china 2 4 photocatalytic degradation of mc lr in this experiment all prepared photocatalysts were dispersed by ultrasonic to obtain 1 g l suspension a certain volume of the suspension was added to 20 ml 0 2 mg l mc lr aqueous solution at the desired catalyst concentration of 100 mg l before photocatalytic experiment the dark adsorption was investigated 1 ml of the sample was taken at pre determined intervals and filtered with a 0 22 μm ptfe syringe high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu lc 2030 japan was then employed for the analysis of mc lr concentrations at different times the catalyst which showed the best photocatalytic performance in mc lr degradation was chosen for the following experiments the impact factors were studied through single factor control experiments the optimum dosage and initial concentration were studied before further investigation firstly 100 mg l of agon 1 30 was adopted to investigate the best initial concentration 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 mg l next the dosage of catalyst 0 50 80 150 200 and 250 mg l was studied the desired ph value 3 5 7 9 was obtained by using 1 m concentration of hno3 and naoh solutions adding a certain volume of 0 5 g l h2o2 solution to obtain h2o2 with different initial concentrations 0 0 1 0 5 1 and 5 mg l other environmental factors including the presence of natter organic matter nom and the coexistence of algae were also investigated 2 5 analytical methods the concentration of mc lr and the degradation intermediates were determined and identified by high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry hplc qtof ms 33 the determination of mc lr concentration was conducted according to the previous method 34 the mobile phase consisted of 0 1 formic acid and acetonitrile acn in gradient elution 10 min 0 20 acn 10 min 20 35 acn 15 min 35 65 acn and 15 min 65 80 acn the qtof ms analysis was performed in positive ion mode and m h m na m 2 h 2 or m 2na 2 m z data where m was the target molecular weight the degradation intermediates with m z range from 200 to 1350 were obtained and analyzed using qualitative analysis b 04 00 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization in fig 1 the peaks at 8 61 20 66 32 76 33 76 37 09 39 75 41 91 and 44 45 correspond to ag2co3 jcpds no 26 0339 35 the peak intensity of ag2co3 did not enhance when the n doped amount was higher than 30 wt indicating that excess doping of n was not conducive to crystallization of ag2co3 no obvious diffraction peaks of n doped graphene were observed in all photocatalysts which could be attribute to the low content of n doped graphene 1 wt notably the peak at 38 1 was attributed to ag 36 therefore the xrd patterns approved the successful synthesis of agon samples the morphology of the photocatalysts was further investigated by sem in fig 2 a the pristine go nanosheets overlapped with each other providing a large number of attachment sites as shown in fig 2 b the highly crystalized ag2co3 nanoparticles deposited on the surface of go indicating the successful synthesis of ag2co3 go when the ratio of n to ago was 1 5 1 10 and 1 20 the morphology of go did not significantly change and the uneven distribution of ag2co3 may result in the weaken photocatalytic performance fig 2 c e as n ago increased to 1 30 the go surface became wrinkled possibly due to the sp2 hybridization of carbon atoms was destructed as n participation increased 37 and thus provided more available sites for ag2co3 deposition fig 2 f when the ratio of n to ag2co3 go further increased to 1 40 and 1 50 the go surface dramatically wrinkled due to the excess doping of n element and the agglomeration of ag2co3 was observed based on the above analysis agon 1 30 was selected for the following characterization as shown in fig 3 elemental analysis proved the homogenous presence of ag c and o throughout agon 1 30 besides the new element n was found which accounted for 7 35 this result confirmed the presence of the n species on the surface of agon 1 30 moreover n atoms would bond with or substitute for c atoms at the defects of go thus resulting in a decrease in the proportion of c and o 38 the structural changes after introducing n into ago were investigated by ftir spectroscopy with regard to the ftir spectra of go the absorption peaks at 3436 31 cm 1 2923 60 cm 1 1624 48 cm 1 1581 37 cm 1 1384 36 cm 1 1108 40 cm 1 and 1042 40 cm 1 belonged to oh c h co cc coh o c h and coc 39 40 respectively after introducing the n element the oh stretching vibration moved from 3436 31 cm 1 to 3445 71 cm 1 and the characteristic peaks of cc o c h and coc disappeared 41 the peaks at 1350 43 cm 1 and 1229 90 cm 1 were attributed to cn and cn indicating that the n atoms were successfully doped into graphene in fig 4 c the oh co and cc from go were conserved in ago pattern the observation of peaks at 1450 83 cm 1 1382 25 cm 1 882 93 cm 1 and 706 22 cm 1 confirmed the dope of ag2co3 42 in fig 4 d agon 1 30 showed a similar pattern with that of ago the peaks at 1229 92 cm 1 cn and 1351 62 cm 1 cn indicated that n atoms have doped into the structure of ago indicating the successfully synthesis of agon 1 30 xps spectrum of go was displayed in fig s2 a it showed that the synthesized go with high purity did not contain other elements except c and o the o1s spectrum of go was displayed in fig s2 b the peaks at 531 8 ev and 532 9 ev were assigned to co and co bands respectively the c1s spectrum of go was displayed in fig s2 c the peaks at 284 8 ev 286 1 ev and 288 7 ev were attributed to the different functional groups of carbon atoms including cc co and oco 43 compared with go the new n1s spectrum was observed in the xps spectrum of gon 1 30 in fig s2 d indicating that the nitrogen atom has been successfully doped into go as shown in fig s2 e the o1s spectrum of gon 1 30 showed similar patterns with that of go except for a 0 1 ev shift observed in the peak of co 531 8 ev this phenomenon was likely due to the addition of n a new peak located at 287 5 ev which was assigned to cn was found in the c1s spectrum of gon 1 30 in fig s2 f the peak of co 285 1 ev in go moved to 285 4 ev in gon 1 30 43 the reduction observed in the intensities of co 286 4 ev and oc o 288 7 ev indicating the o atoms of go have been substituted by n atoms as shown in fig s2 g the n1s was spilt into three peaks which were assigned to the different functional groups of nitrogen atoms that were pyrrolic n 399 8 ev pyridinic n 398 8 ev and graphite n 401 9 ev 43 44 this result confirmed that the successful introduction of nitrogen atoms the xps spectrum of agon 1 30 was displayed in fig s2 h it showed that agon 1 30 consisted of c o n and ag obviously the c1s peak dramatically decreased compared with gon 1 30 as shown in fig 5 c the co 286 4 ev and oco 288 9 ev became stronger which was likely due to the introduction of ag2co3 fig 5 a the ag3d spectrum showed that the peaks at 368 ev and 374 2 ev were ascribed to ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 respectively 45 notably the peak located at 368 ev was spilt into two peaks ag 367 7 ev and ag 368 3 ev respectively the formation of ag may derive from the reduction of ag which spontaneously occurred in the forming of the new bond pyridinic n o at 402 2 ev 46 the o1s spectrum was shown in fig 5 b the only one peak 530 9 ev corresponded to the o element of ag2co3 47 suggesting doping of a large amount of ag2co3 may result in the disappearance of all diffraction peaks of gon 1 30 the n1s spectrum was shown in fig 5 d a new peak at 393 92 ev appeared after introducing n which may be assigned to pyridinic n o derived from the bond energy coupling between the oxygen atom in ag2co3 and the nitrogen atom in gon 1 30 47 ultraviolet visible uv vis absorption spectra and photoluminescence pl spectra were used to probe the optical properties of samples with increasing n content agon samples demonstrated increased light absorption characteristics and then it decreased as the n content further increased it was obvious that agon 1 20 and agon 1 30 ha d an improvement in visible light absorption as their absorption boundaries showed red shift compared with other samples compared with ag2co3 agon 1 30 showed significant enhanced absorption ranges in the visible light region this result further proved that go is an indispensable co catalyst the composite the bandgap energy calculated by the formula 1 48 was shown in the insert of fig 6 a 1 αhν a hν eg n 2 where α is the light absorption coefficients h is planck constants ν is optical frequencies eg is bandgap energy and a is constant the n values of direct and indirect semiconductors are 1 and 4 respectively 49 the n values for both ag2co3 and ng are 4 48 therefore the bandgap order of all samples was as follow agon 1 30 1 69 ev agon 1 20 1 90 ev ago 2 01 ev agon 1 40 2 05 ev agon 1 50 2 20 ev agon 1 10 2 27 ev agon 1 5 2 31 ev as a result agon 1 30 with the minimum bandgap energy 1 69 ev could reduce the bandgap of ago 2 01 ev and promote optical properties the same conclusion can be drawn from the pl emission spectra fig s3 the lower pl intensity presents the lower recombination of electron hole pairs obviously the pl intensity of agon 1 30 significantly decreased compared with the pristine ago thus n doping can effectively improve the optical properties of ago moreover agon 1 30 showed the widest absorption ranges in the visible light region compared with ag2co3 and gon 1 30 fig 6 b this result further proved that agon 1 30 could significantly promote the photocatalytic performance of the composite besides the photon energy vs αhν 1 2 indicated that the bandgap energy of gon 1 30 and ag2co3 was 1 72 ev and 2 15 ev respectively 3 2 photocatalytic degradation of mc lr the mc lr was served as the target contaminant to investigate the photocatalytic activity of the prepared photocatalysts to eliminate the effect of adsorption a dark adsorption experiment was undertaken beforehand as shown in fig s4 the dark adsorption tests indicated that the adsorption equilibrium was obtained within 30 min and the contribution of adsorption by agon 1 30 to mc lr removal was insignificant thus the removal of mc lr by agon 1 30 should be solely attributed to the photocatalytic activity as shown in fig 7 a doping n into go greatly affected its photocatalytic activity over mc lr degradation being far better than the pristine ag2co3 go the agon 1 30 exhibited the best photocatalytic activity and this may due to the higher interfacial charge transfer after doping n atoms into ag2co3 go which could be proposed based on the results pl fig s3 when the mass ratio of n to ago was below 1 20 the mc lr degradation efficiency was decreased 20 min compared with the pristine ago this could be explained by that the defects of go were not filled in time by nitrogen atoms under low n doping ratios however based on the results of sem the excess n doped would cause depressions and cavities on the go surface when n ago further increased to 1 50 simultaneously weakening the photocatalytic activity this result suggested that an appropriate mass ratio of n to ago was very important to obtain the optimal photocatalytic performance from fig 7 b it was obvious that mc lr was completely degraded by agon 1 30 in 7 5 min which was 2 67 times faster than that of ago besides pure ag2co3 showed an insignificant light response in the visible region and the degradation of mc lr was only 40 by 20 min however when ag2co3 was loaded with go the photocatalytic activity was improved 100 removal by 20 min which may due to the excellent visible light absorption performance large specific surface area and high porosity of go 50 especially when n was introduced into the composite the photocatalytic performance was further improved indicating the necessity of n modification this result further proved that go is an indispensable co catalyst the composite therefore subsequent experiments were carried out using agon 1 30 unless otherwise stated 3 3 impact factors on mc lr degradation by agon 1 30 3 3 1 agon 1 30 dosage fig 8 a shows the influence of agon 1 30 dosage 0 250 mg l on mclr degradation results showed that mclr degradation efficiency increased as the dosage of agon 1 30 increased while remained steady in the control group when the dosage of catalyst was below 100 mg l mclr degradation efficiency was decreased in the initial 30 min and significantly increased afterward this is likely due to that active sites were oversaturated at the beginning when the dosage added 100 mg l the maximum mclr degradation efficiencies were reached in 2 5 min that were 58 63 85 and 92 for 100 mg l 150 mg l 200 mg l and 250 mg l respectively this may because the high dosage could provide more active sites for mclr degradation 51 the significant decrease after 2 5 min occurred presumably due to the limited active sites of the photocatalyst as well as the flocculation and precipitation of photocatalysts under high dosage condition 3 3 2 initial concentration different initial concentrations of mc lr 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 mg l were selected to probe the impact on mc lr degradation efficiency as shown in fig 8 b mc lr was 100 removed within 1 5 7 5 30 and 30 min respectively mc lr degradation efficiency increased as mc lr initial concentration added which may because active sites were oversaturated and the violent competition between mc lr and the intermediates as initial concentration increased 52 3 3 3 ph the mc lr degradation by agon 1 30 under different ph value was shown in fig 8 c it was reported that ph was a major factor influencing the efficiency of mc lr degradation since ph could affect the surface charge of the catalyst 53 different ph values had pronounced the influence on mc lr degradation efficiency as followed the order ph 3 5 7 9 obviously acid conditions 7 could promote mc lr degradation efficiency in comparison to alkaline conditions 7 this phenomenon could be divided into three possible reasons a interaction time decreased under alkaline conditions due to the hydrophobicity effect of mc lr in aqueous solution b oh was prone to combine with ag when ph 7 the metallic ag deposited on the surface of catalysts and reduced active sites c it was also affected by the attraction or repulsion relationship between the catalyst and mc lr since oh would produce proton transfer under different ph conditions and thus change electriferous properties of agon 1 30 54 the zeta potential of catalyst and mc lr surface was shown in the inset of fig 8 c the point of zero charge pzc of the catalyst was about 4 2 when the ph 4 2 agon 1 30 surface was positively charged the change of zeta potential on mc lr surface is consistent with formula 2 55 2 mclr h 3 p k 1 3 0 mclr h 2 0 p k 2 3 0 mclr h p k 3 12 5 mcl r 2 3 3 4 impact of nom the presence of nom which usually consisted of humic and non humic fractions has a certain impact on the photocatalytic performance 56 as shown in fig 8 d e the presence of nom significantly inhibited the photocatalytic process since mclr degradation efficiency dramatically decreased kinetic fitting results showed that the photocatalytic degradation of mclr under different nom conditions fit for the second order kinetics model the k value was dropped from 0 1148 min 1 to 0 0109 min 1 when fa dosage increased from 5 mg l to 20 mg l fig s3 e similarly the kinetic constant k decreased from 0 0524 min 1 to 0 0188 min 1 as ha concentration increased fig s3 d this may be attributed to the limited active sites on the catalyst surface besides ha and fa are known as photosensitizers and ros scavenger in natural water body which may lead to light absorption and ross quenching 53 57 noticeability the influence of nom on the catalyst is related to its molecular weight functional group element composition and aromaticity therefore fa with smaller molecular weight and higher o c ratio are more reactive to the catalyst 58 this would explain why fa had a more negative impact than ha on mclr degradation by agon 1 30 under the same condition 3 3 5 h2o2 it has been widely reported that the addition of h2o2 in photocatalytic treatment can promote the removal efficiency of target containments 59 60 fig 8 f showed the mc lr degradation under visible light for different concentrations of h2o2 0 5 mg l it was obvious that mc lr degradation was inhibited with h2o2 increased fig s3 f the kinetic constant k was 0 3441 0 4286 0 0765 0 0678 and 0 0481 min 1 for 0 1 0 5 1 2 5 and 5 mg l of h2o2 respectively as h2o2 concentration increased mc lr degradation efficiency significantly decreased this indicated that the appropriate concentration of h2o2 can promote the degradation of mc lr by agon 1 30 however excess h2o2 may result in a negative impact on mc lr degradation as h2o2 would scavenge ross including oh h e and o2 61 3 3 6 the coexistence of algae cells the release of mc lr was throughout the growth and metabolism of algal cells and therefore algal blooms are usually more complex in the coexistence of algae cells and cyanotoxin in this case a simulation m aeruginosa mc lr coexistence experiment was conducted by adding a certain volume of algae suspension od680 0 932 into mc lr solution as presented in fig s5 visible light barely contributed to mc lr degradation without the addition of catalyst in mc lr agon 1 30 algae system algae cells and its metabolites released along the photocatalytic process would compete with mc lr for active sites of catalyst therefore inhibiting mc lr degradation however after 9 h of visible light irradiation there was 85 of mc lr being removed by agon 1 30 in mc lr algae system and no increase of mc lr concentration observed after algae cells oxidation this indicated that agon 1 30 remained excellent photocatalytic performance in the presence of microcystis aeruginosa and could prevent secondary pollution when practically applied 3 3 7 kinetics analysis kinetics model was used to interpret the photocatalytic reaction kinetics for mc lr degradation as shown in fig s6 the photocatalytic degradation of mc lr under different dosages and ph conditions fits well for the first order kinetics model under different initial mc lr concentrations nom species and content and h2o2 dosage mc lr degradation conformed to the pseudo secondary kinetics model the kinetic equations followed formula 5 and 6 5 ln c t c 0 k 1 t 6 c 0 c t 1 k 2 t where c 0 mg l presents the concentration of microcystis lr at 0 min c t mg l presents the concentration of microcystis lr at t min k 1 min 1 and k 2 s 1 are the apparent reaction rate constant 3 4 recyclability and stability with regards to the stability of agon 1 30 the agon 1 30 cycle experiment was conducted to investigate the photocatalytic degradation performance the detailed description of the experiment can be found in s2 of supporting information as shown in fig 9 a agon 1 30 maintained an excellent photocatalytic activity with a photocatalytic degradation efficiency of 87 after five cycles which only decreased 3 besides the xrd pattern in fig 9 b showed that the reused photocatalyst after five cycles still presented all characteristic peaks of the original one therefore the agon 1 30 photocatalyst possesses great recyclability and stability under visible light irradiation 3 5 reaction intermediates and possible degradation pathway of mc lr the molecular structure of mc lr can be expressed as cyclo adda glu mdha ala leu measp arg 62 in this study 25 degradation products were identified and analyzed according to the lc ms results shown in table s1 the possible degradation pathway of mc lr by agon 1 30 was displayed in fig 10 intermediates of m z 995 6 and 498 3 were corresponded to microcystis lr molecule the adda chain was first attacked by hydroxide radical and formed intermediates a a 1 and a 2 m z 1029 6 the methoxy group in adda chain was reported stable and easily oxidized to formic acid mclr ester under the attack of oh 63 resulting in the formation of intermediates c m z 1043 5 d m z 1043 5 and b m z 1043 5 subsequently the dihydroxylated mclr underwent further oxidization and cleavage reaction forming intermediates e m z 207 3 f m z 835 4 g m z 193 1 h m z 233 1 i m z 795 4 and j m z 247 3 so far the adda chain had been seperated from the mclr structure by oxidation two possible pathways were proposed when intermediates f and i underwent further oxidization in the first proposed pathway the mdha and ala of intermediate f hydrolyzed to form intermediate k m z 783 4 and thus the peptides were separated the amino group in the measp and arg also underwent hydrolyzation and formed intermediate o m z 599 3 l m z 332 2 and n m z 470 3 subsequently the conjugated double bonds of the residual adda in the intermediate o underwent hydroxylation hydroxyl oxidation and cleavage reactions in sequence to generate intermediates w m z 633 3 and x m z 559 3 intermediate p m z 428 2 and q m z 314 2 were assigned to the hydrolysis of the amino groups which occurred in the arg of intermediate n finally intermediate t m z 171 2 y m z 205 3 and z m z 131 1 formed with the amino hydrolysis hydroxylation and hydroxyl oxidation after the continuous radicals attack in the second proposed pathway which started from the hydrolysis of the amino group in the glu of intermediate i resulting in the formation of intermediate m m z 813 4 next hydrolysis reaction took place in the arg in the presence of oh radicals forming intermediates r m z 545 2 and s m z 287 2 the hydroxyl group of the glu in intermediate r then oxidized to form ketone in intermediate u m z 534 2 finally the amino group of leu was hydrolyzed to generate intermediate v m z 300 3 based on the above analysis mclr was more readily attacked by agon 1 30 at the adda chain the conjugated double bonds and methoxy group as well as the cyclic peptides as the photocatalytic process proceeded the adda chain was first attacked by oh radicals and then separated from the mclr structure meanwhile the amino groups in peptides underwent continuous hydrolysis and the cyclic peptide structure was damaged then the adda mdha arg ala and other moieties underwent stepwise oxidation and were removed from mclr structure resulting in the final destruction of the mclr molecule 64 3 6 photocatalytic degradation mechanism the ros generated by agon 1 30 during the photocatalytic process was identified using radical scavenging techniques sodium oxalate so isopropyl alcohol ipa benzoquinone bq and phenol were selected as scavengers to quench h oh o2 and co3 respectively 65 in fig 11 a the mc lr degradation efficiency was 100 with no scavenger and it decreased to 71 4 50 0 39 3 and 23 1 as different kinds of scavengers added based on the difference of mc lr degradation efficiencies by two different scavengers the contributions of active substances were obtained as presented in fig 11 b therefore oh played the main role in the photocatalytic process since it accounted for 28 6 difference value between 100 and 71 4 next o2 for 21 4 contribution and co3 for 16 2 at last the h only accounted for 10 7 as the auxiliary active substance as for the remaining 23 1 contribution it was likely due to those active substances such as e and 1o2 which was not detected 66 according to the results of uv vis the band energies of gon 1 30 and ag2co3 were 1 72 ev and 2 15 ev respectively as shown in fig s7 the vb potentials of gon 1 30 and ag2co3 were 0 732 ev and 2 695 ev respectively therefore the cb potentials of gon 1 30 and ag2co3 were calculated to be 0 988 ev and 0 545 ev based on formula 7 respectively 7 e cb e vb e g where ecb is the cb potential evb is the vb potential and eg is the band energy the mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of mclr over agon 1 30 was proposed based on the above analysis as depicted in scheme 1 the photogenerated electrons were excited from vb to cb of both gon 1 30 and ag2co3 due to their narrow bandgaps under visible light irradiation based on the aforementioned results oh and o2 were proved to be the predominant ross assuming the charge transfer followed the conventional type ii heterojunction mechanism it is likely that h and e would accumulate on the vb of gon 1 30 and the cb of ag2co3 respectively however o2 and oh could not be generated respectively in the cb of ag2co3 and vb of gon 1 30 in this case which is not consistent with the scavenging results 46 67 contrarily the z scheme heterojunction mechanism can better explain the quenching results when z scheme photocatalyst was formed the e in cb of ag2co3 recombined with the h in the vb of gon 1 30 this charge transfer pathway prevented the recombination of e from cb of gon 1 30 and h from vb of ag2co3 as well as the photocorrosion of ag2co3 in this way the photoproduced e was gathered in the cb of gon 1 30 and reduced oxygen to o2 while the photoproduced h in the vb of ag2co3 oxidized hydroxyl ions to oh meanwhile some oh reacted with co3 2 and hco3 to form co3 4 conclusions an efficient z scheme ag2co3 ng agon heterojunction photocatalyst was successfully constructed through the combination of n doping go and facilely deposition of ag2co3 the ag2co3 ng with 30 wt n participation agon 1 30 showed remarkable photocatalytic degradation of mc lr than ag2co3 and ag2co3 go under visible light during the n doping content optimization experiment besides effect of various factors including dosage ph value mc lr concentration nom h2o2 and the presence of microcystis aeruginosa were classified for the practical application the increasing of nom and h2o2 concentration negatively affected on mc lr degradation after the photocatalytic degradation a total of 25 intermediates were identified according to the lc ms results the proposed pathway of mclr degradation suggested that the adda chain the unsaturated conjugated double bonds and methoxy group and the cyclic peptides were vulnerable by the attack of ros the mclr structure was eventually destructed after stepwise oxidation of adda mdha arg and other moieties the charge transfer pathway of agon 1 30 followed the z scheme heterojunction mechanism the e in the cb of ag2co3 recombined with the h in the vb of gon 1 30 generating more o2 in the cb of gon 1 30 and more oh in the vb of ag2co3 this z scheme photocatalyst can help provide a new insight into the visible light driven technologies for the remediation of cyanobacterial toxins declaration of competing interest

13684,a novel z scheme ag2co3 ng heterojunction photocatalyst by employing n doped graphene ng was successfully synthesized with enhanced photocatalytic activity for microcystin lr mc lr degradation characterization results suggested that doping of n can promote the nucleation and crystallization of ag2co3 photocatalytic tests showed that ag2co3 ng with 30 wt n participation agon 1 30 showed the best photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation which could remove mc lr in 7 5 min superior to ag2co3 go composite multiple factors including dosage ph value mc lr concentration h2o2 and the coexistence of microcystis aeruginosa were studied to reveal the environmental impact on mc lr degradation results showed that oh o2 as well as co3 were the main ross in mc lr degradation the excellent reusability and stability of agon 1 30 were proved through five consecutive cycles of degradation therefore the z scheme ag2co3 ng heterojunction photocatalyst is a promising technique for mc lr remediation keywords z scheme photocatalyst n doped graphene microcystis lr degradation visible light 1 introduction cyanobacterial harmful algae blooms cyanohabs which is the result of increased inputs of nutrients by human activities frequently occurs in china over the last decade 1 microcystis is one of the most common bloom forming genera when cyanohabs occurs 2 toxins produced by cyanohabs may pose a significant threat to people through food web or by long term exposure to contaminated drinking water including skin diseases liver cancer or even death 3 much effort has been made to mitigate the effects of microcystins mcs which can be divided into physical 4 chemical 5 and biological 6 methods however microcystin lr mc lr a very stable toxin is difficult to remove by these traditional methods due to its loop structure and amino acid 7 8 it was reported that a c n co modified mesoporous tio2 composite was synthesized by a simple one pot method and successfully employed to remove mc lr under visible light 9 besides it was found that photo irradiation is effective in mcs degradation with the assist of reactive oxygen species ross e g oh 10 many reports have stated that oh with strong oxidizing ability played a main role in photo breakdown of mc lr especially in attacking the adda chain as well as the cyclic structure 11 13 therefore photocatalytic technology has been introduced as a promising approach for degrading cyanotoxins out of various semiconductors silver containing compounds e g ag3po4 ag3vo4 ag2cro4 and ag2co3 are considered as novel photocatalysts with small bandgap energy and high photocatalytic activity 14 19 it has been reported that the narrow bandgap could be attributed to the hybridized ag 4d and o 2p orbitals which raise the top position of the valence band vb and the conduction band cb position is relatively lower 20 moreover silver based compounds also show inhibitory potential in cyanotoxins wang et al 15 found that mclr was degraded into smaller molecules by agbr ag3po4 tio2 photocatalyst under solar light irradiation however silver containing compounds are unstable exposed to visible light irradiation because of the photocorrosion and thus deactivate photocatalysts 21 therefore it is necessary to find an appropriate co catalyst as photogenerated electrons acceptor before ag is reduced to metallic ag graphene oxide go a two dimensional honeycomb structure can serve as an ideal co catalyst 22 unfortunately due to the scarcity of limited band gap go has many restrains in further application 23 to overcome this problem the nitrogen doping has been proven to be an effective way to widen the band gap energy and tailor the electronic property and chemical reactivity of graphene which can be formed by three typical n bonding configurations i e pyridinic n np pyrrolic n npr and graphitic n ng to greatly improve its photocatalytic performance 24 26 n doping in the fabrication can also improve photocatalytic performance by enhancing the electronic and chemical properties 27 29 however the correlation between n doped ag2co3 go and mclr degradation under visible light remains unknown here the n doped ag2co3 go agon photocatalysts were employed to degrade mclr under visible light where the agon photocatalysts followed the z scheme mechanism possessing photocatalytic performance superior to the pristine ag2co3 go ago the introduction of nitrogen element enhanced the visible light absorption of go and greatly improve its electron transfer ability the photocatalytic performance of as prepared products on mc lr was systematically studied the possible degradation pathways of mc lr subjected to agon photocatalyst under visible light were evaluated and a possible degradation mechanism was also proposed 2 methods and materials 2 1 synthesis of ng n doped graphene ng was prepared by a facile method 30 firstly go was prefabricated according to hummers et al 31 subsequently 5 g l go was obtained by the assistance of ultrasound for 2 h a certain amount of urea 0 1 25 2 5 5 7 5 10 and 12 5 g was added into the solution and sonicated for 30 min after magnetically stirring for 2 h the mixture was transferred to a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave 80 ml and held at 180 c for 12 h the final product was centrifuged then washed by ultrapure water and dried at 45 c the collected samples were termed as go gon 1 5 gon 1 10 gon 1 20 gon 1 30 gon 1 40 and gon 1 50 respectively based on the weight ratio of n to go 2 2 synthesis of ag2co3 ng typically a series of different n wt go suspensions 1 g l was obtained 0 wt 5 wt 10 wt 20 wt 30 wt 40 wt and 50 wt by the assistance of ultrasound for 2 h subsequently 8 38 ml of the ng suspension was added into the silver nitrate solution and kept stirring for 12 h to get a mixture after that 100 ml of sodium carbonate solution was added drop by drop and kept stirring for 1 h the molar ratio of silver nitrate sodium carbonate 2 1 finally the final products were obtained after aging at 25 for 4 h the samples were named as ago agon 1 5 agon 1 10 agon 1 20 agon 1 30 agon 1 40 and agon 1 50 the ratio of ng to ag2co3was 1 wt 2 3 experimental set up photocatalytic experiments were performed in a home made photochemical reactor reported in previous study 32 as shown in fig s1 the metal halogen lamp philips 500 w with a uv filter λ 420 nm was kept at a distance of 15 cm from the surface of solution circulating water was used to cool the system to eliminate the thermal effects the light intensity measured to 74020 lx by a digital luxmeter jiading jd 3 china 2 4 photocatalytic degradation of mc lr in this experiment all prepared photocatalysts were dispersed by ultrasonic to obtain 1 g l suspension a certain volume of the suspension was added to 20 ml 0 2 mg l mc lr aqueous solution at the desired catalyst concentration of 100 mg l before photocatalytic experiment the dark adsorption was investigated 1 ml of the sample was taken at pre determined intervals and filtered with a 0 22 μm ptfe syringe high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu lc 2030 japan was then employed for the analysis of mc lr concentrations at different times the catalyst which showed the best photocatalytic performance in mc lr degradation was chosen for the following experiments the impact factors were studied through single factor control experiments the optimum dosage and initial concentration were studied before further investigation firstly 100 mg l of agon 1 30 was adopted to investigate the best initial concentration 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 mg l next the dosage of catalyst 0 50 80 150 200 and 250 mg l was studied the desired ph value 3 5 7 9 was obtained by using 1 m concentration of hno3 and naoh solutions adding a certain volume of 0 5 g l h2o2 solution to obtain h2o2 with different initial concentrations 0 0 1 0 5 1 and 5 mg l other environmental factors including the presence of natter organic matter nom and the coexistence of algae were also investigated 2 5 analytical methods the concentration of mc lr and the degradation intermediates were determined and identified by high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry hplc qtof ms 33 the determination of mc lr concentration was conducted according to the previous method 34 the mobile phase consisted of 0 1 formic acid and acetonitrile acn in gradient elution 10 min 0 20 acn 10 min 20 35 acn 15 min 35 65 acn and 15 min 65 80 acn the qtof ms analysis was performed in positive ion mode and m h m na m 2 h 2 or m 2na 2 m z data where m was the target molecular weight the degradation intermediates with m z range from 200 to 1350 were obtained and analyzed using qualitative analysis b 04 00 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization in fig 1 the peaks at 8 61 20 66 32 76 33 76 37 09 39 75 41 91 and 44 45 correspond to ag2co3 jcpds no 26 0339 35 the peak intensity of ag2co3 did not enhance when the n doped amount was higher than 30 wt indicating that excess doping of n was not conducive to crystallization of ag2co3 no obvious diffraction peaks of n doped graphene were observed in all photocatalysts which could be attribute to the low content of n doped graphene 1 wt notably the peak at 38 1 was attributed to ag 36 therefore the xrd patterns approved the successful synthesis of agon samples the morphology of the photocatalysts was further investigated by sem in fig 2 a the pristine go nanosheets overlapped with each other providing a large number of attachment sites as shown in fig 2 b the highly crystalized ag2co3 nanoparticles deposited on the surface of go indicating the successful synthesis of ag2co3 go when the ratio of n to ago was 1 5 1 10 and 1 20 the morphology of go did not significantly change and the uneven distribution of ag2co3 may result in the weaken photocatalytic performance fig 2 c e as n ago increased to 1 30 the go surface became wrinkled possibly due to the sp2 hybridization of carbon atoms was destructed as n participation increased 37 and thus provided more available sites for ag2co3 deposition fig 2 f when the ratio of n to ag2co3 go further increased to 1 40 and 1 50 the go surface dramatically wrinkled due to the excess doping of n element and the agglomeration of ag2co3 was observed based on the above analysis agon 1 30 was selected for the following characterization as shown in fig 3 elemental analysis proved the homogenous presence of ag c and o throughout agon 1 30 besides the new element n was found which accounted for 7 35 this result confirmed the presence of the n species on the surface of agon 1 30 moreover n atoms would bond with or substitute for c atoms at the defects of go thus resulting in a decrease in the proportion of c and o 38 the structural changes after introducing n into ago were investigated by ftir spectroscopy with regard to the ftir spectra of go the absorption peaks at 3436 31 cm 1 2923 60 cm 1 1624 48 cm 1 1581 37 cm 1 1384 36 cm 1 1108 40 cm 1 and 1042 40 cm 1 belonged to oh c h co cc coh o c h and coc 39 40 respectively after introducing the n element the oh stretching vibration moved from 3436 31 cm 1 to 3445 71 cm 1 and the characteristic peaks of cc o c h and coc disappeared 41 the peaks at 1350 43 cm 1 and 1229 90 cm 1 were attributed to cn and cn indicating that the n atoms were successfully doped into graphene in fig 4 c the oh co and cc from go were conserved in ago pattern the observation of peaks at 1450 83 cm 1 1382 25 cm 1 882 93 cm 1 and 706 22 cm 1 confirmed the dope of ag2co3 42 in fig 4 d agon 1 30 showed a similar pattern with that of ago the peaks at 1229 92 cm 1 cn and 1351 62 cm 1 cn indicated that n atoms have doped into the structure of ago indicating the successfully synthesis of agon 1 30 xps spectrum of go was displayed in fig s2 a it showed that the synthesized go with high purity did not contain other elements except c and o the o1s spectrum of go was displayed in fig s2 b the peaks at 531 8 ev and 532 9 ev were assigned to co and co bands respectively the c1s spectrum of go was displayed in fig s2 c the peaks at 284 8 ev 286 1 ev and 288 7 ev were attributed to the different functional groups of carbon atoms including cc co and oco 43 compared with go the new n1s spectrum was observed in the xps spectrum of gon 1 30 in fig s2 d indicating that the nitrogen atom has been successfully doped into go as shown in fig s2 e the o1s spectrum of gon 1 30 showed similar patterns with that of go except for a 0 1 ev shift observed in the peak of co 531 8 ev this phenomenon was likely due to the addition of n a new peak located at 287 5 ev which was assigned to cn was found in the c1s spectrum of gon 1 30 in fig s2 f the peak of co 285 1 ev in go moved to 285 4 ev in gon 1 30 43 the reduction observed in the intensities of co 286 4 ev and oc o 288 7 ev indicating the o atoms of go have been substituted by n atoms as shown in fig s2 g the n1s was spilt into three peaks which were assigned to the different functional groups of nitrogen atoms that were pyrrolic n 399 8 ev pyridinic n 398 8 ev and graphite n 401 9 ev 43 44 this result confirmed that the successful introduction of nitrogen atoms the xps spectrum of agon 1 30 was displayed in fig s2 h it showed that agon 1 30 consisted of c o n and ag obviously the c1s peak dramatically decreased compared with gon 1 30 as shown in fig 5 c the co 286 4 ev and oco 288 9 ev became stronger which was likely due to the introduction of ag2co3 fig 5 a the ag3d spectrum showed that the peaks at 368 ev and 374 2 ev were ascribed to ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 respectively 45 notably the peak located at 368 ev was spilt into two peaks ag 367 7 ev and ag 368 3 ev respectively the formation of ag may derive from the reduction of ag which spontaneously occurred in the forming of the new bond pyridinic n o at 402 2 ev 46 the o1s spectrum was shown in fig 5 b the only one peak 530 9 ev corresponded to the o element of ag2co3 47 suggesting doping of a large amount of ag2co3 may result in the disappearance of all diffraction peaks of gon 1 30 the n1s spectrum was shown in fig 5 d a new peak at 393 92 ev appeared after introducing n which may be assigned to pyridinic n o derived from the bond energy coupling between the oxygen atom in ag2co3 and the nitrogen atom in gon 1 30 47 ultraviolet visible uv vis absorption spectra and photoluminescence pl spectra were used to probe the optical properties of samples with increasing n content agon samples demonstrated increased light absorption characteristics and then it decreased as the n content further increased it was obvious that agon 1 20 and agon 1 30 ha d an improvement in visible light absorption as their absorption boundaries showed red shift compared with other samples compared with ag2co3 agon 1 30 showed significant enhanced absorption ranges in the visible light region this result further proved that go is an indispensable co catalyst the composite the bandgap energy calculated by the formula 1 48 was shown in the insert of fig 6 a 1 αhν a hν eg n 2 where α is the light absorption coefficients h is planck constants ν is optical frequencies eg is bandgap energy and a is constant the n values of direct and indirect semiconductors are 1 and 4 respectively 49 the n values for both ag2co3 and ng are 4 48 therefore the bandgap order of all samples was as follow agon 1 30 1 69 ev agon 1 20 1 90 ev ago 2 01 ev agon 1 40 2 05 ev agon 1 50 2 20 ev agon 1 10 2 27 ev agon 1 5 2 31 ev as a result agon 1 30 with the minimum bandgap energy 1 69 ev could reduce the bandgap of ago 2 01 ev and promote optical properties the same conclusion can be drawn from the pl emission spectra fig s3 the lower pl intensity presents the lower recombination of electron hole pairs obviously the pl intensity of agon 1 30 significantly decreased compared with the pristine ago thus n doping can effectively improve the optical properties of ago moreover agon 1 30 showed the widest absorption ranges in the visible light region compared with ag2co3 and gon 1 30 fig 6 b this result further proved that agon 1 30 could significantly promote the photocatalytic performance of the composite besides the photon energy vs αhν 1 2 indicated that the bandgap energy of gon 1 30 and ag2co3 was 1 72 ev and 2 15 ev respectively 3 2 photocatalytic degradation of mc lr the mc lr was served as the target contaminant to investigate the photocatalytic activity of the prepared photocatalysts to eliminate the effect of adsorption a dark adsorption experiment was undertaken beforehand as shown in fig s4 the dark adsorption tests indicated that the adsorption equilibrium was obtained within 30 min and the contribution of adsorption by agon 1 30 to mc lr removal was insignificant thus the removal of mc lr by agon 1 30 should be solely attributed to the photocatalytic activity as shown in fig 7 a doping n into go greatly affected its photocatalytic activity over mc lr degradation being far better than the pristine ag2co3 go the agon 1 30 exhibited the best photocatalytic activity and this may due to the higher interfacial charge transfer after doping n atoms into ag2co3 go which could be proposed based on the results pl fig s3 when the mass ratio of n to ago was below 1 20 the mc lr degradation efficiency was decreased 20 min compared with the pristine ago this could be explained by that the defects of go were not filled in time by nitrogen atoms under low n doping ratios however based on the results of sem the excess n doped would cause depressions and cavities on the go surface when n ago further increased to 1 50 simultaneously weakening the photocatalytic activity this result suggested that an appropriate mass ratio of n to ago was very important to obtain the optimal photocatalytic performance from fig 7 b it was obvious that mc lr was completely degraded by agon 1 30 in 7 5 min which was 2 67 times faster than that of ago besides pure ag2co3 showed an insignificant light response in the visible region and the degradation of mc lr was only 40 by 20 min however when ag2co3 was loaded with go the photocatalytic activity was improved 100 removal by 20 min which may due to the excellent visible light absorption performance large specific surface area and high porosity of go 50 especially when n was introduced into the composite the photocatalytic performance was further improved indicating the necessity of n modification this result further proved that go is an indispensable co catalyst the composite therefore subsequent experiments were carried out using agon 1 30 unless otherwise stated 3 3 impact factors on mc lr degradation by agon 1 30 3 3 1 agon 1 30 dosage fig 8 a shows the influence of agon 1 30 dosage 0 250 mg l on mclr degradation results showed that mclr degradation efficiency increased as the dosage of agon 1 30 increased while remained steady in the control group when the dosage of catalyst was below 100 mg l mclr degradation efficiency was decreased in the initial 30 min and significantly increased afterward this is likely due to that active sites were oversaturated at the beginning when the dosage added 100 mg l the maximum mclr degradation efficiencies were reached in 2 5 min that were 58 63 85 and 92 for 100 mg l 150 mg l 200 mg l and 250 mg l respectively this may because the high dosage could provide more active sites for mclr degradation 51 the significant decrease after 2 5 min occurred presumably due to the limited active sites of the photocatalyst as well as the flocculation and precipitation of photocatalysts under high dosage condition 3 3 2 initial concentration different initial concentrations of mc lr 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 mg l were selected to probe the impact on mc lr degradation efficiency as shown in fig 8 b mc lr was 100 removed within 1 5 7 5 30 and 30 min respectively mc lr degradation efficiency increased as mc lr initial concentration added which may because active sites were oversaturated and the violent competition between mc lr and the intermediates as initial concentration increased 52 3 3 3 ph the mc lr degradation by agon 1 30 under different ph value was shown in fig 8 c it was reported that ph was a major factor influencing the efficiency of mc lr degradation since ph could affect the surface charge of the catalyst 53 different ph values had pronounced the influence on mc lr degradation efficiency as followed the order ph 3 5 7 9 obviously acid conditions 7 could promote mc lr degradation efficiency in comparison to alkaline conditions 7 this phenomenon could be divided into three possible reasons a interaction time decreased under alkaline conditions due to the hydrophobicity effect of mc lr in aqueous solution b oh was prone to combine with ag when ph 7 the metallic ag deposited on the surface of catalysts and reduced active sites c it was also affected by the attraction or repulsion relationship between the catalyst and mc lr since oh would produce proton transfer under different ph conditions and thus change electriferous properties of agon 1 30 54 the zeta potential of catalyst and mc lr surface was shown in the inset of fig 8 c the point of zero charge pzc of the catalyst was about 4 2 when the ph 4 2 agon 1 30 surface was positively charged the change of zeta potential on mc lr surface is consistent with formula 2 55 2 mclr h 3 p k 1 3 0 mclr h 2 0 p k 2 3 0 mclr h p k 3 12 5 mcl r 2 3 3 4 impact of nom the presence of nom which usually consisted of humic and non humic fractions has a certain impact on the photocatalytic performance 56 as shown in fig 8 d e the presence of nom significantly inhibited the photocatalytic process since mclr degradation efficiency dramatically decreased kinetic fitting results showed that the photocatalytic degradation of mclr under different nom conditions fit for the second order kinetics model the k value was dropped from 0 1148 min 1 to 0 0109 min 1 when fa dosage increased from 5 mg l to 20 mg l fig s3 e similarly the kinetic constant k decreased from 0 0524 min 1 to 0 0188 min 1 as ha concentration increased fig s3 d this may be attributed to the limited active sites on the catalyst surface besides ha and fa are known as photosensitizers and ros scavenger in natural water body which may lead to light absorption and ross quenching 53 57 noticeability the influence of nom on the catalyst is related to its molecular weight functional group element composition and aromaticity therefore fa with smaller molecular weight and higher o c ratio are more reactive to the catalyst 58 this would explain why fa had a more negative impact than ha on mclr degradation by agon 1 30 under the same condition 3 3 5 h2o2 it has been widely reported that the addition of h2o2 in photocatalytic treatment can promote the removal efficiency of target containments 59 60 fig 8 f showed the mc lr degradation under visible light for different concentrations of h2o2 0 5 mg l it was obvious that mc lr degradation was inhibited with h2o2 increased fig s3 f the kinetic constant k was 0 3441 0 4286 0 0765 0 0678 and 0 0481 min 1 for 0 1 0 5 1 2 5 and 5 mg l of h2o2 respectively as h2o2 concentration increased mc lr degradation efficiency significantly decreased this indicated that the appropriate concentration of h2o2 can promote the degradation of mc lr by agon 1 30 however excess h2o2 may result in a negative impact on mc lr degradation as h2o2 would scavenge ross including oh h e and o2 61 3 3 6 the coexistence of algae cells the release of mc lr was throughout the growth and metabolism of algal cells and therefore algal blooms are usually more complex in the coexistence of algae cells and cyanotoxin in this case a simulation m aeruginosa mc lr coexistence experiment was conducted by adding a certain volume of algae suspension od680 0 932 into mc lr solution as presented in fig s5 visible light barely contributed to mc lr degradation without the addition of catalyst in mc lr agon 1 30 algae system algae cells and its metabolites released along the photocatalytic process would compete with mc lr for active sites of catalyst therefore inhibiting mc lr degradation however after 9 h of visible light irradiation there was 85 of mc lr being removed by agon 1 30 in mc lr algae system and no increase of mc lr concentration observed after algae cells oxidation this indicated that agon 1 30 remained excellent photocatalytic performance in the presence of microcystis aeruginosa and could prevent secondary pollution when practically applied 3 3 7 kinetics analysis kinetics model was used to interpret the photocatalytic reaction kinetics for mc lr degradation as shown in fig s6 the photocatalytic degradation of mc lr under different dosages and ph conditions fits well for the first order kinetics model under different initial mc lr concentrations nom species and content and h2o2 dosage mc lr degradation conformed to the pseudo secondary kinetics model the kinetic equations followed formula 5 and 6 5 ln c t c 0 k 1 t 6 c 0 c t 1 k 2 t where c 0 mg l presents the concentration of microcystis lr at 0 min c t mg l presents the concentration of microcystis lr at t min k 1 min 1 and k 2 s 1 are the apparent reaction rate constant 3 4 recyclability and stability with regards to the stability of agon 1 30 the agon 1 30 cycle experiment was conducted to investigate the photocatalytic degradation performance the detailed description of the experiment can be found in s2 of supporting information as shown in fig 9 a agon 1 30 maintained an excellent photocatalytic activity with a photocatalytic degradation efficiency of 87 after five cycles which only decreased 3 besides the xrd pattern in fig 9 b showed that the reused photocatalyst after five cycles still presented all characteristic peaks of the original one therefore the agon 1 30 photocatalyst possesses great recyclability and stability under visible light irradiation 3 5 reaction intermediates and possible degradation pathway of mc lr the molecular structure of mc lr can be expressed as cyclo adda glu mdha ala leu measp arg 62 in this study 25 degradation products were identified and analyzed according to the lc ms results shown in table s1 the possible degradation pathway of mc lr by agon 1 30 was displayed in fig 10 intermediates of m z 995 6 and 498 3 were corresponded to microcystis lr molecule the adda chain was first attacked by hydroxide radical and formed intermediates a a 1 and a 2 m z 1029 6 the methoxy group in adda chain was reported stable and easily oxidized to formic acid mclr ester under the attack of oh 63 resulting in the formation of intermediates c m z 1043 5 d m z 1043 5 and b m z 1043 5 subsequently the dihydroxylated mclr underwent further oxidization and cleavage reaction forming intermediates e m z 207 3 f m z 835 4 g m z 193 1 h m z 233 1 i m z 795 4 and j m z 247 3 so far the adda chain had been seperated from the mclr structure by oxidation two possible pathways were proposed when intermediates f and i underwent further oxidization in the first proposed pathway the mdha and ala of intermediate f hydrolyzed to form intermediate k m z 783 4 and thus the peptides were separated the amino group in the measp and arg also underwent hydrolyzation and formed intermediate o m z 599 3 l m z 332 2 and n m z 470 3 subsequently the conjugated double bonds of the residual adda in the intermediate o underwent hydroxylation hydroxyl oxidation and cleavage reactions in sequence to generate intermediates w m z 633 3 and x m z 559 3 intermediate p m z 428 2 and q m z 314 2 were assigned to the hydrolysis of the amino groups which occurred in the arg of intermediate n finally intermediate t m z 171 2 y m z 205 3 and z m z 131 1 formed with the amino hydrolysis hydroxylation and hydroxyl oxidation after the continuous radicals attack in the second proposed pathway which started from the hydrolysis of the amino group in the glu of intermediate i resulting in the formation of intermediate m m z 813 4 next hydrolysis reaction took place in the arg in the presence of oh radicals forming intermediates r m z 545 2 and s m z 287 2 the hydroxyl group of the glu in intermediate r then oxidized to form ketone in intermediate u m z 534 2 finally the amino group of leu was hydrolyzed to generate intermediate v m z 300 3 based on the above analysis mclr was more readily attacked by agon 1 30 at the adda chain the conjugated double bonds and methoxy group as well as the cyclic peptides as the photocatalytic process proceeded the adda chain was first attacked by oh radicals and then separated from the mclr structure meanwhile the amino groups in peptides underwent continuous hydrolysis and the cyclic peptide structure was damaged then the adda mdha arg ala and other moieties underwent stepwise oxidation and were removed from mclr structure resulting in the final destruction of the mclr molecule 64 3 6 photocatalytic degradation mechanism the ros generated by agon 1 30 during the photocatalytic process was identified using radical scavenging techniques sodium oxalate so isopropyl alcohol ipa benzoquinone bq and phenol were selected as scavengers to quench h oh o2 and co3 respectively 65 in fig 11 a the mc lr degradation efficiency was 100 with no scavenger and it decreased to 71 4 50 0 39 3 and 23 1 as different kinds of scavengers added based on the difference of mc lr degradation efficiencies by two different scavengers the contributions of active substances were obtained as presented in fig 11 b therefore oh played the main role in the photocatalytic process since it accounted for 28 6 difference value between 100 and 71 4 next o2 for 21 4 contribution and co3 for 16 2 at last the h only accounted for 10 7 as the auxiliary active substance as for the remaining 23 1 contribution it was likely due to those active substances such as e and 1o2 which was not detected 66 according to the results of uv vis the band energies of gon 1 30 and ag2co3 were 1 72 ev and 2 15 ev respectively as shown in fig s7 the vb potentials of gon 1 30 and ag2co3 were 0 732 ev and 2 695 ev respectively therefore the cb potentials of gon 1 30 and ag2co3 were calculated to be 0 988 ev and 0 545 ev based on formula 7 respectively 7 e cb e vb e g where ecb is the cb potential evb is the vb potential and eg is the band energy the mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of mclr over agon 1 30 was proposed based on the above analysis as depicted in scheme 1 the photogenerated electrons were excited from vb to cb of both gon 1 30 and ag2co3 due to their narrow bandgaps under visible light irradiation based on the aforementioned results oh and o2 were proved to be the predominant ross assuming the charge transfer followed the conventional type ii heterojunction mechanism it is likely that h and e would accumulate on the vb of gon 1 30 and the cb of ag2co3 respectively however o2 and oh could not be generated respectively in the cb of ag2co3 and vb of gon 1 30 in this case which is not consistent with the scavenging results 46 67 contrarily the z scheme heterojunction mechanism can better explain the quenching results when z scheme photocatalyst was formed the e in cb of ag2co3 recombined with the h in the vb of gon 1 30 this charge transfer pathway prevented the recombination of e from cb of gon 1 30 and h from vb of ag2co3 as well as the photocorrosion of ag2co3 in this way the photoproduced e was gathered in the cb of gon 1 30 and reduced oxygen to o2 while the photoproduced h in the vb of ag2co3 oxidized hydroxyl ions to oh meanwhile some oh reacted with co3 2 and hco3 to form co3 4 conclusions an efficient z scheme ag2co3 ng agon heterojunction photocatalyst was successfully constructed through the combination of n doping go and facilely deposition of ag2co3 the ag2co3 ng with 30 wt n participation agon 1 30 showed remarkable photocatalytic degradation of mc lr than ag2co3 and ag2co3 go under visible light during the n doping content optimization experiment besides effect of various factors including dosage ph value mc lr concentration nom h2o2 and the presence of microcystis aeruginosa were classified for the practical application the increasing of nom and h2o2 concentration negatively affected on mc lr degradation after the photocatalytic degradation a total of 25 intermediates were identified according to the lc ms results the proposed pathway of mclr degradation suggested that the adda chain the unsaturated conjugated double bonds and methoxy group and the cyclic peptides were vulnerable by the attack of ros the mclr structure was eventually destructed after stepwise oxidation of adda mdha arg and other moieties the charge transfer pathway of agon 1 30 followed the z scheme heterojunction mechanism the e in the cb of ag2co3 recombined with the h in the vb of gon 1 30 generating more o2 in the cb of gon 1 30 and more oh in the vb of ag2co3 this z scheme photocatalyst can help provide a new insight into the visible light driven technologies for the remediation of cyanobacterial toxins declaration of competing interest
