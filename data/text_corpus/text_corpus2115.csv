10575,developing an ecologically friendly supplementary irrigation method is vitally important for improving wheat productivity in terms of reduced water usage and high yields in semiarid areas in this study we explored the effects of the ridge furrow mulching system rf with supplementary irrigation on soil respiration in winter wheat fields under different rainfall conditions three rainfall conditions were simulated heavy rainfall 275 mm normal rainfall 200 mm and light rainfall 125 mm and four irrigation treatments 150 75 37 5 and 0 mm were examined during the growth period for winter wheat a traditional flat tf planting was used as the control the results obtained after three years october 2015 to june 2018 showed that there was no significant difference in the soil respiration rate between rf and tf under 200 mm and 275 mm rainfall in the winter wheat growth period under rainfall at 125 mm the respiration rate using rf with the same irrigation was significantly increased by 5 31 23 38 compared with that using tf where the differences among treatments were significant except for that with irrigation at 150 mm under rainfall at 275 200 and 125 mm the coefficients of determination for the effects of the soil temperature and water content on soil respiration were lower with rf than tf the coefficients of determination also tended to increase as the amounts of rainfall and supplementary irrigation decreased therefore to reduce the impact of supplementary irrigation under climate warming we conclude that the p1r75 p2r150 and p3r150 treatments are suitable

and soil respiration is one of the largest carbon fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere jiang et al 2009 farmland ecosystems are important components of the terrestrial ecosystem zhang et al 2019 where the annual amount of co2 emitted into the atmosphere due to soil respiration in farmland is 640 g m 2 raich and aydin 2000 as people know the farmland ecosystem itself is vulnerable to interference from human activities farina et al 2017 different farming irrigation and fertilization methods can affect soil respiration in farmland lal 2004 therefore it is important to study the response of soil respiration to changes in agricultural management and the climate in farmland ecosystems wan et al 2007 studies have shown that the response of soil respiration to rainfall and irrigation is highly complex where it is affected by changes in the aeration condition of the soil ouyang et al 2015 the composition and effectiveness of the respiratory substrate miller et al 2005 and the physiological activities of soil microorganisms and roots hursh et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 a large number of studies have found that the two main factors affecting soil respiration are soil temperature and moisture which affect soil respiration by affecting plant root growth and microbial activity charles et al 2017 sun et al 2019 particularly in arid and semiarid areas chen et al 2010 norton et al 2008 generally speaking temperature is the main controlling factor of soil respiration wen et al 2018 however when it comes to an ecosystem with limited water resources precipitation is also an important factor affecting soil respiration sun et al 2019 in addition other environmental factors can have synergistic effect on soil respiration through the effects of temperature and precipitation peng et al 2018 in recent years the ridge furrow mulching rf system and supplementary irrigation have been used widely in arid and semiarid areas where water resources are scarce as a new water saving and high efficiency irrigation technology because it significantly increases the soil temperature and moisture content ali et al 2018 li et al 2018 bhattarai et al 2015 it is worth noting that due to the change of the way and the amount of irrigation the change of soil moisture and temperature may directly or indirectly affect soil respiration guan et al 2019 most of the previous studies on rf and supplementary irrigation have focused on crop growth and yield ali et al 2018b but there is no relevant research report on the regulation of soil respiration and its response under rf and supplementary irrigation thus in the present study we tested different amounts of precipitation and irrigation to compare the soil hydrothermal effect and differences in soil respiration under the rf mulching system with supplementary irrigation and traditional flat planting tf in wheat fields we tested different precipitation and irrigation regimes to compare the soil respiration in winter wheat fields and its response mechanism to changes in the soil water content and temperature under the rf mulching system the objectives of the present study are to explore 1 the effect of rf system on soil respiration soil moisture content and soil temperature 2 the synergistic effect of soil water content and soil temperature on soil respiration under rf 3 to provide theoretical basis for defining the characteristic co2 emissions from winter wheat fields under the rf mulching system with supplementary irrigation and determine the impact of rf mulching system on atmospheric environment under the background of global climate change and for evaluating the ecological and environmental benefits of the rf mulching system we expect this study will provide optimal amount of supplementary irrigation for reducing co2 emissions in regions with different rainfall types 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description the experiment was conducted at the crop water

a mean annual temperature of 12 9 c and located 524 m above sea level the mean annual rainfall per year was 550 600 mm where most occurred during july and september the rainfall was relatively low in the winter wheat growth period with about 200 mm in a moderate rainfall year planting pits were prepared with an area of 6 7 m2 3 15 2 13 m and depth of 3 m in the field at the crop water control monitoring test site cement walls were constructed with a thickness of 17 cm around the pits to prevent horizontal water exchange and a soil moisture measurement system time domain reflectometry tdr trase tdr system soil moisture equipment corp germany was fixed in the pits the original soil column comprising deep red soil was collected from typical farmland in yangling and used to fill the pit layer by layer the bottom of the pit was covered with a filter layer 0 5 m thick sand and stone and a drain pipe was positioned to allow water to escape from the bottom of the pit an electrically controlled cover was operated when rain and snow occurred in order to prevent rainwater from entering the pit throughout the year in the root depth of the soil 0 30 cm the available npk contents were 53 12 mg kg 1 n 22 34 mg kg 1 p and 97 37 mg kg 1 k and the total npk contents were 1 31 g kg 1 n 0 83 g kg 1 p and 6 18 g kg 1 k the soil organic matter content was 11 97 g kg 1 and the ph was 7 59 the mean soil bulk density was 1 25 g cm 3 the irrigation water was provided underground 2 2 experimental design and treatments the experiment was conducted for three years october 2015 to june 2018 winter wheat cultivar xinong 979 was sown with an interrow spacing of 20 cm in early october and harvested in mid june during the next year artificial soil preparation tillage film mulching and fertilizer application were conducted on october 1 during each year fertilizer was applied at 225 kg ha 1 n 75 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 150 kg ha 1 k2o wheat was sown at a rate of 2 25 million seeds ha 1 the soil moisture content before sowing in the root layer 0 200 cm was adjusted to 400 mm trials were performed under three simulated precipitation levels comprising heavy rainfall at 275 mm p1 normal rainfall at 200 mm p2 and light rainfall at 125 mm p3 which were set according to previous precipitation data collected in yangling during the wheat growing period from 1966 2014 table 1 liu et al 2019 with two supplemental irrigation models for rf and tf three total amounts of simulated rainfall comprising 125 200 and 275 mm corresponding to light 1 moderate 2 and heavy 3 simulated rainfall levels respectively were applied as described in a previous study ali et al 2018a for rf system a ridge height of 15 cm was used with a furrow to ridge width ratio of 60 40 cm a plastic film was used to cover all the ridges with the edges buried at a depth of 4 5 cm in the soil four rows of wheat were sown in the furrows fig 1 each supplemental irrigation model had four supplemental irrigation levels comprising 150 mm 75 mm 37 5 mm and 0 mm where half of the supplemental irrigation was supplied in the wintering stage and the other half in the jointing stage in order to accurately control the amounts of rainfall and irrigation each pit was equipped with an irrigation control system fig 2 the simulated precipitation was also controlled by this system to ensure that the simulated rainfall and irrigation were provided in a timely and uniform manner in total 24 treatments were tested in the experiment where each was repeated three times and the designated codes for the treatments are shown in table 2 2 3 measurements soil respiration was recorded automated using a portable li cor system li 8100 nebraska usa with a closed chamber and polyvinyl chloride pvc collars internal diameter 20 3 cm outer diameter 21 34 cm and height 11 43 cm the pvc collars were inserted in the soil before sowing two collars were randomly placed between wheat rows in each plot for tf for rf 2 5 of the collar was on the ridge and 3 5 in the furrow gao et al 2014 measurements were recorded once every 10 days after sowing das and also in the event of rainfall or irrigation the measurements were collected between 8 30am 11 30am buchmann 2000 the soil temperature 5 cm layer c wei yu et al 2016 and soil moisture 60 cm layer around the collar were acquired simultaneously with a digital temperature sensor and tdr portable soil moisture velocimeter the soil water contents were corrected using the drying method we determined the soil temperature moisture and respiration characteristics in the following seven wheat growth stages seedling stage 30 das overwintering stage 60 das turning green stage 90 das jointing stage 120 das flowering stage 150 das grain filling stage 180 das and maturing stage 210 das the soil respiration rate temperature and moisture determined for each treatment in each stage were the averages based on all of the values observed during that period the average soil respiration rate temperature and moisture for each treatment were the average values based on all of the observed values in the wheat growing season 2 4 statistical analyses the path analysis method was employed to assess the relationships between y soil respiration with x1 soil temperature and x2 soil water content the relationships between y and xi are shown in table 6 in table 6 the direct path coefficient of xi with respect to y is expressed by bi and the indirect path coefficient between xi is denoted by rij bi other factors that affect y are represented in terms of e thus the path chain for path analysis is r i y b j i 1 r i j b j r i 2 b j r j y where r i y is the coefficient of determination for xi relative to y and r i 2 is the direct coefficient of determination for xi relative to y the effects of the soil temperature and soil moisture on soil respiration were analyzed using excel 2010 data analyses and graph preparation were conducted using excel 2010 spss 18 0 and origin 2019 duncan s multiple range test was conducted with analysis of variance path analysis was performed with spss 18 0 3 results 3 1 response of soil respiration to different amount of supplemental irrigation under tf and rf systems the measurements obtained in three consecutive years showed that the soil respiration rate decreased initially in each treatment before increasing and then decreasing during the winter wheat growth period figs 3 5 the soil respiration rate decreased from the winter wheat seedling stage 30 das until the overwintering stage 90 das as the temperature decreased and the lowest value occurred in the overwintering stage the soil respiration rate increased gradually as the air temperature increased and peaked in the jointing stage 150 das before decreasing in each treatment under rainfall at 275 mm and the same amount of supplemental irrigation compared with the tf the soil respiration rates under rf increased by 9 95 17 67 p 0 05 but the differences were not significant fig 3 however the soil respiration rates under treatments p1r150 p1r75 p1r37 5 and p1t150 were significantly higher than those with the other treatments although the differences between these four treatments were not significant under conditions with 200 mm rainfall in the winter wheat growth period compared with tf the soil respiration rates under rf increased by 12 22 27 64 p 0 05 but there were no significant differences between the treatments fig 4 however the soil respiration rates under treatments p1r150 p1r75 p1r37 5 p1t150 and p1t75 were significantly higher than those with the other treatments although there were no significant differences among these five treatments under conditions with 125 mm rainfall fig 4 compared with tf the soil respiration rates under rf increased by 5 31 with irrigation at 150 mm to 23 38 with irrigation at 0 mm the increases in the soil respiration rate were small as the amount of irrigation increased the differences were significant among these treatments except for the treatments with irrigation at 150 mm table 3 3 2 response of soil respiration to soil temperature under tf and rf fig 6 shows that the soil temperature decreased initially in each treatment but then increased under precipitation at 275 200 and 125 mm where the lowest value occurred about 90 das overwintering stage the peak occurred after about 210 das grain filling stage under the same rainfall amount the average soil temperature was slightly higher with rf than tf when the amount of supplemental irrigation was the same under the same amount of supplemental irrigation as the rainfall decreased the effect of rf on the soil temperature increased compared with that of tf soil temperature is the key factor that affects soil respiration the relationship between the soil temperature and soil respiration is not clear lin et al 2011 so we fitted models with linear r a bt logarithmic r logat and exponential r aebt functions to the relationship between the soil respiration rate r and soil temperature t under different supplemental irrigation treatments the results showed that the exponential equation r aebt obtained the best fit with the data according to correlation analysis between soil respiration and temperature table 4 the soil respiration rates under the rf and tf treatments had highly significant positive correlations with soil temperature under different rainfall and irrigation amounts p 0 01 3 3 response of soil respiration to soil water content under tf and rf the soil water contents were the same under the different treatments during the winter wheat growth period fig 7 where the lowest and highest values occurred after 90 das overwintering stage and 210 das maturing stage respectively in the seedling stage there were no significant differences in the soil water contents among the treatments from the seedling stage to the overwintering stage differences gradually emerged among the treatments according to the amount of precipitation the soil water contents were lowest in the overwintering stage after the overwintering stage the soil water content increased gradually in each treatment with the amounts of rainfall and supplemental irrigation the relationship between the soil water content and soil respiration is not uniform liu et al 2014 therefore we fitted linear r a bw logarithmic r logaw and exponential r aebw functions to the relationships between the soil respiration rate r and soil water content w under different supplemental irrigation treatments where the linear function r a bw obtained the best fit according to correlation analysis between the soil respiration and soil water contents table 5 with different amounts of rainfall and irrigation we determined significant positive correlations between the soil respiration rate and soil moisture content under rf and tf p 0 05 in addition under the same supplementary irrigation mode the correlation between the soil respiration rate and soil moisture content became stronger as the amount of supplementary irrigation decreased table 5 3 4 synergistic effects of hydrothermal conditions on soil respiration under tf and rf the correlation coefficients for the soil water content relative to soil respiration was smaller than that relative to temperature but the soil water content affected the soil respiration rate via the soil temperature path analysis showed that under rainfall at 275 mm if we consider p1t150 as an example table 6 then the direct coefficient of determination for temperature versus the soil respiration rate was 0 8170 where this positive correlation indicates that the soil respiration rate increased by 0 8170 units for every unit increase in the temperature however there was a small negative indirect effect on the soil respiration rate via the soil water content where the indirect coefficient of determination was 0 1650 and the comprehensive coefficient of determination for the soil temperature and soil respiration was 0 5639 thereby indicating a significant positive correlation the direct coefficient of determination for the soil water content relative to the soil respiration rate was 0 1980 and thus it had a small negative indirect effect on the soil respiration rate via the change in temperature thus there was an obvious interaction between the soil water content and temperature which together affected the soil respiration rate furthermore the coefficients of determination for the soil temperature relative to the soil respiration were greater than those for the soil water content tables 6 7 and 8 4 discussion many factors can affect soil respiration such as different farming fertilization and irrigation methods guan 2018 in the present study the average soil respiration rate was higher with rf than tf under the same amounts of rainfall and irrigation possibly because the soil temperature was relatively higher with rf the higher soil temperature enhanced the increase in the soil respiration rate as also shown by shiqing et al 2003 however in the years with high and normal rainfall we found that rf did not significantly increase the soil respiration rate possibly because rf increased the soil water content as well as increasing the soil temperature in the high rainfall year water was not the main factor that affected soil respiration irrigation increases the soil water content but it also makes the soil more anaerobic thus when the amount of irrigation is excessively large the activities of microbes are reduced and the soil respiration rate is decreased as a consequence jing 2014 liu et al 2017 in the year with low rainfall the soil respiration rate with rf under the same amount of irrigation was significantly higher compared with tf possibly because of the increased soil water content in all of the wheat growth stages li et al 2016 in addition improved water conditions can increase the activity and quantity of soil microorganisms thereby enhancing heterotrophic respiration wei and zhang 2014 soil respiration is regulated by various factors and previous studies have shown that the soil temperature and soil moisture contents are the main factors that affect soil respiration qi and xu 2001 buchmann 2000 thus in order to explore the causes associated with the differences in soil respiration under rf and tf we determined the soil moisture content and soil temperature under different treatments in the present study the relationship between the soil respiration rate and soil temperature was fitted using linear exponential and binomial equations and the exponential equation r aebt obtained the best fit as also shown in previous studies curiel et al 2010 wang et al 2010 wildung et al 1975 the fitted results showed that there were significant positive correlations between the soil respiration rate and soil temperature in the high rainfall year 275 mm normal rainfall year 200 mm and low rainfall year 125 under both rf and tf similar results were also obtained in previous studies zhang et al 2016 rowlings et al 2012 wang et al 2018 schaufler et al 2010 in addition many activities of plants and microorganisms require the participation of water which is a very important environmental factor ali et al 2018a however studies have shown that the changes in the soil water content are not consistent with changes in the soil respiration rate and that the correlation coefficient between them is low indeed the effect of the water content on soil respiration is not significant mancinelli et al 2015 zornoza et al 2016 in the present study we fitted the relationship between the soil moisture content and soil respiration to establish the following equations r 0 2375 w 0 91 r2 0 167 w 9 37 18 68 when the amounts of rainfall were 275 200 and 125 mm during the growth period the mean correlation r2 value between the soil water content and soil respiration rate with rf and tf under different amounts of irrigation was 0 167 p 0 001 similar results were obtained in previous studies jiang et al 2009 shi and petra 2014 unger et al 2010 however davidson et al 2000 determined a negative correlation between the soil moisture and soil respiration rate during some months in a forest possibly due to the soil moisture content exceeding the threshold value in a month with heavy rainfall by contrast the soil moisture contents in the present study were 9 37 18 68 and they did not exceed the threshold value similarly xu and qi 2001 found that when the soil water content was 19 the soil moisture and soil respiration rate had a highly significant positive correlation whereas the correlation was highly significantly negative when the soil water content was 19 path analysis was conducted in the present study in order to more accurately explore the effects of the soil moisture and soil temperature on soil respiration as well as their synergistic effect dong et al 2019 thus we determined the direct and indirect effects of the soil temperature and water contents on soil respiration the results showed that the direct coefficient of determination for the effect of the soil water content on soil respiration increased as the amounts of rainfall and irrigation decreased and that for the effect of the soil temperature on soil respiration increased possibly because the soil water content was sufficient in the high rainfall year 275 mm so water was not a limiting factor and the soil respiration was more strongly correlated with the temperature zhang et al 2016 however soil water shortages occurred in the years with normal rainfall 200 mm and low rainfall 125 mm and thus the soil respiration was affected greatly by the soil moisture content conant et al 2000 path analysis also showed that the soil temperature and soil water contents had indirect effects on soil respiration as well as direct effects in particular rainfall and rf with supplementary irrigation changed the soil temperature and water contents and both affected soil respiration as also shown in a previous study gao et al 2013 5 conclusions 1 the soil temperature and soil water content had a synergistic effect on the soil respiration rate and the highest coefficient of determination was 87 84 2 in the year with high rainfall during the growth period the soil respiration rates were significantly higher under p1r150 p1r75 p1r37 5 and p1t150 compared with the other treatments in the normal rainfall year the soil respiration rates were significantly higher under p1r150 p1r75 p1r37 5 p1t150 and p1t75 compared with the other treatments but there were no significant differences among these five treatments therefore in order to reduce the usage of water and ensure that co2 emissions are not increased the p1r75 and p2r150 treatments are suitable ecologically friendly supplementary irrigation methods for semiarid areas in the present study during the winter wheat growth period in the year with low rainfall the soil respiration rate with the same amount of irrigation was significantly higher under rf 9 00 23 38 higher than tf and thus the p3r150 treatment is recommended in low rainfall years declaration of competing interest we declare that we do not have any commercial or associative interest that represents a conflict of interest in connection with the work submitted acknowledgments this study was supported by the program of national natural science foundation of china no 41671226 and 31601257

in terms of e thus the path chain for path analysis is r i y b j i 1 r i j b j r i 2 b j r j y where r i y is the coefficient of determination for xi relative to y and r i 2 is the direct coefficient of determination for xi relative to y the effects of the soil temperature and soil moisture on soil respiration were analyzed using excel 2010 data analyses and graph preparation were conducted using excel 2010 spss 18 0 and origin 2019 duncan s multiple range test was conducted with analysis of variance path analysis was performed with spss 18 0 3 results 3 1 response of soil respiration to different amount of supplemental irrigation under tf and rf systems the measurements obtained in three consecutive years showed that the soil respiration rate decreased initially in each treatment before increasing and then decreasing during the winter wheat growth period figs 3 5 the soil respiration rate decreased from the winter wheat seedling stage 30 das until the overwintering stage 90 das as the temperature decreased and the lowest value occurred in the overwintering stage the soil respiration rate increased gradually as the air temperature increased and peaked in the jointing stage 150 das before decreasing in each treatment under rainfall at 275 mm and the same amount of supplemental irrigation compared with the tf the soil respiration rates under rf increased by 9 95 17 67 p 0 05 but the differences were not significant fig 3 however the soil respiration rates under treatments p1r150 p1r75 p1r37 5 and p1t150 were significantly higher than those with the other treatments although the differences between these four treatments were not significant under conditions with 200 mm rainfall in the winter wheat growth period compared with tf the soil respiration rates under rf increased by 12 22 27 64 p 0 05 but there were no significant differences between the treatments fig 4 however the soil respiration rates under treatments p1r150 p1r75 p1r37 5 p1t150 and p1t75 were significantly higher than those with the other treatments although there were no significant differences among these five treatments under conditions with 125 mm rainfall fig 4 compared with tf the soil respiration rates under rf increased by 5 31 with irrigation at 150 mm to 23 38 with irrigation at 0 mm the increases in the soil respiration rate were small as the amount of irrigation increased the differences were significant among these treatments except for the treatments with irrigation at 150 mm table 3 3 2 response of soil respiration to soil temperature under tf and rf fig 6 shows that the soil temperature decreased initially in each treatment but then increased under precipitation at 275 200 and 125 mm where the lowest value occurred about 90 das overwintering stage the peak occurred after about 210 das grain filling stage under the same rainfall amount the average soil temperature was slightly higher with rf than tf when the amount of supplemental irrigation was the same under the same amount of supplemental irrigation as the rainfall decreased the effect of rf on the soil temperature increased compared with that of tf soil temperature is the key factor that affects soil respiration the relationship between the soil temperature and soil respiration is not clear lin et al 2011 so we fitted models with linear r a bt logarithmic r logat and exponential r aebt functions to the relationship between the soil respiration rate r and soil temperature t under different supplemental irrigation treatments the results showed that the exponential equation r aebt obtained the best fit with the data according to correlation analysis between soil respiration and temperature table 4 the soil respiration rates under the rf and tf treatments had highly significant positive correlations with soil temperature under different rainfall and irrigation amounts p 0 01 3 3 response of soil respiration to soil water content under tf and rf the soil water contents were the same under the different treatments during the winter wheat growth period fig 7 where the lowest and highest values occurred after 90 das overwintering stage and 210 das maturing stage respectively in the seedling stage there were no significant differences in the soil water contents among the treatments from the seedling stage to the overwintering stage differences gradually emerged among the treatments according to the amount of precipitation the soil water contents were lowest in the overwintering stage after the overwintering stage the soil water content increased gradually in each treatment with the amounts of rainfall and supplemental irrigation the relationship between the soil water content and soil respiration is not uniform liu et al 2014 therefore we fitted linear r a bw logarithmic r logaw and exponential r aebw functions to the relationships between the soil respiration rate r and soil water content w under different supplemental irrigation treatments where the linear function r a bw obtained the best fit according to correlation analysis between the soil respiration and soil water contents table 5 with different amounts of rainfall and irrigation we determined significant positive correlations between the soil respiration rate and soil moisture content under rf and tf p 0 05 in addition under the same supplementary irrigation mode the correlation between the soil respiration rate and soil moisture content became stronger as the amount of supplementary irrigation decreased table 5 3 4 synergistic effects of hydrothermal conditions on soil respiration under tf and rf the correlation coefficients for the soil water content relative to soil respiration was smaller than that relative to temperature but the soil water content affected the soil respiration rate via the soil temperature path analysis showed that under rainfall at 275 mm if we consider p1t150 as an example table 6 then the direct coefficient of determination for temperature versus the soil respiration rate was 0 8170 where this positive correlation indicates that the soil respiration rate increased by 0 8170 units for every unit increase in the temperature however there was a small negative indirect effect on the soil respiration rate via the soil water content where the indirect coefficient of determination was 0 1650 and the comprehensive coefficient of determination for the soil temperature and soil respiration was 0 5639 thereby indicating a significant positive correlation the direct coefficient of determination for the soil water content relative to the soil respiration rate was 0 1980 and thus it had a small negative indirect effect on the soil respiration rate via the change in temperature thus there was an obvious interaction between the soil water content and temperature which together affected the soil respiration rate furthermore the coefficients of determination for the soil temperature relative to the soil respiration were greater than those for the soil water content tables 6 7 and 8 4 discussion many factors can affect soil respiration such as different farming fertilization and irrigation methods guan 2018 in the present study the average soil respiration rate was higher with rf than tf under the same amounts of rainfall and irrigation possibly because the soil temperature was relatively higher with rf the higher soil temperature enhanced the increase in the soil respiration rate as also shown by shiqing et al 2003 however in the years with high and normal rainfall we found that rf did not significantly increase the soil respiration rate possibly because rf increased the soil water content as well as increasing the soil temperature in the high rainfall year water was not the main factor that affected soil respiration irrigation increases the soil water content but it also makes the soil more anaerobic thus when the amount of irrigation is excessively large the activities of microbes are reduced and the soil respiration rate is decreased as a consequence jing 2014 liu et al 2017 in the year with low rainfall the soil respiration rate with rf under the same amount of irrigation was significantly higher compared with tf possibly because of the increased soil water content in all of the wheat growth stages li et al 2016 in addition improved water conditions can increase the activity and quantity of soil microorganisms thereby enhancing heterotrophic respiration wei and zhang 2014 soil respiration is regulated by various factors and previous studies have shown that the soil temperature and soil moisture contents are the main factors that affect soil respiration qi and xu 2001 buchmann 2000 thus in order to explore the causes associated with the differences in soil respiration under rf and tf we determined the soil moisture content and soil temperature under different treatments in the present study the relationship between the soil respiration rate and soil temperature was fitted using linear exponential and binomial equations and the exponential equation r aebt obtained the best fit as also shown in previous studies curiel et al 2010 wang et al 2010 wildung et al 1975 the fitted results showed that there were significant positive correlations between the soil respiration rate and soil temperature in the high rainfall year 275 mm normal rainfall year 200 mm and low rainfall year 125 under both rf and tf similar results were also obtained in previous studies zhang et al 2016 rowlings et al 2012 wang et al 2018 schaufler et al 2010 in addition many activities of plants and microorganisms require the participation of water which is a very important environmental factor ali et al 2018a however studies have shown that the changes in the soil water content are not consistent with changes in the soil respiration rate and that the correlation coefficient between them is low indeed the effect of the water content on soil respiration is not significant mancinelli et al 2015 zornoza et al 2016 in the present study we fitted the relationship between the soil moisture content and soil respiration to establish the following equations r 0 2375 w 0 91 r2 0 167 w 9 37 18 68 when the amounts of rainfall were 275 200 and 125 mm during the growth period the mean correlation r2 value between the soil water content and soil respiration rate with rf and tf under different amounts of irrigation was 0 167 p 0 001 similar results were obtained in previous studies jiang et al 2009 shi and petra 2014 unger et al 2010 however davidson et al 2000 determined a negative correlation between the soil moisture and soil respiration rate during some months in a forest possibly due to the soil moisture content exceeding the threshold value in a month with heavy rainfall by contrast the soil moisture contents in the present study were 9 37 18 68 and they did not exceed the threshold value similarly xu and qi 2001 found that when the soil water content was 19 the soil moisture and soil respiration rate had a highly significant positive correlation whereas the correlation was highly significantly negative when the soil water content was 19 path analysis was conducted in the present study in order to more accurately explore the effects of the soil moisture and soil temperature on soil respiration as well as their synergistic effect dong et al 2019 thus we determined the direct and indirect effects of the soil temperature and water contents on soil respiration the results showed that the direct coefficient of determination for the effect of the soil water content on soil respiration increased as the amounts of rainfall and irrigation decreased and that for the effect of the soil temperature on soil respiration increased possibly because the soil water content was sufficient in the high rainfall year 275 mm so water was not a limiting factor and the soil respiration was more strongly correlated with the temperature zhang et al 2016 however soil water shortages occurred in the years with normal rainfall 200 mm and low rainfall 125 mm and thus the soil respiration was affected greatly by the soil moisture content conant et al 2000 path analysis also showed that the soil temperature and soil water contents had indirect effects on soil respiration as well as direct effects in particular rainfall and rf with supplementary irrigation changed the soil temperature and water contents and both affected soil respiration as also shown in a previous study gao et al 2013 5 conclusions 1 the soil temperature and soil water content had a synergistic effect on the soil respiration rate and the highest coefficient of determination was 87 84 2 in the year with high rainfall during the growth period the soil respiration rates were significantly higher under p1r150 p1r75 p1r37 5 and p1t150 compared with the other treatments in the normal rainfall year the soil respiration rates were significantly higher under p1r150 p1r75 p1r37 5 p1t150 and p1t75 compared with the other treatments but there were no significant differences among these five treatments therefore in order to reduce the usage of water and ensure that co2 emissions are not increased the p1r75 and p2r150 treatments are suitable ecologically friendly supplementary irrigation methods for semiarid areas in the present study during the winter wheat growth period in the year with low rainfall the soil respiration rate with the same amount of irrigation was significantly higher under rf 9 00 23 38 higher than tf and thus the p3r150 treatment is recommended in low rainfall years declaration of competing interest we declare that we do not have any commercial or associative interest that

10576,agriculture is the basic unit that safeguards food security in the world and is also the sector that uses the largest amount of water in economic activities in agriculture vigorously promoting high efficiency water conservation in agriculture is regarded as the most important way to solve the water shortage however many examples have shown that increases in irrigation efficiency may increase water consumption in a manner similar to that of the jevon s paradox during the energy saving technology progress the rebound effect has a substantial impact on the effectiveness of water conservation policies it is of substantial value to understand the rebound effect of irrigation water to effectively conserve agricultural water consumption and to reveal and solve the water conservation dilemma in the dry areas an empirical case study is presented based on the largest water conservation irrigation area in the tianshan region northwest china an arid area to test the rebound effect on the water conservation efforts in terms of its blue water footprint which is also designated irrigation water consumption irrigation technology in this region has increased so that more than 47 of the agricultural area utilizes high efficiency drip irrigation technology since the adoption of modern water conservation technologies in 1996 while flooding was the only type of irrigation previously used in this area the results illustrate that since the implementation of high efficiency water conservation irrigation in 1996 the agricultural blue water footprint has continued to rise and the increase in the southern foothill referred to as the south is greater than that in the northern foothill referred to as the north of the tianshan mountains the rebound effect for agricultural water consumption totaled 115 in the tianshan region during the last 20 years showing a backfire phenomenon it differs substantially in the southern and northern parts of the tianshan region totaling approximately 166 in the southern part and 83 in the northern part the high efficiency water conservation and conservation technologies characterized by drip irrigation systems since 1996 resulted in a significant improvement in productivity and thus economic gain while the water consumption per unit area shows no significant decrease the differences in agricultural water consumption can be related to four main factors i the scale of high efficiency water saving ii the change of cultivated land area iii variation in planting structure and iv the increase of average yield per ha this study found negative correlations between high efficiency water conservation and moderate intensity of agricultural water consumption the expansion of the total cultivated land area the continuous increase in the proportion planted to economic crops and the average yield per ha undoubtedly increased agricultural water consumption this study concludes that the primary pathways for achieving the resource based concept of water conservation are to continue to promote more efficient or water conservation irrigation technologies engineering aspects jointly consider with water and land allocation management aspects adjust the planting structure policy guidance aspects and the appropriate pursuit of yield per unit area agricultural technology aspects keywords agricultural water consumption jevons paradox rebound effects agricultural blue water footprint tianshan region 1 introduction water scarcity is a global problem kang and ma 1999 sears et al 2018 and agriculture is the industry that uses the most water and has the greatest potential for water saving kang and xu 2001 in the previous more than half a century some countries and regions had adopted various water saving measures to alleviate the water shortage in agriculture and improve the utilization efficiency of irrigation water incidentally improve water production efficiency and increase the economic benefits of water users song et al 2000 haida et al 2019 qin et al 2018 al ghobari and dewidar 2018 countries such as israel saudi arabia and oman have small irrigation scales a shortage of water resources and strong economic strength and most of them implement technological strategies based on spray drip irrigation song et al 2000 lamm et al 2018 schaible and aillery 2017 cai et al 2017 li 1999 egypt india pakistan and other countries with large irrigation areas primarily surface water irrigation and limited economic capacity primarily rely on irrigation district renovation and the development of surface irrigation kang and ma 1999 the united states the former soviet union and other countries with large irrigated areas and strong economic and technological strengths focus on transforming the original ground irrigation system vigorously developing drip irrigation and combining agricultural measures and management measures to embark on the comprehensive development of water saving and efficient agriculture li 1999 zhao 2000 kang and ma 1999 sweden the united kingdom austria germany france and other countries with mild climates a developed economy and a relatively high labor force prefer sprinkler irrigation technology with good automation performance that saves labor and conserves water and the sprinkler irrigation area accounts for approximately 90 100 of the total irrigated area song et al 2000 china is a traditional agricultural country in 2015 agricultural water accounted for 63 1 of the total water use in the country zhang 2017 far higher than the 50 level of the developed countries zhang et al 2001 to greatly improve the efficiency of water use the central government has arranged approximately 5 billion loans each year since 1996 which are specifically used to support the development of agricultural infrastructures such as water saving irrigation and well drilling xue et al 2018 during the ninth five year plan 1996 2000 period china focused on promoting agricultural water conservation and agricultural production in 300 counties to impel the nationwide spread of water saving irrigation the efficient water saving achievements are remarkable the average water consumption per ha is significantly reduced and water productivity is significantly improved the purpose of improving agricultural irrigation efficiency is to allow water saved from the agricultural sector to be distributed to other sectors such as cities industries or the environment while ensuring food safety however in the past few decades the implementation of these policies showed that irrigation efficiency has increased significantly while the reduction in irrigation water has not been significant especially in areas where water resources are rarer than land resources efficient irrigation technology will result in less water for the same output and farmers will be more inclined to expand irrigated areas to increase agricultural output and economic income which will result in no reduction in total agricultural water use and agricultural water consumption will even continue to increase ward and pulido velazquez 2008 many scholars have also observed that the adjustment of the water use behavior of irrigation technology has resulted in an increase in the demand for irrigation water and defined the phenomenon that the water saving effect of this high efficiency irrigation technology is partially offset by new water use as the rebound effect or jevons paradox whittlesey 2003 contor and taylor 2013 li and zhao 2016 the rebound effect was originally proposed by jevons and it was observed that a more efficient steam engine reduced coal consumption while also reducing coal prices which in turn increased the demand for coal jevons paradox jevons 1866 khazzoom 1980 and brookes 1990 proposed the concept of the rebound effect to describe this phenomenon arguing that increases in energy efficiency lead to economic growth which in turn increases energy consumption this concept has become known as the khazzoom brookes hypothesis later the rebound effect was also introduced into the water resources sector which is the irrigation water use or water consumption rebound effect the rebound of agricultural water saving is similar to the energy rebound but there are still differences in the perception of the agricultural water saving rebound effect one view emphasizes that the water saving effect of high efficiency irrigation technology is partially offset by new water use or water consumption for example tong et al 2014 described that technological progress will cause a rebound in agricultural water use or water consumption when studying china s water use efficiency and song et al 2017 used the macroeconomic indicators such as water and water productivity to study the rebound of irrigation water in various provinces in china another view is that irrigation technology improvements increase rather than reduce the total water use or water consumption phenomenon known as the rebound effect or jevons paradox song et al 2017 defining the agricultural water saving rebound effect helps to clarify the connotation of these two viewpoints this study considers that the first viewpoint contains a broader scope and the second viewpoint is an extreme performance of the first viewpoint this study uses the first view that the water saving effect of high efficiency irrigation technology is partially offset by new water use or water consumption which constitutes a rebound effect the united nations environment program and relevant eu reports have warned of the existence of agricultural water saving rebound effects fao 2011 mcglade et al 2012 scholars have long noted differences in the water saving potential at different scales chen et al 2013 however the literature on the rebound effect of agricultural water is a recent phenomenon berbel and mateos 2014 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 loch and adamson 2015 berbel et al 2014 song et al 2017 has summarized relevant literature on improving the water saving effect of irrigation technology in china and abroad analyzed the particularity and mechanism of the rebound effect of irrigation water reviewed the theoretical and empirical research progress of the rebound effect of irrigation water and then summed up the need to strengthen the research on the rebound effect of the agricultural water saving analysis grafton et al 2018 pointed out that the tendency of countries to adopt policies to improve irrigation efficiency is often counterproductive improving irrigation efficiency but not necessarily saving water and facing the water saving dilemma of improving irrigation efficiency but rarely reducing water consumption liu et al 2018 used a structural decomposition analysis to explain rebound effect after the water saving efforts in the heihe river basin in arid northwest china and pointed out that the effect of water conservation was largely offset by the increase in virtual water in goods and services raeisi et al 2019 used deficit irrigation drip irrigation and greenhouse cultivation to study the water saving effects of different agricultural water saving measures and evaluate the adverse effects at present there are researches on irrigation water use rebound of large scale and irrigation water consumption rebound of small scale however there are few studies on large scale irrigation water consumption rebound the reason is that the influencing factors of canal water use coefficient and field water use coefficient are more complex and complicated it is difficult to accurately measure the actual water consumption of large scale crop irrigation therefore there are few examples of large scale agricultural water consumption rebound the tianshan area is the largest agricultural high efficiency water saving area of arid regions of china and its empirical research has both important academic value and substantial significance to guide practical production to reveal agricultural water saving dilemmas it should be noted that due to the incomplete measurement facilities the current agricultural water statistics could be quite different from the actual situation while water management not only needs to regulate water use but also needs to examine and regulate the water consumption that is ultimately effectively utilized the loss of water in the canal system and the amount of water lost in the field are also beneficial to the ecology of the arid zone the competition for water use between ecosystems and socio economic systems is ultimately a water consuming battle to this end this study uses an indicator that can be used to characterize authenticity the agricultural water footprint as agricultural water consumption data the water footprint refers to the total amount of water needed to produce goods and services the agricultural water footprint is calculated using crop and soil evaporation to calculate the actual water consumption during the crop growth cycle minus the return water and the amount of underground recharge hoekstra 2003 crop water footprint contains 3 aspects blue water footprint amount of blue water consumed in the production process including surface water such as rivers and lakes and groundwater green water footprint the portion of precipitation that is effectively absorbed by crops gray water footprint the amount of water needed to dilute pollutants such as pesticides and fertilizers to normal concentrations jin et al 2018 the actual consumption of irrigation water can be used as a blue water footprint representation of the material therefore studying the rebound of agricultural blue water use can also be understood as studying the real irrigation water consumption rebound of crops our objective is to reveal whether the agricultural irrigation water consumption rebounds and how large the rebound efficiency will be after the implementation of high efficiency water saving in tianshan area based on the blue water footprint of the planting industry and combines its spatial and temporal changes to analyze the regional differences and causes next it proposes rational suggestions for high efficiency water saving in the study area this study is of great significance to the scientific implementation of the water conservation policy of water saving priority spatial balance two handed force and system governance in the new era of china and it is of substantial significance for the research area to continuously and reasonably promote water conservation work and ensure regional water security and ecological security 2 selection of study districts the tianshan area 73 e 96 e 34 n 48 n is located in a typical arid area of northwest china since the area is far from the influence of the sea and surrounded by the mountains precipitation is rare the average annual precipitation is 154 5 mm which is only 23 8 of the national average some areas suffer from a severe water shortage because of strong evaporation and the difference in the distribution of water resources in the region the tianshan area is the largest commercial cotton production base and one of the most important grain production bases in china the xinjiang uygur autonomous region is located in this area the tianshan mountains are located in central xinjiang fig 1 which divides xinjiang into two parts the southern part is the tarim basin and the northern part is the junggar basin zhao 2012 the difference between the south and north is obvious the south has a warm temperate continental arid climate and the northern ridge has a temperate continental arid and semiarid climate xinjiang s aksu bayingolin hotan kashgar and kizilsu are located in the southern foothill while urumqi karamay changji bortala ili tarbagatai altay hami and turpan located in the northern foothill with the development of a social economy the contradiction between water shortage in the southern and northern foothills of the tianshan mountains referred to as the tianshan area has become increasingly prominent drought and water shortages have become the primary constraints of economic and social development in tianshan for a long time crops in the tianshan area were dominated by flood irrigation agricultural water use accounted for more than 90 of the total water consumption in the tianshan area vigorously developing water saving agriculture is one of the most important ways to solve the contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources to promote the sustainable utilization of water resources sustainable economic and social development and ecological environment improvement and is also a revolutionary measure to build modern agriculture li 1999 to achieve this goal the chinese government has vigorously promoted efficient water conservation in the regions of the tianshan mountains since 1999 by the end of the 10th five year plan period a field efficient water saving construction model based on drip irrigation technology under plastic mulch was basically formed in 2008 the government of the xinjiang autonomous region decided to vigorously develop high efficiency water saving technologies for agriculture and introduced a series of policies to support the efficient construction of water saving agriculture so that efficient water saving technologies could be quickly promoted in xinjiang after 2012 the construction of high efficiency and water saving agriculture continued to shift from scale expansion to quality improvement and efficiency and from high efficiency water conservation to efficient water use with the strong support of the central government the tianshan area had made substantial progress in the construction of farmland water conservancy which is primarily based on agricultural high efficiency water saving construction currently the tianshan area has become the most efficient water saving area in china and the world zhang 2018 however the jevons paradox which is similar to the progress of energy saving technology has resulted in an increasing number of questions on the practical effects of efficient water saving in recent years many people think that after the implementation of high efficiency water saving although the irrigation water utilization rate has been significantly improved the total water consumption does not necessarily decrease significantly and the total water consumption even continues to increase huai et al 2013 pfeiffer and lin 2014 as the region with the most water shortage and the largest agricultural water conservation area in china is there a similar or different jevon s paradox for its water conservation technology improvement based on this question this study utilizes the tianshan area as the research object and explores the rebound effect of agricultural water consumption 3 materials and methods 3 1 agricultural water footprint calculation method the agriculture studied in this paper is the planting industry in the narrow sense and the agricultural water footprint primarily used includes the crop water footprint forest fruit water footprint and does not include animal husbandry and fishery the calculation of the agricultural water footprint of the states cities in the tianshan area is based on the calculation method in the water footprint manual compiled by hoekstra 2009 using the cropwat software recommended by the food and agricultural organization fao this paper subsequently refers to the specific calculation steps of zhang 2018 on the water footprint 3 2 agricultural water consumption rebound effects referring to the energy rebound agricultural water consumption is similar to the calculation of the water rebound effect song et al 2017 defines the concept of the irrigation water rebound effect as follows 1 w r e e w s a w s e w s 100 r w e e w s 100 in the eq 1 w r e is the rebound of agricultural water e w s is the expected water saving after the irrigation technology is upgraded 100 million m³ a w s is the real water saving after the irrigation technology is upgraded 100 million m³ thus r w e e w s a w s is the amount of rebound water consumption 100 million m³ similar to the rebound in agricultural water use the correlation between agricultural water consumption and water productivity is 2 w y w p where w is the total agricultural water consumption 100 million m³ y is the total output of agriculture 100 million yuan wp is the productivity of agricultural water consumption at a macroeconomic level yuan m³ it is assumed that the agricultural water consumption agricultural output and water productivity in the t year are w t y t and w p t respectively according to formula 2 the change of agricultural water consumption from the year t 1 to t can be deconstructed as follows 3 δ w t w t w t 1 y t w p t y t 1 w p t 1 y t δ w p t w p t w p t 1 δ y t w p t 1 it can be seen from eq 5 that agricultural water consumption can be broken down into two parts part of the change in agricultural water consumption is caused by changes in agricultural water productivity y t δ w p t w p t w p t 1 the other part is the change caused by the growth of agricultural output δ y t w p t 1 therefore the change in water consumption caused by the agricultural output is not only the cause of technology increased efficiency etc but also the increase in input assuming that ρ is used to indicate the proportion of water consumption change caused by technological progress the rebound in water consumption of technological progress is r w e ρ δ y t w p t 1 according to the expected water saving amount e w s y t δ w p t w p t w p t 1 caused by the increase of agricultural water productivity the prediction method formula of the agricultural water consumption rebound effect can be obtained in t years is as follows 4 w r e ρ δ y t w p t 1 y t δ w p t w p t w p t 1 100 it can be seen from the calculation above that an important part of analyzing the rebound of agricultural water consumption is to accurately predict the rate of the contribution of technological progress to water consumption changes this estimate can be derived from the hicks neutral cobb douglas production function formula 5 5 y i t a i t w i t α x 1 i t β x 2 i t γ x n i t η a i e r t w i t α x 1 i t β x 2 i t γ x n i t η in the formula a i t a i e r t is the technical coefficient of hicks neutral r represents the technical weight y i t stands for output w i t is the input of water x 1 i t x 2 i t x n i t represents other input inputs such as labor and land α β γ η is the elasticity coefficient of the corresponding element input the natural logarithm of formula 5 results in the following 6 l n y i t l n a i r t α l n w i t β l n x 1 i t γ l n x 2 i t η l n x n i t by applying the input and output data of agricultural production in china we can estimate r r is the elastic coefficient of time t and the contribution rate of agricultural technology can be expressed as follows 7 ρ r g y in the formula g y is the agricultural output growth ratio which is equal to the ratio of the difference between agricultural output in the year t and t 1 to agricultural output in the year t 1 y t y t 1 y t 1 after determining ρ the agricultural water consumption rebound under the macroeconomic level can be measured using formula 4 it can be concluded from eq 1 agricultural water consumption rebound effect rebound water consumption expected water saving 100 currently the common rebound effect is divided into four categories as shown in table 1 the ideal state of water saving is zero rebound i e the rebound water consumption is 0 and it is expected that the water saving will be fully realized a rebound between 0 and 100 means that the expected water saving target is not fully met and some water saving is offset by new water use if the rebound water consumption is equal to the expected water saving i e a full rebound occurs and the rebound effect is equal to 100 if the rebound water consumption exceeds the expected water saving a rebound of more than 100 will occur also called the tempering phenomenon 3 3 influence factor analysis method by determining the influencing factors this study analyzes the correlation between the influencing factors water footprint and rebound effect by combining quantitative and qualitative methods 3 4 the dataset 3 4 1 socioeconomic data this paper utilizes the statistical yearbook data of the people s republic of china as the benchmark based on the data of the statistical yearbook of xinjiang uygur autonomous region and the statistical yearbook of xinjiang production and construction corps collects data on social economy population and agricultural production of 14 prefectures cities in the tianshan area from 1996 to 2015 3 4 2 agricultural water consumption data based on the data of the hydrological yearbook of the people s republic of china this study combines the water resources bulletin of xinjiang uygur autonomous region to understand the local water resources and their development and utilization simultaneously the hydro meteorological data http data cma cn of the study area were collected to calculate the agricultural water footprint agriculture water consumption and its changes 4 results 4 1 agricultural water footprint calculation results according to the agricultural blue water footprint estimation method in section 3 1 the crop blue water footprint of 14 prefectures in the tianshan area from 1996 to 2015 was measured the results of the calculations are shown in fig 2 fig 2 shows the interannual variations of the crop blue water footprint in the tianshan area the following is the crop blue water footprint of the southern foothills of tianshan area below the boundary line and the crop blue water footprint of the northern foothills of tianshan area above the boundary line it can be observed from fig 2 that the agricultural blue water footprint of the tianshan area has continued to rise since the implementation of high efficiency water conserving irrigation in 1996 and the increase in the southern foothill of the tianshan mountains is greater than that of the tianshan mountains among them the agricultural blue water footprints of 14 prefectures have increased to varying degrees and the trends of increase in aksu kashi tarbagatai and ili are palpable 4 2 agricultural water consumption rebound effect an observation of 3 2 indicates that the first step in studying the rebound of agricultural water consumption should be to calculate the r which is the proportion of agricultural technology this study divides the agricultural inputs affecting the agricultural output into technological progress and the inputs of land water labor mechanical and fertilizer according to the calculation principle of the hicks neutral cobb douglas production function using spss software spss inc chicago il usa fits the agricultural inputs and agricultural output data of 14 prefectures cities in the tianshan area from 1996 to 2015 it should be noted that to eliminate the impact of price fluctuations on agricultural output this study converts the agricultural added value of each year into a constant price of 1990 before the relevant analysis the calculation results are shown in table 2 in the table 1 shows the results of fitting the cross sectional data of 14 prefectures cities in 1996 2015 a total of 280 sets of data in the tianshan area using the hicks neutral cobb douglas production function and 2 is the fitting result of the cross sectional data of the other 13 prefectures cities except the karamay from 1996 to 2015 a total of 260 sets of data since karamay is an urban area in which development and processing are the primary industries and agriculture is limited the rural population is close to zero therefore this lack of a rural population substantially affects the overall data it can be observed that the determination coefficients of 1 and 2 are 0 965 and 0 957 0 95 respectively and the goodness of fit is higher but the p values of lnm and lnf in 1 are 0 119 and 0 631 0 05 respectively and the difference is not significant in 2 the p values are all less than 0 01 and pass the 99 significance test therefore the proportion of agricultural technology r is 0 030 the agricultural technology proportion r is substituted into the relevant calculation formula of 3 2 and the results of the 20 year cumulative agricultural water consumption rebound in the tianshan area are obtained in table 3 and fig 3 it can be observed in table 3 that in the 20 years of agricultural income in the study area the overall agricultural income in the tianshan area increased by 289 including 275 in the south and 301 in the north the growth rate of bayingolin 448 and aksu 293 in the southern foothill area was greater than that of the southern foothill and tianshan the growth rates of kashi 242 kizilsu 224 and hotan 119 were less than those of the southern foothill and tianshan where bayingolin was the maximum of the southern foothill and even the entire tianshan area and hotan was the minimum of the southern foothill area and even the tianshan area the growth levels of tarbagatai 360 urumqi 352 karamay 346 hami 313 bortala 307 and changji 305 in the northern area were greater than the overall growth ratio in the northern area and the tianshan area while those of ili 271 turpan 270 and altay 196 were less than the overall growth level of the northern area and the tianshan area in terms of water consumption in agriculture the agricultural water consumption in the study area increased by 133 as a whole with 196 in the south which is much higher than the 93 in the north most prefectures cities in the study area increased by 80 220 with the karamay area increasing by 660 in the past 20 years while a few of the prefectures increased by a relatively small amount such as turpan 33 and altay 21 an examination of the area of cultivated land indicated that the overall growth rate of the study area was 120 of which 150 in the south was much higher than the 93 in the north and most of the state city in the study area increased by 50 200 except for the increased area of the cultivated land in karamay 1012 and bayingolin 207 the increase in cultivated land in urumqi was only 19 in terms of expected water saving the estimated 20 year cumulative water saving in the tianshan area was 14 599 billion m3 of which the southern foot and the northern foot are 5 551 billion m3 and 9 123 billion m3 respectively most of the prefectures cities in the study area are expected to save less than 4 billion m3 with the exception of ili prefecture which was 16 87 billion m3 this is primarily because the ili area has a large area of cultivated land and ranks fourth in the entire tianshan area the first three are kashgar aksu and changji but its agricultural water productivity is the lowest in the entire tianshan area therefore ili s expected water saving is particularly sensitive to water productivity indicators resulting in a large cumulative expected water saving and rebound water saving data in terms of actual water saving the accumulated actual water saving in the tianshan area for 20 years was 2 159 million m3 i e the tianshan area not only failed to achieve water saving in 1996 2015 but the water consumption increased by 2 159 billion m3 the actual accumulated water saving in the south was 3 646 billion m3 and the water consumption continued unabated in the northern region it was 1 562 billion m3 i e the accumulated water saving in the northern area was 1 562 billion m3 from 1996 to 2015 although it was smaller than the expected water saving it achieved partial water saving the actual water saving capacity of the 14 prefectures cities of ciba kizilsu hami turpan altay changji karamay urumqi and ili in the study area was positive although all of these prefectures saved less water than expected they all achieved partial expected water savings however aksu hotan kashgar bortala and tarbagatai all had negative values indicating that their water consumption is increasing the rebound water consumption is the difference between the expected water saving and the actual water saving the water consumption of the research area in the past 20 years is 16 758 billion m3 including 9 197 billion m3 in the southern part and 7 561 billion m3 in the northern part the rebound in water consumption in most areas of the study area is less than 4 billion m3 it can be seen from table 3 and fig 3 that the overall rebound effect in the tianshan area is 114 79 100 and the overall appearance is a tempering phenomenon among them the rebound effect of the southern foothill of tianshan was 165 69 100 and there was a tempering phenomenon the rebound effect of the northern foothill of tianshan was 82 88 100 and there was a partial rebound phenomenon i e the expected water saving was not realized but the expected water saving effect was approximately 20 the rebound effects of hotan kashi and aksu in the southern area of the tianshan mountains were 281 254 and 192 respectively resulting in their ranking as the top three in the entire study area and there is a tempering phenomenon the rebound effects of bayingolin and kizilsu were 83 and 74 respectively and each achieved effective water savings of 17 and 26 respectively in the northern foothill of the tianshan mountains only the increase in agricultural water consumption in bortala and tarbagatai was greater than the expected water saving the rebound effect is 123 and 128 and there is a tempering phenomenon the rebound effect of ili and hami is 99 96 close to 100 and the water saving effect was not obvious the rebound effect in the other regions was between 50 and 80 and the water saving effect was more obvious among them turpan is the region with the least rebound effect 57 in the northern part and even the entire tianshan region and it achieved the expected water saving effect of 43 4 3 influencing factor analysis results the influencing factors of agricultural water consumption are various for example the increase of cultivated land area the construction of high efficiency and water saving the adjustment of planting structure and the change of yield per unit area some of these factors are quantifiable and some are unquantifiable this paper analyzes the factors affecting the change of agricultural water consumption in the study area including four factors the ratio of high efficiency and water saving the change of irrigated area the change of planting structure and the change of yield per unit area 4 3 1 efficient water conservation although agricultural water consumption in the study area has a rebound effect it cannot be denied that efficient water saving in agriculture improves the efficiency of agricultural water use while improving the quality of agricultural products since 1996 although the tianshan area as a whole has been vigorously building high efficiency water saving projects the high efficiency water saving area reached 3 02 million ha by 2015 however specific to each prefecture city the process of efficient water saving construction is uneven as shown in fig 4 fig 4 shows the current efficient water saving rate and the rebound of agricultural water consumption in the study area as can be observed in fig 4 there is a negative correlation between the rebound of agricultural water consumption and the efficient water saving rate especially south of the tianshan mountain area the agricultural water consumption of aksu hotan and kashgar in the south of the tianshan mountain rebounded to 192 281 and 254 respectively all higher than the average level of 115 in the tianshan region the efficient water saving rate of bayingolin was 70 which was at a higher level in the southern part of the tianshan mountain and the rebound coefficient of agricultural water consumption was 83 which is far less than the average level in the southern part of the tianshan mountain although the expected water saving was partially offset by the new water consumption the water saving effect of 17 was achieved the overall correlation of the northern foothill of the tianshan mountain is not very intuitive which may be related to the relatively special planting and economic structure of the northern foothill of the tianshan mountain such as bortala and urumqi bortala is the region with the largest change in planting structure in the study area from 1996 to 2015 the proportion of the cotton planting area in bortala changed from 34 75 in 1996 to 61 75 in 2014 and decreased to 52 47 in 2015 cotton is the crop with the highest water consumption per unit of crops in the study area which explains why bortala has a high water saving rate of 90 and the agricultural water consumption rebound coefficient is 123 100 urumqi is dominated by industry in 1996 2015 the area of cultivated land increased by merely 17 this is also the reason why urumqi s efficient water saving rate was not high but its agricultural water consumption rebounded the results of fitting the high efficiency irrigation water saving rate and agricultural water consumption rebound of the other 12 prefectures cities without considering the special conditions of bortala and urumqi fig 5 indicate that there is a moderately negative correlation between the high efficiency water saving rate and the agricultural water consumption rebound correlation coefficient is 0 59 and the elastic coefficient is 2 65 i e the higher the high water saving rate the lower the agricultural water consumption rebound 4 3 2 increase in the cultivated land area the area of cultivated land in the north and south of the tianshan mountains increased from 3037 thousand hectares in 1996 to 6695 thousand hectares in 2015 an increase of 121 the area of cultivated land is a key factor in the increase in agricultural water consumption the change of cultivated land area in 14 prefectures cities from 1996 to 2015 is shown in fig 6 kashgar aksu changji bayingolin tarbagatai ili hotan and bortala are eight areas where the area of cultivated land significantly increased the area of cultivated land in these areas has increased by 858 83 738 70 437 95 398 19 381 52 316 14 148 13 and 126 02 thousand hectares respectively among them the agricultural water consumption rebounds in these eight regions were 254 192 70 83 128 99 281 and 123 respectively more than half of the tempering reactions occurred and all of these states cities that have tempered phenomena in the entire study area although ili bayingolin and bortala have no tempered phenomenon they are close to 100 although the changji prefecture has a significant increase in irrigation area changji s efficient water saving rate was as high as 70 and therefore the rebound coefficient is small 70 from the perspective of large space the agricultural water consumption rebound and the changes in the cultivated land area in the north and south of the tianshan mountains in the past 20 years fig 7 are more obvious on a larger scale the area of cultivated land in the north and south of tianshan mountain grew continuously however the area of the cultivated land in the south of the tianshan mountain was consistently smaller than that in the north of the tianshan mountains from 1996 to 2005 after basically flattening in 2006 the area in the south grew faster the area of cultivated land in the south of tianshan mountain exceeds that in the north of tianshan mountain this can partly explain why the overall rebound effect of the southern foothills of tianshan mountain is higher than that of the northern foothill of tianshan mountain 4 3 3 increased proportion of high water consumption crops since 1996 the proportion of food crops in the tianshan region has continued to decline and the growing trend of economic crops has become increasingly apparent the ratio of the total grain crops to the economic crops planted in the tianshan area referred to as the grain and economic ratio typically decreased the process of the change of grain and economic ratio in 14 prefectures cities from 1996 to 2015 is shown in fig 8 most economic crops consume more water than food crops which has become a general consensus cao et al 2018 under the same conditions the smaller the grain to the economic ratio the more water is consumed fig 8 indicates that the grain and economic ratio of aksu bayingolin hotan kashgar hami and turpan decreased overall and half of the six prefectures cities had a tempering reaction to some extent the effect of the planting structure on the rebound of agricultural water consumption was confirmed most of the grain and economic ratio in the other regions showed a trend of decreasing first and then increasing but the overall grain and economic ratio typically decreased from the perspective of large space the grain and economic ratio in the tianshan area showed a trend of decreasing first and then decreasing while the southern area continuously declined and the northern area decreased first and then increased 4 3 4 increase in output per unit area the increase in yield per unit area indicates that the fruit of the crop stores more water and the water consumption of the crop agriculture increases the primary factors for increasing the crop yield per unit area include increasing the planting density improving crop varieties and changing water and fertilizer supply conditions during the 20 years from 1996 to 2015 the yield per unit area of crops in the tianshan region increased among them the yields of apples pears and beets in 2015 were 3 58 fold 3 86 fold and 2 87 fold greater than the yields in 1996 respectively and the yields of the other crops increased between 1 50 and 2 50 fold the increase in output per unit area also explains the increase in agricultural water consumption and the rebound in agricultural water consumption 5 discussion 1 after the implementation of high efficiency water conservation agricultural water consumption continues to increase but this does not mean that high efficiency water conservation is the cause of the rebound in agricultural water consumption on the contrary efficient water saving not only improves quality and efficiency but also helps to reduce agricultural water consumption rebound the low quality caused by unreasonable irrigation and its impact on the environment were the primary factors restricting the sustainable development of characteristic agriculture and the increase in the farmers income many regions still rely on water fertilizer and other resources to pursue high yield forming a vicious circle of high input high yield low quality low price low efficiency kang 2009 the drip irrigation under plastic mulch implemented in the tianshan area since 1996 is not only a water saving measure but also a technical platform to promote the coordination of water and fertilizer zhang 2018 regulating the flow of information in crops through precise and real time deficit irrigation so as to regulate the quality of crop output thus ensures a certain amount of output on the premise of using less water consumption and fertilizer to produce higher quality agricultural products finally a new agricultural mode with the goal of saving water high yield high quality high efficiency and environmental friendliness will be realized efficient water saving construction can improve the productivity of the use of water fig 9 although there are water productivity differences in the tianshan region the productivity of water in the 14 prefectural level cities in the tianshan region increased as a whole i e the utilization efficiency of the water continued to improve from 1996 to 2015 efficient water saving can improve crop quality it can be observed from the planting proportion in the tianshan area from 1996 to 2015 fig 10 that wheat is the primary grain crop in the research area and the planting proportion has fluctuated and decreased during the previous 20 years cotton is the cash crop that has the largest proportion of planting in the research area red jujube was the crop whose planting proportion changed the most in the study area this area increased from 0 08 in 1996 to 8 53 in 2013 and decreased to 7 4 in 2015 through the analysis of areas planted to wheat for more than 30 kizilsu ili cotton to more than 40 ask bayingolin bortala and red jujube to more than 20 hotan and hami it was observed that the water consumption per unit area of the typical crops is basically unchanged but the yield per unit area increases significantly fig 11 from the seven typical planting areas of these three crops the crop yield per unit area typically increased when the agricultural water consumption per unit area remained basically unchanged which proves that efficient water saving can improve crop quality 2 since the implementation of high efficiency water conservation in the tianshan area in 1996 the water consumption per unit area has not decreased significantly although water consumption in agriculture has not decreased as much as expected due to structural adjustment plastic mulch and water fertilizer integration the crop yield quality and water productivity and production efficiency significantly improved the increase in quality to increase the effect of the achievement was remarkable efficient water saving therefore is not the cause of agricultural rebound the increase in regional water consumption is mainly due to the failure to implement the concept of suitable water development kang 2009 grafton et al 2018 blindly opening the ground loch and adamson 2015 berbel et al 2014 graveline et al 2013 fishman et al 2015 zhu and li 2011 increasing the proportion of high yield water crops playán and mateos 2006 berbel et al 2014 lecina et al 2010 resulting in disorderly expansion of irrigation area and blind pursuit of unit area production dagnino and ward 2012 playán and mateos 2006 lecina et al 2010 to truly realize resource based water conservation on the one hand we must use engineering means to continue to promote the process of efficient agricultural water conservation on the other hand we must use non engineering means such as reducing the area of arable land adjusting the planting structure and moderately pursuing yield per unit area 1 the tianshan area should continue to promote the process of agricultural high efficiency water conservation construction china s 13th five year plan for the implementation of 100 million mu of high efficient water saving irrigation area clearly states that china will add 6 67 million ha of high efficiency water saving irrigation area during the 13th five year plan period of which an efficient water saving area with a focus on drip irrigation of 800 000 ha will be developed in the tianshan area china attaches great importance to high efficiency water saving irrigation which provides opportunities for agricultural water saving construction and development in the tianshan region if the tianshan area wants to reduce the rebound of agricultural water consumption and truly realize the resource based water conservation we should seize the opportunity to continuously promote the process of agricultural efficient water saving construction 2 the tianshan area should implement joint water and soil allocation to reduce the area of cultivated land in some areas the data have proven that there is a correlation between farmland and water conservation policies the increase in the area of cultivated land will promote the rebound of agricultural water consumption zhu and li 2011 to reduce the rebound of agricultural water consumption and result in increased coordination in the development of water resources the tianshan area needs to regard the arable land expansion restriction policy and the water saving technology promotion policy collectively referred to as water and soil policy as a group of related variables i e to promote the development of arable land suitable for water and implement the joint deployment of water and soil for areas such as aksu kashgar kizilsu and hetian in which the area of cultivated land is growing rapidly and water resources are lacking and not abundant on the one hand we will continue to promote the construction of water saving irrigation projects on the other hand we should rationally plan the agricultural layout according to the local water resources and limit the disorderly reclamation of the cultivated land for areas with increased cultivated land but slow progress in efficient water saving construction such as changji and bortala it is recommended to continue to promote the land reduction and water reduction policy to gradually solve the local water resources and ecological environmental protection predicament 3 the tianshan area can adjust the planting structure and reduce the proportion of high yield crops the planting structure is primarily affected by national policies market supply and demand while the tianshan area has always been a highly intensive area of grain and cotton competition and grain and fruit competition wang and xiao 2018 for a given arable land area when there is a larger proportion of economic crops and higher levels of agricultural water consumption the rebound of agricultural water consumption will be more obvious in the future it is necessary to guide farmers to adjust their planting structure and implement fallow farmland and encourage the development of modern agriculture with high yield high quality high efficiency and ecological security in accordance with the regulatory strategy of stabilizing grain adjusting cotton optimizing fruit and rejuvenating livestock which is the only way to realize food and ecological security in the tianshan area appropriate reduction of cotton planting area consolidation and improvement of production capacity in high quality and high yield areas can achieve water saving without reducing production or income at the same time the stable wheat planting area and the reasonable allocation of forest and grain intercropping will maximize water conservation and increase fruit and grain benefits in the tianshan area we should actively develop the planting of characteristic forests fruits and forages and encourage the planting of low water consuming crops such as alfalfa and silage maize which are drought tolerant and saline alkali tolerant zhang et al 2018 4 the tianshan area should appropriately pursue the output per unit area currently the quantitative analysis of the relationship between the yield per unit area and the blue water footprint is mostly present on the field scale and quantitative analysis on the regional scale is still rare however from the physiological response mechanism of crop water and practical experience in production it can be confirmed that the increase in output per unit area can lead to an increase in water consumption kang 2009 huai et al 2013 increases in yields can be achieved by appropriately increasing the density and improving the varieties grown however an inappropriate increase in planting density may reduce the quality of crops so the pursuit of yield per unit area should be moderate wang and xiao 2018 6 conclusions this paper quantitatively analyzes the rebound effect of agricultural water consumption in the tianshan area and analyzes the primary factors affecting the rebound effect data analysis has revealed that since the implementation of water saving measures such as high efficiency irrigation in 1996 the water consumption has not decreased as expected but has rebounded in fact the tianshan area presents the phenomenon that the water is more and more water poor the overall performance is a tempering phenomenon and the rebound effect of the southern foothill is higher than that of the northern foothill of the tianshan mountains efficient water saving construction is not the cause of the rebound of agricultural water consumption currently high efficiency water saving construction has played a role in improving quality and efficiency in the research area the primary reason for the rebound in agricultural water consumption in the study area is the large scale expansion of the irrigated area the change in the ratio of grain to economics in the planting structure primarily reduced and the increase in output per unit area it should be noted that drip irrigation is the primary form of water conserving irrigation in the research area in this paper while sprinkling irrigation and other agriculturally efficient water conserving methods are almost absent moreover agricultural water rights and water price systems in the research area have not yet been perfected therefore this study does not explore the differences between water conservation methods and the rebound effects under different agricultural water tariffs further research should refine the impact of agricultural water prices and different water conserving methods on agricultural water consumption rebound author contributions y w wrote the main manuscript text and prepared the figures a l supervised the study x d and l x advised the study design and performed part of data

10576,agriculture is the basic unit that safeguards food security in the world and is also the sector that uses the largest amount of water in economic activities in agriculture vigorously promoting high efficiency water conservation in agriculture is regarded as the most important way to solve the water shortage however many examples have shown that increases in irrigation efficiency may increase water consumption in a manner similar to that of the jevon s paradox during the energy saving technology progress the rebound effect has a substantial impact on the effectiveness of water conservation policies it is of substantial value to understand the rebound effect of irrigation water to effectively conserve agricultural water consumption and to reveal and solve the water conservation dilemma in the dry areas an empirical case study is presented based on the largest water conservation irrigation area in the tianshan region northwest china an arid area to test the rebound effect on the water conservation efforts in terms of its blue water footprint which is also designated irrigation water consumption irrigation technology in this region has increased so that more than 47 of the agricultural area utilizes high efficiency drip irrigation technology since the adoption of modern water conservation technologies in 1996 while flooding was the only type of irrigation previously used in this area the results illustrate that since the implementation of high efficiency water conservation irrigation in 1996 the agricultural blue water footprint has continued to rise and the increase in the southern foothill referred to as the south is greater than that in the northern foothill referred to as the north of the tianshan mountains the rebound effect for agricultural water consumption totaled 115 in the tianshan region during the last 20 years showing a backfire phenomenon it differs substantially in the southern and northern parts of the tianshan region totaling approximately 166 in the southern part and 83 in the northern part the high efficiency water conservation and conservation technologies characterized by drip irrigation systems since 1996 resulted in a significant improvement in productivity and thus economic gain while the water consumption per unit area shows no significant decrease the differences in agricultural water consumption can be related to four main factors i the scale of high efficiency water saving ii the change of cultivated land area iii variation in planting structure and iv the increase of average yield per ha this study found negative correlations between high efficiency water conservation and moderate intensity of agricultural water consumption the expansion of the total cultivated land area the continuous increase in the proportion planted to economic crops and the average yield per ha undoubtedly increased agricultural water consumption this study concludes that the primary pathways for achieving the resource based concept of water conservation are to continue to promote more efficient or water conservation irrigation technologies engineering aspects jointly consider with water and land allocation management aspects adjust the planting structure policy guidance aspects and the appropriate pursuit of yield per unit area agricultural technology aspects keywords agricultural water consumption jevons paradox rebound effects agricultural blue water footprint tianshan region 1 introduction water scarcity is a global problem kang and ma 1999 sears et al 2018 and agriculture is the industry that uses the most water and has the greatest potential for water saving kang and xu 2001 in the previous more than half a century some countries and regions had adopted various water saving measures to alleviate the water shortage in agriculture and improve the utilization efficiency of irrigation water incidentally improve water production efficiency and increase the economic benefits of water users song et al 2000 haida et al 2019 qin et al 2018 al ghobari and dewidar 2018 countries such as israel saudi arabia and oman have small irrigation scales a shortage of water resources and strong economic strength and most of them implement technological strategies based on spray drip irrigation song et al 2000 lamm et al 2018 schaible and aillery 2017 cai et al 2017 li 1999 egypt india pakistan and other countries with large irrigation areas primarily surface water irrigation and limited economic capacity primarily rely on irrigation district renovation and the development of surface irrigation kang and ma 1999 the united states the former soviet union and other countries with large irrigated areas and strong economic and technological strengths focus on transforming the original ground irrigation system vigorously developing drip irrigation and combining agricultural measures and management measures to embark on the comprehensive development of water saving and efficient agriculture li 1999 zhao 2000 kang and ma 1999 sweden the united kingdom austria germany france and other countries with mild climates a developed economy and a relatively high labor force prefer sprinkler irrigation technology with good automation performance that saves labor and conserves water and the sprinkler irrigation area accounts for approximately 90 100 of the total irrigated area song et al 2000 china is a traditional agricultural country in 2015 agricultural water accounted for 63 1 of the total water use in the country zhang 2017 far higher than the 50 level of the developed countries zhang et al 2001 to greatly improve the efficiency of water use the central government has arranged approximately 5 billion loans each year since 1996 which are specifically used to support the development of agricultural infrastructures such as water saving irrigation and well drilling xue et al 2018 during the ninth five year plan 1996 2000 period china focused on promoting agricultural water conservation and agricultural production in 300 counties to impel the nationwide spread of water saving irrigation the efficient water saving achievements are remarkable the average water consumption per ha is significantly reduced and water productivity is significantly improved the purpose of improving agricultural irrigation efficiency is to allow water saved from the agricultural sector to be distributed to other sectors such as cities industries or the environment while ensuring food safety however in the past few decades the implementation of these policies showed that irrigation efficiency has increased significantly while the reduction in irrigation water has not been significant especially in areas where water resources are rarer than land resources efficient irrigation technology will result in less water for the same output and farmers will be more inclined to expand irrigated areas to increase agricultural output and economic income which will result in no reduction in total agricultural water use and agricultural water consumption will even continue to increase ward and pulido velazquez 2008 many scholars have also observed that the adjustment of the water use behavior of irrigation technology has resulted in an increase in the demand for irrigation water and defined the phenomenon that the water saving effect of this high efficiency irrigation technology is partially offset by new water use as the rebound effect or jevons paradox whittlesey 2003 contor and taylor 2013 li and zhao 2016 the rebound effect was originally proposed by jevons and it was observed that a more efficient steam engine reduced coal consumption while also reducing coal prices which in turn increased the demand for coal jevons paradox jevons 1866 khazzoom 1980 and brookes 1990 proposed the concept of the rebound effect to describe this phenomenon arguing that increases in energy efficiency lead to economic growth which in turn increases energy consumption this concept has become known as the khazzoom brookes hypothesis later the rebound effect was also introduced into the water resources sector which is the irrigation water use or water consumption rebound effect the rebound of agricultural water saving is similar to the energy rebound but there are still differences in the perception of the agricultural water saving rebound effect one view emphasizes that the water saving effect of high efficiency irrigation technology is partially offset by new water use or water consumption for example tong et al 2014 described that technological progress will cause a rebound in agricultural water use or water consumption when studying china s water use efficiency and song et al 2017 used the macroeconomic indicators such as water and water productivity to study the rebound of irrigation water in various provinces in china another view is that irrigation technology improvements increase rather than reduce the total water use or water consumption phenomenon known as the rebound effect or jevons paradox song et al 2017 defining the agricultural water saving rebound effect helps to clarify the connotation of these two viewpoints this study considers that the first viewpoint contains a broader scope and the second viewpoint is an extreme performance of the first viewpoint this study uses the first view that the water saving effect of high efficiency irrigation technology is partially offset by new water use or water consumption which constitutes a rebound effect the united nations environment program and relevant eu reports have warned of the existence of agricultural water saving rebound effects fao 2011 mcglade et al 2012 scholars have long noted differences in the water saving potential at different scales chen et al 2013 however the literature on the rebound effect of agricultural water is a recent phenomenon berbel and mateos 2014 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 loch and adamson 2015 berbel et al 2014 song et al 2017 has summarized relevant literature on improving the water saving effect of irrigation technology in china and abroad analyzed the particularity and mechanism of the rebound effect of irrigation water reviewed the theoretical and empirical research progress of the rebound effect of irrigation water and then summed up the need to strengthen the research on the rebound effect of the agricultural water saving analysis grafton et al 2018 pointed out that the tendency of countries to adopt policies to improve irrigation efficiency is often counterproductive improving irrigation efficiency but not necessarily saving water and facing the water saving dilemma of improving irrigation efficiency but rarely reducing water consumption liu et al 2018 used a structural decomposition analysis to explain rebound effect after the water saving efforts in the heihe river basin in arid northwest china and pointed out that the effect of water conservation was largely offset by the increase in virtual water in goods and services raeisi et al 2019 used deficit irrigation drip irrigation and greenhouse cultivation to study the water saving effects of different agricultural water saving measures and evaluate the adverse effects at present there are researches on irrigation water use rebound of large scale and irrigation water consumption rebound of small scale however there are few studies on large scale irrigation water consumption rebound the reason is that the influencing factors of canal water use coefficient and field water use coefficient are more complex and complicated it is difficult to accurately measure the actual water consumption of large scale crop irrigation therefore there are few examples of large scale agricultural water consumption rebound the tianshan area is the largest agricultural high efficiency water saving area of arid regions of china and its empirical research has both important academic value and substantial significance to guide practical production to reveal agricultural water saving dilemmas it should be noted that due to the incomplete measurement facilities the current agricultural water statistics could be quite different from the actual situation while water management not only needs to regulate water use but also needs to examine and regulate the water consumption that is ultimately effectively utilized the loss of water in the canal system and the amount of water lost in the field are also beneficial to the ecology of the arid zone the competition for water use between ecosystems and socio economic systems is ultimately a water consuming battle to this end this study uses an indicator that can be used to characterize authenticity the agricultural water footprint as agricultural water consumption data the water footprint refers to the total amount of water needed to produce goods and services the agricultural water footprint is calculated using crop and soil evaporation to calculate the actual water consumption during the crop growth cycle minus the return water and the amount of underground recharge hoekstra 2003 crop water footprint contains 3 aspects blue water footprint amount of blue water consumed in the production process including surface water such as rivers and lakes and groundwater green water footprint the portion of precipitation that is effectively absorbed by crops gray water footprint the amount of water needed to dilute pollutants such as pesticides and fertilizers to normal concentrations jin et al 2018 the actual consumption of irrigation water can be used as a blue water footprint representation of the material therefore studying the rebound of agricultural blue water use can also be understood as studying the real irrigation water consumption rebound of crops our objective is to reveal whether the agricultural irrigation water consumption rebounds and how large the rebound efficiency will be after the implementation of high efficiency water saving in tianshan area based on the blue water footprint of the planting industry and combines its spatial and temporal changes to analyze the regional differences and causes next it proposes rational suggestions for high efficiency water saving in the study area this study is of great significance to the scientific implementation of the water conservation policy of water saving priority spatial balance two handed force and system governance in the new era of china and it is of substantial significance for the research area to continuously and reasonably promote water conservation work and ensure regional water security and ecological security 2 selection of study districts the tianshan area 73 e 96 e 34 n 48 n is located in a typical arid area of northwest china since the area is far from the influence of the sea and surrounded by the mountains precipitation is rare the average annual precipitation is 154 5 mm which is only 23 8 of the national average some areas suffer from a severe water shortage because of strong evaporation and the difference in the distribution of water resources in the region the tianshan area is the largest commercial cotton production base and one of the most important grain production bases in china the xinjiang uygur autonomous region is located in this area the tianshan mountains are located in central xinjiang fig 1 which divides xinjiang into two parts the southern part is the tarim basin and the northern part is the junggar basin zhao 2012 the difference between the south and north is obvious the south has a warm temperate continental arid climate and the northern ridge has a temperate continental arid and semiarid climate xinjiang s aksu bayingolin hotan kashgar and kizilsu are located in the southern foothill while urumqi karamay changji bortala ili tarbagatai altay hami and turpan located in the northern foothill with the development of a social economy the contradiction between water shortage in the southern and northern foothills of the tianshan mountains referred to as the tianshan area has become increasingly prominent drought and water shortages have become the primary constraints of economic and social development in tianshan for a long time crops in the tianshan area were dominated by flood irrigation agricultural water use accounted for more than 90 of the total water consumption in the tianshan area vigorously developing water saving agriculture is one of the most important ways to solve the contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources to promote the sustainable utilization of water resources sustainable economic and social development and ecological environment improvement and is also a revolutionary measure to build modern agriculture li 1999 to achieve this goal the chinese government has vigorously promoted efficient water conservation in the regions of the tianshan mountains since 1999 by the end of the 10th five year plan period a field efficient water saving construction model based on drip irrigation technology under plastic mulch was basically formed in 2008 the government of the xinjiang autonomous region decided to vigorously develop high efficiency water saving technologies for agriculture and introduced a series of policies to support the efficient construction of water saving agriculture so that efficient water saving technologies could be quickly promoted in xinjiang after 2012 the construction of high efficiency and water saving agriculture continued to shift from scale expansion to quality improvement and efficiency and from high efficiency water conservation to efficient water use with the strong support of the central government the tianshan area had made substantial progress in the construction of farmland water conservancy which is primarily based on agricultural high efficiency water saving construction currently the tianshan area has become the most efficient water saving area in china and the world zhang 2018 however the jevons paradox which is similar to the progress of energy saving technology has resulted in an increasing number of questions on the practical effects of efficient water saving in recent years many people think that after the implementation of high efficiency water saving although the irrigation water utilization rate has been significantly improved the total water consumption does not necessarily decrease significantly and the total water consumption even continues to increase huai et al 2013 pfeiffer and lin 2014 as the region with the most water shortage and the largest agricultural water conservation area in china is there a similar or different jevon s paradox for its water conservation technology improvement based on this question this study utilizes the tianshan area as the research object and explores the rebound effect of agricultural water consumption 3 materials and methods 3 1 agricultural water footprint calculation method the agriculture studied in this paper is the planting industry in the narrow sense and the agricultural water footprint primarily used includes the crop water footprint forest fruit water footprint and does not include animal husbandry and fishery the calculation of the agricultural water footprint of the states cities in the tianshan area is based on the calculation method in the water footprint manual compiled by hoekstra 2009 using the cropwat software recommended by the food and agricultural organization fao this paper subsequently refers to the specific calculation steps of zhang 2018 on the water footprint 3 2 agricultural water consumption rebound effects referring to the energy rebound agricultural water consumption is similar to the calculation of the water rebound effect song et al 2017 defines the concept of the irrigation water rebound effect as follows 1 w r e e w s a w s e w s 100 r w e e w s 100 in the eq 1 w r e is the rebound of agricultural water e w s is the expected water saving after the irrigation technology is upgraded 100 million m³ a w s is the real water saving after the irrigation technology is upgraded 100 million m³ thus r w e e w s a w s is the amount of rebound water consumption 100 million m³ similar to the rebound in agricultural water use the correlation between agricultural water consumption and water productivity is 2 w y w p where w is the total agricultural water consumption 100 million m³ y is the total output of agriculture 100 million yuan wp is the productivity of agricultural water consumption at a macroeconomic level yuan m³ it is assumed that the agricultural water consumption agricultural output and water productivity in the t year are w t y t and w p t respectively according to formula 2 the change of agricultural water consumption from the year t 1 to t can be deconstructed as follows 3 δ w t w t w t 1 y t w p t y t 1 w p t 1 y t δ w p t w p t w p t 1 δ y t w p t 1 it can be seen from eq 5 that agricultural water consumption can be broken down into two parts part of the change in agricultural water consumption is caused by changes in agricultural water productivity y t δ w p t w p t w p t 1 the other part is the change caused by the growth of agricultural output δ y t w p t 1 therefore the change in water consumption caused by the agricultural output is not only the cause of technology increased efficiency etc but also the increase in input assuming that ρ is used to indicate the proportion of water consumption change caused by technological progress the rebound in water consumption of technological progress is r w e ρ δ y t w p t 1 according to the expected water saving amount e w s y t δ w p t w p t w p t 1 caused by the increase of agricultural water productivity the prediction method formula of the agricultural water consumption rebound effect can be obtained in t years is as follows 4 w r e ρ δ y t w p t 1 y t δ w p t w p t w p t 1 100 it can be seen from the calculation above that an important part of analyzing the rebound of agricultural water consumption is to accurately predict the rate of the contribution of technological progress to water consumption changes this estimate can be derived from the hicks neutral cobb douglas production function formula 5 5 y i t a i t w i t α x 1 i t β x 2 i t γ x n i t η a i e r t w i t α x 1 i t β x 2 i t γ x n i t η in the formula a i t a i e r t is the technical coefficient of hicks neutral r represents the technical weight y i t stands for output w i t is the input of water x 1 i t x 2 i t x n i t represents other input inputs such as labor and land α β γ η is the elasticity coefficient of the corresponding element input the natural logarithm of formula 5 results in the following 6 l n y i t l n a i r t α l n w i t β l n x 1 i t γ l n x 2 i t η l n x n i t by applying the input and output data of agricultural production in china we can estimate r r is the elastic coefficient of time t and the contribution rate of agricultural technology can be expressed as follows 7 ρ r g y in the formula g y is the agricultural output growth ratio which is equal to the ratio of the difference between agricultural output in the year t and t 1 to agricultural output in the year t 1 y t y t 1 y t 1 after determining ρ the agricultural water consumption rebound under the macroeconomic level can be measured using formula 4 it can be concluded from eq 1 agricultural water consumption rebound effect rebound water consumption expected water saving 100 currently the common rebound effect is divided into four categories as shown in table 1 the ideal state of water saving is zero rebound i e the rebound water consumption is 0 and it is expected that the water saving will be fully realized a rebound between 0 and 100 means that the expected water saving target is not fully met and some water saving is offset by new water use if the rebound water consumption is equal to the expected water saving i e a full rebound occurs and the rebound effect is equal to 100 if the rebound water consumption exceeds the expected water saving a rebound of more than 100 will occur also called the tempering phenomenon 3 3 influence factor analysis method by determining the influencing factors this study analyzes the correlation between the influencing factors water footprint and rebound effect by combining quantitative and qualitative methods 3 4 the dataset 3 4 1 socioeconomic data this paper utilizes the statistical yearbook data of the people s republic of china as the benchmark based on the data of the statistical yearbook of xinjiang uygur autonomous region and the statistical yearbook of xinjiang production and construction corps collects data on social economy population and agricultural production of 14 prefectures cities in the tianshan area from 1996 to 2015 3 4 2 agricultural water consumption data based on the data of the hydrological yearbook of the people s republic of china this study combines the water resources bulletin of xinjiang uygur autonomous region to understand the local water resources and their development and utilization simultaneously the hydro meteorological data http data cma cn of the study area were collected to calculate the agricultural water footprint agriculture water consumption and its changes 4 results 4 1 agricultural water footprint calculation results according to the agricultural blue water footprint estimation method in section 3 1 the crop blue water footprint of 14 prefectures in the tianshan area from 1996 to 2015 was measured the results of the calculations are shown in fig 2 fig 2 shows the interannual variations of the crop blue water footprint in the tianshan area the following is the crop blue water footprint of the southern foothills of tianshan area below the boundary line and the crop blue water footprint of the northern foothills of tianshan area above the boundary line it can be observed from fig 2 that the agricultural blue water footprint of the tianshan area has continued to rise since the implementation of high efficiency water conserving irrigation in 1996 and the increase in the southern foothill of the tianshan mountains is greater than that of the tianshan mountains among them the agricultural blue water footprints of 14 prefectures have increased to varying degrees and the trends of increase in aksu kashi tarbagatai and ili are palpable 4 2 agricultural water consumption rebound effect an observation of 3 2 indicates that the first step in studying the rebound of agricultural water consumption should be to calculate the r which is the proportion of agricultural technology this study divides the agricultural inputs affecting the agricultural output into technological progress and the inputs of land water labor mechanical and fertilizer according to the calculation principle of the hicks neutral cobb douglas production function using spss software spss inc chicago il usa fits the agricultural inputs and agricultural output data of 14 prefectures cities in the tianshan area from 1996 to 2015 it should be noted that to eliminate the impact of price fluctuations on agricultural output this study converts the agricultural added value of each year into a constant price of 1990 before the relevant analysis the calculation results are shown in table 2 in the table 1 shows the results of fitting the cross sectional data of 14 prefectures cities in 1996 2015 a total of 280 sets of data in the tianshan area using the hicks neutral cobb douglas production function and 2 is the fitting result of the cross sectional data of the other 13 prefectures cities except the karamay from 1996 to 2015 a total of 260 sets of data since karamay is an urban area in which development and processing are the primary industries and agriculture is limited the rural population is close to zero therefore this lack of a rural population substantially affects the overall data it can be observed that the determination coefficients of 1 and 2 are 0 965 and 0 957 0 95 respectively and the goodness of fit is higher but the p values of lnm and lnf in 1 are 0 119 and 0 631 0 05 respectively and the difference is not significant in 2 the p values are all less than 0 01 and pass the 99 significance test therefore the proportion of agricultural technology r is 0 030 the agricultural technology proportion r is substituted into the relevant calculation formula of 3 2 and the results of the 20 year cumulative agricultural water consumption rebound in the tianshan area are obtained in table 3 and fig 3 it can be observed in table 3 that in the 20 years of agricultural income in the study area the overall agricultural income in the tianshan area increased by 289 including 275 in the south and 301 in the north the growth rate of bayingolin 448 and aksu 293 in the southern foothill area was greater than that of the southern foothill and tianshan the growth rates of kashi 242 kizilsu 224 and hotan 119 were less than those of the southern foothill and tianshan where bayingolin was the maximum of the southern foothill and even the entire tianshan area and hotan was the minimum of the southern foothill area and even the tianshan area the growth levels of tarbagatai 360 urumqi 352 karamay 346 hami 313 bortala 307 and changji 305 in the northern area were greater than the overall growth ratio in the northern area and the tianshan area while those of ili 271 turpan 270 and altay 196 were less than the overall growth level of the northern area and the tianshan area in terms of water consumption in agriculture the agricultural water consumption in the study area increased by 133 as a whole with 196 in the south which is much higher than the 93 in the north most prefectures cities in the study area increased by 80 220 with the karamay area increasing by 660 in the past 20 years while a few of the prefectures increased by a relatively small amount such as turpan 33 and altay 21 an examination of the area of cultivated land indicated that the overall growth rate of the study area was 120 of which 150 in the south was much higher than the 93 in the north and most of the state city in the study area increased by 50 200 except for the increased area of the cultivated land in karamay 1012 and bayingolin 207 the increase in cultivated land in urumqi was only 19 in terms of expected water saving the estimated 20 year cumulative water saving in the tianshan area was 14 599 billion m3 of which the southern foot and the northern foot are 5 551 billion m3 and 9 123 billion m3 respectively most of the prefectures cities in the study area are expected to save less than 4 billion m3 with the exception of ili prefecture which was 16 87 billion m3 this is primarily because the ili area has a large area of cultivated land and ranks fourth in the entire tianshan area the first three are kashgar aksu and changji but its agricultural water productivity is the lowest in the entire tianshan area therefore ili s expected water saving is particularly sensitive to water productivity indicators resulting in a large cumulative expected water saving and rebound water saving data in terms of actual water saving the accumulated actual water saving in the tianshan area for 20 years was 2 159 million m3 i e the tianshan area not only failed to achieve water saving in 1996 2015 but the water consumption increased by 2 159 billion m3 the actual accumulated water saving in the south was 3 646 billion m3 and the water consumption continued unabated in the northern region it was 1 562 billion m3 i e the accumulated water saving in the northern area was 1 562 billion m3 from 1996 to 2015 although it was smaller than the expected water saving it achieved partial water saving the actual water saving capacity of the 14 prefectures cities of ciba kizilsu hami turpan altay changji karamay urumqi and ili in the study area was positive although all of these prefectures saved less water than expected they all achieved partial expected water savings however aksu hotan kashgar bortala and tarbagatai all had negative values indicating that their water consumption is increasing the rebound water consumption is the difference between the expected water saving and the actual water saving the water consumption of the research area in the past 20 years is 16 758 billion m3 including 9 197 billion m3 in the southern part and 7 561 billion m3 in the northern part the rebound in water consumption in most areas of the study area is less than 4 billion m3 it can be seen from table 3 and fig 3 that the overall rebound effect in the tianshan area is 114 79 100 and the overall appearance is a tempering phenomenon among them the rebound effect of the southern foothill of tianshan was 165 69 100 and there was a tempering phenomenon the rebound effect of the northern foothill of tianshan was 82 88 100 and there was a partial rebound phenomenon i e the expected water saving was not realized but the expected water saving effect was approximately 20 the rebound effects of hotan kashi and aksu in the southern area of the tianshan mountains were 281 254 and 192 respectively resulting in their ranking as the top three in the entire study area and there is a tempering phenomenon the rebound effects of bayingolin and kizilsu were 83 and 74 respectively and each achieved effective water savings of 17 and 26 respectively in the northern foothill of the tianshan mountains only the increase in agricultural water consumption in bortala and tarbagatai was greater than the expected water saving the rebound effect is 123 and 128 and there is a tempering phenomenon the rebound effect of ili and hami is 99 96 close to 100 and the water saving effect was not obvious the rebound effect in the other regions was between 50 and 80 and the water saving effect was more obvious among them turpan is the region with the least rebound effect 57 in the northern part and even the entire tianshan region and it achieved the expected water saving effect of 43 4 3 influencing factor analysis results the influencing factors of agricultural water consumption are various for example the increase of cultivated land area the construction of high efficiency and water saving the adjustment of planting structure and the change of yield per unit area some of these factors are quantifiable and some are unquantifiable this paper analyzes the factors affecting the change of agricultural water consumption in the study area including four factors the ratio of high efficiency and water saving the change of irrigated area the change of planting structure and the change of yield per unit area 4 3 1 efficient water conservation although agricultural water consumption in the study area has a rebound effect it cannot be denied that efficient water saving in agriculture improves the efficiency of agricultural water use while improving the quality of agricultural products since 1996 although the tianshan area as a whole has been vigorously building high efficiency water saving projects the high efficiency water saving area reached 3 02 million ha by 2015 however specific to each prefecture city the process of efficient water saving construction is uneven as shown in fig 4 fig 4 shows the current efficient water saving rate and the rebound of agricultural water consumption in the study area as can be observed in fig 4 there is a negative correlation between the rebound of agricultural water consumption and the efficient water saving rate especially south of the tianshan mountain area the agricultural water consumption of aksu hotan and kashgar in the south of the tianshan mountain rebounded to 192 281 and 254 respectively all higher than the average level of 115 in the tianshan region the efficient water saving rate of bayingolin was 70 which was at a higher level in the southern part of the tianshan mountain and the rebound coefficient of agricultural water consumption was 83 which is far less than the average level in the southern part of the tianshan mountain although the expected water saving was partially offset by the new water consumption the water saving effect of 17 was achieved the overall correlation of the northern foothill of the tianshan mountain is not very intuitive which may be related to the relatively special planting and economic structure of the northern foothill of the tianshan mountain such as bortala and urumqi bortala is the region with the largest change in planting structure in the study area from 1996 to 2015 the proportion of the cotton planting area in bortala changed from 34 75 in 1996 to 61 75 in 2014 and decreased to 52 47 in 2015 cotton is the crop with the highest water consumption per unit of crops in the study area which explains why bortala has a high water saving rate of 90 and the agricultural water consumption rebound coefficient is 123 100 urumqi is dominated by industry in 1996 2015 the area of cultivated land increased by merely 17 this is also the reason why urumqi s efficient water saving rate was not high but its agricultural water consumption rebounded the results of fitting the high efficiency irrigation water saving rate and agricultural water consumption rebound of the other 12 prefectures cities without considering the special conditions of bortala and urumqi fig 5 indicate that there is a moderately negative correlation between the high efficiency water saving rate and the agricultural water consumption rebound correlation coefficient is 0 59 and the elastic coefficient is 2 65 i e the higher the high water saving rate the lower the agricultural water consumption rebound 4 3 2 increase in the cultivated land area the area of cultivated land in the north and south of the tianshan mountains increased from 3037 thousand hectares in 1996 to 6695 thousand hectares in 2015 an increase of 121 the area of cultivated land is a key factor in the increase in agricultural water consumption the change of cultivated land area in 14 prefectures cities from 1996 to 2015 is shown in fig 6 kashgar aksu changji bayingolin tarbagatai ili hotan and bortala are eight areas where the area of cultivated land significantly increased the area of cultivated land in these areas has increased by 858 83 738 70 437 95 398 19 381 52 316 14 148 13 and 126 02 thousand hectares respectively among them the agricultural water consumption rebounds in these eight regions were 254 192 70 83 128 99 281 and 123 respectively more than half of the tempering reactions occurred and all of these states cities that have tempered phenomena in the entire study area although ili bayingolin and bortala have no tempered phenomenon they are close to 100 although the changji prefecture has a significant increase in irrigation area changji s efficient water saving rate was as high as 70 and therefore the rebound coefficient is small 70 from the perspective of large space the agricultural water consumption rebound and the changes in the cultivated land area in the north and south of the tianshan mountains in the past 20 years fig 7 are more obvious on a larger scale the area of cultivated land in the north and south of tianshan mountain grew continuously however the area of the cultivated land in the south of the tianshan mountain was consistently smaller than that in the north of the tianshan mountains from 1996 to 2005 after basically flattening in 2006 the area in the south grew faster the area of cultivated land in the south of tianshan mountain exceeds that in the north of tianshan mountain this can partly explain why the overall rebound effect of the southern foothills of tianshan mountain is higher than that of the northern foothill of tianshan mountain 4 3 3 increased proportion of high water consumption crops since 1996 the proportion of food crops in the tianshan region has continued to decline and the growing trend of economic crops has become increasingly apparent the ratio of the total grain crops to the economic crops planted in the tianshan area referred to as the grain and economic ratio typically decreased the process of the change of grain and economic ratio in 14 prefectures cities from 1996 to 2015 is shown in fig 8 most economic crops consume more water than food crops which has become a general consensus cao et al 2018 under the same conditions the smaller the grain to the economic ratio the more water is consumed fig 8 indicates that the grain and economic ratio of aksu bayingolin hotan kashgar hami and turpan decreased overall and half of the six prefectures cities had a tempering reaction to some extent the effect of the planting structure on the rebound of agricultural water consumption was confirmed most of the grain and economic ratio in the other regions showed a trend of decreasing first and then increasing but the overall grain and economic ratio typically decreased from the perspective of large space the grain and economic ratio in the tianshan area showed a trend of decreasing first and then decreasing while the southern area continuously declined and the northern area decreased first and then increased 4 3 4 increase in output per unit area the increase in yield per unit area indicates that the fruit of the crop stores more water and the water consumption of the crop agriculture increases the primary factors for increasing the crop yield per unit area include increasing the planting density improving crop varieties and changing water and fertilizer supply conditions during the 20 years from 1996 to 2015 the yield per unit area of crops in the tianshan region increased among them the yields of apples pears and beets in 2015 were 3 58 fold 3 86 fold and 2 87 fold greater than the yields in 1996 respectively and the yields of the other crops increased between 1 50 and 2 50 fold the increase in output per unit area also explains the increase in agricultural water consumption and the rebound in agricultural water consumption 5 discussion 1 after the implementation of high efficiency water conservation agricultural water consumption continues to increase but this does not mean that high efficiency water conservation is the cause of the rebound in agricultural water consumption on the contrary efficient water saving not only improves quality and efficiency but also helps to reduce agricultural water consumption rebound the low quality caused by unreasonable irrigation and its impact on the environment were the primary factors restricting the sustainable development of characteristic agriculture and the increase in the farmers income many regions still rely on water fertilizer and other resources to pursue high yield forming a vicious circle of high input high yield low quality low price low efficiency kang 2009 the drip irrigation under plastic mulch implemented in the tianshan area since 1996 is not only a water saving measure but also a technical platform to promote the coordination of water and fertilizer zhang 2018 regulating the flow of information in crops through precise and real time deficit irrigation so as to regulate the quality of crop output thus ensures a certain amount of output on the premise of using less water consumption and fertilizer to produce higher quality agricultural products finally a new agricultural mode with the goal of saving water high yield high quality high efficiency and environmental friendliness will be realized efficient water saving construction can improve the productivity of the use of water fig 9 although there are water productivity differences in the tianshan region the productivity of water in the 14 prefectural level cities in the tianshan region increased as a whole i e the utilization efficiency of the water continued to improve from 1996 to 2015 efficient water saving can improve crop quality it can be observed from the planting proportion in the tianshan area from 1996 to 2015 fig 10 that wheat is the primary grain crop in the research area and the planting proportion has fluctuated and decreased during the previous 20 years cotton is the cash crop that has the largest proportion of planting in the research area red jujube was the crop whose planting proportion changed the most in the study area this area increased from 0 08 in 1996 to 8 53 in 2013 and decreased to 7 4 in 2015 through the analysis of areas planted to wheat for more than 30 kizilsu ili cotton to more than 40 ask bayingolin bortala and red jujube to more than 20 hotan and hami it was observed that the water consumption per unit area of the typical crops is basically unchanged but the yield per unit area increases significantly fig 11 from the seven typical planting areas of these three crops the crop yield per unit area typically increased when the agricultural water consumption per unit area remained basically unchanged which proves that efficient water saving can improve crop quality 2 since the implementation of high efficiency water conservation in the tianshan area in 1996 the water consumption per unit area has not decreased significantly although water consumption in agriculture has not decreased as much as expected due to structural adjustment plastic mulch and water fertilizer integration the crop yield quality and water productivity and production efficiency significantly improved the increase in quality to increase the effect of the achievement was remarkable efficient water saving therefore is not the cause of agricultural rebound the increase in regional water consumption is mainly due to the failure to implement the concept of suitable water development kang 2009 grafton et al 2018 blindly opening the ground loch and adamson 2015 berbel et al 2014 graveline et al 2013 fishman et al 2015 zhu and li 2011 increasing the proportion of high yield water crops playán and mateos 2006 berbel et al 2014 lecina et al 2010 resulting in disorderly expansion of irrigation area and blind pursuit of unit area production dagnino and ward 2012 playán and mateos 2006 lecina et al 2010 to truly realize resource based water conservation on the one hand we must use engineering means to continue to promote the process of efficient agricultural water conservation on the other hand we must use non engineering means such as reducing the area of arable land adjusting the planting structure and moderately pursuing yield per unit area 1 the tianshan area should continue to promote the process of agricultural high efficiency water conservation construction china s 13th five year plan for the implementation of 100 million mu of high efficient water saving irrigation area clearly states that china will add 6 67 million ha of high efficiency water saving irrigation area during the 13th five year plan period of which an efficient water saving area with a focus on drip irrigation of 800 000 ha will be developed in the tianshan area china attaches great importance to high efficiency water saving irrigation which provides opportunities for agricultural water saving construction and development in the tianshan region if the tianshan area wants to reduce the rebound of agricultural water consumption and truly realize the resource based water conservation we should seize the opportunity to continuously promote the process of agricultural efficient water saving construction 2 the tianshan area should implement joint water and soil allocation to reduce the area of cultivated land in some areas the data have proven that there is a correlation between farmland and water conservation policies the increase in the area of cultivated land will promote the rebound of agricultural water consumption zhu and li 2011 to reduce the rebound of agricultural water consumption and result in increased coordination in the development of water resources the tianshan area needs to regard the arable land expansion restriction policy and the water saving technology promotion policy collectively referred to as water and soil policy as a group of related variables i e to promote the development of arable land suitable for water and implement the joint deployment of water and soil for areas such as aksu kashgar kizilsu and hetian in which the area of cultivated land is growing rapidly and water resources are lacking and not abundant on the one hand we will continue to promote the construction of water saving irrigation projects on the other hand we should rationally plan the agricultural layout according to the local water resources and limit the disorderly reclamation of the cultivated land for areas with increased cultivated land but slow progress in efficient water saving construction such as changji and bortala it is recommended to continue to promote the land reduction and water reduction policy to gradually solve the local water resources and ecological environmental protection predicament 3 the tianshan area can adjust the planting structure and reduce the proportion of high yield crops the planting structure is primarily affected by national policies market supply and demand while the tianshan area has always been a highly intensive area of grain and cotton competition and grain and fruit competition wang and xiao 2018 for a given arable land area when there is a larger proportion of economic crops and higher levels of agricultural water consumption the rebound of agricultural water consumption will be more obvious in the future it is necessary to guide farmers to adjust their planting structure and implement fallow farmland and encourage the development of modern agriculture with high yield high quality high efficiency and ecological security in accordance with the regulatory strategy of stabilizing grain adjusting cotton optimizing fruit and rejuvenating livestock which is the only way to realize food and ecological security in the tianshan area appropriate reduction of cotton planting area consolidation and improvement of production capacity in high quality and high yield areas can achieve water saving without reducing production or income at the same time the stable wheat planting area and the reasonable allocation of forest and grain intercropping will maximize water conservation and increase fruit and grain benefits in the tianshan area we should actively develop the planting of characteristic forests fruits and forages and encourage the planting of low water consuming crops such as alfalfa and silage maize which are drought tolerant and saline alkali tolerant zhang et al 2018 4 the tianshan area should appropriately pursue the output per unit area currently the quantitative analysis of the relationship between the yield per unit area and the blue water footprint is mostly present on the field scale and quantitative analysis on the regional scale is still rare however from the physiological response mechanism of crop water and practical experience in production it can be confirmed that the increase in output per unit area can lead to an increase in water consumption kang 2009 huai et al 2013 increases in yields can be achieved by appropriately increasing the density and improving the varieties grown however an inappropriate increase in planting density may reduce the quality of crops so the pursuit of yield per unit area should be moderate wang and xiao 2018 6 conclusions this paper quantitatively analyzes the rebound effect of agricultural water consumption in the tianshan area and analyzes the primary factors affecting the rebound effect data analysis has revealed that since the implementation of water saving measures such as high efficiency irrigation in 1996 the water consumption has not decreased as expected but has rebounded in fact the tianshan area presents the phenomenon that the water is more and more water poor the overall performance is a tempering phenomenon and the rebound effect of the southern foothill is higher than that of the northern foothill of the tianshan mountains efficient water saving construction is not the cause of the rebound of agricultural water consumption currently high efficiency water saving construction has played a role in improving quality and efficiency in the research area the primary reason for the rebound in agricultural water consumption in the study area is the large scale expansion of the irrigated area the change in the ratio of grain to economics in the planting structure primarily reduced and the increase in output per unit area it should be noted that drip irrigation is the primary form of water conserving irrigation in the research area in this paper while sprinkling irrigation and other agriculturally efficient water conserving methods are almost absent moreover agricultural water rights and water price systems in the research area have not yet been perfected therefore this study does not explore the differences between water conservation methods and the rebound effects under different agricultural water tariffs further research should refine the impact of agricultural water prices and different water conserving methods on agricultural water consumption rebound author contributions y w wrote the main manuscript text and prepared the figures a l supervised the study x d and l x advised the study design and performed part of data

10577,in the semi arid texas high plains declining irrigation water supply hinders the profitable corn zea mays l silage production the principle feed ingredient of the beef and dairy industries drought tolerant and deep rooting crops like forage sorghum sorghum bicolor l and pearl millet pennisetum glaucum l could be an alternative to corn silage under limiting irrigation a field study was conducted during 2018 and 2019 at new deal tx to assess soil water depletion patterns water use efficiency wue and silage yield of forage sorghum pearl millet and corn under limited irrigation the experiment was conducted in split plot design with three irrigation levels i0 55 and 29 mm i1 172 and 147 mm and i2 323 and 260 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively as main plots and five cultivars p1498am corn af7401 and silo700d bmr sorghum and epic and exceed bmr pearl millet as sub plots with three replications the soil water depletion amount was greater in i0 105 and 57 mm followed by i1 60 and 37 mm and i2 44 and 13 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively fresh biomass yield was the greatest in i2 followed by i1 and i0 however the highest wue was achieved in i0 and i2 in 2018 and 2019 respectively water depletion depth was greater for sorghum and pearl millet plots 0 1 m than corn plots 0 0 6 m which resulted in greater water depletion amount in sorghum 75 and 31 mm and pearl millet 68 and 48 mm plots than corn 67 and 28 mm during 2018 and 2019 respectively average yield and wue were the highest in sorghum cultivars followed by pearl millet and corn results confirmed that the higher silage yield and wue can be achieved by sorghum compared to pearl millet and corn under limited irrigation conditions keywords deficit irrigation evapotranspiration semi arid silage crop soil water extraction 1 introduction frequent droughts erratic and low precipitation 350 550 mm and high evapotranspiration 1500 1750 mm et are the major concerns for agricultural sustainability in the semi arid environment of texas high plains thp bhandari et al 2018 bhandari et al 2020 twdb 2012 these conditions in the thp have necessitated heavy reliance on the ogallala aquifer a confined groundwater resource for successful crop production in most parts of the thp the annual water withdrawal rate for crop irrigation is much higher than the recharge which has resulted in a significant decline in the water table of the aquifer scanlon et al 2012 researchers predicted that if the current water withdrawal rate continues 35 of the currently irrigated land will not be able to support irrigated agriculture in the near future haacker et al 2016 in addition irrigation cost has increased as the water is pumped from deeper depths of the aquifer which is increasing the cost of agricultural production neupane and guo 2019 therefore there is a need to reduce the water footprints of irrigated crops to extend the life of the aquifer without compromising the agricultural sustainability in the region chaves and davies 2010 in the thp the concern is growing among the growers and researchers about the sustainability of beef and dairy industries which rely heavily on irrigated corn zea mays l for feedgrain and silage guerrero et al 2012 corn silage is the most preferred feed ingredient because of the greater portion of grain and high quality digestible energy bhattarai et al 2019 however a high water requirement and inability to cope with drought and heat under limited water supply are risking corn productivity steward et al 2013 hence there is a need for optimization of crop water use which can be achieved through adjusting crop phenology to its environment or by adopting integrated agronomic approaches such as planting drought heat tolerant crops application of deficit irrigation or site specific irrigation irrigation based on growth stage and weather conditions increasing precipitation storage capacity of the soil and planting crops that efficiently utilize stored soil water chaves and davies 2010 neupane and guo 2019 pala et al 2007 the rooting behavior of plant determines the capability to utilize the stored soil moisture which enhances the nutrients uptake while nutrients increase root size and its distribution ali et al 2019 studying the plant rooting behavior and soil water depletion patterns can provide insight of plants ability to tolerate water stress sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench and pearl millet pennisetum glaucum l r br are relatively drought and heat tolerant owing to their ability to utilize stored soil moisture more efficiently than corn bhattarai et al 2019 these crops produce considerable amounts of silage even under limited irrigation conditions and could serve as alternatives to corn silage in the thp sorghum produces large numbers of secondary roots and achieves rooting depth of 0 8 1 8 m whereas rooting depth of corn is shallower 0 7 1 4 m porter 2010 pearl millet also produces fewer but deeper roots than corn pearl millet roots can attained depth of 70 cm within 11 days after germination passot et al 2016 reaching up to 1 6 m faye et al 2019 however rooting depths varies with multiple factors such as soil characteristics cultivars and soil water availability faye et al 2019 although sorghum and pearl millet have an edge on yield performance and utilization of stored soil water efficiently in semi arid environments over corn silage quality of sorghum and pearl millet is somewhat poorer than corn miller and stroup 2003 introduction of the brown midrib bmr trait has enhanced the ruminal digestibility of forage sorghum and pearl millet by reducing the lignin component of plant cell wall concentration compared to non bmr type cherney et al 1991 higher lignin concentration in forage crops is undesirable as it resists microbial digestion in the rumen and therefore reduces enzyme access to the cell structural carbohydrates cherney et al 1991 the bmr trait is reported to reduce lignin concentration by up to 50 compared to similar non bmr types resulting in greater extent digestion of the forage fiber jung and allen 1995 thereby increasing weight gain and milk production per unit mass of forage fed casler and jung 2006 hence in environments where the availability of water is increasingly limited and difficult to predict assessing the ability of non traditional silage crops with the bmr trait to utilize available water compared to traditional crops like corn could provide a new crop option to the thp growers therefore the objective of this study was to assess soil water depletion patterns water use efficiency wue and silage yield of bmr forage sorghum bmr pearl millet and non bmr corn under variable levels of deficit irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted during summers of 2018 and 2019 at the new deal research farm 33 44 39 98 n 101 43 41 23 w and altitude of 995 m texas tech university new deal tx united states the experimental site is characterized as semi arid climate with mean annual precipitation of 469 mm a potential et of 1500 mm and an average annual maximum and minimum temperatures of 24 2 and 8 3 c respectively dhakal et al 2019 the soil type was classified as pullman clay loam fine mixed superactive thermic torrertic paleustolls with overlying calcium carbonate layer from 60 120 cm depth nrcs 2017 which is substantially impervious to roots growth the soil texture and bulk density of experimental field was sandy clay loam and 1 57 g cm 1 for the upper 0 20 cm depth and clay loam and 1 51 g cm 1 for lower 20 100 cm depth respectively singh 2019 similarly field capacity permanent wilting and saturated hydraulic conductivity were 0 25 m3 m 3 0 12 m3 m 3 and 80 7 cm d 1 for upper 20 cm and 0 23 m3 m 3 0 10 m3 m 3 and 44 7 cm d 1 for 20 100 cm soil layer respectively singh 2019 the soil ph and organic matter contents for upper 20 cm depth in adjacent field sites were 7 3 and 1 5 in 2018 and 7 5 and 1 8 in 2019 respectively 2 2 experimental description conventional tillage with a tractor mounted disk plow was performed to prepare the seedbed the experimental field was 180 m long and 24 m wide with an area of 0 42 ha the field was divided into three separate irrigation zones along the length spaced 1 m apart each irrigation zones were controlled individually for irrigation applications there were 45 plots of which 15 in each irrigation zone each plot was 11 m long and 8 m wide with eight rows spaced 1 m apart the planting was done on 25 may in 2018 and 15 may in 2019 using a four row planter model maxemerge xp john deere co however in 2019 replanting of sorghum and pearl millet was done on 27 may due to herbicide drift damage on sorghum and poor germination of pearl millet the pure live seeding rates used were 16 kg ha 1 for corn 9 kg ha 1 for sorghum and 3 5 kg ha 1 for pearl millet these seeding rates were recommended by the texas a m agrilife research and extension service for optimum silage production and resulted in an average of 65 000 240 000 and 275 000 plants ha 1 for corn sorghum and pearl millet respectively there were three targeted irrigation treatments i i0 50 mm ii i1 200 mm and iii i2 350 mm and five crop cultivars i af7401 bmr forage sorghum alta seed company irving tx ii silo700d bmr forage sorghum richardson seed company vega tx iii epic and iv exceed both bmr forage pearl millet coffey seed company plainview tx and v p1498am corn dupont pioneer seed company now corteva agriscience wilmington de these cultivars were selected based on their adaptability to semi arid regions initially 50 mm of irrigation which was applied to all irrigation treatments and later added to their respective total irrigation amount was aimed to distribute equally for two weeks for better crop emergence before the start of actual irrigation treatments using subsurface drip irrigation netafim fresno ca the seasonal distribution of precipitation irrigation and cumulative precipitation and irrigation for each irrigation treatment are presented in fig 1 during 2018 the irrigation treatments were started at 20 days after planting dap however in 2019 irrigation treatments were started at 32 dap because of high rainfall events during early season also the irrigation wasterminated during the events of rainfall irrigation applied for i0 i1 and i2 were 55 172 and 323 mm in 2018 and 29 147 and 260 mm in 2019 respectively weeds were removed manually and the field was fertilized with 60 kg n ha 1 and 50 kg n ha 1 using 32 0 0 liquid fertilizer in 2018 and 2019 respectively these fertilizer amounts were applied considering the dry land forage production which was one of the treatments in this experiment and were kept constant for all the treatments there was no infestation by insect pests in corn and pearl millet however the insecticide sivanto flupyradifurone at 0 58 l ha 1 and prevathon chlorantraniliprole at 1 02 l ha 1 were applied to control sugarcane aphid melanaphis sacchari zehntner and armyworms complex spodoptera frugiperda j e smith and helicoverpa zea boddie respectively in sorghum in both years the final harvest of corn was done when the grain reached the half milk line stage on 3 september 101 dap in 2018 and 19 august 96 dap in 2019 similarly sorghum and pearl millet were harvested at the soft dough stage on 7 september 105 dap in 2018 and 31 august 96 dap in 2019 2 3 measurement of soil water content and water use efficiency volumetric water content m3 m 3 vwc was determined weekly using a capacitance probe model pr2 6 profile probe delta t devices ltd uk the calibration of data recorded from the capacitance probe was done using the equation given by dhakal et al 2019a access tubes for the pr2 probe were installed manually into the soil profile between the plant rows in each plot using the auguring kit provided by the manufacturer the vwc were recorded at 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 6 and 1 m depths the access tubes were installed at 13 dap in 2018 and 26 dap in 2019 soil water depth mm at each depth was calculated by multiplying vwc with depth increment mm and summed together to get the total water depth mm for one meter soil profile qi and helmers 2010 change in soil water storage δs was calculated weekly by subtracting the later measurement from the initial measurement of vwc and were summed to determine the seasonal change singh et al 2016b crop et was determined by using a water balance equation et p i δs d r where p is precipitation mm i is irrigation mm δs is the change in soil water storage mm d is drainage mm and r is runoff mm below root zone wang et al 2012 since the experimental field was level and irrigation was applied through subsurface drip and no excessive rainfall amounts were received throughout the cropping season runoff and drainage were assumed to be zero the wue was calculated at each biomass harvest using the equation wue y et where y is above ground biomass adjusted at 65 moisture kg ha 1 and et is evapotranspiration mm hao et al 2015 the above ground biomass was measured manually at every 15 days interval starting at 30 dap by harvesting the plants from 1 m2 area however the final biomass sample was harvested from 2 m2 area the weight of harvested samples were measured and kept in pre weighed bags then the samples were dried in a laboratory oven for 48 72 hours at 60 c until constant weight was achieved subsequently fresh biomass weight was adjusted to 65 moisture using the formula fresh biomass at 65 moisture unadjusted fresh biomass yield kg ha 1 x 100 actual moisture of harvested biomass 35 2 4 field design and statistical analysis the experiment was laid out in a blocked split plot design with irrigation treatment as the main plot factor and crop cultivar as a sub plot factor with three replications all the collected data were analyzed in r version 3 5 1 using agricolae package version 1 2 8 de mendiburu 2017 the effects of irrigation cultivar and their interaction were analyzed using analysis of variance with two error terms one for irrigation and other for cultivar and their interaction biomass et and wue were analyzed independently for each observation however soil water depletion was analyzed as repeated measure considering the dap as a factor the mean separation test was done with the least significant difference at 5 significance level graphs were prepared using sigmaplot version 14 systat software san jose ca 3 results and discussions 3 1 weather conditions during the growing season prevailing weather variables during the growing season play an important role in crop growth and performance during the cropping season may through august cumulative rainfall was 114 mm and 205 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 2 the seasonal rainfall was lower in 2018 and higher in 2019 compared to long term 1911 2008 average seasonal rainfall of 165 mm dhakal et al 2019 although the total amount of rainfall received in 2019 was much greater than 2018 the distribution of the rainfall was more uniform in 2018 than 2019 fig 2 the major portions of rainfall were concentrated in the months of june 32 and august 36 in 2018 which were the peak vegetative and reproductive stages of crops respectively however 77 of rainfall was concentrated during may to mid june in 2019 when the crops were in early vegetative stage and very little rainfall was received thereafter a similar rainfall was received in july of both years the average air temperature was higher in may and june of 2018 while it was similar in july of both years however in august the average air temperature was 1 9 c higher in 2019 than 2018 the stressful growing condition in 2019 which is clear from low rainfall and higher temperature at the terminal growth stage resulted in early maturity of corn and pearl millet leading to five biomass harvests in 2019 compared to six biomass harvests in 2018 3 2 initial soil water content volumetric soil water content for the 1 m soil profile depth among the irrigation treatments and cultivars are presented in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively the initial vwc measured at 13 dap in 2018 and 26 dap in 2019 were not significantly different down to 0 6 m soil profile depth however significantly lower vwc was observed in 2019 at 1 m depth compared to 2018 the average vwc for 0 0 6 m soil profile depth was 18 2 m3 m 3 and 17 6 m3 m 3 in 2018 and 2019 respectively similarly the vwc at 1 m depth was 23 8 m3 m 3 in 2018 and 19 2 m3 m 3 in 2019 a significant decrease in vwc value was observed at each depth increment down to 1 m soil profile depth with progressing growing season in all irrigation treatments in 2018 and in i0 in 2019 however the decrease in vwc value was significant only up to the depth of 0 0 6 m in i1 and i2 treatments with progressing growing season in 2019 fig 3 these results suggest that the water depletion depths did not vary in 2018 among the irrigation treatments however in 2019 water depletion depths varied among the dryland i0 and irrigated treatments i1 and i2 the shallower depth of water depletion in i1 and i2 in 2019 could be due to higher early season rainfall that wetted the upper soil profile compared to 2018 fig 2 this soil water storage from rainfall in 2019 might have fulfilled the needs of plants and prevented them from depleting water from deeper than 0 6 m hao et al 2015 stone et al 2001 and wang et al 2012 also observed depletion of soil water from shallower depth in corn sorghum and pulses crops respectively in the years when early season rainfall was higher than the years with lower early season rainfall in both years when comparing the first observation with the last observation soil water depletion was greater at each depth down to 1 m in i0 treatment compared to i1 and i2 and this water depletion was the lowest in the i2 treatment this suggested that the total soil water depletion amount along the 1 m soil profile decreased with increasing irrigation water supply a significant decrease in vwc value was observed among cultivar plots at each depth down to 1 m with progressing growing season in both years except for corn plot at 1 m in 2019 fig 4 in corn plot decrease in vwc value was greater from the 0 0 6 m depth increment and less from the 0 6 1 m depth increment in both years hao et al 2015 also observed the maximum water depletion depth of 0 6 0 8 m for corn under 50 et replacement irrigation however soil water depletion from the entire 1 m profile was observed in sorghum and pearl millet plots in both years the initial and final vwc values were similar in pearl millet and sorghum plots at 1 m in 2018 however in 2019 final vwc values was lower in pearl millet plots than sorghum plots fig 4 singh and singh 1995 also observed a similar trend of water depletion and conclude that under water limited conditions significant water depletion in corn occurs from the upper soil profile 0 0 45 m sorghum from the deeper soil profile 0 45 1 35 m and pearl millet from the entire soil profile 0 1 35 m overall soil water depletion amount among the crop cultivar plots was higher in 2018 than 2019 which could be explained by the more favorable growing season greater growth and yield which resulted in efficient utilization of soil water in 2018 compared to 2019 bhattarai 2019 hao et al 2015 and bhattarai et al 2020 also observed a decrease in plant growth and water depletion depth and amount in corn and safflower carthamus tinctorius l plots when plants were subjected to water deficit 3 3 total soil water depletion soil water depletion amount varied significantly among irrigation treatments as the growing season progressed in both years the amount of soil water depletion was greater in dryland i0 treatment followed by i1 and i2 in both years fig 5 the total soil water depletion amount for i0 i1 and i2 irrigation treatments were 105 59 and 43 mm in 2018 and 57 36 and 13 mm in 2019 respectively fig 5c and 5f hao et al 2015 also observed greater soil water depletion in corn from the most water stressed irrigation treatment in their experiment which was 50 et replacement compared to 75 and 100 et replacement this indicates that supplemental irrigation may not provide a chance for the plants to expand their root system which could be one of the reasons for the reduction of soil water depletion in i1 and i2 compared to i0 irrigation treatment significant differences in soil water depletion occurred among the irrigation treatments during the period of 13 60 dap and 26 61 dap fig 5a and 5d compared to the period of 60 105 dap and 61 96 dap fig 5b and 5e in 2018 and 2019 respectively the soil water depletion in i0 i1 and i2 irrigation treatments totaled 78 39 and 34 mm during 13 60 dap in 2018 and 42 27 and 9 mm during 26 61 dap in 2019 respectively fig 5a and 5d similarly total soil water depletion in i0 i1 and i2 irrigation treatments were 27 21 and 9 mm during 60 105 dap in 2018 and 15 9 and 4 mm during 61 96 dap in 2019 respectively fig 5b and 5e hao et al 2014 and vadez et al 2013 also reported the greater soil water depletion in corn and pearl millet field respectively during the early growth stage compared to the later growth stage this lower water depletion at later in the growing season could be attributed the lower water requirement of crops approaching maturity among the cultivars significant differences in soil water depletion amounts were observed during the crop growing season in both years fig 6 during the early crop growing season significant depletion of soil water took place from 0 0 6 m reaching down to 1 m soil profile later in the season fig 6 soil water depletion in corn plot totaled 67 and 29 mm during the growing season from 0 1 m profile of which 50 and 26 mm was from 0 0 6 m depth in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 6c and 6f however soil water depletion in sorghum af7401 and silo700d and pearl millet epic and exceed plots were significant up to 1 m depth in 2018 but not in 2019 on average averaging over the two cultivars of sorghum and pearl millet total water depletion from 0 1 m during the entire growing season was 75 and 31 mm for sorghum plots and 68 and 48 mm for pearl millet plots in 2018 and 2019 respectively sorghum and pearl millet plots depleted 22 and 19 mm of water at 1 m depth which was 29 and 11 greater than corn s plot depletion at that depth in 2018 similarly in 2019 soil water depletion at 1 m depth in sorghum pearl millet and corn plots were 3 7 and 4 mm respectively which was substantially lower than 2018 this lower water depletion in 2019 from deeper soil profile could be due to the shorter and more stressful growing conditions which reduced leaf area and plant growth thus reducing the transpiration and water uptake from deeper soil profile bhattarai 2019 zhou et al 2013 also suggested that shoot characteristics play equally important role in determining soil water depletion mcintyre et al 1995 observed the lower soil water depletion in pearl millet field under water deficit conditions and concluded that stress can result in poor root growth and distribution lowering the soil water depletion overall the amount of soil water depletion was greater in sorghum plot than pearl millet and corn plots during 2018 however soil water depletion in pearl millet plot was more than sorghum and corn plots in 2019 this difference in water depletion between sorghum and pearl millet plots was probably due to the difference in water depletion depth resulted from the difference in root density and distribution or root hydraulic characteristics hamblin and tennant 1987 vadez 2014 singh et al 2010 in a greenhouse study observed the greater concentration of corn roots in the upper soil profile depth 0 0 6 m whereas sorghum roots were concentrated at the deeper soil profile depth 0 6 1 2 m similarly passot et al 2016 observed the rooting depth of pearl millet down to 1 5 m this suggests that a soil profile study only going to 1 m may not be enough to differentiate the abilities to uptake soil water by pearl millet and sorghum 3 4 evapotranspiration fresh biomass yield and water use efficiency the et was significantly affected by irrigation treatments and it increased linearly as the growing season progressed in both years fig 7 a and 7d the total et varied significantly among the irrigation treatments at each observation period in 2018 however the differences in et due to irrigations were significant at 47 dap in 2019 the et was highest in the i2 treatment an intermediate in i1 treatment and the lowest in dryland i0 treatment during both years these trends were expected since i0 i1 and i2 received no irrigation intermediate irrigation and the highest irrigation in both years respectively hao et al 2015 also reported greater et values under higher irrigation treatments in corn by the end of the growing season et for i0 i1 and i2 was 274 346 and 480 mm in 2018 and 193 285 and 366 mm in 2019 respectively the et did not vary among the crop cultivars in 2018 but it varied significantly in 2019 fig 8 a and 8d in 2019 highest et was observed in corn followed by pearl millet cultivars and sorghum cultivars corn received a slightly higher amount of early season rainfall which sorghum and pearl millet did not receive due to replanting hence resulting in greater et in corn than sorghum and pearl millet the et was consistently higher for pearl millet cultivars than sorghum cultivar during 2019 however the et was slightly higher for sorghum than pearl millet during 2018 this higher et for sorghum in 2018 and pearl millet in 2019 is accordance with soil water depletion results fig 6 where more soil water depletion occurred in sorghum and pearl millet cultivars plots in 2018 and 2019 respectively djaman and irmak 2012 singh et al 2016b and wang et al 2012 also reported higher et in the treatments with greater soil water depletion in corn safflower and pulses crops respectively overall et was observed higher in 2018 than 2019 which could be due to higher irrigation amounts rainfall and water depletion amount in 2018 compared to 2019 fresh biomass yield was significantly different among the irrigation treatments at 75 dap in 2018 and 45 dap in 2019 fig 7b and 7e in both years the greatest fresh forage yield was consistently produced by i2 treatment intermediate by i1 treatment and the lowest by dryland i0 treatment at the final harvest i2 produced 36 8 mg ha 1 fresh silage yield which was 21 and 35 higher than i1 and i0 in 2018 respectively similarly in 2019 i2 produced 36 7 mg ha 1 of fresh silage yield which was 29 and 112 higher than i1 and i0 respectively fresh biomass growth rate increased with increasing water supply and was 0 34 0 41 and 0 46 mg ha 1 day 1 in 2018 and 0 23 0 37 and 0 54 mg ha 1 day 1 in 2019 for i0 i1 and i2 irrigation treatments respectively these results show that the increase in water availability helped promote the growth development and biomass yield of forage crops similar results have been observed in other irrigation studies where lower irrigation levels produced the lower yield and vice versa bhattarai et al 2020 enciso et al 2004 porter 2010 singh et al 2016a similarly a significant difference was observed among cultivars for fresh silage yield at 75 dap in 2018 and at all observation periods in 2019 fig 8b and 8e in 2018 at the final harvest sorghum cultivars produced the highest yield which was similar to pearl millet however corn produced lower biomass compared to sorghum and pearl millet similarly in 2019 sorghum outperformed the corn and pearl millet cultivars however yield was similar between corn and pearl millet cultivars fresh biomass yields were consistently higher for sorghum cultivar af7401 and was 35 0 and 31 3 mg ha 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively average growth rates of 0 42 0 41 and 0 38 mg ha 1 day 1 in 2018 and 0 44 0 35 and 0 32 mg ha 1 day 1 in 2019 were observed in sorghum pearl millet and corn cultivars respectively this indicated that the growth rate was higher for sorghum compared to pearl millet and corn cultivars the silage yield of sorghum and corn were low in this study compared to bell et al 2018 and xu et al 2015 respectively which could be due to the significantly lower application of irrigation and nitrogen input than the typical requirement similarly yield reported by jahansouz et al 2014 in 50 et replacement and the yield observed in this study were similar for corn sorghum and pearl millet but lower than the 75 and 100 et replacement similarly the yields of pearl millet in this study and that reported by machicek et al 2019 with 250 mm of irrigation for pearl millet was similar which might be due to similar irrigation amounts and research location differences in wue among the irrigation treatments were observed at 32 91 and 105 dap in 2018 and 47 and 96 dap in 2019 fig 7c and 7f this indicates that in both years difference in wue was observed at the vegetative stage and at near maturity in 2018 until 91 dap i1 irrigation treatment had the highest wue followed by i2 and i0 irrigation treatment however at the final harvest wue was highest for i0 followed by i1 and i2 irrigation treatments this indicated that further application of irrigation did not result in considerable biomass growth from 91 to 105 dap in irrigated treatments in 2018 fig 7b however dryland i0 treatment produced considerably higher biomass per unit of water used from 91 to 105 dap in response to the rain received at the last week of august fig 2a in 2018 whereas in 2019 wue was consistently higher for i2 followed by i1 and i0 irrigation treatment this higher wue of i0 in 2018 and lower in 2019 could be due to the greater fluctuation in the yield the yield was significantly lower in 2019 compared to 2018 in i0 treatment due to more stressful growing conditions in 2019 than 2018 the rainfall in 2019 was higher and was concentrated in the early season which was not fully utilized by the crops for yield formation compared to the lower but well distributed rainfall in 2018 kiziloglu et al 2009 also observed a variation in wue among the irrigation levels in silage corn and reported greater wue in fully irrigated treatment than deficit treatments similarly wue was significantly different among the cultivars at 73 dap in 2018 and 47 dap in 2019 in 2018 wue of the cultivars constantly increased until the final harvest fig 8c however this trend was not observed in 2019 fig 8f since et was similar among the crop cultivars we can infer that the difference in wue was due to the difference in the yield potential among the cultivars at the final harvest wue averaged among the cultivars was highest for sorghum cultivars 93 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2018 and 116 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2019 followed by pearl millet 92 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2018 and 87 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2019 and corn 81 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2018 and 76 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2019 enciso et al 2004 showed similar wue of forage sorghum 96 kg ha 1 mm 1 which was much higher than for corn 78 kg ha 1 mm 1 in the thp machicek et al 2019 also observed higher wue of forage sorghum compared to pearl millet under full irrigation in the thp similarly jahansouz et al 2014 observed lower wue in corn than sorghum and pearl millet under deficit irrigation conditions 4 conclusion soil water depletion patterns wue and fresh forage yield were significantly affected by irrigation treatments and cultivars the dryland i0 treatment depleted more soil water compared to i1 and i2 irrigated treatments higher et and fresh biomass yield were observed in i2 treatment followed by i1 and i0 treatment however wue was the highest in i0 irrigation treatment in 2018 and i2 in 2019 among cultivars a considerable amount of stored soil water depletion occurred from 0 0 6 m depth in corn plot however soil water depletion occurred from the entire 1 m soil profile in pearl millet and sorghum plots during both years also the overall amount of soil water depletion was lower in corn plots compared to sorghum and pearl millet plots in both years greater amounts of soil water depletion occurred from sorghum plots in 2018 and pearl millet plots in 2019 the et was not significantly different among the cultivars in 2018 but the differences were observed in 2019 despite the differences in et and soil water depletion amounts among cultivar plots the greatest wue were observed in sorghum followed by pearl millet and corn cultivars in both years indicating that the increased wue was due to increased biomass yield these results suggest that higher biomass yield and wue can be achieved from forage sorghum and pearl millet under limited irrigation condition as they can utilize stored soil profile water more efficiently by producing more yield per unit of water use compared to corn overall higher forage yield and wue can be achieved with sorghum cultivars under the limited irrigation conditions in future further study incorporating more forage sorghum cultivars greater soil profile depth and economy could provide more accurate insights on the adoptability

10577,in the semi arid texas high plains declining irrigation water supply hinders the profitable corn zea mays l silage production the principle feed ingredient of the beef and dairy industries drought tolerant and deep rooting crops like forage sorghum sorghum bicolor l and pearl millet pennisetum glaucum l could be an alternative to corn silage under limiting irrigation a field study was conducted during 2018 and 2019 at new deal tx to assess soil water depletion patterns water use efficiency wue and silage yield of forage sorghum pearl millet and corn under limited irrigation the experiment was conducted in split plot design with three irrigation levels i0 55 and 29 mm i1 172 and 147 mm and i2 323 and 260 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively as main plots and five cultivars p1498am corn af7401 and silo700d bmr sorghum and epic and exceed bmr pearl millet as sub plots with three replications the soil water depletion amount was greater in i0 105 and 57 mm followed by i1 60 and 37 mm and i2 44 and 13 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively fresh biomass yield was the greatest in i2 followed by i1 and i0 however the highest wue was achieved in i0 and i2 in 2018 and 2019 respectively water depletion depth was greater for sorghum and pearl millet plots 0 1 m than corn plots 0 0 6 m which resulted in greater water depletion amount in sorghum 75 and 31 mm and pearl millet 68 and 48 mm plots than corn 67 and 28 mm during 2018 and 2019 respectively average yield and wue were the highest in sorghum cultivars followed by pearl millet and corn results confirmed that the higher silage yield and wue can be achieved by sorghum compared to pearl millet and corn under limited irrigation conditions keywords deficit irrigation evapotranspiration semi arid silage crop soil water extraction 1 introduction frequent droughts erratic and low precipitation 350 550 mm and high evapotranspiration 1500 1750 mm et are the major concerns for agricultural sustainability in the semi arid environment of texas high plains thp bhandari et al 2018 bhandari et al 2020 twdb 2012 these conditions in the thp have necessitated heavy reliance on the ogallala aquifer a confined groundwater resource for successful crop production in most parts of the thp the annual water withdrawal rate for crop irrigation is much higher than the recharge which has resulted in a significant decline in the water table of the aquifer scanlon et al 2012 researchers predicted that if the current water withdrawal rate continues 35 of the currently irrigated land will not be able to support irrigated agriculture in the near future haacker et al 2016 in addition irrigation cost has increased as the water is pumped from deeper depths of the aquifer which is increasing the cost of agricultural production neupane and guo 2019 therefore there is a need to reduce the water footprints of irrigated crops to extend the life of the aquifer without compromising the agricultural sustainability in the region chaves and davies 2010 in the thp the concern is growing among the growers and researchers about the sustainability of beef and dairy industries which rely heavily on irrigated corn zea mays l for feedgrain and silage guerrero et al 2012 corn silage is the most preferred feed ingredient because of the greater portion of grain and high quality digestible energy bhattarai et al 2019 however a high water requirement and inability to cope with drought and heat under limited water supply are risking corn productivity steward et al 2013 hence there is a need for optimization of crop water use which can be achieved through adjusting crop phenology to its environment or by adopting integrated agronomic approaches such as planting drought heat tolerant crops application of deficit irrigation or site specific irrigation irrigation based on growth stage and weather conditions increasing precipitation storage capacity of the soil and planting crops that efficiently utilize stored soil water chaves and davies 2010 neupane and guo 2019 pala et al 2007 the rooting behavior of plant determines the capability to utilize the stored soil moisture which enhances the nutrients uptake while nutrients increase root size and its distribution ali et al 2019 studying the plant rooting behavior and soil water depletion patterns can provide insight of plants ability to tolerate water stress sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench and pearl millet pennisetum glaucum l r br are relatively drought and heat tolerant owing to their ability to utilize stored soil moisture more efficiently than corn bhattarai et al 2019 these crops produce considerable amounts of silage even under limited irrigation conditions and could serve as alternatives to corn silage in the thp sorghum produces large numbers of secondary roots and achieves rooting depth of 0 8 1 8 m whereas rooting depth of corn is shallower 0 7 1 4 m porter 2010 pearl millet also produces fewer but deeper roots than corn pearl millet roots can attained depth of 70 cm within 11 days after germination passot et al 2016 reaching up to 1 6 m faye et al 2019 however rooting depths varies with multiple factors such as soil characteristics cultivars and soil water availability faye et al 2019 although sorghum and pearl millet have an edge on yield performance and utilization of stored soil water efficiently in semi arid environments over corn silage quality of sorghum and pearl millet is somewhat poorer than corn miller and stroup 2003 introduction of the brown midrib bmr trait has enhanced the ruminal digestibility of forage sorghum and pearl millet by reducing the lignin component of plant cell wall concentration compared to non bmr type cherney et al 1991 higher lignin concentration in forage crops is undesirable as it resists microbial digestion in the rumen and therefore reduces enzyme access to the cell structural carbohydrates cherney et al 1991 the bmr trait is reported to reduce lignin concentration by up to 50 compared to similar non bmr types resulting in greater extent digestion of the forage fiber jung and allen 1995 thereby increasing weight gain and milk production per unit mass of forage fed casler and jung 2006 hence in environments where the availability of water is increasingly limited and difficult to predict assessing the ability of non traditional silage crops with the bmr trait to utilize available water compared to traditional crops like corn could provide a new crop option to the thp growers therefore the objective of this study was to assess soil water depletion patterns water use efficiency wue and silage yield of bmr forage sorghum bmr pearl millet and non bmr corn under variable levels of deficit irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted during summers of 2018 and 2019 at the new deal research farm 33 44 39 98 n 101 43 41 23 w and altitude of 995 m texas tech university new deal tx united states the experimental site is characterized as semi arid climate with mean annual precipitation of 469 mm a potential et of 1500 mm and an average annual maximum and minimum temperatures of 24 2 and 8 3 c respectively dhakal et al 2019 the soil type was classified as pullman clay loam fine mixed superactive thermic torrertic paleustolls with overlying calcium carbonate layer from 60 120 cm depth nrcs 2017 which is substantially impervious to roots growth the soil texture and bulk density of experimental field was sandy clay loam and 1 57 g cm 1 for the upper 0 20 cm depth and clay loam and 1 51 g cm 1 for lower 20 100 cm depth respectively singh 2019 similarly field capacity permanent wilting and saturated hydraulic conductivity were 0 25 m3 m 3 0 12 m3 m 3 and 80 7 cm d 1 for upper 20 cm and 0 23 m3 m 3 0 10 m3 m 3 and 44 7 cm d 1 for 20 100 cm soil layer respectively singh 2019 the soil ph and organic matter contents for upper 20 cm depth in adjacent field sites were 7 3 and 1 5 in 2018 and 7 5 and 1 8 in 2019 respectively 2 2 experimental description conventional tillage with a tractor mounted disk plow was performed to prepare the seedbed the experimental field was 180 m long and 24 m wide with an area of 0 42 ha the field was divided into three separate irrigation zones along the length spaced 1 m apart each irrigation zones were controlled individually for irrigation applications there were 45 plots of which 15 in each irrigation zone each plot was 11 m long and 8 m wide with eight rows spaced 1 m apart the planting was done on 25 may in 2018 and 15 may in 2019 using a four row planter model maxemerge xp john deere co however in 2019 replanting of sorghum and pearl millet was done on 27 may due to herbicide drift damage on sorghum and poor germination of pearl millet the pure live seeding rates used were 16 kg ha 1 for corn 9 kg ha 1 for sorghum and 3 5 kg ha 1 for pearl millet these seeding rates were recommended by the texas a m agrilife research and extension service for optimum silage production and resulted in an average of 65 000 240 000 and 275 000 plants ha 1 for corn sorghum and pearl millet respectively there were three targeted irrigation treatments i i0 50 mm ii i1 200 mm and iii i2 350 mm and five crop cultivars i af7401 bmr forage sorghum alta seed company irving tx ii

corteva agriscience wilmington de these cultivars were selected based on their adaptability to semi arid regions initially 50 mm of irrigation which was applied to all irrigation treatments and later added to their respective total irrigation amount was aimed to distribute equally for two weeks for better crop emergence before the start of actual irrigation treatments using subsurface drip irrigation netafim fresno ca the seasonal distribution of precipitation irrigation and cumulative precipitation and irrigation for each irrigation treatment are presented in fig 1 during 2018 the irrigation treatments were started at 20 days after planting dap however in 2019 irrigation treatments were started at 32 dap because of high rainfall events during early season also the irrigation wasterminated during the events of rainfall irrigation applied for i0 i1 and i2 were 55 172 and 323 mm in 2018 and 29 147 and 260 mm in 2019 respectively weeds were removed manually and the field was fertilized with 60 kg n ha 1 and 50 kg n ha 1 using 32 0 0 liquid fertilizer in 2018 and 2019 respectively these fertilizer amounts were applied considering the dry land forage production which was one of the treatments in this experiment and were kept constant for all the treatments there was no infestation by insect pests in corn and pearl millet however the insecticide sivanto flupyradifurone at 0 58 l ha 1 and prevathon chlorantraniliprole at 1 02 l ha 1 were applied to control sugarcane aphid melanaphis sacchari zehntner and armyworms complex spodoptera frugiperda j e smith and helicoverpa zea boddie respectively in sorghum in both years the final harvest of corn was done when the grain reached the half milk line stage on 3 september 101 dap in 2018 and 19 august 96 dap in 2019 similarly sorghum and pearl millet were harvested at the soft dough stage on 7 september 105 dap in 2018 and 31 august 96 dap in 2019 2 3 measurement of soil water content and water use efficiency volumetric water content m3 m 3 vwc was determined weekly using a capacitance probe model pr2 6 profile probe delta t devices ltd uk the calibration of data recorded from the capacitance probe was done using the equation given by dhakal et al 2019a access tubes for the pr2 probe were installed manually into the soil profile between the plant rows in each plot using the auguring kit provided by the manufacturer the vwc were recorded at 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 6 and 1 m depths the access tubes were installed at 13 dap in 2018 and 26 dap in 2019 soil water depth mm at each depth was calculated by multiplying vwc with depth increment mm and summed together to get the total water depth mm for one meter soil profile qi and helmers 2010 change in soil water storage δs was calculated weekly by subtracting the later measurement from the initial measurement of vwc and were summed to determine the seasonal change singh et al 2016b crop et was determined by using a water balance equation et p i δs d r where p is precipitation mm i is irrigation mm δs is the change in soil water storage mm d is drainage mm and r is runoff mm below root zone wang et al 2012 since the experimental field was level and irrigation was applied through subsurface drip and no excessive rainfall amounts were received throughout the cropping season runoff and drainage were assumed to be zero the wue was calculated at each biomass harvest using the equation wue y et where y is above ground biomass adjusted at 65 moisture kg ha 1 and et is evapotranspiration mm hao et al 2015 the above ground biomass was measured manually at every 15 days interval starting at 30 dap by harvesting the plants from 1 m2 area however the final biomass sample was harvested from 2 m2 area the weight of harvested samples were measured and kept in pre weighed bags then the samples were dried in a laboratory oven for 48 72 hours at 60 c until constant weight was achieved subsequently fresh biomass weight was adjusted to 65 moisture using the formula fresh biomass at 65 moisture unadjusted fresh biomass yield kg ha 1 x 100 actual moisture of harvested biomass 35 2 4 field design and statistical analysis the experiment was laid out in a blocked split plot design with irrigation treatment as the main plot factor and crop cultivar as a sub plot factor with three replications all the collected data were analyzed in r version 3 5 1 using agricolae package version 1 2 8 de mendiburu 2017 the effects of irrigation cultivar and their interaction were analyzed using analysis of variance with two error terms one for irrigation and other for cultivar and their interaction biomass et and wue were analyzed independently for each observation however soil water depletion was analyzed as repeated measure considering the dap as a factor the mean separation test was done with the least significant difference at 5 significance level graphs were prepared using sigmaplot version 14 systat software san jose ca 3 results and discussions 3 1 weather conditions during the growing season prevailing weather variables during the growing season play an important role in crop growth and performance during the cropping season may through august cumulative rainfall was 114 mm and 205 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 2 the seasonal rainfall was lower in 2018 and higher in 2019 compared to long term 1911 2008 average seasonal rainfall of 165 mm dhakal et al 2019 although the total amount of rainfall received in 2019 was much greater than 2018 the distribution of the rainfall was more uniform in 2018 than 2019 fig 2 the major portions of rainfall were concentrated in the months of june 32 and august 36 in 2018 which were the peak vegetative and reproductive stages of crops respectively however 77 of rainfall was concentrated during may to mid june in 2019 when the crops were in early vegetative stage and very little rainfall was received thereafter a similar rainfall was received in july of both years the average air temperature was higher in may and june of 2018 while it was similar in july of both years however in august the average air temperature was 1 9 c higher in 2019 than 2018 the stressful growing condition in 2019 which is clear from low rainfall and higher temperature at the terminal growth stage resulted in early maturity of corn and pearl millet leading to five biomass harvests in 2019 compared to six biomass harvests in 2018 3 2 initial soil water content volumetric soil water content for the 1 m soil profile depth among the irrigation treatments and cultivars are presented in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively the initial vwc measured at 13 dap in 2018 and 26 dap in 2019 were not significantly different down to 0 6 m soil profile depth however significantly lower vwc was observed in 2019 at 1 m depth compared to 2018 the average vwc for 0 0 6 m soil profile depth was 18 2 m3 m 3 and 17 6 m3 m 3 in 2018 and 2019 respectively similarly the vwc at 1 m depth was 23 8 m3 m 3 in 2018 and 19 2 m3 m 3 in 2019 a significant decrease in vwc value was observed at each depth increment down to 1 m soil profile depth with progressing growing season in all irrigation treatments in 2018 and in i0 in 2019 however the decrease in vwc value was significant only up to the depth of 0 0 6 m in i1 and i2 treatments with progressing growing season in 2019 fig 3 these results suggest that the water depletion depths did not vary in 2018 among the irrigation treatments however in 2019 water depletion depths varied among the dryland i0 and irrigated treatments i1 and i2 the shallower depth of water depletion in i1 and i2 in 2019 could be due to higher early season rainfall that wetted the upper soil profile compared to 2018 fig 2 this soil water storage from rainfall in 2019 might have fulfilled the needs of plants and prevented them from depleting water from deeper than 0 6 m hao et al 2015 stone et al 2001 and wang et al 2012 also observed depletion of soil water from shallower depth in corn sorghum and pulses crops respectively in the years when early season rainfall was higher than the years with lower early season rainfall in both years when comparing the first observation with the last observation soil water depletion was greater at each depth down to 1 m in i0 treatment compared to i1 and i2 and this water depletion was the lowest in the i2 treatment this suggested that the total soil water depletion amount along the 1 m soil profile decreased with increasing irrigation water supply a significant decrease in vwc value was observed among cultivar plots at each depth down to 1 m with progressing growing season in both years except for corn plot at 1 m in 2019 fig 4 in corn plot decrease in vwc value was greater from the 0 0 6 m depth increment and less from the 0 6 1 m depth increment in both years hao et al 2015 also observed the maximum water depletion depth of 0 6 0 8 m for corn under 50 et replacement irrigation however soil water depletion from the entire 1 m profile was observed in sorghum and pearl millet plots in both years the initial and final vwc values were similar in pearl millet and sorghum plots at 1 m in 2018 however in 2019 final vwc values was lower in pearl millet plots than sorghum plots fig 4 singh and singh 1995 also observed a similar trend of water depletion and conclude that under water limited conditions significant water depletion in corn occurs from the upper soil profile 0 0 45 m sorghum from the deeper soil profile 0 45 1 35 m and pearl millet from the entire soil profile 0 1 35 m overall soil water depletion amount among the crop cultivar plots was higher in 2018 than 2019 which could be explained by the more favorable growing season greater growth and yield which resulted in efficient utilization of soil water in 2018 compared to 2019 bhattarai 2019 hao et al 2015 and bhattarai et al 2020 also observed a decrease in plant growth and water depletion depth and amount in corn and safflower carthamus tinctorius l plots when plants were subjected to water deficit 3 3 total soil water depletion soil water depletion amount varied significantly among irrigation treatments as the growing season progressed in both years the amount of soil water depletion was greater in dryland i0 treatment followed by i1 and i2 in both years fig 5 the total soil water depletion amount for i0 i1 and i2 irrigation treatments were 105 59 and 43 mm in 2018 and 57 36 and 13 mm in 2019 respectively fig 5c and 5f hao et al 2015 also observed greater soil water depletion in corn from the most water stressed irrigation treatment in their experiment which was 50 et replacement compared to 75 and 100 et replacement this indicates that supplemental irrigation may not provide a chance for the plants to expand their root system which could be one of the reasons for the reduction of soil water depletion in i1 and i2 compared to i0 irrigation treatment significant differences in soil water depletion occurred among the irrigation treatments during the period of 13 60 dap and 26 61 dap fig 5a and 5d compared to the period of 60 105 dap and 61 96 dap fig 5b and 5e in 2018 and 2019 respectively the soil water depletion in i0 i1 and i2 irrigation treatments totaled 78 39 and 34 mm during 13 60 dap in 2018 and 42 27 and 9 mm during 26 61 dap in 2019 respectively fig 5a and 5d similarly total soil water depletion in i0 i1 and i2 irrigation treatments were 27 21 and 9 mm during 60 105 dap in 2018 and 15 9 and 4 mm during 61 96 dap in 2019 respectively fig 5b and 5e hao et al 2014 and vadez et al 2013 also reported the greater soil water depletion in corn and pearl millet field respectively during the early growth stage compared to the later growth stage this lower water depletion at later in the growing season could be attributed the lower water requirement of crops approaching maturity among the cultivars significant differences in soil water depletion amounts were observed during the crop growing season in both years fig 6 during the early crop growing season significant depletion of soil water took place from 0 0 6 m reaching down to 1 m soil profile later in the season fig 6 soil water depletion in corn plot totaled 67 and 29 mm during the growing season from 0 1 m profile of which 50 and 26 mm was from 0 0 6 m depth in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 6c and 6f however soil water depletion in sorghum af7401 and silo700d and pearl millet epic and exceed plots were significant up to 1 m depth in 2018 but not in 2019 on average averaging over the two cultivars of sorghum and pearl millet total water depletion from 0 1 m during the entire growing season was 75 and 31 mm for sorghum plots and 68 and 48 mm for pearl millet plots in 2018 and 2019 respectively sorghum and pearl millet plots depleted 22 and 19 mm of water at 1 m depth which was 29 and 11 greater than corn s plot depletion at that depth in 2018 similarly in 2019 soil water depletion at 1 m depth in sorghum pearl millet and corn plots were 3 7 and 4 mm respectively which was substantially lower than 2018 this lower water depletion in 2019 from deeper soil profile could be due to the shorter and more stressful growing conditions which reduced leaf area and plant growth thus reducing the transpiration and water uptake from deeper soil profile bhattarai 2019 zhou et al 2013 also suggested that shoot characteristics play equally important role in determining soil water depletion mcintyre et al 1995 observed the lower soil water depletion in pearl millet field under water deficit conditions and concluded that stress can result in poor root growth and distribution lowering the soil water depletion overall the amount of soil water depletion was greater in sorghum plot than pearl millet and corn plots during 2018 however soil water depletion in pearl millet plot was more than sorghum and corn plots in 2019 this difference in water depletion between sorghum and pearl millet plots was probably due to the difference in water depletion depth resulted from the difference in root density and distribution or root hydraulic characteristics hamblin and tennant 1987 vadez 2014 singh et al 2010 in a greenhouse study observed the greater concentration of corn roots in the upper soil profile depth 0 0 6 m whereas sorghum roots were concentrated at the deeper soil profile depth 0 6 1 2 m similarly passot et al 2016 observed the rooting depth of pearl millet down to 1 5 m this suggests that a soil profile study only going to 1 m may not be enough to differentiate the abilities to uptake soil water by pearl millet and sorghum 3 4 evapotranspiration fresh biomass yield and water use efficiency the et was significantly affected by irrigation treatments and it increased linearly as the growing season progressed in both years fig 7 a and 7d the total et varied significantly among the irrigation treatments at each observation period in 2018 however the differences in et due to irrigations were significant at 47 dap in 2019 the et was highest in the i2 treatment an intermediate in i1 treatment and the lowest in dryland i0 treatment during both years these trends were expected since i0 i1 and i2 received no irrigation intermediate irrigation and the highest irrigation in both years respectively hao et al 2015 also reported greater et values under higher irrigation treatments in corn by the end of the growing season et for i0 i1 and i2 was 274 346 and 480 mm in 2018 and 193 285 and 366 mm in 2019 respectively the et did not vary among the crop cultivars in 2018 but it varied significantly in 2019 fig 8 a and 8d in 2019 highest et was observed in corn followed by pearl millet cultivars and sorghum cultivars corn received a slightly higher amount of early season rainfall which sorghum and pearl millet did not receive due to replanting hence resulting in greater et in corn than sorghum and pearl millet the et was consistently higher for pearl millet cultivars than sorghum cultivar during 2019 however the et was slightly higher for sorghum than pearl millet during 2018 this higher et for sorghum in 2018 and pearl millet in 2019 is accordance with soil water depletion results fig 6 where more soil water depletion occurred in sorghum and pearl millet cultivars plots in 2018 and 2019 respectively djaman and irmak 2012 singh et al 2016b and wang et al 2012 also reported higher et in the treatments with greater soil water depletion in corn safflower and pulses crops respectively overall et was observed higher in 2018 than 2019 which could be due to higher irrigation amounts rainfall and water depletion amount in 2018 compared to 2019 fresh biomass yield was significantly different among the irrigation treatments at 75 dap in 2018 and 45 dap in 2019 fig 7b and 7e in both years the greatest fresh forage yield was consistently produced by i2 treatment intermediate by i1 treatment and the lowest by dryland i0 treatment at the final harvest i2 produced 36 8 mg ha 1 fresh silage yield which was 21 and 35 higher than i1 and i0 in 2018 respectively similarly in 2019 i2 produced 36 7 mg ha 1 of fresh silage yield which was 29 and 112 higher than i1 and i0 respectively fresh biomass growth rate increased with increasing water supply and was 0 34 0 41 and 0 46 mg ha 1 day 1 in 2018 and 0 23 0 37 and 0 54 mg ha 1 day 1 in 2019 for i0 i1 and i2 irrigation treatments respectively these results show that the increase in water availability helped promote the growth development and biomass yield of forage crops similar results have been observed in other irrigation studies where lower irrigation levels produced the lower yield and vice versa bhattarai et al 2020 enciso et al 2004 porter 2010 singh et al 2016a similarly a significant difference was observed among cultivars for fresh silage yield at 75 dap in 2018 and at all observation periods in 2019 fig 8b and 8e in 2018 at the final harvest sorghum cultivars produced the highest yield which was similar to pearl millet however corn produced lower biomass compared to sorghum and pearl millet similarly in 2019 sorghum outperformed the corn and pearl millet cultivars however yield was similar between corn and pearl millet cultivars fresh biomass yields were consistently higher for sorghum cultivar af7401 and was 35 0 and 31 3 mg ha 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively average growth rates of 0 42 0 41 and 0 38 mg ha 1 day 1 in 2018 and 0 44 0 35 and 0 32 mg ha 1 day 1 in 2019 were observed in sorghum pearl millet and corn cultivars respectively this indicated that the growth rate was higher for sorghum compared to pearl millet and corn cultivars the silage yield of sorghum and corn were low in this study compared to bell et al 2018 and xu et al 2015 respectively which could be due to the significantly lower application of irrigation and nitrogen input than the typical requirement similarly yield reported by jahansouz et al 2014 in 50 et replacement and the yield observed in this study were similar for corn sorghum and pearl millet but lower than the 75 and 100 et replacement similarly the yields of pearl millet in this study and that reported by machicek et al 2019 with 250 mm of irrigation for pearl millet was similar which might be due to similar irrigation amounts and research location differences in wue among the irrigation treatments were observed at 32 91 and 105 dap in 2018 and 47 and 96 dap in 2019 fig 7c and 7f this indicates that in both years difference in wue was observed at the vegetative stage and at near maturity in 2018 until 91 dap i1 irrigation treatment had the highest wue followed by i2 and i0 irrigation treatment however at the final harvest wue was highest for i0 followed by i1 and i2 irrigation treatments this indicated that further application of irrigation did not result in considerable biomass growth from 91 to 105 dap in irrigated treatments in 2018 fig 7b however dryland i0 treatment produced considerably higher biomass per unit of water used from 91 to 105 dap in response to the rain received at the last week of august fig 2a in 2018 whereas in 2019 wue was consistently higher for i2 followed by i1 and i0 irrigation treatment this higher wue of i0 in 2018 and lower in 2019 could be due to the greater fluctuation in the yield the yield was significantly lower in 2019 compared to 2018 in i0 treatment due to more stressful growing conditions in 2019 than 2018 the rainfall in 2019 was higher and was concentrated in the early season which was not fully utilized by the crops for yield formation compared to the lower but well distributed rainfall in 2018 kiziloglu et al 2009 also observed a variation in wue among the irrigation levels in silage corn and reported greater wue in fully irrigated treatment than deficit treatments similarly wue was significantly different among the cultivars at 73 dap in 2018 and 47 dap in 2019 in 2018 wue of the cultivars constantly increased until the final harvest fig 8c however this trend was not observed in 2019 fig 8f since et was similar among the crop cultivars we can infer that the difference in wue was due to the difference in the yield potential among the cultivars at the final harvest wue averaged among the cultivars was highest for sorghum cultivars 93 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2018 and 116 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2019 followed by pearl millet 92 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2018 and 87 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2019 and corn 81 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2018 and 76 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2019 enciso et al 2004 showed similar wue of forage sorghum 96 kg ha 1 mm 1 which was much higher than for corn 78 kg ha 1 mm 1 in the thp machicek et al 2019 also observed higher wue of forage sorghum compared to pearl millet under full irrigation in the thp similarly jahansouz et al 2014 observed lower wue in corn than sorghum and pearl millet under deficit irrigation conditions 4 conclusion soil water depletion patterns wue and fresh forage yield were significantly affected by irrigation treatments and cultivars the dryland i0 treatment depleted more soil water compared to i1 and i2 irrigated treatments higher et and fresh biomass yield were observed in i2 treatment followed by i1 and i0 treatment however wue was the highest in i0 irrigation treatment in 2018 and i2 in 2019 among cultivars a considerable amount of stored soil water depletion occurred from 0 0 6 m depth in corn plot however soil water depletion occurred from the entire 1 m soil profile in pearl millet and sorghum plots during both years also the overall amount of soil water depletion was lower in corn plots compared to sorghum and pearl millet plots in both years greater amounts of soil water depletion occurred from sorghum plots in 2018 and pearl millet plots in 2019 the et was not significantly different among the cultivars in 2018 but the differences were observed in 2019 despite the differences in et and soil water depletion amounts among cultivar plots the greatest wue were observed in sorghum followed by pearl millet and corn cultivars in both years indicating that the increased wue was due to increased biomass yield these results suggest that higher biomass yield and wue can be achieved from forage sorghum and pearl millet under limited irrigation condition as they can utilize stored soil profile water more efficiently by producing more yield per unit of water use compared to corn overall higher forage yield and wue can be achieved with sorghum cultivars under the limited irrigation conditions in future further study incorporating more forage sorghum cultivars greater soil profile depth and economy could provide more accurate insights on the adoptability

10578,although soil moisture sensor based automated irrigation systems enable researchers to grow plants efficiently and quantify drought stress via constant control of volumetric water content vwc growers in practice typically irrigate plants using excessive amounts of water based on their own experience herein we investigated the effects of four different irrigation strategies on the growth physiological responses and phenolic content of sweet basil ocimum basilicum three week old seedlings were grown using an automated irrigation system incorporating a soil moisture sensor and datalogger treatments comprised two irrigation strategies i maintaining a constant vwc of 0 30 0 45 or 0 60 m3 m 3 by applying small amounts of tap water over time and ii providing a fluctuating vwc 0 30 f in which a large amount of tap water was applied when the vwc decreased to below 0 30 m3 m 3 growth parameters were measured at 0 5 10 and 15 days after reaching a set point das and the total irrigation amount was measured at the end of the experiment shoot growth differed significantly among treatments with the highest values being recorded under the 0 60 treatment followed by the 0 45 0 30 f and 0 30 treatments physiological responses decreased under the 0 30 treatment but recovered with increasing das higher constant vwc treatments 0 45 and 0 60 were conducive to higher phenolic content with the lowest content obtained under the 0 30 f treatment although we detected no significant difference in average vwcs between the 0 45 and 0 30 f treatments 0 30 f treatment showed lower growth physiological responses and phenolic content collectively our findings indicate that basil plants with a higher yield and phenolic content can be obtained by maintaining a constantly high vwc 0 60 m3 m 3 than when they are provided with a lower or fluctuating vwc keywords soil moisture sensor ocimum basilicumautomated irrigation system efficient irrigation volumetric water content 1 introduction drought is one of the most important abiotic stresses and the main factor limiting plant growth boyer 1982 since it reduces both cell turgor pressure and elongation bayer et al 2016 drought is closely related to various plant physiological processes e g photosynthesis gene regulation enzymatic activity and secondary metabolite production and thus affects the growth rate and yield of plants khalid 2006 drought can affect the activities of certain enzymes related to photosynthesis including rubisco sucrose phosphate synthase and nitrate reductase and a wide range of genes that regulate atp synthesis or the photosynthetic light reactions chaves et al 2002 excessive production of reactive oxygen species ros can also be induced in response to drought meaning that plants regulate their expression of antioxidative enzymes and utilize the products of these enzymes i e antioxidants to maintain ros homeostasis thereby ensuring uninterrupted cellular metabolism wang et al 2016 these regulatory processes can be utilized to produce secondary metabolites many of which have high commercial value in this regard previous studies have shown that the amounts of the main constituents and a number of components in the essential oil of sweet basil ocimum basilicum are enhanced in these plants under drought conditions omidbaigi et al 2003 the stress associated with drought comprises a combination of contributory factors including drought severity rate of imposition and stress history and the responses of plants exposed to drought may vary depending on the nature of the imposed drought xu et al 2010 although in numerous studies drought stress has been induced by withholding irrigation applying solutes or controlling irrigation frequency most of the previously applied methods have simply involved withholding irrigation which might result in an excessively rapid development of drought conditions that are seldom experienced in agricultural practice the application of nacl or polyethylene glycol peg as osmoticum has been used as a drought treatment method in several studies however it has been noted that a more diverse range of genes related to photosynthesis are downregulated in response to saline stress than under drought stress alone since both dehydration and osmotic stress can co occur under saline stress conditions chaves et al 2009 furthermore although irrigation frequency is commonly manipulated to impose drought stress this approach has yet to be precisely quantified or controlled to enable accurate determinations of drought severity and processes khazaie et al 2008 sensoy et al 2007 moreover plants can acclimate to the imposition of drought thereby highlighting the need for a more comprehensive characterization of the drought phenomenon that would contribute to obtaining a better understanding of how plants respond to differing drought conditions to accurately control drought conditions soil moisture sensor based automated irrigation systems can be used to enable the imposition of different irrigation strategies kim et al 2014 using such systems the substrate water content can be constantly maintained at a specific threshold value and the physiological and molecular responses of plants can thus be evaluated with respect to more precisely defined drought stress conditions kim et al 2012 furthermore compared with timer or manual based automated irrigation systems automated irrigation systems based on soil moisture sensor reading outputs can be used to more efficiently reduce leaching and enhance plant water use efficiency wue however in commercial plant production growers generally irrigate plants sufficiently only when the substrate has become appreciably dry as it is believed that such temporary dryness has negligible negative effects on plants although plant responses to rehydration after withholding irrigation are well established nogués et al 2001 such responses could differ when maintaining substrate water content at a constant level or applying cyclic rehydration throughout the entire growth period and currently the responses of plants under these two conditions are insufficiently understood van iersel et al 2010 xu et al 2010 ocimum basilicum is often grown for its essential oil which can be used as a main ingredient of food pharmaceuticals and cosmetics lee et al 2005 several studies have sought to enhance the yield and secondary metabolite production of basil by controlling the environmental conditions in which it grows beaman et al 2009 mosadegh et al 2018 such studies have shown that mild to severe drought stress 75 and 50 of field capacity respectively can actually enhance the phenolic content of basil although sufficient irrigation 125 of field capacity is required for good growth ekren et al 2012 accordingly basil can be considered a suitable species for investigating the responses of plants to different irrigation strategies the primary purposes of this study were two fold namely to i investigate the growth and physiological responses and phenolic content of basil in response to different irrigation strategies and ii evaluate the adequacy and efficiency of fluctuating volumetric water content vwc relative to maintenance of a constant vwc the use of a fluctuating vwc mimics the conventional irrigation method used at commercial production sites whereas maintaining a constant vwc over time can be achieved using soil moisture sensor based automated irrigation systems 2 material and methods 2 1 plant materials and growth conditions basil seeds were sown in 128 cell plug trays containing a germinating substrate sunshine mix 5 sun gro horticulture agawam ma usa and 3 week old seedlings were transplanted into 10 cm plastic pots filled with a soilless substrate sunshine mix 4 sun gro horticulture mixed with a controlled release fertilizer multicote 6 haifa chemicals israel at a rate of 4 g l 1 during the acclimation period jul 23 aug 12 2018 all plants were irrigated daily by hand and 128 basil plants at the third true leaf stage were selected 3 weeks after transplanting pots were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replicates with each experimental unit comprising eight basil plants as sub replicates a soil moisture sensor based automated irrigation system was used to maintain the substrate vwc θ of the pots at 0 6 m3 m 3 until the start of experimental irrigation treatments prior to the initiation of treatments a further eight plants with similar growth state were harvested to provide samples representing the initial pre treatment growth condition plants were grown in a glass greenhouse at korea university seoul korea during the experiment the average daily

purposes of the present study we used a modified automated irrigation system using frequency domain reflectometry soil moisture sensors nemali and van iersel 2006 soil moisture sensors ec 5 meter

point θ 0 30 10 kpa 0 45 3 8 kpa or 0 60 2 kpa m3 m 3 at 20 min intervals fig 1 treatments comprised two irrigation strategies i maintaining a constant vwc 0 30 0 45 or 0 60 treatments in which a small amount of tap water was applied for 10 s 5 6 ml per application to maintain the intended vwc thresholds 0 30 0 45 and 0 60 m3 m 3 respectively over time and ii providing a fluctuating vwc 0 30 f treatment in which a large amount of tap water was applied for 220 s 122 ml per application when the vwc decreased to below 0 30 m3 m 3 the automated irrigation system was programmed to ensure that the plants were sufficiently irrigated and that no leaching occurred all treatments reached their respective set points 2 days after initiation of the experiment fig 2 the amount of irrigation water applied was logged daily and the total amount of irrigation was calculated as the sum of the daily irrigation amounts applied after the vwc had reached the set point 2 3 harvest and measurements two plants in each experimental unit were harvested at 0 5 10 and 15 days after the set point had been reached das as plant growth parameters we initially measured the shoot fresh weight and subsequently measured its dry weight after drying samples at 80 c for 3 days we also determined the number of leaves and measured the leaf area using a leaf area meter li 3100 li cor lincoln ne usa to measure leaf relative water content four leaf disks per plant were collected at noon using a 15 mm diameter cork borer and the fresh weight was measured immediately after collection leaf disks were floated on deionized water at 4 c for 6 h after which their turgid weights were measured leaf relative water content was calculated as fresh weight dry weight turgid weight dry weight at noon measurements of photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance were taken on the uppermost fully expanded leaves by using a portable photosynthesis system ciras 3 pp systems amesbury ma usa under a photosynthetic photon flux density of 800 μmol m 2 s 1 and a co2 concentration of 390 μmol mol 1 from the same pair of leaves we also measured the maximum quantum yield f v f m using a chlorophyll fluorometer junior pam heinz walz gmbh effeltrich germany after dark acclimation for 20 min 2 4 total phenolic concentration the total phenolic concentration of the basil leaves was determined using the folin ciocalteu assay ainsworth and gillespie 2007 approximately 0 2 g samples of the second uppermost leaves were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen these samples were subsequently ground with liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle and the resulting preparation was extracted with 3 ml of 80 acetone after incubation at 4 c for 12 h in the dark the extract samples were centrifugated at 5620 rpm for 2 min aliquots 100 μl of the supernatants were mixed with 270 μl of h2o 1 5 ml of 10 folin ciocalteu reagent sigma aldrich st louis mo usa and 1 2 ml of 7 5 na2co3 these mixtures were then heated for 15 min at 45 c in a water bath and their absorbances were measured at 765 nm using a uv visible spectrophotometer optizen pop mecasys korea the total phenolic concentration of each

plants from each experimental unit were used for measurements at each of the designated harvest times to analyze the data we used sas statistical software sas 9 4 sas institute cary nc usa to perform analysis of variance and when there was a significant difference at the p 0 05 level mean separation was conducted using tukey s honestly significant difference test to compare the means among the treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the automated irrigation system each pot was irrigated automatically using the soil moisture sensor based automated irrigation system as planned in those treatments designed to maintain a constant vwc at the set points of 0 30 0 45 and 0 60 m3 m 3 the actual vwc values recorded were 0 354 0 086 0 477 0 047 and 0 608 0 014 m3 m 3 mean sd respectively for the fluctuating vwc treatment the pots were irrigated when the vwc decreased to below the threshold level of 0 30 m3 m 3 with sufficient water being applied to reach the target vwc of approximately 0 60 m3 m 3 after irrigation fig 2 we found that using the soil moisture sensor based automated irrigation system enabled us to provide different irrigation strategies not only for constantly maintaining specific vwc levels over time but also for providing fluctuating vwcs this method is more comparable to the irrigation approach generally adopted by most growers in practical production the fluctuating vwc treatment with a threshold level of 0 30 m3 m 3 had an average vwc of 0 477 0 106 m3 m 3 which was essentially the same as maintaining irrigation at a level of 0 45 m3 m 3 fig 2 3 2 overall growth and water use the analysis of the growth parameters of basil plants revealed significant differences among the four irrigation treatments thereby indicating that vwc directly affects the biomass production of basil plants depending on the average vwc and irrigation process we observed that the fresh and dry weights of shoots on the last day of the experiment das 15 were the highest for the plants subjected to the 0 60 treatment followed by the 0 45 0 30 f and 0 30 treatments table 1 cell elongation is one of the most sensitive and immediate responses to drought and is heavily dependent on turgor potential which in turn is strongly related to the availability of water in the substrate hsiao 1973 as the primary response of plants under water deficit conditions cell expansion is inhibited drought stress growth parameter measurements obtained for plants subjected to the maintenance vwc treatments revealed reduced growth with decreasing vwc thresholds which is consistent with the findings of a previous study alishah et al 2006 however a comparison of plants subjected to the constant and fluctuating vwc conditions indicated that the shoot growth of plants in the 0 30 f treatment was less than that of plants irrigated in the 0 45 treatment even though the 0 30 f and 0 45 irrigation treatments provided similar average vwcs over the course of the experimental period although the number of leaves and leaf area also showed similar responses to those of shoot fresh and dry weights we detected no significant differences in these between the 0 60 and 0 45 treatments on the basis of these observations we can infer that a vwc in excess of 0 45 m3 m 3 3 8 kpa appears to be unnecessary for the efficient production of leaves which are the most economically important edible parts of basil plants although the 0 45 and 0 30 f treatments provided similar average vwcs over time the amount of irrigation water applied in the 0 30 f treatment was less than that used in the 0 45 treatment table 1 in this regard previous studies have shown that the total amount of irrigation water applied is closely correlated with the set point threshold used zhen and burnett 2015 and this is strongly related to plant growth as represented by the shoot dry weight kim and van iersel 2011 the soil moisture sensor based automated irrigation system ensures that substrate vwcs are maintained at a constant level even during vigorous plant growth when plants require more water and thus a higher frequency of irrigation is necessary to maintain the same set point thus the low total amount of irrigation water applied in the 0 30 f treatment does not necessarily imply that the fluctuating irrigation strategy can save more water than the constant 0 45 treatment given that we observed less growth of plants in response to the 0 30 f treatment than in the 0 45 treatment wue calculated as the shoot dry weight divided by the total amount of irrigation applied was found to be the highest in plants subjected to the 0 30 treatment although these plants showed very low productivity with respect to their yield the wue of plants in the 0 30 f treatment did not differ significantly from that of plants irrigated using the 0 45 treatment thereby indicating that in the absence of leaching the amount of irrigation water per application does not significantly affect the wue generally the wue showed no appreciable differences among the different vwc treatments as the total irrigation amount applied is proportional to the shoot dry weight ekren et al 2012 nevertheless our observations in the present study are consistent with the findings of numerous previous studies showing that deficit irrigation can enhance wue du et al 2010 rafi et al 2019 when taking into account the total amount of irrigation applied wue and yield we found that maintaining a vwc of 0 45 m3 m 3 was the most effective irrigation strategy to use for the production of basil 3 3 physiological responses drought not only reduces plant growth but also affects different physiological processes including photosynthesis eakes et al 1991 in the early stages of drought stress at das 0 basil plants receiving low vwc treatments showed a clearly reduced photosynthetic rate along with low stomatal conductance indicating they had reduced carbon uptake as a consequence of stomatal closure fig 3 a and b however even though the drought stress to which these plants were subjected was sustained over the course of the experiment we observed a gradual restoration of the photosynthetic activity of plants receiving the 0 30 f and 0 30 treatments indicating that plants could acclimate to these drought conditions in this regard it is well established that plants deploy a range of acclimation mechanisms to avoid drought stress and maintain their photosynthetic capacity yordanov et al 2000 nevertheless at das15 we observed that although plants subjected to the 0 30 treatment eventually recovered stomatal conductance through acclimation the photosynthetic rates of these plants remained significantly lower than those recorded in the other treatments which is thus likely to be owing to non stomatal limitation xu et al 2010 although photosynthetic inhibition is primarily ascribed to stomatal closure in response to prolonged and severe drought it can also be modulated via non stomatal responses for example reduction in chloroplast capacity and carboxylation efficiency can be induced by decreases in the regeneration of rubp and the amounts of functional rubisco in addition to limitations to stomatal and mesophyll conductance xu et al 2010 yordanov et al 2000 although the maximum quantum yield of photosystem ii psii and chlorophyll fluorescence f v f m in the plants in the 0 30 and 0 30 f treatment were found to be relatively lower at das 0 and 5 than those recorded in the treatments with higher vwc thresholds we observed that these recovered from das 10 onward fig 3c although chlorophyll fluorescence can be affected by drought stress mathobo et al 2017 psii activity is known to be less susceptible to drought than other physiological responses such as photosynthetic rate or transpiration rate starman and lombardini 2006 therefore the subsequent recovery that we observed indicates that there was comparatively little inhibition of the photosynthetic light reactions when the automated irrigation system was used changes in leaf relative water content were found to be similar to those characterizing other physiological responses fig 3d although we detected a reduction in the leaf relative water content of plants subjected to the 0 30 treatment at das 0 this soon recovered over time and by das 5 we recorded no significant difference among treatments indicating that the turgor potential of the leaves was adequately maintained in all experimental plants given that maintaining a constant vwc using an automated irrigation system can alleviate drought stress vwc levels per se might not be a representative quantitative indicator of drought severity kim et al 2012 in the current study although the 0 30 f treatment provided an average vwc similar to that obtained in the constant 0 45 treatment the plants in the 0 30 f treatment showed lower photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance than those subjected to the 0 45 treatment up until das 5 and then instead showed changes in their photosynthetic rates similar to those in plants receiving the 0 30 treatment therefore a more comprehensive characterization of the drought treatments applied might be needed to gain a better understanding of the drought related physiological responses of plants rather than using the average vwc during the entire growth period further not only the vwc threshold but also the amount of irrigation water used per application or the specific irrigation strategy applied may alter plant physiological activity under drought conditions 3 4 total phenolic concentrations pal activity and antioxidant capacity in the present study we used total phenolic concentrations pal activity and antioxidant capacity as indicators of the production of secondary metabolites by basil and found that these generally increased over time but at differing rates in the different treatments fig 4 at das 15 we found that among the maintenance vwc treatments the higher vwc treatments resulted in a higher total phenolic concentration pal activity and antioxidant activity however plants subjected to the 0 30 f treatment showed lower concentrations of phenolics than those receiving the constant 0 30 treatment despite plants in the former having higher growth and physiological parameters plants irrigated using the 0 45 and 0 60 treatments showed rapid increases in their total phenolic concentrations and vigorous growth whereas these remained relatively unchanged or increased only slightly over time in plants subjected to the 0 30 and 0 30 f treatments numerous studies have shown that high phenolic content can enhance the quality of plants and that phenolic levels can be altered by controlling environmental factors such as light quality and fertilization rate bantis et al 2016 zheljazkov et al 2008 in this regard it has previously been reported that although mild drought stress can result in a reduced yield of basil it can contribute to increases in the concentrations of both its essential oil and its constituents ekren et al 2012 simon et al 1992 however the results obtained in the present indicated contrasting effects with a lower phenolic content being detected in plants under drought conditions according to omidbaigi et al 2003 essential oil content increases concomitantly with increases in plant water deficit within a certain range from 100 to 70 of field capacity whereas a considerably lower essential oil content is obtained under severe drought conditions at 55 of field capacity likewise in satureja hortensis l which belongs to the same plant family lamiaceae as basil the amounts of certain types of oil constituents are reduced under moderate to severe water stress treatments on the basis of our observations we can thus infer that the 0 30 and 0 30 f treatments applied in the present study are probably insufficient for the synthesis of adequate amounts of phenolic constituents moreover we suspect that the vigorous growth of plants irrigated using the 0 45 and 0 60 treatments could be attributed to their high phenolic content thus a higher water content in plants contributes to accelerating their growth rates thereby enabling the plants to accumulate larger amounts of their phenolic constituents 4 conclusions in response to re watering plants subjected to drought can immediately recover to a pre drought state of growth and photosynthetic activity by re opening the stomata or generating new plant parts however the extent of their recovery is strongly dependent on the intensity and duration of pre drought conditions as well as the plant species and plant memory can also influence their responses to re watering xu et al 2010 with respect to the 0 30 f treatment applied in the present study irrigation was suspended until the vwc measurements had reached the 0 30 m3 m 3 level which on average occurred every 2 days in addition water is less available at matric potential values lower than 10 kpa which corresponded to the 0 30 m3 m 3 threshold used in this treatment montesano et al 2018 so this value might have been below the critical level of drought stress at which adequate growth and physiological activity can be limited in basil at most locations where basil is cultivated the practice of occasional irrigation is conventionally employed either as a water saving strategy or merely out of convenience however the results of the present study indicate that extending the interval between the occurrence of drought and re watering events could have negative repercussions in terms of both the quantity and quality of basil produced and we found that the fluctuating treatment did not enhance wue in basil leaves therefore unless the substrate vwc is below or above the specific thresholds that trigger severe drought stress or waterlogging of the substrate maintaining a constant vwc

10578,although soil moisture sensor based automated irrigation systems enable researchers to grow plants efficiently and quantify drought stress via constant control of volumetric water content vwc growers in practice typically irrigate plants using excessive amounts of water based on their own experience herein we investigated the effects of four different irrigation strategies on the growth physiological responses and phenolic content of sweet basil ocimum basilicum three week old seedlings were grown using an automated irrigation system incorporating a soil moisture sensor and datalogger treatments comprised two irrigation strategies i maintaining a constant vwc of 0 30 0 45 or 0 60 m3 m 3 by applying small amounts of tap water over time and ii providing a fluctuating vwc 0 30 f in which a large amount of tap water was applied when the vwc decreased to below 0 30 m3 m 3 growth parameters were measured at 0 5 10 and 15 days after reaching a set point das and the total irrigation amount was measured at the end of the experiment shoot growth differed significantly among treatments with the highest values being recorded under the 0 60 treatment followed by the 0 45 0 30 f and 0 30 treatments physiological responses decreased under the 0 30 treatment but recovered with increasing das higher constant vwc treatments 0 45 and 0 60 were conducive to higher phenolic content with the lowest content obtained under the 0 30 f treatment although we detected no significant difference in average vwcs between the 0 45 and 0 30 f treatments 0 30 f treatment showed lower growth physiological responses and phenolic content collectively our findings indicate that basil plants with a higher yield and phenolic content can be obtained by maintaining a constantly high vwc 0 60 m3 m 3 than when they are provided with a lower or fluctuating vwc keywords soil moisture sensor ocimum basilicumautomated irrigation system efficient irrigation volumetric water content 1 introduction drought is one of the most important abiotic stresses and the main factor limiting plant growth boyer 1982 since it reduces both cell turgor pressure and elongation bayer et al 2016 drought is closely related to various plant physiological processes e g photosynthesis gene regulation enzymatic activity and secondary metabolite production and thus affects the growth rate and yield of plants khalid 2006 drought can affect the activities of certain enzymes related to photosynthesis including rubisco sucrose phosphate synthase and nitrate reductase and a wide range of genes that regulate atp synthesis or the photosynthetic light reactions chaves et al 2002 excessive production of reactive oxygen species ros can also be induced in response to drought meaning that plants regulate their expression of antioxidative enzymes and utilize the products of these enzymes i e antioxidants to maintain ros homeostasis thereby ensuring uninterrupted cellular metabolism wang et al 2016 these regulatory processes can be utilized to produce secondary metabolites many of which have high commercial value in this regard previous studies have shown that the amounts of the main constituents and a number of components in the essential oil of sweet basil ocimum basilicum are enhanced in these plants under drought conditions omidbaigi et al 2003 the stress associated with drought comprises a combination of contributory factors including drought severity rate of imposition and stress history and the responses of plants exposed to drought may vary depending on the nature of the imposed drought xu et al 2010 although in numerous studies drought stress has been induced by withholding irrigation applying solutes or controlling irrigation frequency most of the previously applied methods have simply involved withholding irrigation which might result in an excessively rapid development of drought conditions that are seldom experienced in agricultural practice the application of nacl or polyethylene glycol peg as osmoticum has been used as a drought treatment method in several studies however it has been noted that a more diverse range of genes related to photosynthesis are downregulated in response to saline stress than under drought stress alone since both dehydration and osmotic stress can co occur under saline stress conditions chaves et al 2009 furthermore although irrigation frequency is commonly manipulated to impose drought stress this approach has yet to be precisely quantified or controlled to enable accurate determinations of drought severity and processes khazaie et al 2008 sensoy et al 2007 moreover plants can acclimate to the imposition of drought thereby highlighting the need for a more comprehensive characterization of the drought phenomenon that would contribute to obtaining a better understanding of how plants respond to differing drought conditions to accurately control drought conditions soil moisture sensor based automated irrigation systems can be used to enable the imposition of different irrigation strategies kim et al 2014 using such systems the substrate water content can be constantly maintained at a specific threshold value and the physiological and molecular responses of plants can thus be evaluated with respect to more precisely defined drought stress conditions kim et al 2012 furthermore compared with timer or manual based automated irrigation systems automated irrigation systems based on soil moisture sensor reading outputs can be used to more efficiently reduce leaching and enhance plant water use efficiency wue however in commercial plant production growers generally irrigate plants sufficiently only when the substrate has become appreciably dry as it is believed that such temporary dryness has negligible negative effects on plants although plant responses to rehydration after withholding irrigation are well established nogués et al 2001 such responses could differ when maintaining substrate water content at a constant level or applying cyclic rehydration throughout the entire growth period and currently the responses of plants under these two conditions are insufficiently understood van iersel et al 2010 xu et al 2010 ocimum basilicum is often grown for its essential oil which can be used as a main ingredient of food pharmaceuticals and cosmetics lee et al 2005 several studies have sought to enhance the yield and secondary metabolite production of basil by controlling the environmental conditions in which it grows beaman et al 2009 mosadegh et al 2018 such studies have shown that mild to severe drought stress 75 and 50 of field capacity respectively can actually enhance the phenolic content of basil although sufficient irrigation 125 of field capacity is required for good growth ekren et al 2012 accordingly basil can be considered a suitable species for investigating the responses of plants to different irrigation strategies the primary purposes of this study were two fold namely to i investigate the growth and physiological responses and phenolic content of basil in response to different irrigation strategies and ii evaluate the adequacy and efficiency of fluctuating volumetric water content vwc relative to maintenance of a constant vwc the use of a fluctuating vwc mimics the conventional irrigation method used at commercial production sites whereas maintaining a constant vwc over time can be achieved using soil moisture sensor based automated irrigation systems 2 material and methods 2 1 plant materials and growth conditions basil seeds were sown in 128 cell plug trays containing a germinating substrate sunshine mix 5 sun gro horticulture agawam ma usa and 3 week old seedlings were transplanted into 10 cm plastic pots filled with a soilless substrate sunshine mix 4 sun gro horticulture mixed with a controlled release fertilizer multicote 6 haifa chemicals israel at a rate of 4 g l 1 during the acclimation period jul 23 aug 12 2018 all plants were irrigated daily by hand and 128 basil plants at the third true leaf stage were selected 3 weeks after transplanting pots were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replicates with each experimental unit comprising eight basil plants as sub replicates a soil moisture sensor based automated irrigation system was used to maintain the substrate vwc θ of the pots at 0 6 m3 m 3 until the start of experimental irrigation treatments prior to the initiation of treatments a further eight plants with similar growth state were harvested to provide samples representing the initial pre treatment growth condition plants were grown in a glass greenhouse at korea university seoul korea during the experiment the average daily

purposes of the present study we used a modified automated irrigation system using frequency domain reflectometry soil moisture sensors nemali and van iersel 2006 soil moisture sensors ec 5 meter

münchen germany two soil moisture sensors for each experimental unit measured the vwc at 10 s intervals and the solenoid valves opened when the average vwc of the two sensors decreased to below a set point θ 0 30 10 kpa 0 45 3 8 kpa or 0 60 2 kpa m3 m 3 at 20 min intervals fig 1 treatments comprised two irrigation strategies i maintaining a constant vwc 0 30 0 45 or 0 60 treatments in which a small amount of tap water was applied for 10 s 5 6 ml per application to maintain the intended vwc thresholds 0 30 0 45 and 0 60 m3 m 3 respectively over time and ii providing a fluctuating vwc 0 30 f treatment in which a large amount of tap water was applied for 220 s 122 ml per application when the vwc decreased to below 0 30 m3 m 3 the automated irrigation system was programmed to ensure that the plants were sufficiently irrigated and that no leaching occurred all treatments reached their respective set points 2 days after initiation of the experiment fig 2 the amount of irrigation water applied was logged daily and the total amount of irrigation was calculated as the sum of the daily irrigation amounts applied after the vwc had reached the set point 2 3 harvest and measurements two plants in each experimental unit were harvested at 0 5 10 and 15 days after the set point had been reached das as plant growth parameters we initially measured the shoot fresh weight and subsequently measured its dry weight after drying samples at 80 c for 3 days we also determined the number of leaves and measured the leaf area using a leaf area meter li 3100 li cor lincoln ne usa to measure leaf relative water content four leaf disks per plant were collected at noon using a 15 mm diameter cork borer and the fresh weight was measured immediately after collection leaf disks were floated on deionized water at 4 c for 6 h after which their turgid weights were measured leaf relative water content was calculated as fresh weight dry weight turgid weight dry weight at noon measurements of photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance were taken on the uppermost fully expanded leaves by using a portable photosynthesis system ciras 3 pp systems amesbury ma usa under a photosynthetic photon flux density of 800 μmol m 2 s 1 and a co2 concentration of 390 μmol mol 1 from the same pair of leaves we also measured the maximum quantum yield f v f m using a chlorophyll fluorometer junior pam heinz walz gmbh effeltrich germany after dark acclimation for 20 min 2 4 total phenolic concentration the total phenolic concentration of the basil leaves was determined using the folin ciocalteu assay ainsworth and gillespie 2007 approximately 0 2 g samples of the second uppermost leaves were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen these samples were subsequently ground with liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle and the resulting preparation was extracted with 3 ml of 80 acetone after incubation at 4 c for 12 h in the dark the extract samples were centrifugated at 5620 rpm for 2 min aliquots 100 μl of the supernatants were mixed with 270 μl of h2o 1 5 ml of 10 folin ciocalteu reagent sigma aldrich st louis mo usa and 1 2 ml of 7 5 na2co3 these mixtures were then heated for 15 min at 45 c in a water bath and their absorbances were measured at 765 nm using a uv visible spectrophotometer optizen pop mecasys korea the total phenolic concentration of each

plants from each experimental unit were used for measurements at each of the designated harvest times to analyze the data we used sas statistical software sas 9 4 sas institute cary nc usa to perform analysis of variance and when there was a significant difference at the p 0 05 level mean separation was conducted using tukey s honestly significant difference test to compare the means among the treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the automated irrigation system each pot was irrigated automatically using the soil moisture sensor based automated irrigation system as planned in those treatments designed to maintain a constant vwc at the set points of 0 30 0 45 and 0 60 m3 m 3 the actual vwc values recorded were 0 354 0 086 0 477 0 047 and 0 608 0 014 m3 m 3 mean sd respectively for the fluctuating vwc treatment the pots were irrigated when the vwc decreased to below the threshold level of 0 30 m3 m 3 with sufficient water being applied to reach the target vwc of approximately 0 60 m3 m 3 after irrigation fig 2 we found that using the soil moisture sensor based automated irrigation system enabled us to provide different irrigation strategies not only for constantly maintaining specific vwc levels over time but also for providing fluctuating vwcs this method is more comparable to the irrigation approach generally adopted by most growers in practical production the fluctuating vwc treatment with a threshold level of 0 30 m3 m 3 had an average vwc of 0 477 0 106 m3 m 3 which was essentially the same as maintaining irrigation at a level of 0 45 m3 m 3 fig 2 3 2 overall growth and water use the analysis of the growth parameters of basil plants revealed significant differences among the four irrigation treatments thereby indicating that vwc directly affects the biomass production of basil plants depending on the average vwc and irrigation process we observed that the fresh and dry weights of shoots on the last day of the experiment das 15 were the highest for the plants subjected to the 0 60 treatment followed by the 0 45 0 30 f and 0 30 treatments table 1 cell elongation is one of the most sensitive and immediate responses to drought and is heavily dependent on turgor potential which in turn is strongly related to the availability of water in the substrate hsiao 1973 as the primary response of plants under water deficit conditions cell expansion is inhibited drought stress growth parameter measurements obtained for plants subjected to the maintenance vwc treatments revealed reduced growth with decreasing vwc thresholds which is consistent with the findings of a previous study alishah et al 2006 however a comparison of plants subjected to the constant and fluctuating vwc conditions indicated that the shoot growth of plants in the 0 30 f treatment was less than that of plants irrigated in the 0 45 treatment even though the 0 30 f and 0 45 irrigation treatments provided similar average vwcs over the course of the experimental period although the number of leaves and leaf area also showed similar responses to those of shoot fresh and dry weights we detected no significant differences in these between the 0 60 and 0 45 treatments on the basis of these observations we can infer that a vwc in excess of 0 45 m3 m 3 3 8 kpa appears to be unnecessary for the efficient production of leaves which are the most economically important edible parts of basil plants although the 0 45 and 0 30 f treatments provided similar average vwcs over time the amount of irrigation water applied in the 0 30 f treatment was less than that used in the 0 45 treatment table 1 in this regard previous studies have shown that the total amount of irrigation water applied is closely correlated with the set point threshold used zhen and burnett 2015 and this is strongly related to plant growth as represented by the shoot dry weight kim and van iersel 2011 the soil moisture sensor based automated irrigation system ensures that substrate vwcs are maintained at a constant level even during vigorous plant growth when plants require more water and thus a higher frequency of irrigation is necessary to maintain the same set point thus the low total amount of irrigation water applied in the 0 30 f treatment does not necessarily imply that the fluctuating irrigation strategy can save more water than the constant 0 45 treatment given that we observed less growth of plants in response to the 0 30 f treatment than in the 0 45 treatment wue calculated as the shoot dry weight divided by the total amount of irrigation applied was found to be the highest in plants subjected to the 0 30 treatment although these plants showed very low productivity with respect to their yield the wue of plants in the 0 30 f treatment did not differ significantly from that of plants irrigated using the 0 45 treatment thereby indicating that in the absence of leaching the amount of irrigation water per application does not significantly affect the wue generally the wue showed no appreciable differences among the different vwc treatments as the total irrigation amount applied is proportional to the shoot dry weight ekren et al 2012 nevertheless our observations in the present study are consistent with the findings of numerous previous studies showing that deficit irrigation can enhance wue du et al 2010 rafi et al 2019 when taking into account the total amount of irrigation applied wue and yield we found that maintaining a vwc of 0 45 m3 m 3 was the most effective irrigation strategy to use for the production of basil 3 3 physiological responses drought not only reduces plant growth but also affects different physiological processes including photosynthesis eakes et al 1991 in the early stages of drought stress at das 0 basil plants receiving low vwc treatments showed a clearly reduced photosynthetic rate along with low stomatal conductance indicating they had reduced carbon uptake as a consequence of stomatal closure fig 3 a and b however even though the drought stress to which these plants were subjected was sustained over the course of the experiment we observed a gradual restoration of the photosynthetic activity of plants receiving the 0 30 f and 0 30 treatments indicating that plants could acclimate to these drought conditions in this regard it is well established that plants deploy a range of acclimation mechanisms to avoid drought stress and maintain their photosynthetic capacity yordanov et al 2000 nevertheless at das15 we observed that although plants subjected to the 0 30 treatment eventually recovered stomatal conductance through acclimation the photosynthetic rates of these plants remained significantly lower than those recorded in the other treatments which is thus likely to be owing to non stomatal limitation xu et al 2010 although photosynthetic inhibition is primarily ascribed to stomatal closure in response to prolonged and severe drought it can also be modulated via non stomatal responses for example reduction in chloroplast capacity and carboxylation efficiency can be induced by decreases in the regeneration of rubp and the amounts of functional rubisco in addition to limitations to stomatal and mesophyll conductance xu et al 2010 yordanov et al 2000 although the maximum quantum yield of photosystem ii psii and chlorophyll fluorescence f v f m in the plants in the 0 30 and 0 30 f treatment were found to be relatively lower at das 0 and 5 than those recorded in the treatments with higher vwc thresholds we observed that these recovered from das 10 onward fig 3c although chlorophyll fluorescence can be affected by drought stress mathobo et al 2017 psii activity is known to be less susceptible to drought than other physiological responses such as photosynthetic rate or transpiration rate starman and lombardini 2006 therefore the subsequent recovery that we observed indicates that there was comparatively little inhibition of the photosynthetic light reactions when the automated irrigation system was used changes in leaf relative water content were found to be similar to those characterizing other physiological responses fig 3d although we detected a reduction in the leaf relative water content of plants subjected to the 0 30 treatment at das 0 this soon recovered over time and by das 5 we recorded no significant difference among treatments indicating that the turgor potential of the leaves was adequately maintained in all experimental plants given that maintaining a constant vwc using an automated irrigation system can alleviate drought stress vwc levels per se might not be a representative quantitative indicator of drought severity kim et al 2012 in the current study although the 0 30 f treatment provided an average vwc similar to that obtained in the constant 0 45 treatment the plants in the 0 30 f treatment showed lower photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance than those subjected to the 0 45 treatment up until das 5 and then instead showed changes in their photosynthetic rates similar to those in plants receiving the 0 30 treatment therefore a more comprehensive characterization of the drought treatments applied might be needed to gain a better understanding of the drought related physiological responses of plants rather than using the average vwc during the entire growth period further not only the vwc threshold but also the amount of irrigation water used per application or the specific irrigation strategy applied may alter plant physiological activity under drought conditions 3 4 total phenolic concentrations pal activity and antioxidant capacity in the present study we used total phenolic concentrations pal activity and antioxidant capacity as indicators of the production of secondary metabolites by basil and found that these generally increased over time but at differing rates in the different treatments fig 4 at das 15 we found that among the maintenance vwc treatments the higher vwc treatments resulted in a higher total phenolic concentration pal activity and antioxidant activity however plants subjected to the 0 30 f treatment showed lower concentrations of phenolics than those receiving the constant 0 30 treatment despite plants in the former having higher growth and physiological parameters plants irrigated using the 0 45 and 0 60 treatments showed rapid increases in their total phenolic concentrations and vigorous growth whereas these remained relatively unchanged or increased only slightly over time in plants subjected to the 0 30 and 0 30 f treatments numerous studies have shown that high phenolic content can enhance the quality of plants and that phenolic levels can be altered by controlling environmental factors such as light quality and fertilization rate bantis et al 2016 zheljazkov et al 2008 in this regard it has previously been reported that although mild drought stress can result in a reduced yield of basil it can contribute to increases in the concentrations of both its essential oil and its constituents ekren et al 2012 simon et al 1992 however the results obtained in the present indicated contrasting effects with a lower phenolic content being detected in plants under drought conditions according to omidbaigi et al 2003 essential oil content increases concomitantly with increases in plant water deficit within a certain range from 100 to 70 of field capacity whereas a considerably lower essential oil content is obtained under severe drought conditions at 55 of field capacity likewise in satureja hortensis l which belongs to the same plant family lamiaceae as basil the amounts of certain types of oil constituents are reduced under moderate to severe water stress treatments on the basis of our observations we can thus infer that the 0 30 and 0 30 f treatments applied in the present study are probably insufficient for the synthesis of adequate amounts of phenolic constituents moreover we suspect that the vigorous growth of plants irrigated using the 0 45 and 0 60 treatments could be attributed to their high phenolic content thus a higher water content in plants contributes to accelerating their growth rates thereby enabling the plants to accumulate larger amounts of their phenolic constituents 4 conclusions in response to re watering plants subjected to drought can immediately recover to a pre drought state of growth and photosynthetic activity by re opening the stomata or generating new plant parts however the extent of their recovery is strongly dependent on the intensity and duration of pre drought conditions as well as the plant species and plant memory can also influence their responses to re watering xu et al 2010 with respect to the 0 30 f treatment applied in the present study irrigation was suspended until the vwc measurements had reached the 0 30 m3 m 3 level which on average occurred every 2 days in addition water is less available at matric potential values lower than 10 kpa which corresponded to the 0 30 m3 m 3 threshold used in this treatment montesano et al 2018 so this value might have been below the critical level of drought stress at which adequate growth and physiological activity can be limited in basil at most locations where basil is cultivated the practice of occasional irrigation is conventionally employed either as a water saving strategy or merely out of convenience however the results of the present study indicate that extending the interval between the occurrence of drought and re watering events could have negative repercussions in terms of both the quantity and quality of basil produced and we found that the fluctuating treatment did not enhance wue in basil leaves therefore unless the substrate vwc is below or above the specific thresholds that trigger severe drought stress or waterlogging of the substrate maintaining a constant vwc would appear to be a more suitable irrigation strategy than using fluctuating irrigation for the production of high quality basil with a higher phenolic content meanwhile the findings of this study may also be adapted to other species that have longer growing cycles to further investigate the effects of different irrigation processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

10579,in response to uncertainties and complexities in the irrigation water management systems this study presents an improved interval based fuzzy credibility constrained programming iifccp model for optimizing the allocation of irrigation water resources under uncertainty mathematical techniques of interval parameter programming ipp improved fuzzy credibility constrained programming ifccp and interval crop water production functions icwpfs are incorporated into a modeling framework for irrigation planning thus this model has the following several advantages in irrigation water management first it can not only address interval and fuzzy uncertainties but also analyze tradeoffs between irrigation water amount and agricultural production returns to maximize the agricultural economic benefits second it further improves upon existing studies on deterministic cwpfs by using the icwpfs to reflect uncertain information in the practical applications third it makes a novel attempt to explore weight coefficients i e the proportion of possibility in estimating credibility to represent various preferences of decision makers fourth it provides more flexible strategies by considering various weight coefficients and credibility levels then the proposed model is applied to a case study of irrigation water management in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin northwest china therefore optimal decision solutions for the allocation of irrigation water under different scenarios i e the combinations of three water levels four credibility levels and nine weight coefficients will be obtained and analyzed a greater system benefits will be achieved at a high weight coefficient and a low credibility level especially weight coefficients are assigned as 0 8 and 0 9 additionally these solutions can provide detailed tradeoffs among system benefits credibility levels and weight coefficients comparisons with the results from deterministic cwpfs and conventional fccp method indicate that the iifccp method has an enhanced practical applicability in actual irrigation water management under uncertainty conditions in arid areas keywords fuzzy mathematical programming weight coefficient credibility level irrigation water resources allocation decision making 1 introduction globally the contradictions among the lack of water resources the growing demand for agricultural grain production and the shortage of water available for agriculture become increasingly prominent tilman et al 2002 mueller et al 2012 kang et al 2017 furthermore the shortage of water resources is gradually becoming the primary and critical factor that restricts the regional social and economic development agricultural irrigation as the main measure to promote agricultural production in arid or semi arid areas has been receiving extensive and sustained attention in fact agricultural water use is a major sector accounting for a considerable part of the total water consumption reaching to more than 60 in china and nearly 90 in northwest china aznar sánchez et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 these implemented management practices for irrigation water resources may affect the agricultural income returns for instance excessive or less irrigation water for a certain crop can cause reductions of crop yields thereby decreasing agricultural benefits moreover unreasonable irrigation management pattern may also be a non negligible force of regional environmental degradations from the perspective of sustainable agriculture the research on agricultural irrigation management has changed from the maximum crop yields to the maximum irrigation benefits or agricultural water productivity wichelns 2014 therefore how to maximize agricultural economic returns and generate desired allocation solutions of irrigation water is of critical importance a sound planning practice of rational allocation and utilization of irrigation water resources is essential for potentially promoting agricultural production in agricultural systems crop water production function cwpf is usually adopted as the basis to optimize the allocation of irrigation water in models for irrigation planning kipkorir et al 2002 generally these empirical cwpfs e g linear and quadratic forms can be obtained by regression analysis method of experimental field data i e crop yield and actual evapotranspiration or irrigation water supply however due to the uncertain factors arising from calculation methods observation errors and measurement methods the deterministic cwpfs may have potential errors and can hardly fully reflect the results of experimental data li et al 2016a zhang et al 2018 such a difficulty can be overcome by interval crop water production functions icwpfs accordingly interval mathematical programming imp is a promising method for addressing such an optimization framework by integration the icwpfs and other interval parameters or variables for instance tong and guo 2013 estimated the icwpfs of four crops using interval regression analysis method and applied them to establish optimal irrigation water allocation model li et al 2016a proposed an uncertain irrigation water allocation model using interval linear fractional programming based on the estimation of icwpfs however apart from these interval uncertainties existing in agricultural systems some parameters such as available water and allowable water loss are linked with environmental loading capacities that are subject to human judgments they are more suitable for fuzzy membership functions expression xu and qin 2010 furthermore the fuzzy linguistic terms are easily acceptable in the decision making process such as approximate value and approximately equal to zeng et al 2010 in response to these fuzzy problems fuzzy mathematical programming fmp can be potentially introduced to represent objectives and constraints of optimization model compared with stochastic mathematical programming method guo et al 2018 hu et al 2018 morar et al 2018 fmp can readily generate effective solutions with a low computational requirement and a high computational efficiency as a typical type of the fmp fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp is an effective method for handling fuzzy uncertainties and constraint violation issues the constraints of the fccp will be satisfied at a given fuzzy credibility level which is similar to its mathematical counterpart i e stochastic chance constrained programming theoretically the fccp was initially proposed arising from the concept of credibility measure liu and liu 2002 the primary advantage of credibility measure is its self duality which is not the characteristic of possibility measure and necessity measure the reason that credibility is self dual is that when credibility level is equal to 1 fuzzy events will inevitably occur while when credibility level arrives at 0 fuzzy events will certainly not occur huang 2006 therefore this method has been applied in various real world practices for example zhang et al 2012 developed an integer fuzzy credibility constrained programming model by combining integer programming into fuzzy credibility constrained programming for power system management zeng et al 2014 established a two stage credibility constrained programming with hurwicz criterion method for water resources management li et al 2018 proposed an inexact credibility chance constrained integer programming for greenhouse gas mitigation management under uncertainty however there is a concern of the aforementioned fccp methods that the concept of credibility is proposed arising from the definition of adopting the average of possibility and necessity indicating that both possibility and necessity have the same contribution degree to the credibility which may be inapplicable to practical problems generally different decision makers will indeed possess their subjective judgments and preferences about the contribution degree of possibility and necessity in the process of determining credibility level which is defined as weight coefficients in this study to make up this disadvantage an improved fuzzy credibility constrained programming ifccp is developed through the weight coefficients to represent the choice of decision makers between possibility and necessity i e the proportion of possibility γ and necessity 1 γ in credibility the ifccp extends the traditional fccp methods by exploring the weight coefficients from a specially designated value i e 0 5 to a wide range of values i e 0 1 0 in this case a fixed weight coefficient at γ 0 5 is chosen in the modeling formulation of the fccp which has been proven to be a special but typical case in the ifccp it is obvious that the ifccp has an enhanced applicability to handle the vague parametric information expressed as fuzzy uncertainties it is proven to be applied to practical applications for dealing with fuzzy information and providing optimal solutions at different satisfactory levels li et al 2015 zhang and guo 2017 nevertheless few attempts to incorporate the ifccp method and the icwpfs within an optimization modeling framework for irrigation water planning have been undertaken thus the primary objective of this study is to develop such a novel optimization framework namely an improved interval based fuzzy credibility constrained programming iifccp approach for supporting optimal irrigation strategies under uncertainty it is derived from incorporating ipp ifccp and icwpfs into a general model aimed to optimize the allocation of irrigation water this study presents the following favorable reasons to further facilitate irrigation water management first it deals with both subjective uncertainties e g human induced judgments and decision makers preferences and objective uncertainties e g related elements in crops market conditions and irrigation systems second it incorporates the icwpfs into optimization framework to enhance its applicability third it explores the range of weight coefficients to represent more choices of decision makers four it provides more

satisfactory degree of constraints i e the combination of credibility levels and weight coefficients have been generated correspondingly tradeoffs among system benefits credibility levels and weight coefficients will be analyzed these results are expected to help decision makers to accomplish optimal irrigation water management and promote sustainable agricultural production under uncertainty in arid areas fig 1 illustrates the general framework of this study 2 methodology in this section four subsections will be presented with the following details 2 1 interval crop water production functions linear forms of the icwpfs are introduced in this study they are presented as y a e t b where y denotes harvested crop yield kg ha e t is the actual evapotranspiration or irrigation water apply m3 ha a and b are empirically fitted coefficients the superscripts and represent the upper and lower bounds of interval parameters and variables then to calculate icwpfs for different study crops an interval regression analysis method is used to analyze the measured experimental field data tanaka and lee 1998 tong and guo 2013 li et al 2016a zhang et al 2018 2 2 improved fuzzy credibility constrained programming the detailed derivation process of the conventional fccp method is presented in appendix a however both possibility and necessity are assigned as the same contribution in determining the credibility which may have limitation in practical problems because of imprecise information to overcome its limitation an improved fuzzy credibility constrained programming ifccp method is proposed via different weight coefficients to balance the tradeoff between possibility γ and necessity 1 γ within credibility zhang and guo 2017 the weight coefficient is defined as the proportion or contribution degree of possibility in calculating credibility obviously the ifccp has extended weight coefficient to a wide range of values indicating that more choices can be provided taking the weight coefficients ranging from 0 1 to 0 9 to illustrate the calculation process for example give two fuzzy variables a i j a 1 a 2 a 3 and b i b 1 b 2 b 3 with fuzzy membership function μ x where fuzzy membership function is defined by using triangular fuzzy variable r 1 r 2 r 3 the formula of μ x is defined 1a μ x x r 1 r 2 r 1 if r 1 x r 2 x r 3 r 2 r 3 if r 2 x r 3 0 otherwise 1 if the weight coefficient is at 0 2 γ 0 2 its constraint can be defined 1b c r a b 0 2 p o s a b 0 8 n e c a b based on the definition of credibility measure see appendix a equation 4 j two scenarios are related to the expressions of credibility first scenario 1 is presented as 1c c r a b 2 a 3 10 a 2 10 b 2 2 b 1 10 a 3 a 2 b 2 b 1 a 2 b 2 a 3 b 1 then we have 1d 2 10 λ i a 3 10 λ i 10 a 2 10 λ i 10 b 2 2 10 λ i b 1 second scenario 2 is presented as 1e c r a b 2 b 3 a 1 10 b 3 b 2 a 2 a 1 a 2 b 2 a 1 b 3 then we have 1f 10 λ i a 2 10 λ i 2 a 1 10 λ i 2 b 3 10 λ i b 2 2 similarly if the weight coefficient is at 0 8 γ 0 8 the constraints can be expressed 1g c r a b 0 8 p o s a b 0 2 n e c a b scenario 1 1h 8 10 λ i a 3 10 λ i 10 a 2 10 λ i 10 b 2 8 10 λ i b 1 scenario 2 1i 10 λ i a 2 10 λ i 8 a 1 10 λ i 8 b 3 10 λ i b 2 these two scenarios are derived from the condition of 1 μ i λ i 0 5 for eq 1c and eq 1e there is a difficulty in identifying whether the credibility level of them is greater than 0 5 i e c r a b 0 5 accordingly both scenario 1 and 2 should be examined to identify which one can generate feasible solutions when solving the model and which one is the superior solution at the same weight coefficients in the practical meanings therefore based on two risk related parameters including credibility levels and weight coefficients more flexible solutions can be generated and thus various choices can be provided from the ifccp model nevertheless few previous efforts of the ifccp method on optimal irrigation water management problems have been undertaken 2 3 improved interval based fuzzy credibility constrained programming therefore to address above concerns mathematical techniques of the interval parameters programming ipp improved fuzzy credibility constrained programming ifccp and interval crop water production functions icwpfs are incorporated into a general optimization framework thus an improved interval based fuzzy credibility constrained programming iifccp model is developed for irrigation water management under uncertainty 2a max f j 1 n c j y j subject to 2b c r j 1 n a i j x j b i λ i i 1 m 2c x j 0 j

solution method therefore the detailed steps to solve the iifccp model are summarized as follows step 1 calculate the icwpfs through interval regression analysis method aiming at the collected field experimental data step 2 consider the interval and fuzzy uncertainties in practical applications take the icwpfs as the optimization framework to formulate the iifccp model step 3 transform the iifccp model into the upper and lower bounds of submodels the upper bound submodel will be first solved f because the objective function is to maximize system benefits step 4 for the upper bound submodel convert these fuzzy credibility constraints into deterministic ones by giving a weight coefficient γ these derivation processes are presented in eqs 2c and 2e step 5 give a certain credibility level λ

into the lower bound submodel then the corresponding feasible solutions can be generated f o p t and x j o p t step 7 repeat steps 3 6 under different combinations of weight coefficients and credibility levels interval solutions about the iifccp model can be finally obtained f o p t f o p t f o p t and x j o p t x j o p t x j o p t 3 case study 3 1 study area and problem statement the heihe river basin is the second largest arid inland river basin in northwest china it covers an area of 142 900 km2 the midstream area of the hrb between the controlled hydrological stations of the yingluoxia and zhengyixia is selected as the study area as shown in fig 2 the study area mainly includes three subareas including ganzhou district gz linze county lz and gaotai county gt it s a highly developed agricultural area known as national commodity grain production base in china its annual average temperature is 7 6 c and annual average precipitation is less than 200 mm but annual average pan evaporation is greater than 2000 mm zhao et al 2018 from march to september approximately 90 of yearly precipitation occurs which is almost in line with the crop growing season accordingly high water consuming agriculture dominates a large portion of economic share of the study area grain crops and economic crops are popularly cultivated and irrigated economic crops the general term including fruits and vegetables can produce more economic value compared with grain crops such as spring wheat and maize in the study area the crop production cycle mainly range from march to october the study area possesses sufficient sunshine and abundant land resources but the water resources are the key limiting factor for agricultural development thus irrigation is an effective measure to satisfy crop water demands and further alleviate water shortages and promote agricultural production crops are irrigated by surface water and groundwater due to low precipitation the surface water is delivered from the heihe river into the fields via multi layered canal networks groundwater is extracted from the multiple wells into the end canals and then conveyed into the fields for compensating the insufficiency of surface water jiang et al 2016 moreover approximately 90 of total water consumption in the midstream area lies in agricultural water consumption li et al 2016b zhang et al 2019 flood and furrow methods i e traditional irrigation methods are commonly used by farmers during the crop growing season from march to october there are usually four or five times of irrigation an additional winter irrigation is carried out in november to ensure proper soil moisture conditions for seeding growth in the coming year nearly all the main canals are lined but part of the secondary and other canals are not lined thus there are a part of irrigation water losses during water conveyance moreover deep percolation occurs due to excessive water deliveries and over irrigation in some areas thereby leading to lower management level and disorder regulation pattern of canal conveyance jiang et al 2015 in the actual irrigation water management system charge for irrigation water is usually calculated by irrigation area e g yuan mu farmers have a disposition to irrigate more water during each irrigation period such a lack of water control and unified irrigation water management practice will inevitably lead to unbalanced irrigation water applied e g water waste or water shortage in different areas resulting in the reduction of crop yields and economic losses therefore possible solutions should be undertaken to optimize and allocate the limited irrigation water to different crops for each subarea reasonably considering uncertainties in the study system a sound irrigation water management practice under uncertainty is essential for promoting agricultural production 3 2 modelling formulation in this study the problems to be systematically considered are 1 how to estimate the icwpfs for the study crops and formulate the optimization model 2 how to allocate the irrigation water to each subarea and crop to maximize system benefits resulting from agricultural production under uncertainty 3 how to obtain optimal solutions among different satisfactory levels 4 how to investigate the variation of optimal solutions under different weight coefficients credibility levels and water levels remarkably there is an assumption that the icwpfs are the same among three subareas in fact water resources are the most critical limiting factor and thus soil types and other characteristics of the study area are not considered therefore an improved interval based fuzzy credibility constrained programming iifccp model is developed in response to above concerns 3 2 1 objective function 3a max f i 1 3 j 1 3 a i j n b i j c p i j a j s w i j g w i j p e i d p i b j i 1 3 j 1 3 a i j c s i s w i j η s c g i g w i j η g where f is the objective function

at the combinations of different weight coefficients and credibility levels under high medium and low water levels can be generated through the solution steps see section 2 4 3 3 input data acquisition and processing input parameters are collected and calculated basically including crop data water availabilities and market conditions each detailed subsection is presented as follows table 1 provides the icwpfs for spring wheat maize and economic crops the field experimental data on crop yield and irrigation water apply come from li 2005 the interval regression results of each study crop are referred to li 2017 an interval regression analysis method was employed to estimate the corresponding icwpfs for each study crop the weight of k 1 1 and k 2 0 0001 was used to calculate the icwpfs for the purpose of a central tendency of the regression results li et al 2016a table 2 provides the available surface water and groundwater for agricultural irrigation fuzzy numbers are used to represent the surface water and groundwater availabilities under high medium and low water levels which are the input parameters on the right hand side of constraints the triangular fuzzy number is typically used to represent the fuzzy events i e a i j a 1 a 2 a 3 where a 1 is the least possible value a 2 is the main value and a 3 is the most possible value the division of three inflow levels is based on the frequency analysis method li et al 2016b including low level p 75 medium level 25 p 75 and high level p 25 t distribution method with the 95 confidence level was used to estimate the range of water availability under each inflow level interval estimations where the lower limits were used as the least possible values while the upper limits represent the most possible values the mean of each inflow is considered as the main values therefore a triangular fuzzy number for water availability is obtained for each water level in terms of groundwater availability the least possible main and the most possible values are accordingly calculated based on the minimum mean and the maximum values of the samples historical statistical data of pumped groundwater tables 3 and 4 provide the crop irrigation water demands and k c values of the crops daily meteorological data are obtained from three meteorological stations including zhangye no 52562 linze no 52557 and gaotai no 52546 where they are located in the midstream area yin et al 2012 moreover the effective precipitation is collected from the observation data of above three meteorological stations under three water levels see table 3 table 5 provides basic input parameters for solving the iifccp optimization model they are generally collected from other references and statistical data considering the rates of surface water and groundwater loss during water conveyance as triangular fuzzy numbers due to its imprecise definition and they are ξ s 0 20 0 25 0 30 and ξ g 0 10 0 15 0 20 respectively 4 results analysis generally a potential way to reflect the decision makers subjective judgment is to predefine different semantic levels for the satisfaction degree of feasibility in fuzzy decision making analysis zadeh 1975 jiménez et al 2007 established a fuzzy linguistic scale to distinguish credibility levels from λ 0 to λ 1 0 in detail λ 0 7 represents a very acceptable solution λ 0 8 means an almost acceptable solution λ 0 9 denotes a practically acceptable solution and λ 1 0 is completely acceptable solution the practical meaning of a higher credibility level is associated with less system benefits and higher degrees of feasibility which is a conservative and reliable attitude on environmental loading capacities at a lower system failure risk level weight coefficients are defined as the contribution degree of the possibility in credibility which can balance the tradeoff between possibility and necessity ranging from γ 0 to γ 1 0 the practice meaning is when the weight coefficient takes a larger value of the fuzzy event the objective function will be more likely to be satisfied if the local managers pursue greater economic benefits higher weight coefficient will be assigned therefore to investigate and compare the variations of obtained results under high medium and low water levels in this study four credibility levels i e λ 0 7 0 8 0 9 1 0 and nine weight coefficients i e γ 0 1 0 9 are introduced into the iifccp model moreover each weight coefficient is associated with two types of scenarios regarding the fuzzy credibility constraints including scenario 1 and scenario 2 while two submodels including the upper and lower bounds of submodels can further be obtained for each scenario thus a total of 432 submodels that are required to be solved and then 216 sets of optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation have been provided for supporting agricultural production because the developed iifccp model integrates the ifccp method and the icwpfs into a general optimization framework naturally the advantages of both techniques will compatibly be inherited as the ifccp method can deal with violation of system constraints and examine the satisfaction of constraints it can generate and provide the corresponding optimal solutions at the combinations of different weight coefficients and credibility levels icwpfs are used to reflect more uncertain and practical information in the collected field experimental data therefore deterministic and interval solutions will coexist in these results reflecting the effects of different forms of uncertainties on the optimization model 4 1 optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation plan table 6 provides the comparison results for optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation through the iifccp model between scenario 1 and scenario 2 under medium water level and credibility level λ 0 7 the results include the allocated surface water and groundwater patterns for the three subareas and three crops when the weight coefficient increases from γ 0 1 to γ 0 9 it is obvious that crops in lz and gt subareas are totally irrigated by surface water in scenarios 1 and 2 with the change of weight coefficient the results show that surface water in such subareas are given priority due to its lower water use cost therefore the variations of weight coefficient have no effect on the allocated groundwater in lz and gt subareas moreover the amount of allocated surface water for economic crops in lz and gt subareas are the same following different weight coefficients i e 5203 5 7040 1 m3 ha and 6264 6 8475 7 m3 ha respectively in comparison there is a complementarity between allocated surface water and groundwater in gz subarea because crops are irrigated by surface water and groundwater for example the allocated surface water and groundwater in scenario 1 for spring wheat is 752 0 m3 ha and 1551 3 m3 ha for maize is 3944 9 m3 ha and 1336 6 3200 7 m3 ha and for economic crops is 2811 4 m3 ha and 1891 9 3551 9 m3 ha when γ 0 1 in terms of the results in gz subarea when weight coefficient is raised from γ 0 1 to γ 0 9 the amount of allocated surface water is increased but allocated groundwater is decreased similarly the results of spring wheat and maize in lz subarea and spring wheat in gt subarea present the same increasing trend this can be explained by the mathematical meaning of weight coefficient a high weight coefficient means possibility has an increasingly important influence on calculating credibility which will naturally lead to a greater degree of satisfaction of constraints and thus the decision space for water availability is expanded because the objective is to maximize system economic benefits more surface water will be applied for irrigation than groundwater based on the structure of objective function of optimization model the results from table 6 show that their changing trends corresponding to different weight coefficients are the same as the scenario 1 see table 6 however the allocated irrigation water including surface water and groundwater in scenario 2 are generally less than that in scenario 1 from γ 0 1 to γ 0 4 and from γ 0 8 to γ 0 9 furthermore it is noted that the results in scenario 1 and scenario 2 are the same at γ 0 5 and γ 0 7 for example when γ 0 5 in scenario 1 and scenario 2 solutions in gz subarea are the same namely 1172 7 1130 5 m3 ha surface water groundwater for spring wheat 4143 2 1138 3 3002 3 m3 ha for maize and 3116 1 1587 2 3247 2 m3 ha for economic crops this is because the structure of fuzzy constraints is equivalent at the combination of these two weight coefficients and credibility level e g λ 0 7 and γ 0 7 in both two scenarios table 7 presents optimal irrigation water allocation solutions under medium water level and weight coefficient γ 0 5 this is to compare the impact of changes associated with different credibility levels i e λ 0 7 0 8 0 9 1 0 on results generally credibility level is closely linked with the satisfaction degree of constraints with an increased credibility level the constraints become enhanced with a higher system reliability level and a lower violation constraint risk level in this case surface water availabilities would decrease but stimulate increased groundwater availability more groundwater would be pumped taking economic crops in gz subarea as an example the results are 3116 1 1587 2 3247 2 m3 ha λ 0 7 2673 5 1950 0 4186 3 m3 ha λ 0 8 2579 7 2029 8 4489 8 m3 ha λ 0 9 and 1703 3 2177 0 2223 7 4683 7 m3 ha λ 1 0 therefore from λ 0 7 to λ 1 0 the results of allocated surface water in gz subarea for three crops are decreased but increased groundwater consumption it is clear that the results in gt subarea are not sensitive to the changing of credibility level table 8 shows optimal solutions under credibility level λ 0 9 and weight coefficient γ 0 5 this is to examine the influence of changes related to different water levels on results the main difference among three water levels are the amount of available water and irrigation water demands i e high medium low compared with medium and low water levels in practice there are more available surface water and thus groundwater is less pumped under high water level if the available water is relatively sufficient more irrigation water will be allocated for irrigation to achieve the maximum system benefits for example from high water level to low water level the allocated surface water in gz lz and gt subareas are decreased moreover only crops in gz subarea are irrigated by surface water and groundwater while crops in lz and gt subareas is merely irrigated by surface water similarly results analysis of optimal irrigation water allocation solutions from the other scenarios can be interpreted these results can support analysis of tradeoffs between irrigation water amount and agricultural production returns to reflect the complexities of agricultural systems therefore by introducing weight coefficients into the conventional fccp method more feasible solutions have been generated to facilitate irrigation water management this will naturally broad and enrich the scope of decision making following the human induced judgment and preference of the decision makers 4 2 system benefits the objective function of this study is to maximize system benefits from agricultural production under different scenarios to examine and compare the results at the combinations of credibility level and weight coefficients fig 3 illustrates an overview of system benefits under medium water level and scenario 1 it can be clearly seen that both the upper and lower bounds of system benefits are increased along with an increased weight coefficient e g γ 0 1 0 9 overall it presents a disproportionate grow rate for system benefits with weight coefficient increases in detail system benefits experience a slight increase when the weight coefficient is raised from 0 1 to 0 5 conversely there is a significant increase from γ 0 6 to γ 0 9 similar patterns can be seen at credibility level λ 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 taking λ 0 8 as an example system benefits resulting from the iifccp model would increase from 2 476 7 582 109 yuan γ 0 1 to 2 492 7 604 109 yuan γ 0 5 the grow rate of the lower and upper bounds of the objective functions are approximately 0 6 and 0 3 respectively while the results are increased from 2 502 7 615 109 yuan γ 0 6 to 2 564 7 727 109 yuan γ 0 9 the grow rate of the lower and upper bounds are 2 47 and 1 46 this is almost five times that at weight coefficients ranging from γ 0 1 to γ 0 5 it shows that the larger the weight coefficient is the more significant the impact on the results is moreover the results at different credibility levels are also different in other words the greater the credibility level the smaller the objective function for example for a certain weight coefficient γ 0 5 system benefits are 2 516 7 627 109 yuan λ 0 7 2 492 7 604 109 yuan λ 0 8 2 480 7 580 109 yuan λ 0 9 2 468 7 554 109 yuan λ 1 0 this is determined by the mathematical definition of fuzzy credibility constrained programming a credibility level represents a satisfaction of constraints and the corresponding confidence for optimization results it thus will result in a smaller decision space for the realization of objective function at a higher credibility level it is noted that system benefits remain unchanged along with different weight coefficients at credibility level λ 1 0 this is because the constraints are totally satisfied in that case and thus weight coefficients have no effects on the results fig 4 a d present the comparison of system benefits between scenario 1 and scenario 2 under medium water level the upper bounds of system benefits are selected to examine the differences between scenario 1 and scenario 2 and the results of other water levels can be similarly interpreted in general all the results increase with the increase of the weight coefficient which indicates that the increase of the possibility weight can satisfy the constraints to a greater extent leading to the increase of the objective function values it is worth noting that when the weight coefficient is equal to 0 5 the results of the two scenarios are the same indicating that the model and constraint structure of the two scenarios are equivalent at γ 0 5 thus the same results can be obtained in other words results at γ 0 5 is only a special case among solutions resulted from the iifccp model reflecting that the iifccp model can extend to more different cases besides system benefits in scenario 2 are lower than that in scenario 1 at γ 0 1 0 4 when the weight is greater than 0 5 the growth rate of scenario 1 is relatively faster than that of scenario 2 in particular circumstances the results of the two scenarios will be the same for example the results of two scenarios are the same at the combinations of λ 0 7 and γ 0 7 similar results can be seen at λ 0 8 and γ 0 8 λ 0 9 and γ 0 9 λ 1 0 and γ 1 0 because of their equivalent constraints taking the combinations of λ 0 8 and γ 0 8 as an example to demonstrate the transformation process in terms of the fuzzy credibility constraints in scenario 1 10 0 8 a 2 10 0 8 8 a 1 10 0 8 8 b 3 10 0 8 b 2 a 2 b 2 e g λ 0 8 and γ 0 8 likewise fuzzy credibility constraints in scenario 2 8 10 0 8 a 3 10 0 8 10 a 2 10 0 8 10 b 2 8 10 0 8 b 1 e g λ 0 8 and γ 0 8 a 2 b 2 understandable there are two intersection points in fig 4a d thereby proving the interactions between the combinations of credibility levels and weight coefficients under specific situations in practice it is found that not all the scenarios are totally satisfied and feasible when both scenario 1 and scenario 2 are satisfied at the same weight coefficients more optimal solutions corresponding to greater objective function values should be selected as potential alternatives therefore the obtained results can present tradeoffs among system benefits weight coefficients and credibility levels fig 5 presents system benefits under different water levels and credibility levels γ 0 5 it is apparent that both the upper and lower bounds of system benefits under a higher water level are greater than that of a lower water level e g f o p t low f o p t medium f o p t high from a management perspective more available water resources will produce more economic benefits in summary the iifccp model can provide various solutions under different water levels credibility levels and weight coefficients these results can support in depth analysis of the interrelationships among system benefits water levels credibility levels and weight coefficients thereby assisting decision makers in better understanding the uncertainties in the study system and further facilitating irrigation water management 5 discussion in this study the iifccp model is developed by incorporating the ifccp method and icwpfs within a general optimization framework thus its practical applicability is undoubtedly enhanced for addressing interval and fuzzy uncertainties existing in the agricultural systems the following contents are the detailed discussion 5 1 comparison with the results from deterministic cwpfs the deterministic solution can be obtained through a deterministic optimization model where the deterministic cpwfs are selected as the general framework of optimization model for irrigation planning and other interval parameters are taken their mean values as input parameters taking the results under medium water level as an example for comparison between deterministic and icwpfs four credibility levels and nine weight coefficients are given to generate the corresponding results therefore optimal solutions resulting from deterministic cwpfs can be generated in general these results present a similar changing trend along with the weight coefficient changes however it is obvious that the results based on deterministic cwpfs are only deterministic values within interval solutions resulting from the iifccp model showing that these results are inflexible in fact there are many uncertainties in agricultural irrigation systems it is thus more reasonable to express the decision variables or parameters as intervals or other uncertainties which can provide more flexible solutions within the range of the feasible solutions furthermore it can be proved again by the system benefits presented in fig 6 indicating that the deterministic cpwfs are the special case in the icwpfs the results indicate that the icwpfs are superior to deterministic ones as the basic framework of optimization irrigation water management model therefore the developed model improves upon the existing studies on deterministic cwpfs 5 2 comparison with the conventional fccp method to overcome the limitations arising from the conventional fccp method weight coefficient derived from possibility to credibility measure is introduced into the iifccp model theoretically credibility is defined by adopting the average of possibility and necessity meaning that weight coefficients of the possibility and necessity in credibility are 0 5 respectively in this study the iifccp model extends a specific designed value to a generalized range i e 0 1 namely it can further be divided into more scenarios related to different weight coefficients at the same credibility level to facilitate decision making by contrast the conventional fccp method can merely address fuzzy problems at γ 0 5 which is a fixed value and single weight coefficient in fact different weight coefficients are useful for analyzing uncertain system conditions in practical applications in detail when the weight coefficient is fixed at γ 0 9 which means that the possibility takes 90 possession of the credibility and thus possibility has a greater impact on satisfying the objective function this is the reason why the objective function value at γ 0 9 is higher than that of γ 0 5 li et al 2015 instead when the weight coefficient is fixed at γ 0 1 predictable consequences and opposite results can be obtained it is more informative and expected to quantify system risk levels by introducing various weight coefficients to analyze the system situations therefore in the process of irrigation water management planning with more possibility represents a positive preference for water availability whereas it would lead to potential risk of violating the constraints when the available water is not sufficient willingness to accept more necessity indicates that decision makers have conservative irrigation water management plans which may cause unavoidable risk that irrigation water resources are wasted without being fully allocated and utilized zhang and guo 2017 actually the iifccp model can represent three kinds of methods including possibility i e γ 1 0 necessity i e γ 0 and credibility i e γ 0 5 along with the changing weight coefficients and different satisfactory levels of constraints therefore the iifccp model can provide more feasible and flexible results which can clearly illustrate the interrelationships among possibility necessity and credibility measures it is thus proved that the iifccp model has an enhanced practical applicability to deal with irrigation water allocation problems under uncertainty 6 conclusions an improved interval based fuzzy credibility constrained programming iifccp model is developed for supporting irrigation water management under uncertainty mathematical techniques including interval parameter programming ipp improved fuzzy credibility constrained programming ifccp and interval crop water production functions icwpfs are incorporated into a modeling framework the following potential advantages are presented to facilitate irrigation water management first it can deal with fuzzy and interval uncertainties existing in the constraints and objective function of the model second interval crop water production functions cwpfs is estimated to reflect more uncertain information of the practical applications it improves upon existing studies based on deterministic cwpfs third it makes a novel attempt to explore weight coefficients to represent the various preferences of decision makers fourth it can provide more flexible decision solutions by considering various weight coefficients and credibility levels the developed iifccp model is then applied to a real world case study in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin located in northwest china to demonstrate its applicability therefore various optimal solutions under different weight coefficients credibility levels and water levels have been generated and the variations of results among different satisfactory levels of constraints have been further investigated the obtained results from the case study indicate that 1 crops in lz and gt subareas are totally irrigated by surface water 2 optimal surface water allocation is increased but the allocated groundwater is decreased in gz subarea with the weight coefficients increase 3 a higher weight coefficient and a lower credibility level under high water level will lead to a greater system benefits 4 the icwpfs are superior to deterministic ones as the basic framework of optimization irrigation water management model and 5 the iifccp model is a representative method with an enhanced practical applicability compared with the conventional fccp method these results can assist decision makers in better facilitating optimal irrigation water management and support sustainable agricultural production under uncertainty in arid areas although this is an application in irrigation water management problems the iifccp can also be applicable to other environmental and resources management problems under interval and fuzzy uncertainties for future research seasonal response of crop yield to irrigation water under different crop growth stages should be incorporated into the optimization model which can further enhance its applicability and effectiveness declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

greatly improved this manuscript appendix a solution process of the conventional fccp method three types of measures including possibility necessity and credibility are effective for handling fuzzy information the credibility measure was initially proposed by liu and liu 2002 to overcome the limitation of the possibility and necessity measures it s defined by taking the mean value of both of them it has an advantage in identifying whether a fuzzy event will certainly occur or not based on this concept a fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp method is formulated to address these fuzzy uncertainty moreover by giving varying credibility levels it can also examine the satisfaction of constraints thus this problem can be presented 4a max f j 1 n c j x j subject to 4b c r j 1 n a i j x j b i λ i i 1 m 4c x j 0 j 1 n where c j is non fuzzy coefficient of objective x j is real number decision variables j is the number of variables j 1 n a i j and b i are fuzzy coefficients of constraints i is the number of constraints i 1 m eq 4b means that at credibility level λ i the fuzzy credibility constraint should be satisfied based on the eq 1a two fuzzy variables a i j a 1 a 2 a 3 and b i b 1 b 2 b 3 with fuzzy membership function μ x are presented the formula of μ x is written 4d μ x x r 1 r 2 r 1 if r 1 x r 2 x r 3 r 2 r 3 if r 2 x r 3 0 otherwise moreover the definition of possibility of a fuzzy event i e p o s a b is presented 4e p o s a b sup min μ a x μ b y x y ℜ x y the mathematical equation can be defined using triangular fuzzy variables 4f p o s a b 1 if a 2 b 2 b 3 a 1 b 3 b 2 a 2 a 1 if a 2 b 2 a 1 b 3 0 if a 1 b 3 similarly the necessity of a fuzzy event i e n e c a b represents the impossibility of the opposite event its definition is 4g n e c a b inf max μ a x 1 μ b y x y ℜ x y the mathematical formula can be defined using triangular fuzzy variables 4h n e c a b 1 if a 3 b 1 b 2 a 2 a 3 a 2 b 2 b 1 if a 2 b 2 a 3 b 1 0 if a 2 b 2 however both possibility measure and necessity measure have limitations because they are not self dual the credibility measure was thus proposed to make up their limitations therefore the definition of credibility is 4i c r a b 1 2 p o s a b n e c a b therefore the definition can be presented using triangular fuzzy variables 4j c r a b 1 if a 3 b 1 a 3 2 a 2 2 b 2 b 1 2 a 3 a 2 b 2 b 1 if a 2 b 2 a 3 b 1 b 3 a 1 2 b 3 b 2 a 2 a 1 if a 2 b 2 a 1 b 3 0 if a 1 b 3 according to the rules of fuzzy operations in terms of credibility constraint 4b we have 4k j 1 n a i j x j j 1 n a i j 1 x j j 1 n a i j 2 x j j 1 n a i j 3 x j let triangular fuzzy variables z i z i 1 z i 2 z i 3 replace j 1 n a i j x j thus constraint 4b can be transformed into 4l c r z i b i λ i i 1 m 1 thus μ i c r t i b i can represent the credibility of variable b i for z i understandably the effective and meaningful credibility level should not be less than 0 5 therefore 1 μ i λ i 0 5 for each fuzzy credibility constraint we have 4m z i 3 2 z i 2 2 b i 2 b i 1 2 z i 3 z i 2 b i 2 b i 1 λ i then we have 4n 1 2 λ i z i 3 2 λ i 1 z i 2 2 λ i 2 b i 2 1 2 λ i b i 1 subsequently by replacing z i by j 1 n a i j x j the fccp problem can be solved therefore the crisp equivalent inequalities of credibility constrained constraints can be obtained 
10579,in response to uncertainties and complexities in the irrigation water management systems this study presents an improved interval based fuzzy credibility constrained programming iifccp model for optimizing the allocation of irrigation water resources under uncertainty mathematical techniques of interval parameter programming ipp improved fuzzy credibility constrained programming ifccp and interval crop water production functions icwpfs are incorporated into a modeling framework for irrigation planning thus this model has the following several advantages in irrigation water management first it can not only address interval and fuzzy uncertainties but also analyze tradeoffs between irrigation water amount and agricultural production returns to maximize the agricultural economic benefits second it further improves upon existing studies on deterministic cwpfs by using the icwpfs to reflect uncertain information in the practical applications third it makes a novel attempt to explore weight coefficients i e the proportion of possibility in estimating credibility to represent various preferences of decision makers fourth it provides more flexible strategies by considering various weight coefficients and credibility levels then the proposed model is applied to a case study of irrigation water management in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin northwest china therefore optimal decision solutions for the allocation of irrigation water under different scenarios i e the combinations of three water levels four credibility levels and nine weight coefficients will be obtained and analyzed a greater system benefits will be achieved at a high weight coefficient and a low credibility level especially weight coefficients are assigned as 0 8 and 0 9 additionally these solutions can provide detailed tradeoffs among system benefits credibility levels and weight coefficients comparisons with the results from deterministic cwpfs and conventional fccp method indicate that the iifccp method has an enhanced practical applicability in actual irrigation water management under uncertainty conditions in arid areas keywords fuzzy mathematical programming weight coefficient credibility level irrigation water resources allocation decision making 1 introduction globally the contradictions among the lack of water resources the growing demand for agricultural grain production and the shortage of water available for agriculture become increasingly prominent tilman et al 2002 mueller et al 2012 kang et al 2017 furthermore the shortage of water resources is gradually becoming the primary and critical factor that restricts the regional social and economic development agricultural irrigation as the main measure to promote agricultural production in arid or semi arid areas has been receiving extensive and sustained attention in fact agricultural water use is a major sector accounting for a considerable part of the total water consumption reaching to more than 60 in china and nearly 90 in northwest china aznar sánchez et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 these implemented management practices for irrigation water resources may affect the agricultural income returns for instance excessive or less irrigation water for a certain crop can cause reductions of crop yields thereby decreasing agricultural benefits moreover unreasonable irrigation management pattern may also be a non negligible force of regional environmental degradations from the perspective of sustainable agriculture the research on agricultural irrigation management has changed from the maximum crop yields to the maximum irrigation benefits or agricultural water productivity wichelns 2014 therefore how to maximize agricultural economic returns and generate desired allocation solutions of irrigation water is of critical importance a sound planning practice of rational allocation and utilization of irrigation water resources is essential for potentially promoting agricultural production in agricultural systems crop water production function cwpf is usually adopted as the basis to optimize the allocation of irrigation water in models for irrigation planning kipkorir et al 2002 generally these empirical cwpfs e g linear and quadratic forms can be obtained by regression analysis method of experimental field data i e crop yield and actual evapotranspiration or irrigation water supply however due to the uncertain factors arising from calculation methods observation errors and measurement methods the deterministic cwpfs may have potential errors and can hardly fully reflect the results of experimental data li et al 2016a zhang et al 2018 such a difficulty can be overcome by interval crop water production functions icwpfs accordingly interval mathematical programming imp is a promising method for addressing such an optimization framework by integration the icwpfs and other interval parameters or variables for instance tong and guo 2013 estimated the icwpfs of four crops using interval regression analysis method and applied them to establish optimal irrigation water allocation model li et al 2016a proposed an uncertain irrigation water allocation model using interval linear fractional programming based on the estimation of icwpfs however apart from these interval uncertainties existing in agricultural systems some parameters such as available water and allowable water loss are linked with environmental loading capacities that are subject to human judgments they are more suitable for fuzzy membership functions expression xu and qin 2010 furthermore the fuzzy linguistic terms are easily acceptable in the decision making process such as approximate value and approximately equal to zeng et al 2010 in response to these fuzzy problems fuzzy mathematical programming fmp can be potentially introduced to represent objectives and constraints of optimization model compared with stochastic mathematical programming method guo et al 2018 hu et al 2018 morar et al 2018 fmp can readily generate effective solutions with a low computational requirement and a high computational efficiency as a typical type of the fmp fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp is an effective method for handling fuzzy uncertainties and constraint violation issues the constraints of the fccp will be satisfied at a given fuzzy credibility level which is similar to its mathematical counterpart i e stochastic chance constrained programming theoretically the fccp was initially proposed arising from the concept of credibility measure liu and liu 2002 the primary advantage of credibility measure is its self duality which is not the characteristic of possibility measure and necessity measure the reason that credibility is self dual is that when credibility level is equal to 1 fuzzy events will inevitably occur while when credibility level arrives at 0 fuzzy events will certainly not occur huang 2006 therefore this method has been applied in various real world practices for example zhang et al 2012 developed an integer fuzzy credibility constrained programming model by combining integer programming into fuzzy credibility constrained programming for power system management zeng et al 2014 established a two stage credibility constrained programming with hurwicz criterion method for water resources management li et al 2018 proposed an inexact credibility chance constrained integer programming for greenhouse gas mitigation management under uncertainty however there is a concern of the aforementioned fccp methods that the concept of credibility is proposed arising from the definition of adopting the average of possibility and necessity indicating that both possibility and necessity have the same contribution degree to the credibility which may be inapplicable to practical problems generally different decision makers will indeed possess their subjective judgments and preferences about the contribution degree of possibility and necessity in the process of determining credibility level which is defined as weight coefficients in this study to make up this disadvantage an improved fuzzy credibility constrained programming ifccp is developed through the weight coefficients to represent the choice of decision makers between possibility and necessity i e the proportion of possibility γ and necessity 1 γ in credibility the ifccp extends the traditional fccp methods by exploring the weight coefficients from a specially designated value i e 0 5 to a wide range of values i e 0 1 0 in this case a fixed weight coefficient at γ 0 5 is chosen in the modeling formulation of the fccp which has been proven to be a special but typical case in the ifccp it is obvious that the ifccp has an enhanced applicability to handle the vague parametric information expressed as fuzzy uncertainties it is proven to be applied to practical applications for dealing with fuzzy information and providing optimal solutions at different satisfactory levels li et al 2015 zhang and guo 2017 nevertheless few attempts to incorporate the ifccp method and the icwpfs within an optimization modeling framework for irrigation water planning have been undertaken thus the primary objective of this study is to develop such a novel optimization framework namely an improved interval based fuzzy credibility constrained programming iifccp approach for supporting optimal irrigation strategies under uncertainty it is derived from incorporating ipp ifccp and icwpfs into a general model aimed to optimize the allocation of irrigation water this study presents the following favorable reasons to further facilitate irrigation water management first it deals with both subjective uncertainties e g human induced judgments and decision makers preferences and objective uncertainties e g related elements in crops market conditions and irrigation systems second it incorporates the icwpfs into optimization framework to enhance its applicability third it explores the range of weight coefficients to represent more choices of decision makers four it provides more flexible irrigation water strategies with considerations of weight coefficients and credibility levels then a real world case study is provided for irrigation water management in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin northwest china through solving the developed optimization model more optimal solutions for supporting flexible irrigation water allocation plans corresponding to different satisfactory degree of constraints i e the combination of credibility levels and weight coefficients have been generated correspondingly tradeoffs among system benefits credibility levels and weight coefficients will be analyzed these results are expected to help decision makers to accomplish optimal irrigation water management and promote sustainable agricultural production under uncertainty in arid areas fig 1 illustrates the general framework of this study 2 methodology in this section four subsections will be presented with the following details 2 1 interval crop water production functions linear forms of the icwpfs are introduced in this study they are presented as y a e t b where y denotes harvested crop yield kg ha e t is the actual evapotranspiration or irrigation water apply m3 ha a and b are empirically fitted coefficients the superscripts and represent the upper and lower bounds of interval parameters and variables then to calculate icwpfs for different study crops an interval regression analysis method is used to analyze the measured experimental field data tanaka and lee 1998 tong and guo 2013 li et al 2016a zhang et al 2018 2 2 improved fuzzy credibility constrained programming the detailed derivation process of the conventional fccp method is presented in appendix a however both possibility and necessity are assigned as the same contribution in determining the credibility which may have limitation in practical problems because of imprecise information to overcome its limitation an improved fuzzy credibility constrained programming ifccp method is proposed via different weight coefficients to balance the tradeoff between possibility γ and necessity 1 γ within credibility zhang and guo 2017 the weight coefficient is defined as the proportion or contribution degree of possibility in calculating credibility obviously the ifccp has extended weight coefficient to a wide range of values indicating that more choices can be provided taking the weight coefficients ranging from 0 1 to 0 9 to illustrate the calculation process for example give two fuzzy variables a i j a 1 a 2 a 3 and b i b 1 b 2 b 3 with fuzzy membership function μ x where fuzzy membership function is defined by using triangular fuzzy variable r 1 r 2 r 3 the formula of μ x is defined 1a μ x x r 1 r 2 r 1 if r 1 x r 2 x r 3 r 2 r 3 if r 2 x r 3 0 otherwise 1 if the weight coefficient is at 0 2 γ 0 2 its constraint can be defined 1b c r a b 0 2 p o s a b 0 8 n e c a b based on the definition of credibility measure see appendix a equation 4 j two scenarios are related to the expressions of credibility first scenario 1 is presented as 1c c r a b 2 a 3 10 a 2 10 b 2 2 b 1 10 a 3 a 2 b 2 b 1 a 2 b 2 a 3 b 1 then we have 1d 2 10 λ i a 3 10 λ i 10 a 2 10 λ i 10 b 2 2 10 λ i b 1 second scenario 2 is presented as 1e c r a b 2 b 3 a 1 10 b 3 b 2 a 2 a 1 a 2 b 2 a 1 b 3 then we have 1f 10 λ i a 2 10 λ i 2 a 1 10 λ i 2 b 3 10 λ i b 2 2 similarly if the weight coefficient is at 0 8 γ 0 8 the constraints can be expressed 1g c r a b 0 8 p o s a b 0 2 n e c a b scenario 1 1h 8 10 λ i a 3 10 λ i 10 a 2 10 λ i 10 b 2 8 10 λ i b 1 scenario 2 1i 10 λ i a 2 10 λ i 8 a 1 10 λ i 8 b 3 10 λ i b 2 these two scenarios are derived from the condition of 1 μ i λ i 0 5 for eq 1c and eq 1e there is a difficulty in identifying whether the credibility level of them is greater than 0 5 i e c r a b 0 5 accordingly both scenario 1 and 2 should be examined to identify which one can generate feasible solutions when solving the model and which one is the superior solution at the same weight coefficients in the practical meanings therefore based on two risk related parameters including credibility levels and weight coefficients more flexible solutions can be generated and thus various choices can be provided from the ifccp model nevertheless few previous efforts of the ifccp method on optimal irrigation water management problems have been undertaken 2 3 improved interval based fuzzy credibility constrained programming therefore to address above concerns mathematical techniques of the interval parameters programming ipp improved fuzzy credibility constrained programming ifccp and interval crop water production functions icwpfs are incorporated into a general optimization framework thus an improved interval based fuzzy credibility constrained programming iifccp model is developed for irrigation water management under uncertainty 2a max f j 1 n c j y j subject to 2b c r j 1 n a i j x j b i λ i i 1 m 2c x j 0 j

solution method therefore the detailed steps to solve the iifccp model are summarized as follows step 1 calculate the icwpfs through interval regression analysis method aiming at the collected field experimental data step 2 consider the interval and fuzzy uncertainties in practical applications take the icwpfs as the optimization framework to formulate the iifccp model step 3 transform the iifccp model into the upper and lower bounds of submodels the upper bound submodel will be first solved f because the objective function is to maximize system benefits step 4 for the upper bound submodel convert these fuzzy credibility constraints into deterministic ones by giving a weight coefficient γ these derivation processes are presented in eqs 2c and 2e step 5 give a certain credibility level λ i to solve the deterministic upper bound submodel and to generate its feasible and optimal solutions f o p t and x j o p t step 6 introduce optimal solutions of the upper bound submodel as an input into the lower bound submodel then the corresponding feasible solutions can be generated f o p t and x j o p t step 7 repeat steps 3 6 under different combinations of weight coefficients and credibility levels interval solutions about the iifccp model can be finally obtained f o p t f o p t f o p t and x j o p t x j o p t x j o p t 3 case study 3 1 study area and problem statement the heihe river basin is the second largest arid inland river basin in northwest china it covers an area of 142 900 km2 the midstream area of the hrb between the controlled hydrological stations of the yingluoxia and zhengyixia is selected as the study area as shown in fig 2 the study area mainly includes three subareas including ganzhou district gz linze county lz and gaotai county gt it s a highly developed agricultural area known as national commodity grain production base in china its annual average temperature is 7 6 c and annual average precipitation is less than 200 mm but annual average pan evaporation is greater than 2000 mm zhao et al 2018 from march to september approximately 90 of yearly precipitation occurs which is almost in line with the crop growing season accordingly high water consuming agriculture dominates a large portion of economic share of the study area grain crops and economic crops are popularly cultivated and irrigated economic crops the general term including fruits and vegetables can produce more economic value compared with grain crops such as spring wheat and maize in the study area the crop production cycle mainly range from march to october the study area possesses sufficient sunshine and abundant land resources but the water resources are the key limiting factor for agricultural development thus irrigation is an effective measure to satisfy crop water demands and further alleviate water shortages and promote agricultural production crops are irrigated by surface water and groundwater due to low precipitation the surface water is delivered from the heihe river into the fields via multi layered canal networks groundwater is extracted from the multiple wells into the end canals and then conveyed into the fields for compensating the insufficiency of surface water jiang et al 2016 moreover approximately 90 of total water consumption in the midstream area lies in agricultural water consumption li et al 2016b zhang et al 2019 flood and furrow methods i e traditional irrigation methods are commonly used by farmers during the crop growing season from march to october there are usually four or five times of irrigation an additional winter irrigation is carried out in november to ensure proper soil moisture conditions for seeding growth in the coming year nearly all the main canals are lined but part of the secondary and other canals are not lined thus there are a part of irrigation water losses during water conveyance moreover deep percolation occurs due to excessive water deliveries and over irrigation in some areas thereby leading to lower management level and disorder regulation pattern of canal conveyance jiang et al 2015 in the actual irrigation water management system charge for irrigation water is usually calculated by irrigation area e g yuan mu farmers have a disposition to irrigate more water during each irrigation period such a lack of water control and unified irrigation water management practice will inevitably lead to unbalanced irrigation water applied e g water waste or water shortage in different areas resulting in the reduction of crop yields and economic losses therefore possible solutions should be undertaken to optimize and allocate the limited irrigation water to different crops for each subarea reasonably considering uncertainties in the study system a sound irrigation water management practice under uncertainty is essential for promoting agricultural production 3 2 modelling formulation in this study the problems to be systematically considered are 1 how to estimate the icwpfs for the study crops and formulate the optimization model 2 how to allocate the irrigation water to each subarea and crop to maximize system benefits resulting from agricultural production under uncertainty 3 how to obtain optimal solutions among different satisfactory levels 4 how to investigate the variation of optimal solutions under different weight coefficients credibility levels and water levels remarkably there is an assumption that the icwpfs are the same among three subareas in fact water resources are the most critical limiting factor and thus soil types and other characteristics of the study area are not considered therefore an improved interval based fuzzy credibility constrained programming iifccp model is developed in response to above concerns 3 2 1 objective function 3a max f i 1 3 j 1 3 a i j n b i j c p i j a j s w i j g w i j p e i d p i b j i 1 3 j 1 3 a i j c s i s w i j η s c g i g w i j η g where f is the objective function

at the combinations of different weight coefficients and credibility levels under high medium and low water levels can be generated through the solution steps see section 2 4 3 3 input data acquisition and processing input parameters are collected and calculated basically including crop data water availabilities and market conditions each detailed subsection is presented as follows table 1 provides the icwpfs for spring wheat maize and economic crops the field experimental data on crop yield and irrigation water apply come from li 2005 the interval regression results of each study crop are referred to li 2017 an interval regression analysis method was employed to estimate the corresponding icwpfs for each study crop the weight of k 1 1 and k 2 0 0001 was used to calculate the icwpfs for the purpose of a central tendency of the regression results li et al 2016a table 2 provides the available surface water and groundwater for agricultural irrigation fuzzy numbers are used to represent the surface water and groundwater availabilities under high medium and low water levels which are the input parameters on the right hand side of constraints the triangular fuzzy number is typically used to represent the fuzzy events i e a i j a 1 a 2 a 3 where a 1 is the least possible value a 2 is the main value and a 3 is the most possible value the division of three inflow levels is based on the frequency analysis method li et al 2016b including low level p 75 medium level 25 p 75 and high level p 25 t distribution method with the 95 confidence level was used to estimate the range of water availability under each inflow level interval estimations where the lower limits were used as the least possible values while the upper limits represent the most possible values the mean of each inflow is considered as the main values therefore a triangular fuzzy number for water availability is obtained for each water level in terms of groundwater availability the least possible main and the most possible values are accordingly calculated based on the minimum mean and the maximum values of the samples historical statistical data of pumped groundwater tables 3 and 4 provide the crop irrigation water demands and k c values of the crops daily meteorological data are obtained from three meteorological stations including zhangye no 52562 linze no 52557 and gaotai no 52546 where they are located in the midstream area yin et al 2012 moreover the effective precipitation is collected from the observation data of above three meteorological stations under three water levels see table 3 table 5 provides basic input parameters for solving the iifccp optimization model they are generally collected from other references and statistical data considering the rates of surface water and groundwater loss during water conveyance as triangular fuzzy numbers due to its imprecise definition and they are ξ s 0 20 0 25 0 30 and ξ g 0 10 0 15 0 20 respectively 4 results analysis generally a potential way to reflect the decision makers subjective judgment is to predefine different semantic levels for the satisfaction degree of feasibility in fuzzy decision making analysis zadeh 1975 jiménez et al 2007 established a fuzzy linguistic scale to distinguish credibility levels from λ 0 to λ 1 0 in detail λ 0 7 represents a very acceptable solution λ 0 8 means an almost acceptable solution λ 0 9 denotes a practically acceptable solution and λ 1 0 is completely acceptable solution the practical meaning of a higher credibility level is associated with less system benefits and higher degrees of feasibility which is a conservative and reliable attitude on environmental loading capacities at a lower system failure risk level weight coefficients are defined as the contribution degree of the possibility in credibility which can balance the tradeoff between possibility and necessity ranging from γ 0 to γ 1 0 the practice meaning is when the weight coefficient takes a larger value of the fuzzy event the objective function will be more likely to be satisfied if the local managers pursue greater economic benefits higher weight coefficient will be assigned therefore to investigate and compare the variations of obtained results under high medium and low water levels in this study four credibility levels i e λ 0 7 0 8 0 9 1 0 and nine weight coefficients i e γ 0 1 0 9 are introduced into the iifccp model moreover each weight coefficient is associated with two types of scenarios regarding the fuzzy credibility constraints including scenario 1 and scenario 2 while two submodels including the upper and lower bounds of submodels can further be obtained for each scenario thus a total of 432 submodels that are required to be solved and then 216 sets of optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation have been provided for supporting agricultural production because the developed iifccp model integrates the ifccp method and the icwpfs into a general optimization framework naturally the advantages of both techniques will compatibly be inherited as the ifccp method can deal with violation of system constraints and examine the satisfaction of constraints it can generate and provide the corresponding optimal solutions at the combinations of different weight coefficients and credibility levels icwpfs are used to reflect more uncertain and practical information in the collected field experimental data therefore deterministic and interval solutions will coexist in these results reflecting the effects of different forms of uncertainties on the optimization model 4 1 optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation plan table 6 provides the comparison results for optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation through the iifccp model between scenario 1 and scenario 2 under medium water level and credibility level λ 0 7 the results include the allocated surface water and groundwater patterns for the three subareas and three crops when the weight coefficient increases from γ 0 1 to γ 0 9 it is obvious that crops in lz and gt subareas are totally irrigated by surface water in scenarios 1 and 2 with the change of weight coefficient the results show that surface water in such subareas are given priority due to its lower water use cost therefore the variations of weight coefficient have no effect on the allocated groundwater in lz and gt subareas moreover the amount of allocated surface water for economic crops in lz and gt subareas are the same following different weight coefficients i e 5203 5 7040 1 m3 ha and 6264 6 8475 7 m3 ha respectively in comparison there is a complementarity between allocated surface water and groundwater in gz subarea because crops are irrigated by surface water and groundwater for example the allocated surface water and groundwater in scenario 1 for spring wheat is 752 0 m3 ha and 1551 3 m3 ha for maize is 3944 9 m3 ha and 1336 6 3200 7 m3 ha and for economic crops is 2811 4 m3 ha and 1891 9 3551 9 m3 ha when γ 0 1 in terms of the results in gz subarea when weight coefficient is raised from γ 0 1 to γ 0 9 the amount of allocated surface water is increased but allocated groundwater is decreased similarly the results of spring wheat and maize in lz subarea and spring wheat in gt subarea present the same increasing trend this can be explained by the mathematical meaning of weight coefficient a high weight coefficient means possibility has an increasingly important influence on calculating credibility which will naturally lead to a greater degree of satisfaction of constraints and thus the decision space for water availability is expanded because the objective is to maximize system economic benefits more surface water will be applied for irrigation than groundwater based on the structure of objective function of optimization model the results from table 6 show that their changing trends corresponding to different weight coefficients are the same as the scenario 1 see table 6 however the allocated irrigation water including surface water and groundwater in scenario 2 are generally less than that in scenario 1 from γ 0 1 to γ 0 4 and from γ 0 8 to γ 0 9 furthermore it is noted that the results in scenario 1 and scenario 2 are the same at γ 0 5 and γ 0 7 for example when γ 0 5 in scenario 1 and scenario 2 solutions in gz subarea are the same namely 1172 7 1130 5 m3 ha surface water groundwater for spring wheat 4143 2 1138 3 3002 3 m3 ha for maize and 3116 1 1587 2 3247 2 m3 ha for economic crops this is because the structure of fuzzy constraints is equivalent at the combination of these two weight coefficients and credibility level e g λ 0 7 and γ 0 7 in both two scenarios table 7 presents optimal irrigation water allocation solutions under medium water level and weight coefficient γ 0 5 this is to compare the impact of changes associated with different credibility levels i e λ 0 7 0 8 0 9 1 0 on results generally credibility level is closely linked with the satisfaction degree of constraints with an increased credibility level the constraints become enhanced with a higher system reliability level and a lower violation constraint risk level in this case surface water availabilities would decrease but stimulate increased groundwater availability more groundwater would be pumped taking economic crops in gz subarea as an example the results are 3116 1 1587 2 3247 2 m3 ha λ 0 7 2673 5 1950 0 4186 3 m3 ha λ 0 8 2579 7 2029 8 4489 8 m3 ha λ 0 9 and 1703 3 2177 0 2223 7 4683 7 m3 ha λ 1 0 therefore from λ 0 7 to λ 1 0 the results of allocated surface water in gz subarea for three crops are decreased but increased groundwater consumption it is clear that the results in gt subarea are not sensitive to the changing of credibility level table 8 shows optimal solutions under credibility level λ 0 9 and weight coefficient γ 0 5 this is to examine the influence of changes related to different water levels on results the main difference among three water levels are the amount of available water and irrigation water demands i e high medium low compared with medium and low water levels in practice there are more available surface water and thus groundwater is less pumped under high water level if the available water is relatively sufficient more irrigation water will be allocated for irrigation to achieve the maximum system benefits for example from high water level to low water level the allocated surface water in gz lz and gt subareas are decreased moreover only crops in gz subarea are irrigated by surface water and groundwater while crops in lz and gt subareas is merely irrigated by surface water similarly results analysis of optimal irrigation water allocation solutions from the other scenarios can be interpreted these results can support analysis of tradeoffs between irrigation water amount and agricultural production returns to reflect the complexities of agricultural systems therefore by introducing weight coefficients into the conventional fccp method more feasible solutions have been generated to facilitate irrigation water management this will naturally broad and enrich the scope of decision making following the human induced judgment and preference of the decision makers 4 2 system benefits the objective function of this study is to maximize system benefits from agricultural production under different scenarios to examine and compare the results at the combinations of credibility level and weight coefficients fig 3 illustrates an overview of system benefits under medium water level and scenario 1 it can be clearly seen that both the upper and lower bounds of system benefits are increased along with an increased weight coefficient e g γ 0 1 0 9 overall it presents a disproportionate grow rate for system benefits with weight coefficient increases in detail system benefits experience a slight increase when the weight coefficient is raised from 0 1 to 0 5 conversely there is a significant increase from γ 0 6 to γ 0 9 similar patterns can be seen at credibility level λ 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 taking λ 0 8 as an example system benefits resulting from the iifccp model would increase from 2 476 7 582 109 yuan γ 0 1 to 2 492 7 604 109 yuan γ 0 5 the grow rate of the lower and upper bounds of the objective functions are approximately 0 6 and 0 3 respectively while the results are increased from 2 502 7 615 109 yuan γ 0 6 to 2 564 7 727 109 yuan γ 0 9 the grow rate of the lower and upper bounds are 2 47 and 1 46 this is almost five times that at weight coefficients ranging from γ 0 1 to γ 0 5 it shows that the larger the weight coefficient is the more significant the impact on the results is moreover the results at different credibility levels are also different in other words the greater the credibility level the smaller the objective function for example for a certain weight coefficient γ 0 5 system benefits are 2 516 7 627 109 yuan λ 0 7 2 492 7 604 109 yuan λ 0 8 2 480 7 580 109 yuan λ 0 9 2 468 7 554 109 yuan λ 1 0 this is determined by the mathematical definition of fuzzy credibility constrained programming a credibility level represents a satisfaction of constraints and the corresponding confidence for optimization results it thus will result in a smaller decision space for the realization of objective function at a higher credibility level it is noted that system benefits remain unchanged along with different weight coefficients at credibility level λ 1 0 this is because the constraints are totally satisfied in that case and thus weight coefficients have no effects on the results fig 4 a d present the comparison of system benefits between scenario 1 and scenario 2 under medium water level the upper bounds of system benefits are selected to examine the differences between scenario 1 and scenario 2 and the results of other water levels can be similarly interpreted in general all the results increase with the increase of the weight coefficient which indicates that the increase of the possibility weight can satisfy the constraints to a greater extent leading to the increase of the objective function values it is worth noting that when the weight coefficient is equal to 0 5 the results of the two scenarios are the same indicating that the model and constraint structure of the two scenarios are equivalent at γ 0 5 thus the same results can be obtained in other words results at γ 0 5 is only a special case among solutions resulted from the iifccp model reflecting that the iifccp model can extend to more different cases besides system benefits in scenario 2 are lower than that in scenario 1 at γ 0 1 0 4 when the weight is greater than 0 5 the growth rate of scenario 1 is relatively faster than that of scenario 2 in particular circumstances the results of the two scenarios will be the same for example the results of two scenarios are the same at the combinations of λ 0 7 and γ 0 7 similar results can be seen at λ 0 8 and γ 0 8 λ 0 9 and γ 0 9 λ 1 0 and γ 1 0 because of their equivalent constraints taking the combinations of λ 0 8 and γ 0 8 as an example to demonstrate the transformation process in terms of the fuzzy credibility constraints in scenario 1 10 0 8 a 2 10 0 8 8 a 1 10 0 8 8 b 3 10 0 8 b 2 a 2 b 2 e g λ 0 8 and γ 0 8 likewise fuzzy credibility constraints in scenario 2 8 10 0 8 a 3 10 0 8 10 a 2 10 0 8 10 b 2 8 10 0 8 b 1 e g λ 0 8 and γ 0 8 a 2 b 2 understandable there are two intersection points in fig 4a d thereby proving the interactions between the combinations of credibility levels and weight coefficients under specific situations in practice it is found that not all the scenarios are totally satisfied and feasible when both scenario 1 and scenario 2 are satisfied at the same weight coefficients more optimal solutions corresponding to greater objective function values should be selected as potential alternatives therefore the obtained results can present tradeoffs among system benefits weight coefficients and credibility levels fig 5 presents system benefits under different water levels and credibility levels γ 0 5 it is apparent that both the upper and lower bounds of system benefits under a higher water level are greater than that of a lower water level e g f o p t low f o p t medium f o p t high from a management perspective more available water resources will produce more economic benefits in summary the iifccp model can provide various solutions under different water levels credibility levels and weight coefficients these results can support in depth analysis of the interrelationships among system benefits water levels credibility levels and weight coefficients thereby assisting decision makers in better understanding the uncertainties in the study system and further facilitating irrigation water management 5 discussion in this study the iifccp model is developed by incorporating the ifccp method and icwpfs within a general optimization framework thus its practical applicability is undoubtedly enhanced for addressing interval and fuzzy uncertainties existing in the agricultural systems the following contents are the detailed discussion 5 1 comparison with the results from deterministic cwpfs the deterministic solution can be obtained through a deterministic optimization model where the deterministic cpwfs are selected as the general framework of optimization model for irrigation planning and other interval parameters are taken their mean values as input parameters taking the results under medium water level as an example for comparison between deterministic and icwpfs four credibility levels and nine weight coefficients are given to generate the corresponding results therefore optimal solutions resulting from deterministic cwpfs can be generated in general these results present a similar changing trend along with the weight coefficient changes however it is obvious that the results based on deterministic cwpfs are only deterministic values within interval solutions resulting from the iifccp model showing that these results are inflexible in fact there are many uncertainties in agricultural irrigation systems it is thus more reasonable to express the decision variables or parameters as intervals or other uncertainties which can provide more flexible solutions within the range of the feasible solutions furthermore it can be proved again by the system benefits presented in fig 6 indicating that the deterministic cpwfs are the special case in the icwpfs the results indicate that the icwpfs are superior to deterministic ones as the basic framework of optimization irrigation water management model therefore the developed model improves upon the existing studies on deterministic cwpfs 5 2 comparison with the conventional fccp method to overcome the limitations arising from the conventional fccp method weight coefficient derived from possibility to credibility measure is introduced into the iifccp model theoretically credibility is defined by adopting the average of possibility and necessity meaning that weight coefficients of the possibility and necessity in credibility are 0 5 respectively in this study the iifccp model extends a specific designed value to a generalized range i e 0 1 namely it can further be divided into more scenarios related to different weight coefficients at the same credibility level to facilitate decision making by contrast the conventional fccp method can merely address fuzzy problems at γ 0 5 which is a fixed value and single weight coefficient in fact different weight coefficients are useful for analyzing uncertain system conditions in practical applications in detail when the weight coefficient is fixed at γ 0 9 which means that the possibility takes 90 possession of the credibility and thus possibility has a greater impact on satisfying the objective function this is the reason why the objective function value at γ 0 9 is higher than that of γ 0 5 li et al 2015 instead when the weight coefficient is fixed at γ 0 1 predictable consequences and opposite results can be obtained it is more informative and expected to quantify system risk levels by introducing various weight coefficients to analyze the system situations therefore in the process of irrigation water management planning with more possibility represents a positive preference for water availability whereas it would lead to potential risk of violating the constraints when the available water is not sufficient willingness to accept more necessity indicates that decision makers have conservative irrigation water management plans which may cause unavoidable risk that irrigation water resources are wasted without being fully allocated and utilized zhang and guo 2017 actually the iifccp model can represent three kinds of methods including possibility i e γ 1 0 necessity i e γ 0 and credibility i e γ 0 5 along with the changing weight coefficients and different satisfactory levels of constraints therefore the iifccp model can provide more feasible and flexible results which can clearly illustrate the interrelationships among possibility necessity and credibility measures it is thus proved that the iifccp model has an enhanced practical applicability to deal with irrigation water allocation problems under uncertainty 6 conclusions an improved interval based fuzzy credibility constrained programming iifccp model is developed for supporting irrigation water management under uncertainty mathematical techniques including interval parameter programming ipp improved fuzzy credibility constrained programming ifccp and interval crop water production functions icwpfs are incorporated into a modeling framework the following potential advantages are presented to facilitate irrigation water management first it can deal with fuzzy and interval uncertainties existing in the constraints and objective function of the model second interval crop water production functions cwpfs is estimated to reflect more uncertain information of the practical applications it improves upon existing studies based on deterministic cwpfs third it makes a novel attempt to explore weight coefficients to represent the various preferences of decision makers fourth it can provide more flexible decision solutions by considering various weight coefficients and credibility levels the developed iifccp model is then applied to a real world case study in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin located in northwest china to demonstrate its applicability therefore various optimal solutions under different weight coefficients credibility levels and water levels have been generated and the variations of results among different satisfactory levels of constraints have been further investigated the obtained results from the case study indicate that 1 crops in lz and gt subareas are totally irrigated by surface water 2 optimal surface water allocation is increased but the allocated groundwater is decreased in gz subarea with the weight coefficients increase 3 a higher weight coefficient and a lower credibility level under high water level will lead to a greater system benefits 4 the icwpfs are superior to deterministic ones as the basic framework of optimization irrigation water management model and 5 the iifccp model is a representative method with an enhanced practical applicability compared with the conventional fccp method these results can assist decision makers in better facilitating optimal irrigation water management and support sustainable agricultural production under uncertainty in arid areas although this is an application in irrigation water management problems the iifccp can also be applicable to other environmental and resources management problems under interval and fuzzy uncertainties for future research seasonal response of crop yield to irrigation water under different crop growth stages should be incorporated into the optimization model which can further enhance

greatly improved this manuscript appendix a solution process of the conventional fccp method three types of measures including possibility necessity and credibility are effective for handling fuzzy information the credibility measure was initially proposed by liu and liu 2002 to overcome the limitation of the possibility and necessity measures it s defined by taking the mean value of both of them it has an advantage in identifying whether a fuzzy event will certainly occur or not based on this concept a fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp method is formulated to address these fuzzy uncertainty moreover by giving varying credibility levels it can also examine the satisfaction of constraints thus this problem can be presented 4a max f j 1 n c j x j subject to 4b c r j 1 n a i j x j b i λ i i 1 m 4c x j 0 j 1 n where c j is non fuzzy coefficient of objective x j is real number decision variables j is the number of variables j 1 n a i j and b i are fuzzy coefficients of constraints i is the number of constraints i 1 m eq 4b means that at credibility level λ i the fuzzy credibility constraint should be satisfied based on the eq 1a two fuzzy variables a i j a 1 a 2 a 3 and b i b 1 b 2 b 3 with fuzzy membership function μ x are presented the formula of μ x is written 4d μ x x r 1 r 2 r 1 if r 1 x r 2 x r 3 r 2 r 3 if r 2 x r 3 0 otherwise moreover the definition of possibility of a fuzzy event i e p o s a b is presented 4e p o s a b sup min μ a x μ b y x y ℜ x y the mathematical equation can be defined using triangular fuzzy variables 4f p o s a b 1 if a 2 b 2 b 3 a 1 b 3 b 2 a 2 a 1 if a 2 b 2 a 1 b 3 0 if a 1 b 3 similarly the necessity of a fuzzy event i e n e c a b represents the impossibility of the opposite event its definition is 4g n e c a b inf max μ a x 1 μ b y x y ℜ x y the mathematical formula can be defined using triangular fuzzy variables 4h n e c a b 1 if a 3 b 1 b 2 a 2 a 3 a 2 b 2 b 1 if a 2 b 2 a 3 b 1 0 if a 2 b 2 however both possibility measure and necessity measure have limitations because they are not self dual the credibility measure was thus proposed to make up their limitations therefore the definition of credibility is 4i c r a b 1 2 p o s a b n e c a b therefore the definition can be presented using triangular fuzzy variables 4j c r a b 1 if a 3 b 1 a 3 2 a 2 2 b 2 b 1 2 a 3 a 2 b 2 b 1 if a 2 b 2 a 3 b 1 b 3 a 1 2 b 3 b 2 a 2 a 1 if a 2 b 2 a 1 b 3 0 if a 1 b 3 according to the rules of fuzzy operations in terms of credibility constraint 4b we have 4k j 1 n a i j x j j 1 n a i j 1 x j j 1 n a i j 2 x j j 1 n a i j 3 x j let triangular fuzzy variables z i z i 1 z i 2 z i 3 replace j 1 n a i j x j thus constraint 4b can be transformed into 4l c r z i b i λ i i 1 m 1 thus μ i c r t i b i can represent the credibility of variable b i for z i understandably the effective and meaningful credibility level should not be less than 0 5 therefore 1 μ i λ i 0 5 for each fuzzy credibility constraint we have 4m z i 3 2 z i 2 2 b i 2 b i 1 2 z i 3 z i 2 b i 2 b i 1 λ i then we have 4n 1 2 λ i z i 3 2 λ i 1 z i 2 2 λ i 2 b i 2 1 2 λ i b i 1 subsequently by replacing z i by j 1 n a i j x j the fccp problem can be solved therefore the crisp equivalent inequalities of credibility constrained constraints can be obtained
