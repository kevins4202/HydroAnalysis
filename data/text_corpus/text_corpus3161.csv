15805,the anaerobic microbial nitrogen n removal in lake sediments is one of the most important processes driving the nitrogen cycling in lake ecosystems however the n removal and its underlying mechanisms regulated by denitrifying and anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox bacteria in lake sediments remain poorly understood with the field sediments collected from different areas of lake donghu a shallow eutrophic lake we examined the denitrifying and anammox bacterial communities by sequencing the nirs k and hzsb genes respectively the results indicated that denitrifiers in sediments were affiliated to nine clusters which are involved in both heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification however anammox bacteria were only dominated by candidatus brocadia we found that no3 and no2 concentrations as well as nar enzyme activity were the key factors affecting denitrifying and anammox communities in this eutrophic lake the enrichment experiments in bioreactors confirmed the divergence of denitrification and anammox rates with an additional complement of no2 especially under a condition low nitrate reductase activity the coupled denitrification and anammox may play significant roles in n removal and the availability of electronic acceptors i e no2 and no3 strongly influenced the n loss in lake sediments further path analysis indicated that no2 no3 and some n related enzymes were the key factors affecting microbial n removal in lake sediments this study advances our understanding of the mechanisms driving the of denitrification and anammox in lake sediments which also provides new insights into coupled denitrification anammox n removal in eutrophic lake ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrogen removal denitrification anammox nitrogen related enzymes functional gene sequencing 1 introduction the eutrophication of lakes is a worldwide environmental problem especially for most of the urban lakes in china jin et al 2005 yang et al 2017 nitrogen n pollution is one of the major causes of eutrophication and thus the n removal is a critical issue for controlling the eutrophication in lakes gruber and galloway 2008 the pathways involved in n removal for lake ecosystems have attracted considerable attention in recent years vila costa et al 2016 there are four microbial metabolic processes in responsible for no2 and no3 reduction and nh4 oxidization including nitrification denitrification dissimilatory no3 reduction to ammonium dnra and anammox roland et al 2018 nh4 oxidation provides no2 for denitrification and anammox but it also competes with anammox for nh4 leininger et al 2006 denitrification includes the successive reduction of no3 to no2 and subsequently generate n2 but anammox utilize substrates of no2 and may affect denitrification yang et al 2017 generally denitrification is expected to dominate in environments with high organic matters whereas a high concentration of organic matters may inhibit anammox yang et al 2020b thus clarifying the mechanisms regulating these competing processes is crucial for predicting modeling and managing the n cycling kuypers et al 2018 in shallow eutrophic lake sediments denitrification and anammox have been recognized as the major n removal processes moreover their functions and activities could be regulated by n compounds and different environmental factors roland et al 2018 yang et al 2017 for example low dissolved oxygen may strongly affect the n and c biogeochemical processes liu et al 2015 the concentration of substances was found to be a key determinant affecting the denitrification rates because no3 and organic carbon act as a terminal electron acceptors and electron donors for denitrifying bacteria ma et al 2020 although the heterotrophic denitrification has been widely studied wang et al 2018 the regulation of denitrification and other metabolisms of electron donors and acceptors in freshwater eutrophic lakes remain unclear qiu et al 2020 particullarly we have much less knowledge of anammox process which is a complex metabolic process that occurs in various environments kartal et al 2013 strous et al 2002 recent studies showed that some intermediates such as so4 2 no2 no3 s2 and s might affect the removal efficiencies of nh4 and no2 through anammox process zhang et al 2019a denitrification and anammox are generally anaerobic processes which are significantly affected by the concentration of o2 as well as the availability of the different substrates such as organic matter no2 no3 nh4 ma et al 2020 roland et al 2018 in lake environments the high flux of n oxides drives most of the sediments to an active state which may be helpful for denitrification and anammox processes humbert et al 2010 li et al 2010 previous studies found that environmental factors such as dissolved oxygen temperature and n availability microbial diversity and abundance all could affected the n cycling in lakes wu et al 2012 yoshinaga et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 the temporal variations could also greatly affect the denitrifying and anammox communities in freshwater lakes liu et al 2018 however environmental effects on the distribution of denitrifying and anammox bacteria in different lake ecosystem remain largely inconsistent yang et al 2019 moreover the cooccurrence and regulation of denitrification and anammox metabolisms across freshwater lake cosystems remain unclear microbial community activity is always closely correlated with environmental conditions rocca et al 2015 in turn diverse metabolic capabilities of microbes may result in different n metabolites which can also affect the environmental conditions liu et al 2018 therefore it is important to clarify these processes in sediments from the microbial perspective to improve our understanding of n removal in eutrophic lakes fu et al 2019 previous studies found that environmental factors such as dissolved oxygen temperature and n availability microbial diversity and abundance all could affected the n cycling in lakes hu et al 2012 sun et al 2014 yang et al 2021 zhu et al 2015 for example microbial abundance and diversity were important in controlling denitrification and anammox rates ma et al 2020 trophic status determined the patterns of denitrifying and anammox communities in sediments yang et al 2017 anammox activity is highly dependent on local environmental conditions oshiki et al 2016 however such understanding mainly focused on the community composition and its spatio temporal variations but how the environmental factors affecting the linkage and coupling of denitrification and anammox in lake sediments remains unclear leininger et al 2006 wang et al 2017 in this study we aimed to evaluate the effects of environmental factors on the denitrification and anammox and determine the key processes driving the dynamics of denitrifying and anammox communities in eutrophic lake sediments we hypothesized that no2 concentration was a key factor affecting denitrification and anammox processes in the sediments eutrophic lake ecosystems to test this hypothesis a total of 25 sediment samples were collected from eutrophic lake donghu wuhan china with relative high n concentrations we analyzed both denitrifying and anammox bacteria by sequencing the functional genes nirs k and hzsb repectively the enzyme activities associated with n cycling were also determined to evaluate the n removal potential our results provide refined knowledge about the microbial n removal in lake sediments which is also especially important for increasing our understanding of the n sink in lake ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples collection and environmental

denitrification and anammox to test whether denitrification and anammox rates in the sediments are significantly affected by no2 concentrations we performed bioreactor experiments with lake sediments

and dominant taxa r packages including corrplot and pheatmap were used for the rda and spearman analyses mantel text was used to determine the correlation between microbial communities and physicochemical factors as described previously yu et al 2021 the co occurrence networks were constructed by a phylogenetic molecular ecological network analysis menap pipeline http ieg4 rccc ou edu mena using random matrix theory rmt based methods according to our previous study yu et al 2021 networks were visualized by the gephi software structural equation modeling analysis sem a powerful statistical method to reveal interactive relationships among manifest variables and latent variables was used to analyze the relationships between n cycling microbial community and environmental factors the sem model with latent variable manifest variables and path diagram fig s3 was constructed using plspm packages in r sanchez 2013 3 results 3 1 environmental characterization of lake sediments to understand the n transformation processes in lake donghu we measured concentrations of no3 no2 and nh4 in sediments the no3 and no2 showed considerable variations which ranging from 100 to 400 and 2 to 12 mg n kg respectively table 1 the concentration of no3 was approximately 20 30 times higher than that of no2 the linear regression analysis indicated that no3 was positively correlated r 0 50 p 0 001 with no2 fig s4 nh4 concentration ranged between 20 and 60 mg n kg which was significantly lower than that of the no3 concentration however the no3 was negatively correlated r 0 42 p 0 01 with nh4 fig s4 to intuitively evaluate the conversion capacity of denitrification and anammox the concentrations of tc and tn in sediments were also determined results indicated that there were no significant differences for the tc 28 34 48 82 mg g and tn concentrations 2 60 5 44 mg g among all samples 3 2 n related enzyme activity of lake sediments the results showed that the activity of nar and nir ranged from 3 72 to 4 73 and 2328 37 to 2860 64 μmol d g respectively fig 2 a among the seven investigated n related enzymes nitrite reductase showed the highest activity whereas nitrate reductase was the lowest fig 2b this indicated that no3 reduction rate no3 no2 catalyzed by nar might much lower than no2 reduction rate no2 no catalyzed by nir the activity of nor and nos were 274 70 and 188 73 μmol d g respectively this was an important signal that the no2 reduction rate was faster than other denitrification processes under enzymatic catalysis moreover the activity of nxr ranged from 905 94 to 2096 91 μmol d g the high activity of nxr leads to no3 accumulation the activities of hzs and amo ranged from 44 50 to 74 39 μmol d g and 64 15 to 120 94 μmol d g respectively the nh4 oxidation under oxygen limited and the aerobic condition was the major pathway to remove nh4 together different activities of n transformation enzymes are employed among the denitrifying and anammox bacterial groups which could result in no3 accumulates and no2 utilization 3 3 diversity composition and structure of denitrifying and anammox communities in order to better understand the denitrification and anammox processes and n transformation mechanisms in sediments nirs k and hzsb gene amplicons were sequenced the rarefaction curves of denitrifying otus based on nirs k gene sequences showed a good coverage fig s5 the high consistent results of α diversity suggesting the universality in the diversity and richness of bacterial communities throughout lake donghu fig 3 a pcoa results showed that the denitrifying communities were significantly p 0 05 distinct among different sites indicating that the distribution of denitrification was strikingly different fig 3b the major denitrifying clusters detected including proteobacteria 99 and chloroflexi 0 5 classification at the genus level indicated that dominant genera were rubrivivax and pseudomonas fig 4 in addition prosthecomicrobium anaerolinea cupriavidus and sulfurifustis were also showed relative high abundance the rarefaction curves of anammox otus based on hzsb gene sequences showed a good coverage fig s5 the α diversity of anammox bacterial communities in lake donghu was significantly p 0 05 different fig 3a pcoa results showed that the anammox community were significantly p 0 05 different among sampling sites fig 3b the candidatus brocadia was the most dominat anammox genus followed by candidatus kuenenia and candidatus jetteni fig 4 however about 80 90 of the anammox bacteria detected in this study were unclassified at the genus level indicating there may be lot of new members 3 4 relationships between denitrifying or anammox communities and environmental variables pairwise spearman s correlation and partial mantel tests were used to reveal environmental drivers of ammonia oxidation denitrifying and anammox communities our results showed that both denitrifying and anammox communities were significantly p 0 01 correlated with no2 concentration and nar hzs enzymes fig 5 a moreover there was a significant relationship between denitrifying community and nir enzymes fig 5a some denitrifying communities were significantly p 0 01 correlated with no2 and no3 concentrations in sediments fig 5b moreover the abundant of candidatus brocadia a typical anammox bacterium was positively correlated with no2 concentration fig 5b the linear regression showed that no2 and no3 had significant correlations with the shannon and simpson index of the denitrifying and anammox communities p 0 01 fig s6 besides nir nar hzs and no2 also explained considerable variations of the denitrifying and anammox communities fig 5c and no2 concentration was always found to be the key factor shaping the denitrification and anammox communits correlation analysis showed that denitrifying and anammox communities are significantly affected by substrate concentrations and nar enzyme activity nor nos enzymes and do had weak correlations with the denitrifying and anammox communities the co occurrence networks of denitrification and anammox with the environmental factors indicated that nar and no3 no2 were the key factors to drive the denitrifying and anammox communities fig 5d however we found that the number of denitrifying keystone taxa linked with the environmental factors were more than that of anammox fig s7 the interspecies interactions showed that 14 of the links between denitrifying and anammox bacteria were negative connections indicating clear competition between denitrifying and anammox bacteria fig 5e based on the path model of denitrification and anammox the concentrations of no2 and no3 showed significant effects p 0 01 on the rates and denitrifying and anammox communities fig 6 environmental factors showed negative effects on denitrification enzymes the enzymes involved in n cycling could explain the denitrifying communities well and denitrifying communities showed the strongest positive effects on the denitrification rate the no2 no3 and nar nir hzs were the main environmental factors driving the dynamics of denitrification and anammox communities 3 5 effects of no2 on the integration of denitrification and anammox processes the concentrations of no2 and no3 were the key factors affecting the n removal and the structures of denitrifying and anammox communities a relative higher concentration of no3 compared to that of no2 accompanied with a lower nar enzyme activity could be attributed to a low no3 reduction rate the low no3 reduction rate in denitrification could inhibit the anammox activity through reducing the no2 availability to test whether the denitrification and anammox rates could be promoted by sufficient no2 we performed bioreactor experiments with lake sediments by adding no2 during the experiment the sediment was fed by inorganic synthetic wastewater with 30 0 mg n l no2 and 10 0 mg n l nh4 with a 12 h hydraulic retention time the concentration of organics initially was sufficient and the no2 removal efficiency was high confirming high denitrification rate with sufficient no2 as electron acceptor fig 7 a however we could not detect clear consumption of nh4 at the beginning of the experiment fig 7a after 30 days the no2 in the effluent increased from approximately 3 73 mg n l to 15 66 mg n l and the nh4 removal efficiency was increased from 35 to 56 the sediments were fed by inorganic synthetic wastewater using no2 as the sole nitrogen source heterotrophic denitrifiers began to die due to the lack of organic substrates that the influent nitrite could not be efficiently removed through denitrification process the activity of anammox was very low at the beginning of the enrichment that no2 could also not be removed through anammox process from days 32 to 56 no2 removal efficiency gradually increased from 47 to 89 and the nh4 removal rate reached 6 49 mg n l d the removal of nh4 gradually increased with the enhancing of anammox activity in the anaerobic conditions fig s8 the production of no3 could be detected in the effluent with an average concentration of 2 5 mg n l after adding the labelled 15nh4 as substrates the scale of the measured denitrification and anammox rates are linearly increased fig 7b thus although the nar enzyme activity was low the supplementation of no2 could increase denitrification and anammox rates 4 discussion the widely distributed denitrification and anammox bacteria in sediments contribute significantly to n removal in eutrophic lakes which greatly increased our understanding of n cycling in aquatic ecosystems wang et al 2020 although the n removal could be affected by various environmental factors ma et al 2020 how denitrification and anammox bacteria regulated in lake ecosystems remains unclear this study found that no3 and no2 concentrations as well as nar enzyme activity were the key factors affecting the denitrification and anammox communities in lake ecosystems specifically the availability of no2 and no3 could control the abundances of denitrifying bacteria in subsurface sediments moreover the competition for no2 between denitrification and anammox may significantly influenced the n removal in sediments of eutrophic lake ecosystems the relative contributions of abiotic and biotic factors affecting denitrification and anammox are highly variable which complicate the microbial n cycling in sediments abrego et al 2020 chen et al 2019 ma et al 2020 no3 and no2 could be used as substrates and would affect the diversity and composition of denitrifying and anammox communities and thus could promote n cycling in lake ecosystems yin et al 2019 previous studies found that the available no3 in pore water of sediment was one of the key factors controlling denitrification rate hou et al 2013 the n availability in water was also significantly correlated with the microbial composition and diversity liu et al 2022 xiao et al 2019 we found that no2 and no3 concentrations were the key factors affecting the n removal and the structure of denitrifying community the no2 oxidation is the main biochemical pathway that produces no3 which catalysed by the nitrite oxidoreductase nxr nxr is encoded by aerobic no2 oxidizing bacteria and anaerobic no2 oxidation bacteria kuypers et al 2018 zeng et al 2021 reported that do and orp oxidation reduction potential were significantly correlated with the nxra amoa nirs k nosz in sediments indicating oxygen is a key factor of most nitrifiers however we found no significant correlation between do and sediment denitrifying and anammox communities the oxygen level may only affect the uppermost surface sediment due to the limited oxygen penetration glud 2008 thus the denitrification and anammox seem to be less effected by oxygen level in sediments wu et al 2021 we hypothesized that bacteria performing the comammox process could oxidize ammonia to no3 under oxygen limited conditions and perform partial ammonia oxidation to no2 under oxygen limited conditions recent studies also revealed that marine aoa and nob can oxidize ammonia and nitrite respectively in the omzs kraft et al 2022 sun et al 2021 ammonia oxidation process can be expressed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and accumulate a large amount of no3 su et al 2021 we found that the concentration of no3 was approximately 20 30 times higher than that of no2 moreover the nir enzyme activity was higher than that of nar enzyme suggesting the reduction rate of no2 are stronger than that of no3 the detection of no3 in the operating bioreactors also confirmed this conclusion nar enzyme catalyzes the reduction of no3 to no2 and we found that no2 was the key factor affecting the community structure and n removal rate of anammox and final product will be favored by denitrification in terms of nar nir furthermore there was competition for no2 between anammox bacteria and denitrifiers chen et al 2021 and the nar enzyme could be inhibited in the process of transcription or translation yoshida et al 2012 dnra competes with denitrification for no3 whereas higher no3 concentration may favor denitrification dong et al 2011 silver et al 2001 in this research we also observed a higher concentration of no3 at the same time based on the average potential rates of n loss the annual n loss rates of denitrification were much higher than that of the dnar roland et al 2018 yin et al 2019 correspondingly the nar enzyme activity was low the abundance dnar was lower than that of denitrification thus we mainly focused on the denitrification herein as the ultimate substrate of denitrification no3 with a high concentration could affect the denitrification rate and n related enzyme activities song et al 2010 van kessel et al 2015 lake donghu with relatively high load of no3 would significantly influence the production of no2 leading to inhibition of denitrification and anammox previous studies showed that nutrient levels could significantly affect the patterns of microbial communities however the concentration of no2 was low in lake donghu the effects of no2 on the community structure and functional metabolism could not be fully explained by the data we obtained in the current study further study of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics may help us to explore the influence of no2 concentration on the functional metabolism different types of electron donors e g organics and sulfide are available for denitrifying bacteria and they tend to use various electron acceptors e g no3 and no2 burgin and hamilton 2008 qiu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 we found that the nir enzyme activity was higher than that of nar enzyme suggesting the reduction rate of no2 are stronger than that of no3 previous studies have found that the no2 reduction pathway of different anammox genera differed significantly and both the nirs and nirk orthologues were missed in the candidatus brocadia gori et al 2011 oshiki et al 2016 in this study the dominant anammox genus in the sediments was identified as candidatus brocadia fig 4 there also have no relevant nir enzyme synthesis detected in candidatus brocadia bai et al 2016 at the same the abundance anammox was low we believed that nir could be used to represent denitrification process during the sulfur and sulfide based denitrification sulfidogenic bacteria prefer to use no2 as electron acceptors li et al 2021 sun et al 2017 kojima et al 2015 we found that dominant genera were rubrivivax and pseudomonas which were the important key bacteria controlling the reduction of no2 in lakes deng et al 2021 he et al 2019 lu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b zhang et al 2022 wang et al 2018 the autotrophic denitrification in sediments were also affected by the sulfide as well as the reduction of no2 and no3 suggesting that the redox of no2 no3 and the activities of nar and nir enzymes determined the accumulation of no2 and no3 le roux et al 2013 similarly the nar and nir enzymes were also the key factors affecting denitrification as they could be directly influenced by no2 and no3 therefore different denitrifying populations had contrasting physiological characteristics showing high sensitivities to environmental changes enwall et al 2010 the availability of no2 and no3 may be the key factors controlling the abundances of denitrifying bacteria in subsurface sediments rissanen et al 2013 the microbial n cycling also could be driven by the competition for no2 by denitrifying and anammox bacteria which was confirmed by the strong correlation of denitrifiers and anammox bacteria with no2 kartal et al 2013 zeng et al 2021 thus the metabolic pathway of no2 is an important factor affecting the community composition of denitrification and anammox zhang et al 2017 we also found the concentrations of no2 and no3 might be important in affecting the relative abundances of anammox suggesting that the reduction rate of no3 in denitrification limited the availability of no2 and the activity of anammox qian et al 2018 van de vossenberg et al 2008 species co occurrences networks can reveal the role of interspecific interactions in determining the community structure and ecological functions in this study the co occurrence networks of denitrifying and anammox communities showed 14 of negative connections suggesting competitive interactions wang et al 2012 nh4 and organics become the major electron donors the metabolic pathway of no2 is an important factor affecting the community composition of denitrification and anammox zhang et al 2017 the enrichment experiments confirmed the divergence of denitrification and anammox rates with the supplement of no2 and a low nar enzyme activity a suitable concentration of electron acceptors of no2 could improve n removal through anammox and denitrification however lake sediments were generally characterized by low no2 but sufficient no3 and the limited no2 may significantly restrict the generation of n2 through anammox an appropriate concentration of no2 can also drive the microbial interactions and turnover which highlights the crucial roles of no2 in maintaining the integrity and the functions of n related microbes roland et al 2018 coupled denitrification and anammox may play significant roles in removing n and the competition for no2 strongly influenced the n removal activities in lake sediments oshiki et al 2016 nar enzyme catalyzes no3 reduction to no2 and promotes the fixation of no2 in sediments however due to the low availability of nar the utilization of no3 decreased significantly and resulted in weak n cycling in the sediments fig 8 also the availability of no2 and no3 as electron acceptors could significantly affecthe n removal processes 5 conclusions this study reveals the roles and underlying mechanisms of denitrifying and anammox communities in n removal by analyzing field lake samples and laboratory enrichment experiments we found that the concentrations of no2 and no3 were the key factors affecting the denitrifying and anammox communities and finally resulted in different n removal rates the concentrations of no2 and no3 may affect these microbial communities by regulating nar activity which determined the reduction rate of no3 to no2 we also found that a suitable amount of electron acceptors such as no2 could simultaneously improve the nitrogen removal by anammox and denitrification however lake sediments generally with low no2 but sufficient no3 and the limited no2 may significantly restrict the generation of n2 through denitrification and anammox thus the anammox activity was low in shallow eutrophic lake sediments due to the no2 limitation this study highlighted that the no2 and no3 reduction driving the microbial n cycling in eutrophic lake

15805,the anaerobic microbial nitrogen n removal in lake sediments is one of the most important processes driving the nitrogen cycling in lake ecosystems however the n removal and its underlying mechanisms regulated by denitrifying and anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox bacteria in lake sediments remain poorly understood with the field sediments collected from different areas of lake donghu a shallow eutrophic lake we examined the denitrifying and anammox bacterial communities by sequencing the nirs k and hzsb genes respectively the results indicated that denitrifiers in sediments were affiliated to nine clusters which are involved in both heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification however anammox bacteria were only dominated by candidatus brocadia we found that no3 and no2 concentrations as well as nar enzyme activity were the key factors affecting denitrifying and anammox communities in this eutrophic lake the enrichment experiments in bioreactors confirmed the divergence of denitrification and anammox rates with an additional complement of no2 especially under a condition low nitrate reductase activity the coupled denitrification and anammox may play significant roles in n removal and the availability of electronic acceptors i e no2 and no3 strongly influenced the n loss in lake sediments further path analysis indicated that no2 no3 and some n related enzymes were the key factors affecting microbial n removal in lake sediments this study advances our understanding of the mechanisms driving the of denitrification and anammox in lake sediments which also provides new insights into coupled denitrification anammox n removal in eutrophic lake ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrogen removal denitrification anammox nitrogen related enzymes functional gene sequencing 1 introduction the eutrophication of lakes is a worldwide environmental problem especially for most of the urban lakes in china jin et al 2005 yang et al 2017 nitrogen n pollution is one of the major causes of eutrophication and thus the n removal is a critical issue for controlling the eutrophication in lakes gruber and galloway 2008 the pathways involved in n removal for lake ecosystems have attracted considerable attention in recent years vila costa et al 2016 there are four microbial metabolic processes in responsible for no2 and no3 reduction and nh4 oxidization including nitrification denitrification dissimilatory no3 reduction to ammonium dnra and anammox roland et al 2018 nh4 oxidation provides no2 for denitrification and anammox but it also competes with anammox for nh4 leininger et al 2006 denitrification includes the successive reduction of no3 to no2 and subsequently generate n2 but anammox utilize substrates of no2 and may affect denitrification yang et al 2017 generally denitrification is expected to dominate in environments with high organic matters whereas a high concentration of organic matters may inhibit anammox yang et al 2020b thus clarifying the mechanisms regulating these competing processes is crucial for predicting modeling and managing the n cycling kuypers et al 2018 in shallow eutrophic lake sediments denitrification and anammox have been recognized as the major n removal processes moreover their functions and activities could be regulated by n compounds and different environmental factors roland et al 2018 yang et al 2017 for example low dissolved oxygen may strongly affect the n and c biogeochemical processes liu et al 2015 the concentration of substances was found to be a key determinant affecting the denitrification rates because no3 and organic carbon act as a terminal electron acceptors and electron donors for denitrifying bacteria ma et al 2020 although the heterotrophic denitrification has been widely studied wang et al 2018 the regulation of denitrification and other metabolisms of electron donors and acceptors in freshwater eutrophic lakes remain unclear qiu et al 2020 particullarly we have much less knowledge of anammox process which is a complex metabolic process that occurs in various environments kartal et al 2013 strous et al 2002 recent studies showed that some intermediates such as so4 2 no2 no3 s2 and s might affect the removal efficiencies of nh4 and no2 through anammox process zhang et al 2019a denitrification and anammox are generally anaerobic processes which are significantly affected by the concentration of o2 as well as the availability of the different substrates such as organic matter no2 no3 nh4 ma et al 2020 roland et al 2018 in lake environments the high flux of n oxides drives most of the sediments to an active state which may be helpful for denitrification and anammox processes humbert et al 2010 li et al 2010 previous studies found that environmental factors such as dissolved oxygen temperature and n availability microbial diversity and abundance all could affected the n cycling in lakes wu et al 2012 yoshinaga et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 the temporal variations could also greatly affect the denitrifying and anammox communities in freshwater lakes liu et al 2018 however environmental effects on the distribution of denitrifying and anammox bacteria in different lake ecosystem remain largely inconsistent yang et al 2019 moreover the cooccurrence and regulation of denitrification and anammox metabolisms across freshwater lake cosystems remain unclear microbial community activity is always closely correlated with environmental conditions rocca et al 2015 in turn diverse metabolic capabilities of microbes may result in different n metabolites which can also affect the environmental conditions liu et al 2018 therefore it is important to clarify these processes in sediments from the microbial perspective to improve our understanding of n removal in eutrophic lakes fu et al 2019 previous studies found that environmental factors such as dissolved oxygen temperature and n availability microbial diversity and abundance all could affected the n cycling in lakes hu et al 2012 sun et al 2014 yang et al 2021 zhu et al 2015 for example microbial abundance and diversity were important in controlling denitrification and anammox rates ma et al 2020 trophic status determined the patterns of denitrifying and anammox communities in sediments yang et al 2017 anammox activity is highly dependent on local environmental conditions oshiki et al 2016 however such understanding mainly focused on the community composition and its spatio temporal variations but how the environmental factors affecting the linkage and coupling of denitrification and anammox in lake sediments remains unclear leininger et al 2006 wang et al 2017 in this study we aimed to evaluate the effects of environmental factors on the denitrification and anammox and determine the key processes driving the dynamics of denitrifying and anammox communities in eutrophic lake sediments we hypothesized that no2 concentration was a key factor affecting denitrification and anammox processes in the sediments eutrophic lake ecosystems to test this hypothesis a total of 25 sediment samples were collected from eutrophic lake donghu wuhan china with relative high n concentrations we analyzed both denitrifying and anammox bacteria by sequencing the functional genes nirs k and hzsb repectively the enzyme activities associated with n cycling were also determined to evaluate the n removal potential our results provide refined knowledge about the microbial n removal in lake sediments which is also especially important for increasing our understanding of the n sink in lake ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples collection and environmental

denitrification and anammox to test whether denitrification and anammox rates in the sediments are significantly affected by no2 concentrations we performed bioreactor experiments with lake sediments

using the glmnet package in r the anova and t test were performed to assess the difference using spss version 24 0 and the significant level was examined at p 0 05 yang et al 2020c the dissimilarities

and dominant taxa r packages including corrplot and pheatmap were used for the rda and spearman analyses mantel text was used to determine the correlation between microbial communities and physicochemical factors as described previously yu et al 2021 the co occurrence networks were constructed by a phylogenetic molecular ecological network analysis menap pipeline http ieg4 rccc ou edu mena using random matrix theory rmt based methods according to our previous study yu et al 2021 networks were visualized by the gephi software structural equation modeling analysis sem a powerful statistical method to reveal interactive relationships among manifest variables and latent variables was used to analyze the relationships between n cycling microbial community and environmental factors the sem model with latent variable manifest variables and path diagram fig s3 was constructed using plspm packages in r sanchez 2013 3 results 3 1 environmental characterization of lake sediments to understand the n transformation processes in lake donghu we measured concentrations of no3 no2 and nh4 in sediments the no3 and no2 showed considerable variations which ranging from 100 to 400 and 2 to 12 mg n kg respectively table 1 the concentration of no3 was approximately 20 30 times higher than that of no2 the linear regression analysis indicated that no3 was positively correlated r 0 50 p 0 001 with no2 fig s4 nh4 concentration ranged between 20 and 60 mg n kg which was significantly lower than that of the no3 concentration however the no3 was negatively correlated r 0 42 p 0 01 with nh4 fig s4 to intuitively evaluate the conversion capacity of denitrification and anammox the concentrations of tc and tn in sediments were also determined results indicated that there were no significant differences for the tc 28 34 48 82 mg g and tn concentrations 2 60 5 44 mg g among all samples 3 2 n related enzyme activity of lake sediments the results showed that the activity of nar and nir ranged from 3 72 to 4 73 and 2328 37 to 2860 64 μmol d g respectively fig 2 a among the seven investigated n related enzymes nitrite reductase showed the highest activity whereas nitrate reductase was the lowest fig 2b this indicated that no3 reduction rate no3 no2 catalyzed by nar might much lower than no2 reduction rate no2 no catalyzed by nir the activity of nor and nos were 274 70 and 188 73 μmol d g respectively this was an important signal that the no2 reduction rate was faster than other denitrification processes under enzymatic catalysis moreover the activity of nxr ranged from 905 94 to 2096 91 μmol d g the high activity of nxr leads to no3 accumulation the activities of hzs and amo ranged from 44 50 to 74 39 μmol d g and 64 15 to 120 94 μmol d g respectively the nh4 oxidation under oxygen limited and the aerobic condition was the major pathway to remove nh4 together different activities of n transformation enzymes are employed among the denitrifying and anammox bacterial groups which could result in no3 accumulates and no2 utilization 3 3 diversity composition and structure of denitrifying and anammox communities in order to better understand the denitrification and anammox processes and n transformation mechanisms in sediments nirs k and hzsb gene amplicons were sequenced the rarefaction curves of denitrifying otus based on nirs k gene sequences showed a good coverage fig s5 the high consistent results of α diversity suggesting the universality in the diversity and richness of bacterial communities throughout lake donghu fig 3 a pcoa results showed that the denitrifying communities were significantly p 0 05 distinct among different sites indicating that the distribution of denitrification was strikingly different fig 3b the major denitrifying clusters detected including proteobacteria 99 and chloroflexi 0 5 classification at the genus level indicated that dominant genera were rubrivivax and pseudomonas fig 4 in addition prosthecomicrobium anaerolinea cupriavidus and sulfurifustis were also showed relative high abundance the rarefaction curves of anammox otus based on hzsb gene sequences showed a good coverage fig s5 the α diversity of anammox bacterial communities in lake donghu was significantly p 0 05 different fig 3a pcoa results showed that the anammox community were significantly p 0 05 different among sampling sites fig 3b the candidatus brocadia was the most dominat anammox genus followed by candidatus kuenenia and candidatus jetteni fig 4 however about 80 90 of the anammox bacteria detected in this study were unclassified at the genus level indicating there may be lot of new members 3 4 relationships between denitrifying or anammox communities and environmental variables pairwise spearman s correlation and partial mantel tests were used to reveal environmental drivers of ammonia oxidation denitrifying and anammox communities our results showed that both denitrifying and anammox communities were significantly p 0 01 correlated with no2 concentration and nar hzs enzymes fig 5 a moreover there was a significant relationship between denitrifying community and nir enzymes fig 5a some denitrifying communities were significantly p 0 01 correlated with no2 and no3 concentrations in sediments fig 5b moreover the abundant of candidatus brocadia a typical anammox bacterium was positively correlated with no2 concentration fig 5b the linear regression showed that no2 and no3 had significant correlations with the shannon and simpson index of the denitrifying and anammox communities p 0 01 fig s6 besides nir nar hzs and no2 also explained considerable variations of the denitrifying and anammox communities fig 5c and no2 concentration was always found to be the key factor shaping the denitrification and anammox communits correlation analysis showed that denitrifying and anammox communities are significantly affected by substrate concentrations and nar enzyme activity nor nos enzymes and do had weak correlations with the denitrifying and anammox communities the co occurrence networks of denitrification and anammox with the environmental factors indicated that nar and no3 no2 were the key factors to drive the denitrifying and anammox communities fig 5d however we found that the number of denitrifying keystone taxa linked with the environmental factors were more than that of anammox fig s7 the interspecies interactions showed that 14 of the links between denitrifying and anammox bacteria were negative connections indicating clear competition between denitrifying and anammox bacteria fig 5e based on the path model of denitrification and anammox the concentrations of no2 and no3 showed significant effects p 0 01 on the rates and denitrifying and anammox communities fig 6 environmental factors showed negative effects on denitrification enzymes the enzymes involved in n cycling could explain the denitrifying communities well and denitrifying communities showed the strongest positive effects on the denitrification rate the no2 no3 and nar nir hzs were the main environmental factors driving the dynamics of denitrification and anammox communities 3 5 effects of no2 on the integration of denitrification and anammox processes the concentrations of no2 and no3 were the key factors affecting the n removal and the structures of denitrifying and anammox communities a relative higher concentration of no3 compared to that of no2 accompanied with a lower nar enzyme activity could be attributed to a low no3 reduction rate the low no3 reduction rate in denitrification could inhibit the anammox activity through reducing the no2 availability to test whether the denitrification and anammox rates could be promoted by sufficient no2 we performed bioreactor experiments with lake sediments by adding no2 during the experiment the sediment was fed by inorganic synthetic wastewater with 30 0 mg n l no2 and 10 0 mg n l nh4 with a 12 h hydraulic retention time the concentration of organics initially was sufficient and the no2 removal efficiency was high confirming high denitrification rate with sufficient no2 as electron acceptor fig 7 a however we could not detect clear consumption of nh4 at the beginning of the experiment fig 7a after 30 days the no2 in the effluent increased from approximately 3 73 mg n l to 15 66 mg n l and the nh4 removal efficiency was increased from 35 to 56 the sediments were fed by inorganic synthetic wastewater using no2 as the sole nitrogen source heterotrophic denitrifiers began to die due to the lack of organic substrates that the influent nitrite could not be efficiently removed through denitrification process the activity of anammox was very low at the beginning of the enrichment that no2 could also not be removed through anammox process from days 32 to 56 no2 removal efficiency gradually increased from 47 to 89 and the nh4 removal rate reached 6 49 mg n l d the removal of nh4 gradually increased with the enhancing of anammox activity in the anaerobic conditions fig s8 the production of no3 could be detected in the effluent with an average concentration of 2 5 mg n l after adding the labelled 15nh4 as substrates the scale of the measured denitrification and anammox rates are linearly increased fig 7b thus although the nar enzyme activity was low the supplementation of no2 could increase denitrification and anammox rates 4 discussion the widely distributed denitrification and anammox bacteria in sediments contribute significantly to n removal in eutrophic lakes which greatly increased our understanding of n cycling in aquatic ecosystems wang et al 2020 although the n removal could be affected by various environmental factors ma et al 2020 how denitrification and anammox bacteria regulated in lake ecosystems remains unclear this study found that no3 and no2 concentrations as well as nar enzyme activity were the key factors affecting the denitrification and anammox communities in lake ecosystems specifically the availability of no2 and no3 could control the abundances of denitrifying bacteria in subsurface sediments moreover the competition for no2 between denitrification and anammox may significantly influenced the n removal in sediments of eutrophic lake ecosystems the relative contributions of abiotic and biotic factors affecting denitrification and anammox are highly variable which complicate the microbial n cycling in sediments abrego et al 2020 chen et al 2019 ma et al 2020 no3 and no2 could be used as substrates and would affect the diversity and composition of denitrifying and anammox communities and thus could promote n cycling in lake ecosystems yin et al 2019 previous studies found that the available no3 in pore water of sediment was one of the key factors controlling denitrification rate hou et al 2013 the n availability in water was also significantly correlated with the microbial composition and diversity liu et al 2022 xiao et al 2019 we found that no2 and no3 concentrations were the key factors affecting the n removal and the structure of denitrifying community the no2 oxidation is the main biochemical pathway that produces no3 which catalysed by the nitrite oxidoreductase nxr nxr is encoded by aerobic no2 oxidizing bacteria and anaerobic no2 oxidation bacteria kuypers et al 2018 zeng et al 2021 reported that do and orp oxidation reduction potential were significantly correlated with the nxra amoa nirs k nosz in sediments indicating oxygen is a key factor of most nitrifiers however we found no significant correlation between do and sediment denitrifying and anammox communities the oxygen level may only affect the uppermost surface sediment due to the limited oxygen penetration glud 2008 thus the denitrification and anammox seem to be less effected by oxygen level in sediments wu et al 2021 we hypothesized that bacteria performing the comammox process could oxidize ammonia to no3 under oxygen limited conditions and perform partial ammonia oxidation to no2 under oxygen limited conditions recent studies also revealed that marine aoa and nob can oxidize ammonia and nitrite respectively in the omzs kraft et al 2022 sun et al 2021 ammonia oxidation process can be expressed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and accumulate a large amount of no3 su et al 2021 we found that the concentration of no3 was approximately 20 30 times higher than that of no2 moreover the nir enzyme activity was higher than that of nar enzyme suggesting the reduction rate of no2 are stronger than that of no3 the detection of no3 in the operating bioreactors also confirmed this conclusion nar enzyme catalyzes the reduction of no3 to no2 and we found that no2 was the key factor affecting the community structure and n removal rate of anammox and final product will be favored by denitrification in terms of nar nir furthermore there was competition for no2 between anammox bacteria and denitrifiers chen et al 2021 and the nar enzyme could be inhibited in the process of transcription or translation yoshida et al 2012 dnra competes with denitrification for no3 whereas higher no3 concentration may favor denitrification dong et al 2011 silver et al 2001 in this research we also observed a higher concentration of no3 at the same time based on the average potential rates of n loss the annual n loss rates of denitrification were much higher than that of the dnar roland et al 2018 yin et al 2019 correspondingly the nar enzyme activity was low the abundance dnar was lower than that of denitrification thus we mainly focused on the denitrification herein as the ultimate substrate of denitrification no3 with a high concentration could affect the denitrification rate and n related enzyme activities song et al 2010 van kessel et al 2015 lake donghu with relatively high load of no3 would significantly influence the production of no2 leading to inhibition of denitrification and anammox previous studies showed that nutrient levels could significantly affect the patterns of microbial communities however the concentration of no2 was low in lake donghu the effects of no2 on the community structure and functional metabolism could not be fully explained by the data we obtained in the current study further study of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics may help us to explore the influence of no2 concentration on the functional metabolism different types of electron donors e g organics and sulfide are available for denitrifying bacteria and they tend to use various electron acceptors e g no3 and no2 burgin and hamilton 2008 qiu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 we found that the nir enzyme activity was higher than that of nar enzyme suggesting the reduction rate of no2 are stronger than that of no3 previous studies have found that the no2 reduction pathway of different anammox genera differed significantly and both the nirs and nirk orthologues were missed in the candidatus brocadia gori et al 2011 oshiki et al 2016 in this study the dominant anammox genus in the sediments was identified as candidatus brocadia fig 4 there also have no relevant nir enzyme synthesis detected in candidatus brocadia bai et al 2016 at the same the abundance anammox was low we believed that nir could be used to represent denitrification process during the sulfur and sulfide based denitrification sulfidogenic bacteria prefer to use no2 as electron acceptors li et al 2021 sun et al 2017 kojima et al 2015 we found that dominant genera were rubrivivax and pseudomonas which were the important key bacteria controlling the reduction of no2 in lakes deng et al 2021 he et al 2019 lu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b zhang et al 2022 wang et al 2018 the autotrophic denitrification in sediments were also affected by the sulfide as well as the reduction of no2 and no3 suggesting that the redox of no2 no3 and the activities of nar and nir enzymes determined the accumulation of no2 and no3 le roux et al 2013 similarly the nar and nir enzymes were also the key factors affecting denitrification as they could be directly influenced by no2 and no3 therefore different denitrifying populations had contrasting physiological characteristics showing high sensitivities to environmental changes enwall et al 2010 the availability of no2 and no3 may be the key factors controlling the abundances of denitrifying bacteria in subsurface sediments rissanen et al 2013 the microbial n cycling also could be driven by the competition for no2 by denitrifying and anammox bacteria which was confirmed by the strong correlation of denitrifiers and anammox bacteria with no2 kartal et al 2013 zeng et al 2021 thus the metabolic pathway of no2 is an important factor affecting the community composition of denitrification and anammox zhang et al 2017 we also found the concentrations of no2 and no3 might be important in affecting the relative abundances of anammox suggesting that the reduction rate of no3 in denitrification limited the availability of no2 and the activity of anammox qian et al 2018 van de vossenberg et al 2008 species co occurrences networks can reveal the role of interspecific interactions in determining the community structure and ecological functions in this study the co occurrence networks of denitrifying and anammox communities showed 14 of negative connections suggesting competitive interactions wang et al 2012 nh4 and organics become the major electron donors the metabolic pathway of no2 is an important factor affecting the community composition of denitrification and anammox zhang et al 2017 the enrichment experiments confirmed the divergence of denitrification and anammox rates with the supplement of no2 and a low nar enzyme activity a suitable concentration of electron acceptors of no2 could improve n removal through anammox and denitrification however lake sediments were generally characterized by low no2 but sufficient no3 and the limited no2 may significantly restrict the generation of n2 through anammox an appropriate concentration of no2 can also drive the microbial interactions and turnover which highlights the crucial roles of no2 in maintaining the integrity and the functions of n related microbes roland et al 2018 coupled denitrification and anammox may play significant roles in removing n and the competition for no2 strongly influenced the n removal activities in lake sediments oshiki et al 2016 nar enzyme catalyzes no3 reduction to no2 and promotes the fixation of no2 in sediments however due to the low availability of nar the utilization of no3 decreased significantly and resulted in weak n cycling in the sediments fig 8 also the availability of no2 and no3 as electron acceptors could significantly affecthe n removal processes 5 conclusions this study reveals the roles and underlying mechanisms of denitrifying and anammox communities in n removal by analyzing field lake samples and laboratory enrichment experiments we found that the concentrations of no2 and no3 were the key factors affecting the denitrifying and anammox communities and finally resulted in different n removal rates the concentrations of no2 and no3 may affect these microbial communities by regulating nar activity which determined the reduction rate of no3 to no2 we also found that a suitable amount of electron acceptors such as no2 could simultaneously improve the nitrogen removal by anammox and denitrification however lake sediments generally with low no2 but sufficient no3 and the limited no2 may significantly restrict the generation of n2 through denitrification and anammox thus the anammox activity was low in shallow eutrophic lake sediments due to the no2 limitation this study highlighted that the no2 and no3 reduction driving the microbial n cycling in eutrophic lake ecosystems future studies may focus on clarifying the mechanism regulating the denitrification and anammox to increase the n removal in eutrophic lakes declaration of competing interest the authors

15806,the hydrolysate species of metal based coagulants and the binding sites of humic acid ha are highly dependent on the ph conditions exploring the binding sites and modes between coagulant hydrolysates and ha molecules is critical to understanding the coagulation mechanism in this paper the binding behavior between ha molecules and the hydrolysates of a polyaluminum titanium chloride composite coagulant patc was investigated under different ph conditions by semi quantitative ftir and xps it was found that oligomeric and mesopolymeric hydrolysates were the dominant species under acid conditions which could complex with the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of ha by forming coal ti coordinate bonds however large amounts of h could compete with al3 and weaken the removal efficiency of ha with the increase of ph the hydrolysis process of the patc and the deprotonation of ha were simultaneously underway under weakly acid conditions the complexation of the aluminum hydrolysates with carboxyl groups was improved due to the gradually diminishing competition of h and the enhanced charge neutralization of the further polymerized hydrolysates consequently the maximum uv254 removal by adding patc was observed at ph 6 under alkaline conditions the sweeping effect of amorphous hydroxide dominated the ha removals which was accompanied by the surface complexation of al ti nuclear with carboxyl groups as well as the hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl and hydroxide this study provides a new clue for the interaction mechanisms between the hydrolysates of composite coagulants and the dominant functional groups of ha at various ph conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords composite coagulants binding behavior coagulation mechanism ph effect semi quantitative ftir 1 introduction coagulation plays an important role in water wastewater treatment gan et al 2021c wang et al 2018a wang et al 2019 traditional coagulants such as aluminum al and iron fe are widely used to remove suspended solids lan et al 2009 organic matters dayarathne et al 2021 and inorganic ions wang et al 2018b however some shortages of al fe coagulants such as huge emission of chemical sludge large dosage low efficiency of removing hydrophilic organics and toxicity of the residual al limit their further application huang et al 2014 hussain et al 2019 wang et al 2021 previous studies have shown that ti based coagulants has better coagulation performance than al fe coagulants in removing organic matters and micropollutants gan et al 2021c wan et al 2019 zhao and li 2019 ti coagulants have several advantages over al fe coagulants i the coagulation efficiency is relatively insensitive to temperature and ph variation ii floc properties are excellent for example fast growth rates large sizes and good sedimentation iii the chemical sludge can be collected and calcined to prepare tio2 gan et al 2021c wang et al 2021 zhao et al 2020a zhao et al 2020b zhao et al 2015 however simple ti salts ticl4 and ti so4 2 would greatly reduce the effluent ph and exhibit poor stability during storage du et al 2021 zhao et al 2013 although prehydrolysis could overcome the above drawbacks to some extent polymerized ti salts with high basicities used in previous studies were still volatile gan et al 2021a huang et al 2016 to overcome the deficiency of single metal salts developing composite coagulants with appreciable stabilities and excellent coagulation efficiency has attracted public attention in our previous work liu et al 2022 a series of polyaluminum titanium chloride composite coagulants patc were prepared by co polymerization of alcl3 6h2o and ticl4 patc with a 4 atom rings structure was proved to be efficient and stable even at high basicities patc showed a high removal efficiency of approximately 77 03 for organic matters liu et al 2022 however the potential interaction between the hydrolysates of patc and humic acid ha molecules remains unclear with a complex structure ha contains large amounts of functional groups including double bonds aromatic rings carbonyl co hydroxyl oh and carboxyl cooh ai et al 2020 bahemmat et al 2016 jin et al 2018 the ph of test water will affect the protonation and deprotonation process of the functional groups in ha which will further change the binding sites and modes between ha and coagulants jin et al 2018 wang et al 2018b the alteration of binding sites and modes leads to a change in the interaction between ha and metal salts thereby affecting the removal efficiency of ha kong et al 2021 song et al 2019b several researchers have investigated the complexation behaviors between ha and al salts under different ph conditions kong et al 2021 lv et al 2021 ma et al 2022 jin et al demonstrated that a linear complexation reaction between al and ha was observed when ph 7 while in the neutral state there was no reaction between free al and ha until the concentration of al reached a level that triggered the formation of al oh 3 jin et al 2018 lin et al investigated the coagulation behavior of sulfate containing pac pacc and al13 containing pac pacl al13 to remove the organic matter under weakly acidic conditions they found that the main coagulation mechanism for pacc was al oh 3 ha co precipitation while that for pacl al13 was charge neutralization and complexation lin et al 2014 song et al indicated that the binding sites of ha with different affinities had different complexing ability to al hydrolysates and the synergistic effects of different al hydrolysates influenced the complexation efficiency of ha song et al 2019a song et al also found that under weakly acidic conditions al3 could complex with the cooh of ha while under neutral conditions sweeping effects by the aluminum hydroxide were the dominant mechanism for ha removals song et al 2019b based on the above findings it can be concluded that the hydrolysate species of the metal based coagulants and the binding sites of ha molecules are highly dependent on the ph conditions and their binding behaviors determine the removal efficiency of ha accordingly exploring the complexation behavior between coagulants and ha molecules is conducive to clarifying the coagulation mechanism however previous studies mainly focused on the complexation behaviors of single al based coagulants with ha but almost no study reported the complexation behaviors and mechanism of ti based coagulants and composite coagulants with ha molecules from the perspective of functional groups hence the objective of this study is to elucidate the binding behavior between the hydrolysates of patc and the functional groups of ha under different ph conditions and then explain the reason why patc has better ha removal efficiency than polyaluminum chloride pac and polytitanium chloride ptc pac ptc and patc were used for ha kaolin simulated water treatment under different ph conditions the coagulation efficiency and floc properties were analyzed a three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix 3d eem was adopted to determine the distribution of the organics before and after coagulation x ray photoelectron spectra xps and semi quantitative analysis of fourier transformed infrared ft ir spectroscopy were used to identify the functional groups in ha molecules coagulants and flocs the complexation behaviors and mechanisms were explored by studying the changes of the functional groups in ha molecules after coagulation as well as the morphological transformation of mental hydrolysates under different ph conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and test water alcl3 6h2o na2co3 and kaolin were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd humic acid ha was provided by sigma aldrich shanghai trading co ltd ticl4 purity 99 was obtained from macklin biochemical technology co ltd all chemicals were used as received without further purification ha is a main natural organic matter nom which accounts for about 50 90 of the total organic matter contents in surface water yue et al 2021 therefore ha was used as a typical nom in this study notably there are many kinds of nom including allochthonous nom and authigenic nom in surface water ho et al 2022 liang et al 2021 therefore it is not comprehensive enough to represent nom by ha only but the efficient removal of ha is important to improve water quality besides exploring the interaction mechanism between ha and coagulants has great guidance for the removal of nom in actual water treatment the ha stock solution was prepared by adding 1 0 g ha and 0 4 g naoh to 1 0 l deionized water kaolin stock solution was obtained by adding kaolin 5 0 g to 1 0 l of deionized water lv et al 2021 the concentrations of background ions in ha kaolin test water were determined by ion chromatography ics 1100 the test water contained 78 14 mg l cl 18 78 mg l no3 69 71 mg l so4 2 6 1 mg l k 68 4 mg l ca2 99 9 mg l na and 21 2 mg l mg2 2 2 preparation and characterization of pac ptc and patc patc 0 1 mol al3 l with al ti molar ratios of 15 20 and 30 were prepared as follows liu et al 2022 0 26 ml of diluted ticl4 density ρ 1 26 g ml was added dropwise to 200 ml of alcl3 solution under stirring then a certain mass of na2co3 was dissolved and slowly added to the mixed solution to achieve the predetermined basicity 0 5 0 8 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 detailed information about the preparation of pac and ptc can be found in the supporting information section s2 the ph of coagulants was adjusted with hcl 1 m or naoh 1 m and then the charges and molecular weights of the hydrolysates were measured by the zetasizer nano zs instrument malvern instruments uk and gel permeation chromatography gpc pl gpc50 0 2 m nano3 at the rate of 1 0 ml min respectively afm bruker dimension icon and tem fei tecnai g2 f20 were used to observe the morphology of the freeze dried hydrolysates more details about the gpc afm and tem characterization methods are shown in s3 of the supporting information ftir thermo scientific nicolet in10 analyses were conducted to characterize the functional groups of the freeze dried hydrolysates 2 3 coagulation experiments in order to eliminate the effect of ph the simulated water samples were adjusted to a certain ph before adding coagulant and the final ph of the coagulated water samples was adjusted to the same ph the coagulation experiments were conducted with a standard jar test apparatus zr4 6 zhongrun water industry technology development co ltd china according to the following procedure 30 s rapid mixing 200 rpm 40 s rapid mixing 200 rpm 20 min slow mixing 50 rpm and 30 min sedimentation after the slow mixing phase the aggregated flocs were exposed to a shear force at 200 rpm 5 min and then slowly mixed at 50 rpm 20 min to regrow the flocs a continuous laser particle size scattering instrument malvern mastersizer 3000 malvern uk was used to record the particle size of the flocs and the floc properties including fractal dimension df strength factor sf and recovery factor rf were obtained based on the size values liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the specific calculations of df sf and rf are presented in s4 of the supporting information the supernatant after coagulation was collected and used directly for turbidity turbidity dimeter 2100 q hach us and zeta potential determination after filtration with a 0 45 μm membrane the filtrate was further analyzed for the measurement of uv254 absorbance tu 1810 uv vis spectrophotometer persee china dissolved organic carbon doc doc vcph total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu japan and 3d eem fluoromax 4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi japan the excitation range of 200 480 nm and emission range of 200 550 nm was utilized to characterize the 3d eem of organic matter before and after coagulation wang et al 2018b fluorescence regional integration fri was used for quantitative analysis of 3d eem to compare the changes of organic matters before and after coagulation chen et al 2014 chen et al 2003 ma et al 2014 the specific calculation method and parameters of fri are shown in the supporting information the functional groups of the freeze dried flocs were characterized by xps thermo scientific k alpha and ftir analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 coagulation performance comparative tests of coagulation performance were conducted using patc with different b values and al ti molar ratios patc with al ti 15 and b 1 5 was preferably selected supporting information section s4 fig 1 a b showed that the removal of turbidity and organic matter by pac ptc and patc increased first and then decreased with the increase of ph at ph 8 patc achieved the maximum removal efficiency for turbidity uv254 and doc with 94 75 76 53 and 42 45 respectively patc led to a high removal efficiency of turbidity and organic matter in a relatively wider ph range compared with pac and ptc fig 1 a b and fig s2 the df values and particle sizes of flocs formed by pac ptc and patc at different ph values are presented in table 1 in the ph range of 2 8 the flocs formed by ptc had larger particle sizes and df values than pac and patc the large df sf and rf values indicated that the flocs had compact structure strong resistance and excellent recovery ability li et al 2006 liu et al 2020 the results in table 1 and fig s3 showed that the floc structure fragmentation resistance and recoverability of ptc and pac were highly dependent on the ph value compared with the flocs formed by pac and ptc those formed by patc exhibited better recoverability under alkaline conditions also the floc size and df values of flocs formed by patc were relatively insensitive to ph variation 3 2 three dimensional fluorescence analysis 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to examine the changes of organic matter after coagulation lv et al 2021 eem spectra were divided into five regions as reported in previous studies chen et al 2003 liu et al 2020 herein five regions showed fluorescence responses which represented aromatic proteins i region i aromatic proteins ii region ii fulvic acid fa like organics region iii tryptophan protein like materials region iv and ha like substances region v respectively liu et al 2020 as shown in fig 2 the coagulation performance of ptc was highly dependent on ph variation and the removals of organic matters deteriorated sharply with the increase of ph however pac and patc were relatively independent on ph changes especially patc which showed a considerable removal efficiency for organic matters even under alkaline conditions to better demonstrate the variation of organic matter contents before and after coagulation eem spectra were analyzed by fri method the fri parameters are shown in table 2 at ph 4 ptc was more effective in removing aromatic proteins i and ii fa like organics tryptophan protein like materials and ha like substances than pac and patc at ph 7 the considerable decline of the fluorescence responses was achieved by the pac and patc system which displayed low residual concentrations of ha like substances and fa like organics it was worth noting that patc was more effective in removing fa like organics than pac table 2 at ph 10 the performance of pac ptc and patc was weakened in varying degrees and patc showed the best effect on the removals of ha like and fa like substances fig 2 the phenomena were consistent with the coagulation efficiency in section 3 1 which could be interpreted by the various hydrolysate species of patc under different ph conditions ptc hydrolysates including tio oh and tio oh 2 am gan et al 2021b were the dominant species in removing organic matters under acidic conditions and then the hydrolysates of ptc were converted to tio oh 2 aq tio oh 2 am and tio oh 3 under neutral and alkaline conditions gan et al 2021a the charge repulsion between the negatively charged hydrolysates and organic matters would weaken the complexation reaction which ultimately led to a decrease in the organic matter removals pac hydrolysates such as al oh 2 al oh 2 al2 oh 2 4 and al3 oh 4 5 could complex with ha like substances at ph 4 gong et al 2022 song et al 2019b and then pac hydrolysates including alo4al12 oh 24 h2o 12 7 and al oh 3 am became the predominant species to neutralize ha like and fa like organics when the ph value was about 7 yan et al 2008 next the negatively charged al oh 4 and al oh 3 aq with poor charge neutralizing ability played a key role in contaminant removals at ph 10 which could explain the unsatisfactory coagulation efficiency under alkaline conditions compared with pac and ptc a new aloti bond was observed in patc as our previous study reported liu et al 2022 the coexistence of aloal tioti and aloti led to the formation of hydrolysates with complex structures and abundant active sites which made patc more stable than pac and ptc therefore patc was relatively insensitive to ph variation and efficient in removing ha like and fa like substances over pac and ptc under neutral and alkaline conditions and the reason why patc was efficient in removing organic matters under neutral and alkaline conditions would be explained in detail in section 3 5 3 3 x ray photoelectron spectra xps analysis the interaction between coagulants and organic matters under different ph conditions was investigated by xps the high resolution o1s core level spectra of samples are shown in fig 3 before coagulation the peaks at 531 87 ev and 533 48 ev belonged to o c and oc respectively guo et al 2020 lu et al 2021 after pac ptc and patc coagulation the o c and oc peaks of the flocs moved to the direction of low binding energy at ph 4 this phenomenon was due to the interaction between coagulants and organic matters which changes the electrostatic potential field of the core electrons of o atom thereby resulting in a decrease in o1s binding energy lu et al 2021 after coagulation the characteristic peaks of both c o and co bonds in flocs exhibited a shift toward low binding energy at ph 4 and 7 which demonstrated that oh and cooh was likely the main binding site of ha to complex metal hydrolysates under acidic and neutral conditions fig 3 when the ph was about 10 adding any one of the three coagulants did not lead to the shift of the oc and oc peaks which indicated that with the increase of ph value the coagulation mechanism converted from charge neutralization and complexation to a sweeping effect the background subtracted high resolution c1s core level spectra are shown in fig 4 four peaks at 284 58 ev 285 87 ev 286 8 ev and 288 2 ev were observed in the c1s spectra of test water these peaks can be assigned to unsubstituted aromatic carbon cc ch α carbon cco alcohol carbon coh and carboxylic carbon cooh respectively jin et al 2018 liu et al 2020 no obvious peak shift was observed in the flocs formed by pac ptc and patc at the studied ph values which indicated that the electron transfer between coagulants and organics was not related to the c atom but mainly to the o atom the results were consistent with that of o1s spectra which demonstrated that hydroxyl and carboxyl were the dominant binding sites of ha to complex metal hydrolysates under acidic and neutral conditions more importantly our findings were consistent with some studies that hydroxyl and carboxyl in ha were the main binding sites to complex metal ions jin et al 2018 song et al 2019a song et al 2019b however lin et al held a different view that aromatic cc of ha was preferentially removed by al salts which was concluded from the peak shift and the changes of peak area in c1s spectra lin et al 2014 besides zhao et al reported that alcl3 could remove aromatic aliphatic and carboxyl structures zhao et al 2009 the contradictory conclusions could be explained as that carbonaceous groups in ha would inevitably decrease once ha molecules were removed no matter which functional group the binding site was the characterization techniques used in the aforementioned studies were ftir and xps which is more suitable for qualitative analysis not for quantitative analysis to further investigate the main binding sites of ha a semi quantitative analysis of ftir spectra was adopted in this study 3 4 semi quantitative ftir analysis the functional groups of coagulants and flocs were examined by ftir fig 5 with the increase of ph the absorption peaks corresponding to the alcoholic hydroxyl coh 3409 cm 1 symmetrical cooh 1383 cm 1 and phenolic hydroxyl phoh 1249 cm 1 groups of ha showed red shift and blue shift respectively bahemmat et al 2016 monteiro et al 2021 song et al 2019b as the ph increased the intensity of the stretching vibration and peak area of the co peak 1425 cm 1 in cooh groups increased wang et al 2018a the above phenomena indicated that the deprotonation degree of ha deepened with the increase of ph value a semi quantitative analysis of ftir spectra was applied and the results are shown in table 3 at ph 4 the contents of coh phoh and cooh functional groups in ha decreased significantly after coagulation the phenomena indicated that coagulant hydrolysates complexed mainly with coh phoh and cooh of ha under acidic conditions at ph 7 the reduction of the coh and phoh content after coagulation was less than that at ph 4 while the decrease of co in cooh was considerable it indicated that the coagulants reacted predominantly with oh groups under acidic conditions but cooh groups became the main binding sites when ph was neutral at ph 10 the changes in the contents of the functional groups were relatively slight compared with those at ph 4 and 7 however the contents of the coh phoh and co bond in cooh of ha were reduced after coagulation at ph 10 and the reduction in the patc system was the most significant the phenomena seemed to demonstrate that coh phoh and cooh were the main binding sites of ha under alkaline condition however the above result contradicted the xps result that adsorption and sweeping effects were the dominant coagulation mechanism instead of complexation under alkaline condition the contradiction was due to that ftir just determined the functional groups on the surface of the samples but was powerless to detect the functional groups wrapped in the flocs this was why the c1s and o1s peaks of xps at ph 10 showed no shift of peaks after coagulation but the functional groups in ftir spectra were decreased without selectivity after coagulation the possible reaction pathways of pac ptc and patc with ha are listed in fig 6 3 5 mechanism analysis the functional groups of ha especially cooh and oh can protonate and deprotonate in a wide ph range which influenced the amounts of the binding sites in ha jin et al 2018 due to the atoms containing lone pairs of electrons in ha functional groups such as c and o have high electronegativity the charge densities around these atoms are high jin et al 2018 according to the physicochemical properties of these functional groups they can act as lewis bases in solution and then their lone electron pairs can be pushed to the metal side of the coagulants which result in the formation of stable m ha complexes cheng and chi 2002 moreover afm and tem images of patc showed that its hydrolysates had a flower like structure which provided a larger surface area compared with pac and ptc fig 7 a c and fig s4 the flower like structure of patc could provide a large surface area and make it easy to contact with ha at ph 4 ptc generated a large amount of positively charged ti species e g tio oh and tio oh 2 am which could complex with phoh coh and cooh to form coti coordination bonds the empty orbit of metal atoms could accept the lone pair electrons of o atoms in hydroxyl or carboxyl groups which promoted the coordination reaction to form a stable complex song et al 2019b zeta potentials of the flocs were close to the isoelectric point at ph 4 which indicated the leading role of charge neutralization under acid conditions fig 7 g i when the ph reached 7 tio oh 2 aq and tio oh 2 am gradually became the dominant species they could remove organic matters by sweeping flocculation and adsorption lu et al 1999 for pac al oh 2 al oh 2 al2 oh 2 4 and al3 oh 4 5 were the dominant species at ph 4 which could complex with the coh phoh and cooh of ha by forming coal coordinate bonds however large amounts of h could compete with al3 and weak the ha removal efficiency therefore the coagulation performance of pac was bad at ph 4 with the increase of ph the hydrolysis process of the aluminum and the deprotonation of ha molecules were simultaneously underway under weakly acid conditions positively charged hydrolysates like alo4al12 oh 24 h2o 12 7 dominated the ha removals the complexation of the al hydrolysates with carboxyl and hydroxyl groups was improved due to the gradually diminishing competition of h and the enhanced charge neutralization of the further polymerized hydrolysates consequently the maximum uv254 removal by adding pac was observed under weakly acid conditions when the ph was neutral a small part of the positively charged al species was transferred into al oh 3 am which would weaken the charge neutralization ability and provide sweep and adsorption effects but the high zeta potentials of pac at ph 7 indicated a still strong charge neutralization ability of the al hydrolysates therefore uv254 removal efficiency of pac at ph 7 was only slightly poorer than that at ph 6 the transformation of the al species was far different from other study that al oh 3 am was the dominant hydrolysates under neutral conditions zhao et al 2011 which could be interpreted by the stability of the prefabricated al hydrolysates in pac at ph 10 the hydrolysates of pac mostly existed in the forms of al oh 4 and al oh 3 aq al oh 3 aq removed ha mainly by adsorption and sweeping flocculation accompanied by a small amount of the surface complexation with cooh and the hydrogen bonds with oh based on the hydrolysis characteristics of al and ti the possible hydrolysates of patc at different ph conditions were proposed patc hydrolysates including al oh 2o tio and al oh 2tio3 were probably the dominant species at ph 4 which could complex with phoh coh and cooh of ha with the increase of ph the patc hydrolysates turned to aloti oh 2 3 and al2 oh 2o2ti oh 2 2 which could remove ha molecules mainly by the complexation with co of cooh groups moreover compared with pac and ptc patc showed the highest electropositivity and molecular weight at ph 7 which contributed to its best removal efficiency for ha like and fa like substances due to the strong charge neutralization ability the amorphous hydroxide of patc such as ti oh 3o oh 2al played a major role at ph 10 liu et al 2022 our previous study found that the hydrolysates of patc were composited of the polyhydroxy polynuclear complex and hydroxyl bridged al ti polymers liu et al 2022 fig 7d i showed that the hydroxyl bridged al ti polymers had a 4 ring structure which was more complex and stable than the polynuclear hydroxyl complexes of al or ti the previous study believed that the stable hydrolysates had a relatively low affinity with oh wang et al 2004 which was consistent with our finding that the zeta potentials of patc at ph 7 and 10 were higher than those of pac and ptc meanwhile the afm and tem results also confirmed that patc had a unique flower like spatial structure with a large specific surface area which made it easy to contact with contaminants it was why patc performed better than pac and ptc for ha removal especially under neutral and alkaline conditions 4 conclusions in this study we performed an in depth analysis to elucidate the binding behavior between ha molecules and the hydrolysates of patc pac and ptc under different ph conditions using semi quantitative ftir and xps it was found that oligomeric and mesopolymeric hydrolysates were the dominant species under acidic conditions which could complex mainly with coh phoh and cooh groups of ha to form coordinate bonds but large amounts of h could compete with metal ions and occupy the coordinate sites under highly acid conditions when the ph was about neutral the complexation of the metal hydrolysates with carboxyl groups was improved due to the gradually diminishing competition of h and the enhanced charge neutralization of the further polymerized hydrolysates consequently the pronounced uv254 removal by adding patc was observed under weakly acid and neutral conditions with the further increase of ph values amorphous hydrolysates such as ti oh 3o oh 2al occupied the leading role which could remove organic matters by sweeping flocculation and adsorption due to the diversity of hydrolyzed species and the stability of the al ti polymers patc was promising in removing ha like and fa like substances in a wide ph range this study provided a new insight into the interaction mechanisms between the hydrolysates of composite coagulants and the dominant functional groups of ha exploring the coagulation mechanism of patc has a great guiding significance for the efficient removal of nom in actual water treatment further studies should focus on the coagulation behavior and mechanism of patc for removing different nom in actual surface water treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

15806,the hydrolysate species of metal based coagulants and the binding sites of humic acid ha are highly dependent on the ph conditions exploring the binding sites and modes between coagulant hydrolysates and ha molecules is critical to understanding the coagulation mechanism in this paper the binding behavior between ha molecules and the hydrolysates of a polyaluminum titanium chloride composite coagulant patc was investigated under different ph conditions by semi quantitative ftir and xps it was found that oligomeric and mesopolymeric hydrolysates were the dominant species under acid conditions which could complex with the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of ha by forming coal ti coordinate bonds however large amounts of h could compete with al3 and weaken the removal efficiency of ha with the increase of ph the hydrolysis process of the patc and the deprotonation of ha were simultaneously underway under weakly acid conditions the complexation of the aluminum hydrolysates with carboxyl groups was improved due to the gradually diminishing competition of h and the enhanced charge neutralization of the further polymerized hydrolysates consequently the maximum uv254 removal by adding patc was observed at ph 6 under alkaline conditions the sweeping effect of amorphous hydroxide dominated the ha removals which was accompanied by the surface complexation of al ti nuclear with carboxyl groups as well as the hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl and hydroxide this study provides a new clue for the interaction mechanisms between the hydrolysates of composite coagulants and the dominant functional groups of ha at various ph conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords composite coagulants binding behavior coagulation mechanism ph effect semi quantitative ftir 1 introduction coagulation plays an important role in water wastewater treatment gan et al 2021c wang et al 2018a wang et al 2019 traditional coagulants such as aluminum al and iron fe are widely used to remove suspended solids lan et al 2009 organic matters dayarathne et al 2021 and inorganic ions wang et al 2018b however some shortages of al fe coagulants such as huge emission of chemical sludge large dosage low efficiency of removing hydrophilic organics and toxicity of the residual al limit their further application huang et al 2014 hussain et al 2019 wang et al 2021 previous studies have shown that ti based coagulants has better coagulation performance than al fe coagulants in removing organic matters and micropollutants gan et al 2021c wan et al 2019 zhao and li 2019 ti coagulants have several advantages over al fe coagulants i the coagulation efficiency is relatively insensitive to temperature and ph variation ii floc properties are excellent for example fast growth rates large sizes and good sedimentation iii the chemical sludge can be collected and calcined to prepare tio2 gan et al 2021c wang et al 2021 zhao et al 2020a zhao et al 2020b zhao et al 2015 however simple ti salts ticl4 and ti so4 2 would greatly reduce the effluent ph and exhibit poor stability during storage du et al 2021 zhao et al 2013 although prehydrolysis could overcome the above drawbacks to some extent polymerized ti salts with high basicities used in previous studies were still volatile gan et al 2021a huang et al 2016 to overcome the deficiency of single metal salts developing composite coagulants with appreciable stabilities and excellent coagulation efficiency has attracted public attention in our previous work liu et al 2022 a series of polyaluminum titanium chloride composite coagulants patc were prepared by co polymerization of alcl3 6h2o and ticl4 patc with a 4 atom rings structure was proved to be efficient and stable even at high basicities patc showed a high removal efficiency of approximately 77 03 for organic matters liu et al 2022 however the potential interaction between the hydrolysates of patc and humic acid ha molecules remains unclear with a complex structure ha contains large amounts of functional groups including double bonds aromatic rings carbonyl co hydroxyl oh and carboxyl cooh ai et al 2020 bahemmat et al 2016 jin et al 2018 the ph of test water will affect the protonation and deprotonation process of the functional groups in ha which will further change the binding sites and modes between ha and coagulants jin et al 2018 wang et al 2018b the alteration of binding sites and modes leads to a change in the interaction between ha and metal salts thereby affecting the removal efficiency of ha kong et al 2021 song et al 2019b several researchers have investigated the complexation behaviors between ha and al salts under different ph conditions kong et al 2021 lv et al 2021 ma et al 2022 jin et al demonstrated that a linear complexation reaction between al and ha was observed when ph 7 while in the neutral state there was no reaction between free al and ha until the concentration of al reached a level that triggered the formation of al oh 3 jin et al 2018 lin et al investigated the coagulation behavior of sulfate containing pac pacc and al13 containing pac pacl al13 to remove the organic matter under weakly acidic conditions they found that the main coagulation mechanism for pacc was al oh 3 ha co precipitation while that for pacl al13 was charge neutralization and complexation lin et al 2014 song et al indicated that the binding sites of ha with different affinities had different complexing ability to al hydrolysates and the synergistic effects of different al hydrolysates influenced the complexation efficiency of ha song et al 2019a song et al also found that under weakly acidic conditions al3 could complex with the cooh of ha while under neutral conditions sweeping effects by the aluminum hydroxide were the dominant mechanism for ha removals song et al 2019b based on the above findings it can be concluded that the hydrolysate species of the metal based coagulants and the binding sites of ha molecules are highly dependent on the ph conditions and their binding behaviors determine the removal efficiency of ha accordingly exploring the complexation behavior between coagulants and ha molecules is conducive to clarifying the coagulation mechanism however previous studies mainly focused on the complexation behaviors of single al based coagulants with ha but almost no study reported the complexation behaviors and mechanism of ti based coagulants and composite coagulants with ha molecules from the perspective of functional groups hence the objective of this study is to elucidate the binding behavior between the hydrolysates of patc and the functional groups of ha under different ph conditions and then explain the reason why patc has better ha removal efficiency than polyaluminum chloride pac and polytitanium chloride ptc pac ptc and patc were used for ha kaolin simulated water treatment under different ph conditions the coagulation efficiency and floc properties were analyzed a three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix 3d eem was adopted to determine the distribution of the organics before and after coagulation x ray photoelectron spectra xps and semi quantitative analysis of fourier transformed infrared ft ir spectroscopy were used to identify the functional groups in ha molecules coagulants and flocs the complexation behaviors and mechanisms were explored by studying the changes of the functional groups in ha molecules after coagulation as well as the morphological transformation of mental hydrolysates under different ph conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and test water alcl3 6h2o na2co3 and kaolin were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd humic acid ha was provided by sigma aldrich shanghai trading co ltd ticl4 purity 99 was obtained from macklin biochemical technology co ltd all chemicals were used as received without further purification ha is a main natural organic matter nom which accounts for about 50 90 of the total organic matter contents in surface water yue et al 2021 therefore ha was used as a typical nom in this study notably there are many kinds of nom including allochthonous nom and authigenic nom in surface water ho et al 2022 liang et al 2021 therefore it is not comprehensive enough to represent nom by ha only but the efficient removal of ha is important to improve water quality besides exploring the interaction mechanism between ha and coagulants has great guidance for the removal of nom in actual water treatment the ha stock solution was prepared by adding 1 0 g ha and 0 4 g naoh to 1 0 l deionized water kaolin stock solution was obtained by adding kaolin 5 0 g to 1 0 l of deionized water lv et al 2021 the concentrations of background ions in ha kaolin test water were determined by ion chromatography ics 1100 the test water contained 78 14 mg l cl 18 78 mg l no3 69 71 mg l so4 2 6 1 mg l k 68 4 mg l ca2 99 9 mg l na and 21 2 mg l mg2 2 2 preparation and characterization of pac ptc and patc patc 0 1 mol al3 l with al ti molar ratios of 15 20 and 30 were prepared as follows liu et al 2022 0 26 ml of diluted ticl4 density ρ 1 26 g ml was added dropwise to 200 ml of alcl3 solution under stirring then a certain mass of na2co3 was dissolved and slowly added to the mixed solution to achieve the predetermined basicity 0 5 0 8 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 detailed information about the preparation of pac and ptc can be found in the supporting information section s2 the ph of coagulants was adjusted with hcl 1 m or naoh 1 m and then the charges and molecular weights of the hydrolysates were measured by the zetasizer nano zs instrument malvern instruments uk and gel permeation chromatography gpc pl gpc50 0 2 m nano3 at the rate of 1 0 ml min respectively afm bruker dimension icon and tem fei tecnai g2 f20 were used to observe the morphology of the freeze dried hydrolysates more details about the gpc afm and tem characterization methods are shown in s3 of the supporting information ftir thermo scientific nicolet in10 analyses were conducted to characterize the functional groups of the freeze dried hydrolysates 2 3 coagulation experiments in order to eliminate the effect of ph the simulated water samples were adjusted to a certain ph before adding coagulant and the final ph of the coagulated water samples was adjusted to the same ph the coagulation experiments were conducted with a standard jar test apparatus zr4 6 zhongrun water industry technology development co ltd china according to the following procedure 30 s rapid mixing 200 rpm 40 s rapid mixing 200 rpm 20 min slow mixing 50 rpm and 30 min sedimentation after the slow mixing phase the aggregated flocs were exposed to a shear force at 200 rpm 5 min and then slowly mixed at 50 rpm 20 min to regrow the flocs a continuous laser particle size scattering instrument malvern mastersizer 3000 malvern uk was used to record the particle size of the flocs and the floc properties including fractal dimension df strength factor sf and recovery factor rf were obtained based on the size values liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the specific calculations of df sf and rf are presented in s4 of the supporting information the supernatant after coagulation was collected and used directly for turbidity turbidity dimeter 2100 q hach us and zeta potential determination after filtration with a 0 45 μm membrane the filtrate was further analyzed for the measurement of uv254 absorbance tu 1810 uv vis spectrophotometer persee china dissolved organic carbon doc doc vcph total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu japan and 3d eem fluoromax 4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi japan the excitation range of 200 480 nm and emission range of 200 550 nm was utilized to characterize the 3d eem of organic matter before and after coagulation wang et al 2018b fluorescence regional integration fri was used for quantitative analysis of 3d eem to compare the changes of organic matters before and after coagulation chen et al 2014 chen et al 2003 ma et al 2014 the specific calculation method and parameters of fri are shown in the supporting information the functional groups of the freeze dried flocs were characterized by xps thermo scientific k alpha and ftir analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 coagulation performance comparative tests of coagulation performance were conducted using patc with different b values and al ti molar ratios patc with al ti 15 and b 1 5 was preferably selected supporting information section s4 fig 1 a b showed that the removal of turbidity and organic matter by pac ptc and patc increased first and then decreased with the increase of ph at ph 8 patc achieved the maximum removal efficiency for turbidity uv254 and doc with 94 75 76 53 and 42 45 respectively patc led to a high removal efficiency of turbidity and organic matter in a relatively wider ph range compared with pac and ptc fig 1 a b and fig s2 the df values and particle sizes of flocs formed by pac ptc and patc at different ph values are presented in table 1 in the ph range of 2 8 the flocs formed by ptc had larger particle sizes and df values than pac and patc the large df sf and rf values indicated that the flocs had compact structure strong resistance and excellent recovery ability li et al 2006 liu et al 2020 the results in table 1 and fig s3 showed that the floc structure fragmentation resistance and recoverability of ptc and pac were highly dependent on the ph value compared with the flocs formed by pac and ptc those formed by patc exhibited better recoverability under alkaline conditions also the floc size and df values of flocs formed by patc were relatively insensitive to ph variation 3 2 three dimensional fluorescence analysis 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to examine the changes of organic matter after coagulation lv et al 2021 eem spectra were divided into five regions as reported in previous studies chen et al 2003 liu et al 2020 herein five regions showed fluorescence responses which represented aromatic proteins i region i aromatic proteins ii region ii fulvic acid fa like organics region iii tryptophan protein like materials region iv and ha like substances region v respectively liu et al 2020 as shown in fig 2 the coagulation performance of ptc was highly dependent on ph variation and the removals of organic matters deteriorated sharply with the increase of ph however pac and patc were relatively independent on ph changes especially patc which showed a considerable removal efficiency for organic matters even under alkaline conditions to better demonstrate the variation of organic matter contents before and after coagulation eem spectra were analyzed by fri method the fri parameters are shown in table 2 at ph 4 ptc was more effective in removing aromatic proteins i and ii fa like organics tryptophan protein like materials and ha like substances than pac and patc at ph 7 the considerable decline of the fluorescence responses was achieved by the pac and patc system which displayed low residual concentrations of ha like substances and fa like organics it was worth noting that patc was more effective in removing fa like organics than pac table 2 at ph 10 the performance of pac ptc and patc was weakened in varying degrees and patc showed the best effect on the removals of ha like and fa like substances fig 2 the phenomena were consistent with the coagulation efficiency in section 3 1 which could be interpreted by the various hydrolysate species of patc under different ph conditions ptc hydrolysates including tio oh and tio oh 2 am gan et al 2021b were the dominant species in removing organic matters under acidic conditions and then the hydrolysates of ptc were converted to tio oh 2 aq tio oh 2 am and tio oh 3 under neutral and alkaline conditions gan et al 2021a the charge repulsion between the negatively charged hydrolysates and organic matters would weaken the complexation reaction which ultimately led to a decrease in the organic matter removals pac hydrolysates such as al oh 2 al oh 2 al2 oh 2 4 and al3 oh 4 5 could complex with ha like substances at ph 4 gong et al 2022 song et al 2019b and then pac hydrolysates including alo4al12 oh 24 h2o 12 7 and al oh 3 am became the predominant species to neutralize ha like and fa like organics when the ph value was about 7 yan et al 2008 next the negatively charged al oh 4 and al oh 3 aq with poor charge neutralizing ability played a key role in contaminant removals at ph 10 which could explain the unsatisfactory coagulation efficiency under alkaline conditions compared with pac and ptc a new aloti bond was observed in patc as our previous study reported liu et al 2022 the coexistence of aloal tioti and aloti led to the formation of hydrolysates with complex structures and abundant active sites which made patc more stable than pac and ptc therefore patc was relatively insensitive to ph variation and efficient in removing ha like and fa like substances over pac and ptc under neutral and alkaline conditions and the reason why patc was efficient in removing organic matters under neutral and alkaline conditions would be explained in detail in section 3 5 3 3 x ray photoelectron spectra xps analysis the interaction between coagulants and organic matters under different ph conditions was investigated by xps the high resolution o1s core level spectra of samples are shown in fig 3 before coagulation the peaks at 531 87 ev and 533 48 ev belonged to o c and oc respectively guo et al 2020 lu et al 2021 after pac ptc and patc coagulation the o c and oc peaks of the flocs moved to the direction of low binding energy at ph 4 this phenomenon was due to the interaction between coagulants and organic matters which changes the electrostatic potential field of the core electrons of o atom thereby resulting in a decrease in o1s binding energy lu et al 2021 after coagulation the characteristic peaks of both c o and co bonds in flocs exhibited a shift toward low binding energy at ph 4 and 7 which demonstrated that oh and cooh was likely the main binding site of ha to complex metal hydrolysates under acidic and neutral conditions fig 3 when the ph was about 10 adding any one of the three coagulants did not lead to the shift of the oc and oc peaks which indicated that with the increase of ph value the coagulation mechanism converted from charge neutralization and complexation to a sweeping effect the background subtracted high resolution c1s core level spectra are shown in fig 4 four peaks at 284 58 ev 285 87 ev 286 8 ev and 288 2 ev were observed in the c1s spectra of test water these peaks can be assigned to unsubstituted aromatic carbon cc ch α carbon cco alcohol carbon coh and carboxylic carbon cooh respectively jin et al 2018 liu et al 2020 no obvious peak shift was observed in the flocs formed by pac ptc and patc at the studied ph values which indicated that the electron transfer between coagulants and organics was not related to the c atom but mainly to the o atom the results were consistent with that of o1s spectra which demonstrated that hydroxyl and carboxyl were the dominant binding sites of ha to complex metal hydrolysates under acidic and neutral conditions more importantly our findings were consistent with some studies that hydroxyl and carboxyl in ha were the main binding sites to complex metal ions jin et al 2018 song et al 2019a song et al 2019b however lin et al held a different view that aromatic cc of ha was preferentially removed by al salts which was concluded from the peak shift and the changes of peak area in c1s spectra lin et al 2014 besides zhao et al reported that alcl3 could remove aromatic aliphatic and carboxyl structures zhao et al 2009 the contradictory conclusions could be explained as that carbonaceous groups in ha would inevitably decrease once ha molecules were removed no matter which functional group the binding site was the characterization techniques used in the aforementioned studies were ftir and xps which is more suitable for qualitative analysis not for quantitative analysis to further investigate the main binding sites of ha a semi quantitative analysis of ftir spectra was adopted in this study 3 4 semi quantitative ftir analysis the functional groups of coagulants and flocs were examined by ftir fig 5 with the increase of ph the absorption peaks corresponding to the alcoholic hydroxyl coh 3409 cm 1 symmetrical cooh 1383 cm 1 and phenolic hydroxyl phoh 1249 cm 1 groups of ha showed red shift and blue shift respectively bahemmat et al 2016 monteiro et al 2021 song et al 2019b as the ph increased the intensity of the stretching vibration and peak area of the co peak 1425 cm 1 in cooh groups increased wang et al 2018a the above phenomena indicated that the deprotonation degree of ha deepened with the increase of ph value a semi quantitative analysis of ftir spectra was applied and the results are shown in table 3 at ph 4 the contents of coh phoh and cooh functional groups in ha decreased significantly after coagulation the phenomena indicated that coagulant hydrolysates complexed mainly with coh phoh and cooh of ha under acidic conditions at ph 7 the reduction of the coh and phoh content after coagulation was less than that at ph 4 while the decrease of co in cooh was considerable it indicated that the coagulants reacted predominantly with oh groups under acidic conditions but cooh groups became the main binding sites when ph was neutral at ph 10 the changes in the contents of the functional groups were relatively slight compared with those at ph 4 and 7 however the contents of the coh phoh and co bond in cooh of ha were reduced after coagulation at ph 10 and the reduction in the patc system was the most significant the phenomena seemed to demonstrate that coh phoh and cooh were the main binding sites of ha under alkaline condition however the above result contradicted the xps result that adsorption and sweeping effects were the dominant coagulation mechanism instead of complexation under alkaline condition the contradiction was due to that ftir just determined the functional groups on the surface of the samples but was powerless to detect the functional groups wrapped in the flocs this was why the c1s and o1s peaks of xps at ph 10 showed no shift of peaks after coagulation but the functional groups in ftir spectra were decreased without selectivity after coagulation the possible reaction pathways of pac ptc and patc with ha are listed in fig 6 3 5 mechanism analysis the functional groups of ha especially cooh and oh can protonate and deprotonate in a wide ph range which influenced the amounts of the binding sites in ha jin et al 2018 due to the atoms containing lone pairs of electrons in ha functional groups such as c and o have high electronegativity the charge densities around these atoms are high jin et al 2018 according to the physicochemical properties of these functional groups they can act as lewis bases in solution and then their lone electron pairs can be pushed to the metal side of the coagulants which result in the formation of stable m ha complexes cheng and chi 2002 moreover afm and tem images of patc showed that its hydrolysates had a flower like structure which provided a larger surface area compared with pac and ptc fig 7 a c and fig s4 the flower like structure of patc could provide a large surface area and make it easy to contact with ha at ph 4 ptc generated a large amount of positively charged ti species e g tio oh and tio oh 2 am which could complex with phoh coh and cooh to form coti coordination bonds the empty orbit of metal atoms could accept the lone pair electrons of o atoms in hydroxyl or carboxyl groups which promoted the coordination reaction to form a stable complex song et al 2019b zeta potentials of the flocs were close to the isoelectric point at ph 4 which indicated the leading role of charge neutralization under acid conditions fig 7 g i when the ph reached 7 tio oh 2 aq and tio oh 2 am gradually became the dominant species they could remove organic matters by sweeping flocculation and adsorption lu et al 1999 for pac al oh 2 al oh 2 al2 oh 2 4 and al3 oh 4 5 were the dominant species at ph 4 which could complex with the coh phoh and cooh of ha by forming coal coordinate bonds however large amounts of h could compete with al3 and weak the ha removal efficiency therefore the coagulation performance of pac was bad at ph 4 with the increase of ph the hydrolysis process of the aluminum and the deprotonation of ha molecules were simultaneously underway under weakly acid conditions positively charged hydrolysates like alo4al12 oh 24 h2o 12 7 dominated the ha removals the complexation of the al hydrolysates with carboxyl and hydroxyl groups was improved due to the gradually diminishing competition of h and the enhanced charge neutralization of the further polymerized hydrolysates consequently the maximum uv254 removal by adding pac was observed under weakly acid conditions when the ph was neutral a small part of the positively charged al species was transferred into al oh 3 am which would weaken the charge neutralization ability and provide sweep and adsorption effects but the high zeta potentials of pac at ph 7 indicated a still strong charge neutralization ability of the al hydrolysates therefore uv254 removal efficiency of pac at ph 7 was only slightly poorer than that at ph 6 the transformation of the al species was far different from other study that al oh 3 am was the dominant hydrolysates under neutral conditions zhao et al 2011 which could be interpreted by the stability of the prefabricated al hydrolysates in pac at ph 10 the hydrolysates of pac mostly existed in the forms of al oh 4 and al oh 3 aq al oh 3 aq removed ha mainly by adsorption and sweeping flocculation accompanied by a small amount of the surface complexation with cooh and the hydrogen bonds with oh based on the hydrolysis characteristics of al and ti the possible hydrolysates of patc at different ph conditions were proposed patc hydrolysates including al oh 2o tio and al oh 2tio3 were probably the dominant species at ph 4 which could complex with phoh coh and cooh of ha with the increase of ph the patc hydrolysates turned to aloti oh 2 3 and al2 oh 2o2ti oh 2 2 which could remove ha molecules mainly by the complexation with co of cooh groups moreover compared with pac and ptc patc showed the highest electropositivity and molecular weight at ph 7 which contributed to its best removal efficiency for ha like and fa like substances due to the strong charge neutralization ability the amorphous hydroxide of patc such as ti oh 3o oh 2al played a major role at ph 10 liu et al 2022 our previous study found that the hydrolysates of patc were composited of the polyhydroxy polynuclear complex and hydroxyl bridged al ti polymers liu et al 2022 fig 7d i showed that the hydroxyl bridged al ti polymers had a 4 ring structure which was more complex and stable than the polynuclear hydroxyl complexes of al or ti the previous study believed that the stable hydrolysates had a relatively low affinity with oh wang et al 2004 which was consistent with our finding that the zeta potentials of patc at ph 7 and 10 were higher than those of pac and ptc meanwhile the afm and tem results also confirmed that patc had a unique flower like spatial structure with a large specific surface area which made it easy to contact with contaminants it was why patc performed better than pac and ptc for ha removal especially under neutral and alkaline conditions 4 conclusions in this study we performed an in depth analysis to elucidate the binding behavior between ha molecules and the hydrolysates of patc pac and ptc under different ph conditions using semi quantitative ftir and xps it was found that oligomeric and mesopolymeric hydrolysates were the dominant species under acidic conditions which could complex mainly with coh phoh and cooh groups of ha to form coordinate bonds but large amounts of h could compete with metal ions and occupy the coordinate sites under highly acid conditions when the ph was about neutral the complexation of the metal hydrolysates with carboxyl groups was improved due to the gradually diminishing competition of h and the enhanced charge neutralization of the further polymerized hydrolysates consequently the pronounced uv254 removal by adding patc was observed under weakly acid and neutral conditions with the further increase of ph values amorphous hydrolysates such as ti oh 3o oh 2al occupied the leading role which could remove organic matters by sweeping flocculation and adsorption due to the diversity of hydrolyzed species and the stability of the al ti polymers patc was promising in removing ha like and fa like substances in a wide ph range this study provided a new insight into the interaction mechanisms between the hydrolysates of composite coagulants and the dominant functional groups of ha exploring the coagulation mechanism of patc has a great guiding significance for the efficient removal of nom in actual water treatment further studies should focus on the coagulation behavior and mechanism of patc for removing different nom in actual surface water treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

widespread application and could act as a promising technology for industrial wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrocoagulation ceramic membrane machining industrial wastewater membrane fouling 1 introduction membrane separation has recently attracted widespread attention for use in numerous wastewater treatment technologies goh and ismail 2018 owing to

promising devices for treating some challenging types of water such as wastewater containing highly concentrated organic effluent li et al 2017 and oil xia et al 2018 for which polymeric membranes are either inefficient or inapplicable due to their severe instability mostafazadeh et al 2016 the rapid decrease in the price of cms has led to their increased use in recent years li et al 2011 however increasing the difference in transmembrane pressure and reducing the membrane flux due to irreversible membrane fouling that cannot be effectively resolved even by routine cleaning and pretreatment operations which requires frequent optimized membrane cleaning and replacement as well as limits the long term application of cms goh et al 2016 hendon et al 2017 numerous efforts have been made to

electrochemistry fu et al 2019 guo et al 2018 he et al 2019 in a hybrid ec coupled membrane filtration system highly porous flocs can be generated through regulating the electrochemical parameters which could effectively remove particles or dissolved organic substances from raw water xu et al 2021 moreover huang et al 2018 demonstrated that the electro assisted membrane filtration in a one pot coupling system could effectively prevent charged foulants from adhering to the membrane surface so as to realize in situ membrane cleaning in terms of this the development of electrically conductive membranes in an integrated electrochemical membrane reactor have been the focus of many studies in recent years li et al 2018 coating a conductive layer onto a membrane surface is considered to be a practical and affordable way to make conductive cms to date few electrically assisted antifouling cms have been reported and some typical achievements include the carbon fiber carbon composite

reagents the chemicals used in this study including stannous chloride dihydrate sncl2 2h2o three antimony chloride sbcl3 zinc chloride zncl2 ethylene glycol c2h6o2 hydrochloric acid hcl sodium hydroxide naoh α terpineol c10h18o 98 ethyl cellulose c6 2nh7 8no2 4n x 3 7mpa s 5 toluene isopropanol 80 20 absolute ethanol ch3ch2oh aqueous ammonia nh3 h2o 25 28 and sulfuric acid h2so4 were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd and were all of analytical reagent ar grade unless other specified the solution ph was adjusted using 0 1 m naoh or h2so4 if necessary deionized di water was obtained using a milli q advantage a 10 system usa millipore at a resistivity of 18 2 m ω raw flat sheet type ceramic membranes with length width and thicknesses of 120 100 and 6 mm and an average pore size of 0 4 μm were purchased from pingxiang yulong porcelin plastic co ltd china the support layer of the cms was composed of α al2o3 while the separation layer was composed of al2o3 caco3 with a pure water flux of 720 10 l m2 h 1 2 2 comparison of ccm preparation processes gel coating and impregnation hydrolysis are the most common ways to prepare sb sno2 coating films although the preparation process is convenient the poor stability and non uniformity have not been improved to solve the shortcomings of poor coating stability and conductivity spray pyrolysis was used to prepare the load coating film on the surface of inorganic cms by comparing the above two methods 2 2 1 spray pyrolysis method typically when synthesizing ato coating films by spray pyrolysis the metal salt solution is sprayed into a high temperature substrate surface as a mist causing the evaporation of the solvent and thermal decomposition of the metal salt thereby creating a coating film layer after solid precipitation boningari et al 2018 hashim et al 2010 a mixture of various concentrations 0 3 0 7 m sno2 sn sb 9 5 1 of sncl2 2h2o and sbcl3 in absolute ethanol at 40 was prepared for the following experiment about 5 ml of hcl 0 1 m was added to the mixture to maintain the acidity of the solution ph 5 and prevent the precursor from precipitating during the preparation process fig 1 a the cleaned cm was then heated to a high temperature 400 500 on an electric furnace hp 18 shanghai xuesen instrument co ltd and monitored using an infrared thermometer while the clarified precursor fluid was sprayed evenly onto the surface of the membrane using a spray gun schutze w7 shanghai foreign dar industrial co ltd to prevent excessive variations in the temperature of the cm the cm was sprayed every 5 min in the batch spray mode and the ccm product was obtained after drying and calcining at 700 for 2 h 2 2 2 gel coating method as we successfully prepared pure ato sb sno2 powders with relatively low resistivity 3 9 ω cm in our previous study tang et al 2019 a certain amount of ato powder ground using an agate mortar was doped with nano zno particles and nano cuo particles doping mass ratios 1 3 and 5 to obtain composite a z ato zno composite powder and a c ato cuo composite powder powders the composite powder was then added to a mixed sol prepared from castor oil 1 2 ml terpineol 200 5 g and ethyl cellulose 6 1 g and stirred for 30 min using a magnetic stirrer df 101s zhengzhou greatwall scientific industrial and trade co ltd to obtain a plurality of coating gels with different liquid solid ratios 1 0 4 0 ml g which was the ratio of the mass of powder consumed in the single coating process to the volume of dispersant the gels were then uniformly brushed 3 4 ml dm2 onto the surface of the pretreated cm washed in deionized water three times then soaked in a 0 1 m naoh solution and absolute ethanol and treated by ultrasound for 30 min and dried at 90 c for 1 h the sample was finally calcined in a muffle furnace sx g08163 tianjin central electric furnace limited by share ltd for 2 h at 1100 c the heating procedure followed in the calcination of the pretreated sol loaded cm is shown in si table s1 of the supplementary information 2 2 3 immersion hydrolysis method during the preparation of the ccm fig 1 b sncl2 2h2o and sbcl3 sn sb molar ratio 9 5 1 were mixed with ethylene glycol to prepare impregnation solutions with different mass fractions 10 20 30 40 and 50 calculated as sncl2 2h2o and then stirred at 40 c in a magnetic water bath until the solution became transparent the cleaned flat sheet cm was then placed in a custom impregnation vessel and the precursor fluid was added until the liquid level exceeded the upper surface of the membrane the cm was then immersed in a sealed environment for 6 h before drying in a constant temperature drying oven at 90 c based on previous studies cheraghali and maghsoud 2020 choi et al 2016 prior to the final coating the cm was completely immersed in an aqueous ammonia aqueous solution 8 under a closed environment for secondary hydrolysis 1 h the ccm product was obtained after drying and calcining at 700 under a specific temperature procedure table s1 for 2 h completing one coating cycle 2 3 ccm optimization and characterization to evaluate the conductivity and separation performance of the ccm prepared by the above methods the pure water flux and sheet resistance were firstly determined using a self made reactor following the dc four probe test method st2258c suzhou jingge electronic co ltd owing to the differences in the properties of sno2 and al2o3 the conductive coating film stability will directly affect the membrane separation performance and application of the electric field therefore the adhesion by type test astm d3359 09 was conducted to evaluate the binding stability of the coating film and ceramic membrane more detailed procedures and evaluation levels 0 5a are shown in table s2 of the supplemental information furthermore the pore size distribution of the cm and ccm was measured by mercury injection using an auto pore ⅳ 9500 mercury porosimeter micromeritics usa the optimal morphology and structure could be determined by evaluating and comparing the conductivity adhesion stability and separation performance of the ccms prepared following different methods the crystal structure and elemental composition of the coating film were first observed by x ray diffraction xrd d8 advanced bruker ltd germany and energy dispersive spectrometry eds model ex 250 horiba japan the fourier transform infrared ftir spectra were recorded following the attenuated total reflection atr technique using a pe spectrum 2000 ftir spectrometer thermo nicolet usa with a horizontal atr device to characterize the presence of functionalized groups in the prepared ccm films while the film morphologies were observed using a scanning electron microscope sem model s 4800 hitachi japan additionally coagulated particles were measured in situ using a mastersizer 2000 instrument mastersizer 2000 malvern uk as a function of operation time the membrane hydrophilicity was quantified by measuring the contact angle model oca25 dataphysics germany that formed between the membrane s surface and water typically since the permeability and surface roughness of the cm material can significantly affect the measurement of the contact angle a dense ceramic plate with the same main components as the cm was used as the raw experimental substitute for contact angle measurement in this study as well as the modification treatment of its surface conductive coating furthermore an electrochemical workstation aut86329 metrohm with a three electrode system was used to evaluate the electrochemical properties of the ccm by linear sweep voltammetry lsv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis with a 0 06 m koh solution as an electrolyte the ccm was used as the working electrode while ag agcl was the reference electrode and a platinum tablet was used as the auxiliary electrode due to its good corrosion resistance and electrical conductivity 2 4 permeation experiment and analytic methods an industrial oily wastewater from automobile parts machining beijing china were used as the feed solution to assess the treatment effect of the ccm due to the industrial plant produces the braking steering and shock absorption systems of automobiles a large number of complex wastewater containing chemical oxygen demand cod and oil pollutants are produced to meet the secondary ⅱ standard of integrated wastewater discharge standard gb 8978 1996 the water treatment process of coagulation sedimentation air flotation hydrolysis acidification biological contact oxidation was used to manage which possesses the disadvantages of large floor area and complex operation herein to evaluate the application feasibility of electrocoagulation coupled with ccm filtration the water sample was collected from the effluent of the air flotation process for the further permeation experiment and its detailed characteristics are listed in table s3 fig 2 presents an electro assisted membrane filtration reactor with an effective volume of 0 8 l the ccm filtration module was composed of plexiglass and the installed part of the cathode ccm includes a seal ring and plexiglass sealing plate fig 2 a placed in the center of the container two al electrodes were placed on either side of the cathode and served as anodes with an anode cathode distance of 2 0 0 1 cm an external electric field was created using a direct current dc power supply tpr 3020df longwei instruments hk co ltd china diaphragm pumps model dp130 shanghai magnetic pumps co ltd china were used to extract water from the membrane with a maximum flux of 0 4 gpm and range of 0 0 4 mpa during filtration during operation the cm and ccm were first used to separately purify the feed solution at the optimized suction pressure of 0 06 mpa to determine the cod removal efficiency and attenuation of the membrane flux in each operating cycle 60 min the water samples were then purified in different operation modes table s4 including the sole membrane cm and ccm separation process without electric field mode 1 electrocoagulation ec by using ccm cathode mode 2a electric field assisted membrane separation mode 2b and ec electric field assisted membrane separation systems mode 3 to systematically investigate the membrane separation capacity and antifouling performance the membranes used after treatment were backwashed with 0 01 m naoh solution and di water after each application the instantaneous permeate flux j l m 2 h 1 as an essential parameter for the evaluation of fouling status was calculated based on the permeate volume v l effective area of the membrane s m2 and operation hours t h this was followed by estimation of water flux of cleaned membranes jn l m 2 h 1 at each time n 1 2 the flux recovery frn was calculated by eq 2 to evaluate the membrane recoverability generally higher fr demonstrates better antifouling property of the membrane hofs et al 2011 1 j v s δ t 2 f r n j n j 0 furthermore as the most useful and applicable models whose parameters have a physical significance based on classical constant pressure dead end or cross flow filtration equations hermia s models eq 3 are employed to identify the fouling mechanism involved during the filtration process as a result hermia 1982 vela et al 2009 3 dj dt k j j s j 2 n where n 0 for cake filtration n 1 for intermediate blocking n 1 5 for standard blocking n 2 for complete blocking while k and js are model constant and steady state permeation flux of membrane at the end of process these models were modified to account for fouling removal mechanisms from the membrane surface which resulting in the following general differential equations which belong to the cake filtration model eq 4 intermediate pore blocking model eq 5 standard pore blocking model eq 6 and complete pore blocking model eq 7 respectively 4 y exp kj s 2 t j s j 0 5 1 j 0 5 j 0 0 5 kt 6 j j s j 0 j s exp k j 0 t 7 j j 0 j s exp k j s t j s j 0 exp k j s t 1 to determine whether the data agree with any of the considered models the coefficient of correlation r2 of each plot for respective model was compared with the others 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation method optimization and characterization 3 1 1 optimization and comparison of preparation methods fig 3 a shows that the flux of the membrane prepared by spray pyrolysis increased slightly with increases in the heating temperature and molar concentration of the precursor while the sheet resistance decreased sharply when the molar concentration of the precursor and heating temperature of the cm substrate were 0 5 m and 475 optimal separation and conductivity performance pure water flux and sheet resistance of 585 l m2 h 1 and 74 ω sq respectively were achieved this is reasonable because the precursor concentration determines the distribution density of the precursor at the instant of its reaction on the cm substrate s surface the higher the concentration and substrate temperature the more complete the oxidation reaction of the precursor and the greater the possibility of the agglomeration of the generated oxide however a high precursor concentration could also cause membrane pore blockage resulting in a significant decrease in the membrane flux boningari et al 2018 therefore the following experiments with different spraying amounts 30 70 ml 120 cm2 were conducted under a cm substrate temperature of 475 and precursor concentration of 0 5 m to determine the optimum parameters as fig 3 b indicates the spraying quantity of precursor fluid could significantly affect the membrane adhesion strength and pure water flux since the membrane flux and sheet resistance decreased to 631 582 573 527 and 480 l m2 h 1 and 108 74 62 59 and 51 ω sq with adhesion coefficients of grade 4a 4a 5a 5a and 5a as the spraying amount increased from 30 to 70 ml respectively the sheet resistance of the ccm could be as low as 59 9 56 3 2 mω cm and 51 ω sq 8 83 2 1 mω cm at spraying amounts of 60 and 70 ml but the membrane fluxes decreased by 31 and 42 which severely reduced the membrane separation capacity therefore increasing the spraying amount could increase the thickness of the membrane surface film and occupy the surface channels of the membrane leading to an increase in the resistance of liquid passing through the membrane and decrease in the membrane flux wang et al 2012 therefore a spraying amount of 50 ml was considered as the optimal parameter as a contrast to achieve optimal ccm separability and conductivity via gel coating and immersion hydrolysis the effects of different liquid solid ratios 1 4 ml g numbers of coating layers 1 3 metal oxide doping a c a z and the impregnation concentrations 0 50 and times 1 5 were also studied the detailed optimization and analysis process are shown in the section f1 and f2 of supplementary information figure s1 s2 figure s3 a c present images of the ccms prepared by gel coating immersion hydrolysis and spray pyrolysis the color of the ccms developed from light to dark blue which was attributed to the differences in the preparation processes the gel and immersion techniques could cause inhomogeneous doping and the insufficient oxidation of sn and sb atoms banerjee et al 2004 while spray pyrolysis was an in situ coating method as the reactants were sprayed directly to the surface of the high temperature cm substrate materials as aerosols to generate metal oxide films as the basis for evaluating the effectiveness of the preparation method the pure water flux and sheet resistance of the membranes prepared by the three methods under the optimal conditions are summarized and presented in table 1 obviously the ccm prepared by spray pyrolysis exhibited the best conductivity coating film stability and retained excellent separation performance compared to the ccms prepared by the other two methods and was finally selected for the following characterization and application experiments 3 1 2 characterization of the ccm figure s4 a shows the xrd pattern of the ccm surface prepared by spray pyrolysis the main diffraction peaks at 2θ 25 6 35 1 43 3 52 7 57 5 66 5 68 2 77 1 were identified as al2o3 jcpds card no 46 1212 while the peaks at 26 5 33 6 37 7 52 7 were assigned to sno2 sb2o3 jcpds card no 88 2348 the clear diffraction peaks of al2o3 and sno2 sb2o3 were observed indicating the successful sno2 coating was loaded to the cm surface figure s4 b depicts the ft ir spectra of cm and ccm in the spectrum of cm and ccm the characteristic absorption peaks near the wavenumber of 3322 2078 2104 and 1541 cm 1 in both samples was ascribed to the characteristic stretching modes of oh on the surface of the sample notably the peak appeared at the wavenumber of 635 3 cm 1 in ccm spectrum could be attributed to the stretching vibration peak of the sn o bond suggested that the sno2 conductive coating was successfully prepared fig 4 a shows the image of sem photo of original cm clearly the membrane surface of original cm was rough while a large number of ultrafine particles with the particle size were observed to be distributed in the pores of the original cm fig 4 b and c after modification speculating that the sno2 sb particles had been covered the cm surface and filled the interspaces of the membrane pores these changes increased the complexity of the pore structure and provided a platform for the occurrence of electrochemical reaction the sem images of the original cm and ccm cross sections are presented in fig 4 d and e respectively it can be observed that there is no difference except that the surface of the ccm was loaded with a slight film to further explore the composition of the coating film eds microanalyses of the cm and ccm fig 4 f and g were conducted and the results indicate that the ccm s surface mainly contained al 28 57 by weight o 41 91 sn 21 04 and sb 2 46 fig 4 h n without notable stratification moreover sn and sb were deposited on the surface of the film and uniformly distributed in the depths of the pore channels further indicating that the sprayed sno2 particles were mainly distributed inside the membrane pores this is because the conductive sno2 sb conductive particles spread to the inner part of the separation layer and formed a stable film after the oxidation and nucleation reactions of the precursor on the membrane s surface the pore size distributions of the cm and ccm were determined in detail following the mercury injection method the trimodal pore size distribution of the membrane was typical for cm the structures of which are subdivided into the support intermediate and separation layers based on the aperture size distribution wang et al 2019 figure s5 a shows that most of the intrusion pore volume was attributed to the support and intermediate layers which had pore diameters of 5 10 μm due to their relatively larger pore size than that of the separation layer 0 3 0 5 μm additionally figure s5 b shows that the average pore size of the separation layer ranged from 0 2 to 0 4 μm which was slightly lower than that of the original cm and could be attributed to the modified sno2 sb conductive layer the micro sized pores would facilitate water transport and pollutant retention through the membrane due to the low flow resistance during separation the surface wettability of ceramic plate before and after modification fig 5 indicates that the contact angles decreased from 103 8 to 70 3 with the introduction of the conductive sno2 sb coating film exhibiting excellent surface hydrophilicity that was considered to be beneficial for membrane antifouling filtration as it can aid in decreasing the adsorption of hydrophobic organic pollutants zhang and vecitis 2014 the electrochemical properties of the ccm were evaluated through lsv and the tafel curve figure s6 a and b no passivation occurred when the ccm was used as the working electrode and the corrosion potential of the ccm electrode was higher 0 3625 v than that of the stainless steel electrode 1 2509 v with a corrosion rate of 2 067 against 2 336 mm r the self corrosion potential moved in the positive direction indicating that the electrode reaction was inhibited simultaneously to the observation of lower corrosion rates therefore the ccm electrode was relatively stable and exhibited excellent corrosion resistance potential to determine an appropriate coating cycle a nyquist plot obtained through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis at the frequency range of 1 105 hz potential range of 1 0 1 0 v vs ag agcl the scan rate of 100 mv s was used and is presented in figure s6 c the semicircle diameter was taken as the charge transfer resistance rct and the ccm was 38 ω after testing demonstrating that the ccm exhibited high electron transfer ability in the electrochemical reaction which agreed well with the results from the sno2 sb electrode yao et al 2016 3 2 optimization of sole cm and ccm separation performance key water quality parameters for the permeation including the cod removal efficiency instantaneous permeate flux j and flux recovery j j0 were used to evaluate the purification and antifouling performance during the experimental process the feed solution was treated by sole membrane separation and the membrane flux attenuations of cm and ccm within 60 min of filtration are presented in fig 6 a whose pure water flux j0 were about 720 and 575 l m 2 h 1 respectively the results showed that the normalized permeate fluxes j j0 of the original cm and modified ccm decreased slowly during the initial 15 min and then decreased significantly to 43 1 and 35 3 in the following 45 min the permeate flux noticeably declined without an electric field which could be because the cake layer had not been formed during the initial filtration stage maluleke and linkov 2003 the difference in the flux attenuation between cm and ccm was inferred based in the decrease in pore size separation layer after modification which could also be the reason for the higher cod removal efficiency of ccm separation 43 2 than that of the original cm 37 2 fig 6 b to investigate the reusability of the sole filtration process during long term recycling the cm and ccm were reused four times 60 min per cycle and their performances in each normalized flux cycle were evaluated fig 6 c the normalized initial fluxes of the original cm and ccm recovered to approximately 82 2 and 80 0 of their initial values and then subsequently plummeted to 26 4 and 24 2 after another 60 min of filtering during the third cycle the normalized initial fluxes decreased slightly recovering to 73 3 and 68 9 of their initial values which were similar to those before the second backwashing respectively these results suggest that there was no significant difference in the membrane fouling mitigation performance of the original cm and ccm during the sole filtration process 3 3 optimization of the ec process and ec assisted membrane separation performance to evaluate the feasibility of applying the ccm as an electrode and the contribution of ec as a pretreatment to alleviating membrane fouling the cod removal efficiency of the sole ec process mode 2a was determined based on different current densities 2 10 ma cm2 fig 7 a reveals that the cod removal ratios reached 14 0 20 1 18 2 25 8 26 4 31 0 29 8 35 6 and 30 7 39 5 after 30 60 min of electrolysis at current densities of 2 4 6 8 and 10 ma cm2 respectively meanwhile the sizes of the flocs under current densities of 2 4 6 and 8 ma cm2 began to increase remarkably after 3 6 9 and 15 min respectively figure s7 according to faraday s law the amounts of al ions released from anode were positively correlated with the current density and reaction time therefore a higher current density could promote the production of polynuclear hydroxy aluminum compounds aln oh 3n which was beneficial for the formation of floccules from aluminum complexes and pollutants by adsorption neutralization and net sweeping zhao et al 2019 the large particle size floccules that attached by charged contaminants organic matter oil drop and colloidal substance was attached and intercepted instead of the adsorption of membrane pores which greatly improved the capability to achieve high flux of membrane separation lehman and liu 2009 myat et al 2018 fig 7 b presents the normalized flux declines of ccm after 60 min of electrolysis with different current densities the ccm exhibited higher membrane flux attenuation than that of the original ccm filtration which was not coupling with ec process with the current density increased particularly when it exceeded 6 ma cm2 this is because the flocs generated by the high current density in the ec process were adsorbed in the membrane pores and were difficult to eliminate without complete cleaning zhao et al 2019 moreover the resistance of the ccm electrode was still higher than that of the metal electrode and the high electric field strength may have impacted the structure of the conductive layer on the membrane s surface thereby affecting the separation performance of these ccms therefore as the ccm filtration performance and service life could be reduced it was reasonable to take the current density value of less than 6 ma cm2 in subsequent experiments although higher current densities could slightly improve the cod removal efficiency as the external electric field positively affects membrane filtration the related configurations were of equal importance to the results liu et al 2012 therefore to investigate the enhanced separation performance of the ccm coupled with continuous ec electric field intensities of 0 6 1 v cm current densities of 0 5 ma cm2 were applied to the treatment system fig 7 c the intervention of the electric field was beneficial for cod removal as it increased gradually from 43 3 without electric field to 47 2 49 4 56 1 55 8 and 54 6 at electric field intensities of 0 6 1 5 2 8 4 2 6 1 v cm current densities of 1 2 3 4 and 5 ma cm2 respectively the current densities of 3 5 ma cm2 induced a significant gradual increase in the cod removal efficiencies suggesting that flocculation may have been responsible for the removal of oil and some colloidal pollutants from the feed solution the normalized flux declines of ccm with and without ec assistance 2 4 ma cm2 for four cycles were studied and are presented in fig 7 d obviously the permeate fluxes decreased by 64 3 and 70 5 and 64 0 and 69 8 during the third and fourth cycles of ec assisted filtration with current densities of 3 and 4 ma cm2 after 60 min respectively which were lower than those of the ccm without ec assistance 79 6 and 87 5 additionally the contaminants could not fully coagulate with the al hydroxides at a low current density 2 ma m2 under a short reactor residence time causing numerous small flocs to clog the membrane pores or deposit on the membrane s surface thereby resulting in lower surface porosity and higher filtration resistance during the filtration stage xu et al 2011 in contrast increasing the current density could significantly remove small colloidal particles and reduce the effluent cod concentration as the electric field between the electrodes increased the motion and collision frequency of the colloidal particles thereby accelerating coagulation within the same hydraulic retention time and reducing the probability of the blockage of membrane pores by small particles mudhoo et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 3 4 evaluation and optimization of ec ec assisted membrane separation performance the operation mode based on ec pretreatment 30 min 6 ma cm2 combined with ec assisted membrane separation 60 min 3 ma cm2 mode 3 was implemented and compared to the sole ec assisted membrane separation process mode 2b as observed the cod removal efficiency 64 6 was higher than that of the sole ec assisted ccm separation process 56 1 for the first cycle and the removal effect decreased rapidly as the number of cycles increased fig 8 a fig 8 b presents the normalized flux decline of the ccm with ec 30 min 6 ma cm2 and the original ccm under an electric field of 3 ma cm2 during four cycles the antifouling performance of the original ccm was much better than that of the ccm used as a cathode in the ec process the normalized initial fluxes at 60 120 180 and 240 min of the above two ccms decreased to 40 1 vs 47 3 32 4 vs 42 5 24 8 vs 33 6 and 19 2 vs 28 8 respectively the variations in the sheet resistance of the ccm film after use in the ec process were higher than those of the original ccm material after each cycle figure s8 furthermore figure s9 shows the sem images of ccm membrane surface and cross section after being recycled for 5 times by ec process and the pollutants attached to the surface can be clearly observed which can be inferred that a large number of flocs containing heavy metals colloids and other small molecule pollutants generated in the ec process would move to the cathode through the electromigration process and even formed a thin scaling layer that composed of caco3 and mg oh 2 based on the principle of electrochemical reaction as previous research demonstrated that the membrane flux decline is due to pore blockage and cake layer formation during the earlier and later stages of filtration respectively vereb et al 2018 it could be deduced that when the ccm used by ec was reused for filtration large amounts of pollutants were deposited and adsorbed in the membrane pores that had not been completely cleaned by the backwashing process thereby increasing the membrane surface resistance and increasing the difficulty of filter cake layer formation by comparing the operation effects of different modes it can be concluded that both the ec assisted membrane separation mode 2b and ec ec assisted membrane separation technologies mode 3 could achieve well purification effect that the oil petroleum concentration of effluent could meet the secondary ⅱ standard of integrated wastewater discharge standard gb 8978 1996 oil 10 mg l but the mode 3 process may significantly destroy the ccm surface structure thereby affecting the service life of the membrane material therefore the operation of the ec assisted membrane separation process mode 2b with an electric field intensity of 2 8 v cm was optimal to ensure a good separation effect excellent antifouling performance and long service life 3 5 membrane fouling model and antifouling mechanism investigation in this study the fitting results of hermia s models adapted to filtration were analyzed and compared to the experimental data obtained from the cm and ec assisted ccm separation processes figure s10 presents the flux decline analysis results for four classic membrane fouling models and their corresponding parameters during filtration the correlation coefficients r2 of cm and ec assisted ccm filtration were 0 7543 vs 0 8667 0 9856 vs 0 9684 0 8542 vs 0 8756 and 07 520 vs 0 8438 after fitting the cake layer standard pore blocking complete pore blocking and intermediate pore blocking models respectively the results show that the standard blocking model could predict the permeate flux better than the other models even during the initial filtration stage figure s10 b this is reasonable because the pore size distribution of the cms used in this experiment was approximately 0 3 μm and the large pore structures allowed the passage of small molecule pollutants and salts while intercepting large molecule pollutants colloids and floc particles resulting in membrane pore pollution both the cm and ccm separation processes were accompanied by the other three membrane fouling models and the r2 of the ec assisted ccm membrane separation process mode 2b was higher than that of cm filtration alone this indicated that the steric and demulsification effects caused by the intervention of ec prevented more colloids oil drops and other small molecule pollutants from entering the membrane pores and reduced the extent of membrane pore blockage thereby changing membrane fouling from irreversible to reversible lu 2016 mameda et al 2017 in addition the aluminum hydroxide functional groups aln oh 3n also improved the ability to achieve high fluxes due to the attachment of charged contaminants to the floccules with large particle size instead of the membrane surface which formed cake on top of the membrane surface and do not penetrate into the pores to further understand the oil removal performance and antifouling mechanism of ccm in the ec assisted membrane separation process the zeta potential of cm and ccm under different ph conditions was determined in fig 9 a b a significant electronegativity result 17 5 mv was obtained at the condition of solution ph 4 in addition the organics with fluorescence characteristics in effluent from sole ccm filtration mode 1 and ec assisted ccm filtration processes mode 2b were detected and analyzed by three dimensional fluorescence spectrometer it is found that there are obvious characteristic peaks at the maximum excitation emission wavelengths of 319 305 and 320 368 nm that belong to the typical organic matter in oil fig 9 c d compared with sole ccm filtration the ec assisted ccm separation process could remove more organics with fluorescence characteristics which was further demonstrating the contribution of electrochemical process to pollutant degradation thus an antifouling mechanism that included the changes in the structure of the ccm preparation process and possible migration and transformation of pollutants ions in the ec assisted membrane filtration is proposed in fig 10 the microstructure of the cms was asymmetric with a denser separation layer on top of a more porous and larger particle substrate however the incorporation of the conductive coating layers may influence the overall pore size and level porosity tang et al 2013 as described in ccm preparation using spray pyrolysis method the mixed solution was sprayed onto the surface of the cm driving the in situ chemical precipitation reaction to generate sb sno2 which uniformly adhered to the surface of the membrane pores and form a dense conductive film therefore as a membrane fouling mitigation strategy the deposited conductive molecular layer could significantly improve the hydrophilicity of the membrane s surface and facilitate the formation of a hydration layer preventing the foulants from directly attaching to the membrane s surface and improving its fouling resistance hofs et al 2011 additionally the membrane fouling mitigation mechanisms in the electro membrane filtration system were complex due to the different types of foulants present therefore explanations for the mitigation of fouling due to flocculation can be found based on the experimental results and previous studies ebrahimi et al 2009 jing and chaplin 2016 in addition to the antifouling contribution of the above ccm material properties the electric field coupling process also has significant antifouling performance driven by the transmembrane pressure and the electric field force between electrodes the pollutants and charged particles gradually accumulated from the membrane pores to the membrane s surface which involved the hydrodynamic forces induced by filtration and electric field forces caused by the applied dc fig 10 a b anderson 1988 besides according to the experimental results and research achievements from fan et al fan et al 2015 the electrochemical degradation electrostatic repulsion and electrochemical adsorption were the main electric field factors influencing the charged particles in the ccm separation system fig 10 c e timmes et al 2009 the charged contaminants could be repelled from the membrane s surface to alleviate fouling under the electric field due to the effect of the electrophoretic and electrostatic repulsive forces pan et al 2019 meanwhile the increase in the particle size due to flocculation prevented the particles from penetrating and blocking the membrane pores thereby mitigating the internal fouling mechanism zaky and chaplin 2014 and improving the antifouling performance accordingly the antifouling mechanism of electric field assisted membrane separation can be summarized into three parts including 1 the promotion of membrane fouling mitigation influenced by the hydrophilic and oleophobic of the ccm material surface 2 the contribution of electrostatic repulsion to the inhibition of the formation of oil fouling layer on the ccm surface and 3 the effect of flocs produced by ec micro degradation on filter cake layer 4 conclusions a robust and electroconductive flat sb sno2 al2o3 membrane with good pore size tunability and mechanical

were obtained at the substrate cm surface temperature of 475 c precursor concentration of 0 5 m calculate as sno2 and spraying amount of 50 ml 120 cm2 using spray pyrolysis during membrane modification the designed module with a sb sno2 al2o3 flat ccm element could treat machining industrial wastewater as both the cathode and filter module with al plates as the anode multiple groups of comparative experiments were conducted and their results suggested that the electric field exerted on ccm provided by ec aided in alleviating membrane fouling at the electric field intensity of 2 8 v

15807,membrane separation is an effective solution for pollutant removal however achieving high permeability and antifouling ability remains a pressing challenge for its widespread application in this study a novel method of coating flat ceramic membranes cms with a conductive film sb sno2 was developed to enhance the filtration and antifouling performance of cms when the membrane filtration was coupled with electrocoagulation after comparing the parameters including the film sheet resistance and pure water flux with those of other coating methods i e gel coating and immersion hydrolysis a well fixed conductive coating with optimal permeability and stability was generated using spray pyrolysis with a substrate ceramic membrane surface temperature of 475 c precursor concentration of 0 5 m calculate as sno2 and spraying amount of 50 ml 120 cm2 during membrane modification batch filtration experiments using wastewater from the mechanical industry demonstrated that the conductive ceramic membrane ccm cathode integrated with electrocoagulation at an electric field of 2 8 v cm 3 0 ma cm2 achieved permeate fluxes that were 0 34 0 70 0 75 and 1 41 times higher than those of sole cm separation after four cycles moreover the membrane separation process was dominated by the standard pore blocking model and its correlation coefficient decreased with the exertion of the electric field indicating that membrane filtration fouling changed from irreversible to reversible this ccm combined with electrocoagulation exhibited significant potential for alleviating membrane fouling and widespread application and could act as a promising technology for industrial wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrocoagulation ceramic membrane machining industrial wastewater membrane fouling 1 introduction membrane separation has recently attracted widespread attention for use in numerous wastewater treatment technologies goh and ismail 2018 owing to their advantages of high separation selectivity low energy consumption acid and alkali corrosion resistance and being easy to scale up tan et al 2018 ceramic membranes cms are one of the most promising devices for treating some challenging types of water such as wastewater containing highly concentrated organic effluent li et al 2017 and oil xia et al 2018 for which polymeric membranes are either inefficient or inapplicable due to their severe instability mostafazadeh et al 2016 the rapid decrease in the price of cms has led to their increased use in recent years li et al 2011 however increasing the difference in transmembrane pressure and reducing the membrane flux due to irreversible membrane fouling that cannot be effectively resolved even by routine cleaning and pretreatment operations which requires frequent optimized membrane cleaning and replacement as well as limits the long term application of cms goh et al 2016 hendon et al 2017 numerous efforts have been made to develop new methods and strategies for the effective prevention of membrane fouling during the cm filtration process in addition to increasing membrane cleaning frequency and developing antifouling materials include electrocoagulation ec facilitated membrane fouling control which is a promising approach for alleviating membrane fouling by combining the advantages of coagulation flotation and electrochemistry fu et al 2019 guo et al 2018 he et al 2019 in a hybrid ec coupled membrane filtration system highly porous flocs can be generated through regulating the electrochemical parameters which could effectively remove particles or dissolved organic substances from raw water xu et al 2021 moreover huang et al 2018 demonstrated that the electro assisted membrane filtration in a one pot coupling system could effectively prevent charged foulants from adhering to the membrane surface so as to realize in situ membrane cleaning in terms of this the development of electrically conductive membranes in an integrated electrochemical membrane reactor have been the focus of many studies in recent years li et al 2018 coating a conductive layer onto a membrane surface is considered to be a practical and affordable way to make conductive cms to date few electrically assisted antifouling cms have been reported and some typical achievements include the carbon fiber carbon composite membrane developed by huotari et al 1999 carbon nanotube composite membrane cnts al2o3 developed by fan et al 2015 iro2 sb2o3 ruo2 al2o3 modified membrane developed by yang 2012 and magnéli ti4o7 al2o3 membrane developed by geng et al 2016 these conductive membranes have shown excellent performance to repel the foulants and suppress the fouling growth under the application of external electric voltages however the limited application of carbon membranes and high cost of noble metal oxides in membrane modification are restricting the implementation of these membranes it is noteworthy that a sb bi sno2 al2o3 composite cm material prepared by sol gel method was recently developed and applied in the treatment of dyeing wastewater shen 2016 the pollutant removal effect was found to be similar to that of many studied electrically assisted membrane filtration approaches pan et al 2019 zhang et al 2011 owing to its low resistivity chemical stability and corrosion resistance antimony doped tin dioxide ato sb sno2 materials exhibit promising coating application prospects in antistatic coatings and electrochemical electrodes shokr 2000 chen et al 2021 generally the sb sno2 material preparation methods include sol gel coating hydrothermal synthesis impregnation hydrolysis and chemical precipitation however the above methods are mostly used for the preparation of powder materials and rarely for the preparation of coated thin film electrodes terrier 1997 spray pyrolysis is a type of aerosol technology that involves the direct dripping of solutes into droplets that are then heated to form ultrafine powders with higher purity lower resistivity and more uniform particle size distribution than other methods boningari et al 2018 this provides a new way to prepare conductive films on the surface of cms herein a novel electrocoagulation membrane reactor in which electrocoagulation and membrane filtration were integrated into one reactor with electrically ceramic membranes sb sno2 al2o3 served as cathode filter which was employed for treating industrial wastewater in this study some key factors including coating adhesion film sheet resistance and pure water flux which were systematically investigated to evaluate the feasibility of the conductive ceramic membrane ccm prepared by spray pyrolysis gel coating and impregnation hydrolysis methods the micro morphology characterization of ccm and its antifouling performance in this ec assisted membrane fouling control process were evaluated for the treatment of practical wastewaters besides the membrane fouling blockage model floc size change and various operation modes were also evaluated for the first time to describe the antifouling mechanism of ccm separation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the chemicals used in this study including stannous chloride dihydrate sncl2 2h2o three antimony chloride sbcl3 zinc chloride zncl2 ethylene glycol c2h6o2 hydrochloric acid hcl sodium hydroxide naoh α terpineol c10h18o 98 ethyl cellulose c6 2nh7 8no2 4n x 3 7mpa s 5 toluene isopropanol 80 20 absolute ethanol ch3ch2oh aqueous ammonia nh3 h2o 25 28 and sulfuric acid h2so4 were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd and were all of analytical reagent ar grade unless other specified the solution ph was adjusted using 0 1 m naoh or h2so4 if necessary deionized di water was obtained using a milli q advantage a 10 system usa millipore at a resistivity of 18 2 m ω raw flat sheet type ceramic membranes with length width and thicknesses of 120 100 and 6 mm and an average pore size of 0 4 μm were purchased from pingxiang yulong porcelin plastic co ltd china the support layer of the cms was composed of α al2o3 while the separation layer was composed of al2o3 caco3 with a pure water flux of 720 10 l m2 h 1 2 2 comparison of ccm preparation processes gel coating and impregnation hydrolysis are the most common ways to prepare sb sno2 coating films although the preparation process is convenient the poor stability and non uniformity have not been improved to solve the shortcomings of poor coating stability and conductivity spray pyrolysis was used to prepare the load coating film on the surface of inorganic cms by comparing the above two methods 2 2 1 spray pyrolysis method typically when synthesizing ato coating films by spray pyrolysis the metal salt solution is sprayed into a high temperature substrate surface as a mist causing the evaporation of the solvent and thermal decomposition of the metal salt thereby creating a coating film layer after solid precipitation boningari et al 2018 hashim et al 2010 a mixture of various concentrations 0 3 0 7 m sno2 sn sb 9 5 1 of sncl2 2h2o and sbcl3 in absolute ethanol at 40 was prepared for the following experiment about 5 ml of hcl 0 1 m was added to the mixture to maintain the acidity of the solution ph 5 and prevent the precursor from precipitating during the preparation process fig 1 a the cleaned cm was then heated to a high temperature 400 500 on an electric furnace hp 18 shanghai xuesen instrument co ltd and monitored using an infrared thermometer while the clarified precursor fluid was sprayed evenly onto the surface of the membrane using a spray gun schutze w7 shanghai foreign dar industrial co ltd to prevent excessive variations in the temperature of the cm the cm was sprayed every 5 min in the batch spray mode and the ccm product was obtained after drying and calcining at 700 for 2 h 2 2 2 gel coating method as we successfully prepared pure ato sb sno2 powders with relatively low resistivity 3 9 ω cm in our previous study tang et al 2019 a certain amount of ato powder ground using an agate mortar was doped with nano zno particles and nano cuo particles doping mass ratios 1 3 and 5 to obtain composite a z ato zno composite powder and a c ato cuo composite powder powders the composite powder was then added to a mixed sol prepared from castor oil 1 2 ml terpineol 200 5 g and ethyl cellulose 6 1 g and stirred for 30 min using a magnetic stirrer df 101s zhengzhou greatwall scientific industrial and trade co ltd to obtain a plurality of coating gels with different liquid solid ratios 1 0 4 0 ml g which was the ratio of the mass of powder consumed in the single coating process to the volume of dispersant the gels were then uniformly brushed 3 4 ml dm2 onto the surface of the pretreated cm washed in deionized water three times then soaked in a 0 1 m naoh solution and absolute ethanol and treated by ultrasound for 30 min and dried at 90 c for 1 h the sample was finally calcined in a muffle furnace sx g08163 tianjin central electric furnace limited by share ltd for 2 h at 1100 c the heating procedure followed in the calcination of the pretreated sol loaded cm is shown in si table s1 of the supplementary information 2 2 3 immersion hydrolysis method during the preparation of the ccm fig 1 b sncl2 2h2o and sbcl3 sn sb molar ratio 9 5 1 were mixed with ethylene glycol to prepare impregnation solutions with different mass fractions 10 20 30 40 and 50 calculated as sncl2 2h2o and then stirred at 40 c in a magnetic water bath until the solution became transparent the cleaned flat sheet cm was then placed in a custom impregnation vessel and the precursor fluid was added until the liquid level exceeded the upper surface of the membrane the cm was then immersed in a sealed environment for 6 h before drying in a constant temperature drying oven at 90 c based on previous studies cheraghali and maghsoud 2020 choi et al 2016 prior to the final coating the cm was completely immersed in an aqueous ammonia aqueous solution 8 under a closed environment for secondary hydrolysis 1 h the ccm product was obtained after drying and calcining at 700 under a specific temperature procedure table s1 for 2 h completing one coating cycle 2 3 ccm optimization and characterization to evaluate the conductivity and separation performance of the ccm prepared by the above methods the pure water flux and sheet resistance were firstly determined using a self made reactor following the dc four probe test method st2258c suzhou jingge electronic co ltd owing to the differences in the properties of sno2 and al2o3 the conductive coating film stability will directly affect the membrane separation performance and application of the electric field therefore the adhesion by type test astm d3359 09 was conducted to evaluate the binding stability of the coating film and ceramic membrane more detailed procedures and evaluation levels 0 5a are shown in table s2 of the supplemental information furthermore the pore size distribution of the cm and ccm was measured by mercury injection using an auto pore ⅳ 9500 mercury porosimeter micromeritics usa the optimal morphology and structure could be determined by evaluating and comparing the conductivity adhesion stability and separation performance of the ccms prepared following different methods the crystal structure and elemental composition of the coating film were first observed by x ray diffraction xrd d8 advanced bruker ltd germany and energy dispersive spectrometry eds model ex 250 horiba japan the fourier transform infrared ftir spectra were recorded following the attenuated total reflection atr technique using a pe spectrum 2000 ftir spectrometer thermo nicolet usa with a horizontal atr device to characterize the presence of functionalized groups in the prepared ccm films while the film morphologies were observed using a scanning electron microscope sem model s 4800 hitachi japan additionally coagulated particles were measured in situ using a mastersizer 2000 instrument mastersizer 2000 malvern uk as a function of operation time the membrane hydrophilicity was quantified by measuring the contact angle model oca25 dataphysics germany that formed between the membrane s surface and water typically since the permeability and surface roughness of the cm material can significantly affect the measurement of the contact angle a dense ceramic plate with the same main components as the cm was used as the raw experimental substitute for contact angle measurement in this study as well as the modification treatment of its surface conductive coating furthermore an electrochemical workstation aut86329 metrohm with a three electrode system was used to evaluate the electrochemical properties of the ccm by linear sweep voltammetry lsv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis with a 0 06 m koh solution as an electrolyte the ccm was used as the working electrode while ag agcl was the reference electrode and a platinum tablet was used as the auxiliary electrode due to its good corrosion resistance and electrical conductivity 2 4 permeation experiment and analytic methods an industrial oily wastewater from automobile parts machining beijing china were used as the feed solution to assess the treatment effect of the ccm due to the industrial plant produces the braking steering and shock absorption systems of automobiles a large number of complex wastewater containing chemical oxygen demand cod and oil pollutants are produced to meet the secondary ⅱ standard of integrated wastewater discharge standard gb 8978 1996 the water treatment process of coagulation sedimentation air flotation hydrolysis acidification biological contact oxidation was used to manage which possesses the disadvantages of large floor area and complex operation herein to evaluate the application feasibility of electrocoagulation coupled with ccm filtration the water sample was collected from the effluent of the air flotation process for the further permeation experiment and its detailed characteristics are listed in table s3 fig 2 presents an electro assisted membrane filtration reactor with an effective volume of 0 8 l the ccm filtration module was composed of plexiglass and the installed part of the cathode ccm includes a seal ring and plexiglass sealing plate fig 2 a placed in the center of the container two al electrodes were placed on either side of the cathode and served as anodes with an anode cathode distance of 2 0 0 1 cm an external electric field was created using a direct current dc power supply tpr 3020df longwei instruments hk co ltd china diaphragm pumps model dp130 shanghai magnetic pumps co ltd china were used to extract water from the membrane with a maximum flux of 0 4 gpm and range of 0 0 4 mpa during filtration during operation the cm and ccm were first used to separately purify the feed solution at the optimized suction pressure of 0 06 mpa to determine the cod removal efficiency and attenuation of the membrane flux in each operating cycle 60 min the water samples were then purified in different operation modes table s4 including the sole membrane cm and ccm separation process without electric field mode 1 electrocoagulation ec by using ccm cathode mode 2a electric field assisted membrane separation mode 2b and ec electric field assisted membrane separation systems mode 3 to systematically investigate the membrane separation capacity and antifouling performance the membranes used after treatment were backwashed with 0 01 m naoh solution and di water after each application the instantaneous permeate flux j l m 2 h 1 as an essential parameter for the evaluation of fouling status was calculated based on the permeate volume v l effective area of the membrane s m2 and operation hours t h this was followed by estimation of water flux of cleaned membranes jn l m 2 h 1 at each time n 1 2 the flux recovery frn was calculated by eq 2 to evaluate the membrane recoverability generally higher fr demonstrates better antifouling property of the membrane hofs et al 2011 1 j v s δ t 2 f r n j n j 0 furthermore as the most useful and applicable models whose parameters have a physical significance based on classical constant pressure dead end or cross flow filtration equations hermia s models eq 3 are employed to identify the fouling mechanism involved during the filtration process as a result hermia 1982 vela et al 2009 3 dj dt k j j s j 2 n where n 0 for cake filtration n 1 for intermediate blocking n 1 5 for standard blocking n 2 for complete blocking while k and js are model constant and steady state permeation flux of membrane at the end of process these models were modified to account for fouling removal mechanisms from the membrane surface which resulting in the following general differential equations which belong to the cake filtration model eq 4 intermediate pore blocking model eq 5 standard pore blocking model eq 6 and complete pore blocking model eq 7 respectively 4 y exp kj s 2 t j s j 0 5 1 j 0 5 j 0 0 5 kt 6 j j s j 0 j s exp k j 0 t 7 j j 0 j s exp k j s t j s j 0 exp k j s t 1 to determine whether the data agree with any of the considered models the coefficient of correlation r2 of each plot for respective model was compared with the others 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation method optimization and characterization 3 1 1 optimization and comparison of preparation methods fig 3 a shows that the flux of the membrane prepared by spray pyrolysis increased slightly with increases in the heating temperature and molar concentration of the precursor while the sheet resistance decreased sharply when the molar concentration of the precursor and heating temperature of the cm substrate were 0 5 m and 475 optimal separation and conductivity performance pure water flux and sheet resistance of 585 l m2 h 1 and 74 ω sq respectively were achieved this is reasonable because the precursor concentration determines the distribution density of the precursor at the instant of its reaction on the cm substrate s surface the higher the concentration and substrate temperature the more complete the oxidation reaction of the precursor and the greater the possibility of the agglomeration of the generated oxide however a high precursor concentration could also cause membrane pore blockage resulting in a significant decrease in the membrane flux boningari et al 2018 therefore the following experiments with different spraying amounts 30 70 ml 120 cm2 were conducted under a cm substrate temperature of 475 and precursor concentration of 0 5 m to determine the optimum parameters as fig 3 b indicates the spraying quantity of precursor fluid could significantly affect the membrane adhesion strength and pure water flux since the membrane flux and sheet resistance decreased to 631 582 573 527 and 480 l m2 h 1 and 108 74 62 59 and 51 ω sq with adhesion coefficients of grade 4a 4a 5a 5a and 5a as the spraying amount increased from 30 to 70 ml respectively the sheet resistance of the ccm could be as low as 59 9 56 3 2 mω cm and 51 ω sq 8 83 2 1 mω cm at spraying amounts of 60 and 70 ml but the membrane fluxes decreased by 31 and 42 which severely reduced the membrane separation capacity therefore increasing the spraying amount could increase the thickness of the membrane surface film and occupy the surface channels of the membrane leading to an increase in the resistance of liquid passing through the membrane and decrease in the membrane flux wang et al 2012 therefore a spraying amount of 50 ml was considered as the optimal parameter as a contrast to achieve optimal ccm separability and conductivity via gel coating and immersion hydrolysis the effects of different liquid solid ratios 1 4 ml g numbers of coating layers 1 3 metal oxide doping a c a z and the impregnation concentrations 0 50 and times 1 5 were also studied the detailed optimization and analysis process are shown in the section f1 and f2 of supplementary information figure s1 s2 figure s3 a c present images of the ccms prepared by gel coating immersion hydrolysis and spray pyrolysis the color of the ccms developed from light to dark blue which was attributed to the differences in the preparation processes the gel and immersion techniques could cause inhomogeneous doping and the insufficient oxidation of sn and sb atoms banerjee et al 2004 while spray pyrolysis was an in situ coating method as the reactants were sprayed directly to the surface of the high temperature cm substrate materials as aerosols to generate metal oxide films as the basis for evaluating the effectiveness of the preparation method the pure water flux and sheet resistance of the membranes prepared by the three methods under the optimal conditions are summarized and presented in table 1 obviously the ccm prepared by spray pyrolysis exhibited the best conductivity coating film stability and retained excellent separation performance compared to the ccms prepared by the other two methods and was finally selected for the following characterization and application experiments 3 1 2 characterization of the ccm figure s4 a shows the xrd pattern of the ccm surface prepared by spray pyrolysis the main diffraction peaks at 2θ 25 6 35 1 43 3 52 7 57 5 66 5 68 2 77 1 were identified as al2o3 jcpds card no 46 1212 while the peaks at 26 5 33 6 37 7 52 7 were assigned to sno2 sb2o3 jcpds card no 88 2348 the clear diffraction peaks of al2o3 and sno2 sb2o3 were observed indicating the successful sno2 coating was loaded to the cm surface figure s4 b depicts the ft ir spectra of cm and ccm in the spectrum of cm and ccm the characteristic absorption peaks near the wavenumber of 3322 2078 2104 and 1541 cm 1 in both samples was ascribed to the characteristic stretching modes of oh on the surface of the sample notably the peak appeared at the wavenumber of 635 3 cm 1 in ccm spectrum could be attributed to the stretching vibration peak of the sn o bond suggested that the sno2 conductive coating was successfully prepared fig 4 a shows the image of sem photo of original cm clearly the membrane surface of original cm was rough while a large number of ultrafine particles with the particle size were observed to be distributed in the pores of the original cm fig 4 b and c after modification speculating that the sno2 sb particles had been covered the cm surface and filled the interspaces of the membrane pores these changes increased the complexity of the pore structure and provided a platform for the occurrence of electrochemical reaction the sem images of the original cm and ccm cross sections are presented in fig 4 d and e respectively it can be observed that there is no difference except that the surface of the ccm was loaded with a slight film to further explore the composition of the coating film eds microanalyses of the cm and ccm fig 4 f and g were conducted and the results indicate that the ccm s surface mainly contained al 28 57 by weight o 41 91 sn 21 04 and sb 2 46 fig 4 h n without notable stratification moreover sn and sb were deposited on the surface of the film and uniformly distributed in the depths of the pore channels further indicating that the sprayed sno2 particles were mainly distributed inside the membrane pores this is because the conductive sno2 sb conductive particles spread to the inner part of the separation layer and formed a stable film after the oxidation and nucleation reactions of the precursor on the membrane s surface the pore size distributions of the cm and ccm were determined in detail following the mercury injection method the trimodal pore size distribution of the membrane was typical for cm the structures of which are subdivided into the support intermediate and separation layers based on the aperture size distribution wang et al 2019 figure s5 a shows that most of the intrusion pore volume was attributed to the support and intermediate layers which had pore diameters of 5 10 μm due to their relatively larger pore size than that of the separation layer 0 3 0 5 μm additionally figure s5 b shows that the average pore size of the separation layer ranged from 0 2 to 0 4 μm which was slightly lower than that of the original cm and could be attributed to the modified sno2 sb conductive layer the micro sized pores would facilitate water transport and pollutant retention through the membrane due to the low flow resistance during separation the surface wettability of ceramic plate before and after modification fig 5 indicates that the contact angles decreased from 103 8 to 70 3 with the introduction of the conductive sno2 sb coating film exhibiting excellent surface hydrophilicity that was considered to be beneficial for membrane antifouling filtration as it can aid in decreasing the adsorption of hydrophobic organic pollutants zhang and vecitis 2014 the electrochemical properties of the ccm were evaluated through lsv and the tafel curve figure s6 a and b no passivation occurred when the ccm was used as the working electrode and the corrosion potential of the ccm electrode was higher 0 3625 v than that of the stainless steel electrode 1 2509 v with a corrosion rate of 2 067 against 2 336 mm r the self corrosion potential moved in the positive direction indicating that the electrode reaction was inhibited simultaneously to the observation of lower corrosion rates therefore the ccm electrode was relatively stable and exhibited excellent corrosion resistance potential to determine an appropriate coating cycle a nyquist plot obtained through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis at the frequency range of 1 105 hz potential range of 1 0 1 0 v vs ag agcl the scan rate of 100 mv s was used and is presented in figure s6 c the semicircle diameter was taken as the charge transfer resistance rct and the ccm was 38 ω after testing demonstrating that the ccm exhibited high electron transfer ability in the electrochemical reaction which agreed well with the results from the sno2 sb electrode yao et al 2016 3 2 optimization of sole cm and ccm separation performance key water quality parameters for the permeation including the cod removal efficiency instantaneous permeate flux j and flux recovery j j0 were used to evaluate the purification and antifouling performance during the experimental process the feed solution was treated by sole membrane separation and the membrane flux attenuations of cm and ccm within 60 min of filtration are presented in fig 6 a whose pure water flux j0 were about 720 and 575 l m 2 h 1 respectively the results showed that the normalized permeate fluxes j j0 of the original cm and modified ccm decreased slowly during the initial 15 min and then decreased significantly to 43 1 and 35 3 in the following 45 min the permeate flux noticeably declined without an electric field which could be because the cake layer had not been formed during the initial filtration stage maluleke and linkov 2003 the difference in the flux attenuation between cm and ccm was inferred based in the decrease in pore size separation layer after modification which could also be the reason for the higher cod removal efficiency of ccm separation 43 2 than that of the original cm 37 2 fig 6 b to investigate the reusability of the sole filtration process during long term recycling the cm and ccm were reused four times 60 min per cycle and their performances in each normalized flux cycle were evaluated fig 6 c the normalized initial fluxes of the original cm and ccm recovered to approximately 82 2 and 80 0 of their initial values and then subsequently plummeted to 26 4 and 24 2 after another 60 min of filtering during the third cycle the normalized initial fluxes decreased slightly recovering to 73 3 and 68 9 of their initial values which were similar to those before the second backwashing respectively these results suggest that there was no significant difference in the membrane fouling mitigation performance of the original cm and ccm during the sole filtration process 3 3 optimization of the ec process and ec assisted membrane separation performance to evaluate the feasibility of applying the ccm as an electrode and the contribution of ec as a pretreatment to alleviating membrane fouling the cod removal efficiency of the sole ec process mode 2a was determined based on different current densities 2 10 ma cm2 fig 7 a reveals that the cod removal ratios reached 14 0 20 1 18 2 25 8 26 4 31 0 29 8 35 6 and 30 7 39 5 after 30 60 min of electrolysis at current densities of 2 4 6 8 and 10 ma cm2 respectively meanwhile the sizes of the flocs under current densities of 2 4 6 and 8 ma cm2 began to increase remarkably after 3 6 9 and 15 min respectively figure s7 according to faraday s law the amounts of al ions released from anode were positively correlated with the current density and reaction time therefore a higher current density could promote the production of polynuclear hydroxy aluminum compounds aln oh 3n which was beneficial for the formation of floccules from aluminum complexes and pollutants by adsorption neutralization and net sweeping zhao et al 2019 the large particle size floccules that attached by charged contaminants organic matter oil drop and colloidal substance was attached and intercepted instead of the adsorption of membrane pores which greatly improved the capability to achieve high flux of membrane separation lehman and liu 2009 myat et al 2018 fig 7 b presents the normalized flux declines of ccm after 60 min of electrolysis with different current densities the ccm exhibited higher membrane flux attenuation than that of the original ccm filtration which was not coupling with ec process with the current density increased particularly when it exceeded 6 ma cm2 this is because the flocs generated by the high current density in the ec process were adsorbed in the membrane pores and were difficult to eliminate without complete cleaning zhao et al 2019 moreover the resistance of the ccm electrode was still higher than that of the metal electrode and the high electric field strength may have impacted the structure of the conductive layer on the membrane s surface thereby affecting the separation performance of these ccms therefore as the ccm filtration performance and service life could be reduced it was reasonable to take the current density value of less than 6 ma cm2 in subsequent experiments although higher current densities could slightly improve the cod removal efficiency as the external electric field positively affects membrane filtration the related configurations were of equal importance to the results liu et al 2012 therefore to investigate the enhanced separation performance of the ccm coupled with continuous ec electric field intensities of 0 6 1 v cm current densities of 0 5 ma cm2 were applied to the treatment system fig 7 c the intervention of the electric field was beneficial for cod removal as it increased gradually from 43 3 without electric field to 47 2 49 4 56 1 55 8 and 54 6 at electric field intensities of 0 6 1 5 2 8 4 2 6 1 v cm current densities of 1 2 3 4 and 5 ma cm2 respectively the current densities of 3 5 ma cm2 induced a significant gradual increase in the cod removal efficiencies suggesting that flocculation may have been responsible for the removal of oil and some colloidal pollutants from the feed solution the normalized flux declines of ccm with and without ec assistance 2 4 ma cm2 for four cycles were studied and are presented in fig 7 d obviously the permeate fluxes decreased by 64 3 and 70 5 and 64 0 and 69 8 during the third and fourth cycles of ec assisted filtration with current densities of 3 and 4 ma cm2 after 60 min respectively which were lower than those of the ccm without ec assistance 79 6 and 87 5 additionally the contaminants could not fully coagulate with the al hydroxides at a low current density 2 ma m2 under a short reactor residence time causing numerous small flocs to clog the membrane pores or deposit on the membrane s surface thereby resulting in lower surface porosity and higher filtration resistance during the filtration stage xu et al 2011 in contrast increasing the current density could significantly remove small colloidal particles and reduce the effluent cod concentration as the electric field between the electrodes increased the motion and collision frequency of the colloidal particles thereby accelerating coagulation within the same hydraulic retention time and reducing the probability of the blockage of membrane pores by small particles mudhoo et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 3 4 evaluation and optimization of ec ec assisted membrane separation performance the operation mode based on ec pretreatment 30 min 6 ma cm2 combined with ec assisted membrane separation 60 min 3 ma cm2 mode 3 was implemented and compared to the sole ec assisted membrane separation process mode 2b as observed the cod removal efficiency 64 6 was higher than that of the sole ec assisted ccm separation process 56 1 for the first cycle and the removal effect decreased rapidly as the number of cycles increased fig 8 a fig 8 b presents the normalized flux decline of the ccm with ec 30 min 6 ma cm2 and the original ccm under an electric field of 3 ma cm2 during four cycles the antifouling performance of the original ccm was much better than that of the ccm used as a cathode in the ec process the normalized initial fluxes at 60 120 180 and 240 min of the above two ccms decreased to 40 1 vs 47 3 32 4 vs 42 5 24 8 vs 33 6 and 19 2 vs 28 8 respectively the variations in the sheet resistance of the ccm film after use in the ec process were higher than those of the original ccm material after each cycle figure s8 furthermore figure s9 shows the sem images of ccm membrane surface and cross section after being recycled for 5 times by ec process and the pollutants attached to the surface can be clearly observed which can be inferred that a large number of flocs containing heavy metals colloids and other small molecule pollutants generated in the ec process would move to the cathode through the electromigration process and even formed a thin scaling layer that composed of caco3 and mg oh 2 based on the principle of electrochemical reaction as previous research demonstrated that the membrane flux decline is due to pore blockage and cake layer formation during the earlier and later stages of filtration respectively vereb et al 2018 it could be deduced that when the ccm used by ec was reused for filtration large amounts of pollutants were deposited and adsorbed in the membrane pores that had not been completely cleaned by the backwashing process thereby increasing the membrane surface resistance and increasing the difficulty of filter cake layer formation by comparing the operation effects of different modes it can be concluded that both the ec assisted membrane separation mode 2b and ec ec assisted membrane separation technologies mode 3 could achieve well purification effect that the oil petroleum concentration of effluent could meet the secondary ⅱ standard of integrated wastewater discharge standard gb 8978 1996 oil 10 mg l but the mode 3 process may significantly destroy the ccm surface structure thereby affecting the service life of the membrane material therefore the operation of the ec assisted membrane separation process mode 2b with an electric field intensity of 2 8 v cm was optimal to ensure a good separation effect excellent antifouling performance and long service life 3 5 membrane fouling model and antifouling mechanism investigation in this study the fitting results of hermia s models adapted to filtration were analyzed and compared to the experimental data obtained from the cm and ec assisted ccm separation processes figure s10 presents the flux decline analysis results for four classic membrane fouling models and their corresponding parameters during filtration the correlation coefficients r2 of cm and ec assisted ccm filtration were 0 7543 vs 0 8667 0 9856 vs 0 9684 0 8542 vs 0 8756 and 07 520 vs 0 8438 after fitting the cake layer standard pore blocking complete pore blocking and intermediate pore blocking models respectively the results show that the standard blocking model could predict the permeate flux better than the other models even during the initial filtration stage figure s10 b this is reasonable because the pore size distribution of the cms used in this experiment was approximately 0 3 μm and the large pore structures allowed the passage of small molecule pollutants and salts while intercepting large molecule pollutants colloids and floc particles resulting in membrane pore pollution both the cm and ccm separation processes were accompanied by the other three membrane fouling models and the r2 of the ec assisted ccm membrane separation process mode 2b was higher than that of cm filtration alone this indicated that the steric and demulsification effects caused by the intervention of ec prevented more colloids oil drops and other small molecule pollutants from entering the membrane pores and reduced the extent of membrane pore blockage thereby changing membrane fouling from irreversible to reversible lu 2016 mameda et al 2017 in addition the aluminum hydroxide functional groups aln oh 3n also improved the ability to achieve high fluxes due to the attachment of charged contaminants to the floccules with large particle size instead of the membrane surface which formed cake on top of the membrane surface and do not penetrate into the pores to further understand the oil removal performance and antifouling mechanism of ccm in the ec assisted membrane separation process the zeta potential of cm and ccm under different ph conditions was determined in fig 9 a b a significant electronegativity result 17 5 mv was obtained at the condition of solution ph 4 in addition the organics with fluorescence characteristics in effluent from sole ccm filtration mode 1 and ec assisted ccm filtration processes mode 2b were detected and analyzed by three dimensional fluorescence spectrometer it is found that there are obvious characteristic peaks at the maximum excitation emission wavelengths of 319 305 and 320 368 nm that belong to the typical organic matter in oil fig 9 c d compared with sole ccm filtration the ec assisted ccm separation process could remove more organics with fluorescence characteristics which was further demonstrating the contribution of electrochemical process to pollutant degradation thus an antifouling mechanism that included the changes in the structure of the ccm preparation process and possible migration and transformation of pollutants ions in the ec assisted membrane filtration is proposed in fig 10 the microstructure of the cms was asymmetric with a denser separation layer on top of a more porous and larger particle substrate however the incorporation of the conductive coating layers may influence the overall pore size and level porosity tang et al 2013 as described in ccm preparation using spray pyrolysis method the mixed solution was sprayed onto the surface of the cm driving the in situ chemical precipitation reaction to generate sb sno2 which uniformly adhered to the surface of the membrane pores and form a dense conductive film therefore as a membrane fouling mitigation strategy the deposited conductive molecular layer could significantly improve the hydrophilicity of the membrane s surface and facilitate the formation of a hydration layer preventing the foulants from directly attaching to the membrane s surface and improving its fouling resistance hofs et al 2011 additionally the membrane fouling mitigation mechanisms in the electro membrane filtration system were complex due to the different types of foulants present therefore explanations for the mitigation of fouling due to flocculation can be found based on the experimental results and previous studies ebrahimi et al 2009 jing and chaplin 2016 in addition to the antifouling contribution of the above ccm material properties the electric field coupling process also has significant antifouling performance driven by the transmembrane pressure and the electric field force between electrodes the pollutants and charged particles gradually accumulated from the membrane pores to the membrane s surface which involved the hydrodynamic forces induced by filtration and electric field forces caused by the applied dc fig 10 a b anderson 1988 besides according to the experimental results and research achievements from fan et al fan et al 2015 the electrochemical degradation electrostatic repulsion and electrochemical adsorption were the main electric field factors influencing the charged particles in the ccm separation system fig 10 c e timmes et al 2009 the charged contaminants could be repelled from the membrane s surface to alleviate fouling under the electric field due to the effect of the electrophoretic and electrostatic repulsive forces pan et al 2019 meanwhile the increase in the particle size due to flocculation prevented the particles from penetrating and blocking the membrane pores thereby mitigating the internal fouling mechanism zaky and chaplin 2014 and improving the antifouling performance accordingly the antifouling mechanism of electric field assisted membrane separation can be summarized into three parts including 1 the promotion of membrane fouling mitigation influenced by the hydrophilic and oleophobic of the ccm material surface 2 the contribution of electrostatic repulsion to the inhibition of the formation of oil fouling layer on the ccm surface and 3 the effect of flocs produced by ec micro degradation on filter cake layer 4 conclusions a robust and electroconductive flat sb sno2 al2o3 membrane with good pore size tunability and mechanical stability was successfully prepared and utilized for electrically assisted antifouling filtration optimum permeability coating stability and uniform surface morphology with well dispersed particulates were obtained at the substrate cm surface temperature of 475 c precursor concentration of 0 5 m calculate as sno2 and spraying amount of 50 ml 120 cm2 using spray pyrolysis during membrane modification the designed module with a sb sno2 al2o3 flat ccm element could treat machining industrial wastewater as both the cathode and filter module with al plates as the anode multiple groups of comparative experiments were conducted and their results suggested that the electric field exerted on ccm provided by ec aided in alleviating membrane fouling at the electric field intensity of 2 8 v cm which enhanced the permeate fluxes by 0 34 0 7 0 75 and 1 41 times after four cycles of treating wastewater samples when compared with cm filtration alone furthermore the standard pore blocking model coefficient of the ec assisted ccm process was significantly lower than that of cm filtration alone indicating that the membrane separation process changed from irreversible to reversible pollution this work demonstrates that the modified conductive flat cm under ec assistance is promising for industrial wastewater treatment and provides new insights for the design of next generation

15808,the traditional methods of increasing the chlorine disinfectant dosage in the drinking water distribution system dwds to control microorganisms and improve the safety of drinking water quality are subjected to several challenges one noticeable problem is the unpleasant odor generated by chlorine and chloramines however the generally proposed chlorine dosage optimization model ignores the chloric odor distribution in the dwds this study proposes a comprehensive multi parameter water quality model and aims to balance the trade offs between i minimize the flavor profile analysis fpa degree of the chloric odor produced by chlorine and chloramines in the dwds and ii minimize the economic investment chlorine dosage and operation cost epanet and back propagation bp network integrated with the borg algorithm were employed as innovative approaches to simulate the chlorine chloramines and chloric odor intensity in the dwds moreover the application of the multi parameter model was demonstrated in a real world dwds case study 0 5 mg cl2 l mg l chlorine at 8 secondary chlorination points was added to the dwds as an optimized chlorine dosing scheme considering the olfactory and financial objective functions simultaneously when switching to a superior water source the fpa of the chloric odor in dwds increased by a maximum of 1 4 at most if the initial chlorine dosage remained as before to avoid the occurrence of chloric odor and also control the residual free chlorine residual chlorine at a suitable value the initial and secondary chlorine dosages were optimized to 0 4 mg l and 0 3 mg l respectively under this condition the initial chlorine dosage was reduced by 50 compared to the original operation scheme in city j china the qualification rate of the residual chlorine reached 97 2 basically consistent with that before water source switching and the chloric odor intensity of the dwds was controlled below fpa 3 4 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chloric odor intensity water source switching bp neural network borg algorithm drinking water distribution system dwds 1 introduction chlorine has been widely regarded as an important disinfectant in drinking water for over 100 years to meet water quality standards lv et al 2021 scarpino et al 1972 as an effective disinfectant the higher the chlorine dosage of the points the better is the safety of the drinking water distribution system dwds excessive chlorine would make the water stable in contrast it would result in the complex disinfection by products dbps unpleasant odor with strong impacts on the users and even cause a large amount of cost investment it is particularly important to control the biological safety of the drinking water as much as possible and avoid the pungent odor caused by disinfection or dbps to monitor the water quality in dwds kennedy et al 2021 analyzed the residual free chlorine residual chlorine of water samples selected from various on site sampling points one shortcoming of the on site sampling method is its ability to only characterize the water quality at a limited number of sampling points and does not represent the residual chlorine of all other points in the entire dwds zhang et al 2021 therefore residual chlorine may have been too low to maintain the biological safety of water and could thus seriously affect the health of residents li et al 2018 pan et al 2021 this has motivated researchers to establish water quality models instead of using the usual sampling methods and gradually apply an increasing number of dwds abokifa et al 2016b the chlorine decay rates hua et al 2015 chlorine dosages sikder et al 2020 and setting up booster chlorination stations goyal and patel 2017 were treated as a single simulation target in some water quality models which can effectively benefit the operation and management of the dwds additionally multi parameter water quality models have garnered increasing attention globally some common water quality indicators ph value turbidity temperature total phosphor total nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand and the association between chlorine and dbps boccelli et al 2003 metal corrosives such as lead maheshwari et al 2020 and microbial biomass abokifa et al 2016a have been explored in forecast models the water quality models have improved the detection efficiency compared to normal water quality testing methods however some gaps still exist in the field of modeling and representing odors within a dwds the taste and odor t o problem in drinking water is one of the most crucial hotspots of current water quality research and has frequently been complained about in recent years owing to greater demand from residents regarding their drinking water and the dangers of unpleasant odors sun 2015 tap water may be replaced by bottled water in several households if the smell is too pungent however the waterworks should have a greater budget to handle the water that consequently contributes to the economic waste avvedimento et al 2020 the reasons for the peculiar smell of drinking water can be summarized in the following three points 1 chemical substances contained in the water source and odorants secreted by algae zhou et al 2017 2 agents or newly generated substances added during water treatment and 3 the secondary pollution process during the transportation or storage of the dwds most scholars have characterized the first type of odorants released by algae such as geosmin gsm 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib and other earthy and musty substances bu et al 2017 while ignoring the chloric odor directly caused by the disinfectant added in the treatment process the chloric odor generated by chlorine and chloramines is one important factor among the unpleasant odors in drinking water unfortunately to date no systematic assessment of the chloric odor of the entire dwds has been assessed in the literature it has been proven that residual chlorine concentration positively correlates with the chloric odor wang et al 2018 proposed that chloramines were another vital reason resulting in a chloric odor apart from chlorine the process of generation and the form of existence of hypochlorous acid is listed in eqs 1 and 2 the odor threshold of hypochlorous acid is 0 28 mg cl2 l mg l and is usually described as a bleach like odor krasner 1984 shen et al 2003 in the presence of hypochlorous acid and ammonia chloramines can be expressed by eqs 3 to 5 vikesland et al 2001 the formation of chloramines species is generally determined by the ph of water and the ratio of chlorine to ammonia nitrogen cl n ratio liu et al 2021 monochloramine is dominant when the ph value is between 7 and 11 dichloramine gradually becomes abundant when it is lowered to 4 4 7 and trichloramine would become predominant when it is below 4 4 the chloramines are described as having a swimming pool like odor with odor thresholds of 0 65 0 15 and 0 02 mg l respectively implying that they contribute to the chloric odor intensity lee and westerhoff 2009 matsushita et al 2017 monochloramine and dichloramine were considered as the main factors as the ph of drinking water is often around 7 but trichloramine also could exist in the drinking water which could not be ignored in some regions kosaka et al 2010 1 n a c l o h 2 o n a o h h c l o 2 h c l o h c l o 3 n h 3 h c l o n h 2 c l h 2 o 4 n h 2 c l h c l o n h c l 2 h 2 o 5 n h c l 2 h c l o n c l 3 h 2 o with the development of artificial intelligence systems the reaction and simulation of multi water parameter chlorine chloramines and chloric odor can be achieved duirk et al 2005 vikesland et al 2001 establishing the relationship between the chloric odor and the factors impacting the chloric odor intensity can be defined as a type of end to end learning wu et al 2020 a prediction result is obtained from the input to the output ends during the process an error would be produced when comparing it with the real observation in each layer which is propagated backpropagated in the model the representation of each layer is adjusted according to this error until the model converges or the expected effect is achieved the back propagation bp neural network is a species of artificial neural network models hao et al 2018 applied most widely in end to end learning including management science economics and sociology however it has not been employed in forecasting the chloric odor intensity in the water environment industry in this study epanet software maheshwari et al 2018 was integrated with a bp neural network as a systematic multi component prediction approach that could obtain the mathematical relationship between chlorine chloramines and the relative odor degree and consequently obtain the chloric odor intensity at any point in the dwds moreover the initial chlorine dosage and the location and dosage of the secondary chlorination points were optimized based on the economic investment and chloric odor intensity in this study by borg algorithm therefore this study can serve as a guide for smell control and is conducive to balancing the water quality and cost 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials naclo solution 4 00 4 99 available chlorine kh2po4 99 0 na2hpo4 99 0 naoh 98 n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd 99 0 ki 99 0 and nh4cl 99 5 from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china all chemicals were at least of analytical grade ultrapure water produced by a milli q apparatus millipore corporation billerica massachusetts usa was used to prepare solutions 2 2 determination experiment of chloric odor intensity the concentrations of residual chlorine and three chloramines were measured with dpd colorimetric method and the detection limit of the method for residual chlorine and chloramines was 0 01 mg l american public health association 2005 more advanced method could be used to detect the presence of residual chlorine and chloramines in the future to obtain more accurate detection values an initial chlorine range of 0 2 2 0 mg l with an interval of 0 2 mg l was respectively dosed in each sampled water and initial cl n ratio was subsequently set to various values in each sampled water to obtain different percentages of chlorine and chloramines a uv visible spectrophotometer dr6000 hach company united states was used to determine the free residual chlorine and chloramines subsequently each 200 ml water sample was collected in a 500 ml erlenmeyer flask and sealed with a plastic wrap the erlenmeyer flask was placed in a 45 c water bath for 10 min after heating the water bath the testers were requested to smell the water samples the testers were required to describe the type and intensity of the odor to guarantee that the odor of the water sample was not volatilized which could influence the accuracy of the experiment the erlenmeyer flask was sealed again and heated in a 45 c water bath for 2 3 min after being smelled by one tester five or seven testers were selected in this experiment to describe the chloric odor flavor profile analysis fpa was used to define the chloric odor levels from 0 to 12 the relationship between eight different fpa degrees and the chloric odor intensity is presented in table s1 in particular the larger the value of the fpa the more pungent was the chlorine odor the fpa results of each water sample were calculated using eq 6 and are listed in table s2 6 f p a i 1 s f i s where fi is the fpa result of the ith tester and s is the number of testers 2 3 application of the bp neural network to simulate the chloric odor the chloric odor was set as the forecast target based on its connection with the parameters chlorine and chloramines which could be speculated by the bp neural network zhang et al 2018 all data input to the bp neural network should be normalized first using eq 7 to be located in 0 1 the sigmoid function was adopted as the activation function in the experimental model 7 y x x m i n x m a x x m i n here y is the normalized result and x xmax and xmin are the origin maximum and minimum input values respectively 2 4 optimization of the chlorine dosage and secondary chlorination points the determination of the secondary chlorination points and chlorine dosage is a multi objective optimization problem which is typically difficult in the field of civil and infrastructure engineering because of its discrete nonlinear and high dimensional search spaces regarding the optimization formulation and implementation a phased evolutionary optimization algorithm was developed and applied in the dwds before and after water source switching during the first step the two objectives of this study are to 1 minimize the average chloric odor intensity and 2 maximize economic benefits reduce the costs on the construction of secondary chlorination points and chlorine dosing cost the decision variables considered are n secondary chlorination points as x l n i k s i l n i j and i 1 n the constraints considered for achieving the optimization objectives are the requirements for chlorine dosage and hydraulic conditions the formulation of the bi objective optimization can be generalized as follows 8 f x f o d f e c subject to secondary chlorine dosage constraints 9 k s m i n k s i k s m a x duplicated points constraints 10 n d u p 0 hydraulic constraints 11 h f d q where lni is the index of the secondary chlorination point i ksi is the chlorine dosage at point i n is the maximum number of secondary chlorination points to be placed within the dwds j is the set of points of candidate secondary chlorination f x is the vector valued objective function fod and fec are the chloric odor intensity at the nodes of dwds and the economic costs respectively ks min and ks max are the minimum required and maximum allowable chlorine dosages respectively at point i ndup is the number of duplicated points identified as secondary chlorination points in one solution h h 1 k s h m t is the vector of nodal pressure q q 1 k s q m t is the vector of node demands m is the number of demand nodes f d q is the nonlinear equation of the hydraulic model namely flow continuity and energy conservation equations for the assessment of hydraulic condition and water quality eqs 8 and 11 were solved using epanet 2 0 the aforementioned bi objective functions are used to evaluate the performance of secondary chlorination points in a given design scheme which are described in detail as follows 12 f o d i 1 m j 1 t o d i t j m t 13 f e c n c 365 24 t k 1 n j 1 t q k t j t j k s i e where o d i t j is the chloric odor intensity for demand node i at time tj q k t j is the flow rate of secondary chlorination k at time tj t is the duration of assessment m is the total demand nodes in dwds c and e are the per year cost of the secondary chlorination point construction and raw material per unit respectively k is the secondary chlorination point index k 1 2 n j is the time index j 1 2 t t j j δ t is the simulation time and δ t is the time step for water quality analysis in the second process the location of the secondary points remains unchanged the objective of the study is converted into minimizing the average chloric odor intensity while controlling the residual chlorine concentration above 0 05 mg l thus the dosage of initial chlorine and secondary chlorination are optimized the decision variables considered are n secondary chlorination points as y k s i i 1 n ksi is the chorine dosage at the secondary chlorination point lni i 1 n which should be determined in the first process the constraints considered for achieving the optimization objectives are no different from the first step the formulation of the objective optimization can be generalized as follows 14 f y f o d subject to eqs 9 11 and 15 initial chlorine dosage constraints 15 k y m i n k y k y m a x where ky is the chlorine dosage at waterwork y ky min and ky max are the minimum required and maximum allowable chlorine dosages respectively at waterwork y generally the aforementioned bi objective optimization problems need to be solved through multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas various moeas have been widely applied to handle complex real world optimization problems although these algorithms often work well on bi objective optimization problems the advantages of these algorithms can be severely deteriorated with an increase in objective numbers thus a state of the art hyper heuristic algorithm known as borg was introduced to improve the performance of multi objective optimization several scholars have comprehensively compared borg with other moeas in terms of its effectiveness efficiency reliability and scalability they found that borg exhibits superior performance and reliability in handling complex real world high dimensional optimization problems hadka and reed 2013 wang et al 2015 zheng et al 2016 therefore the borg algorithm was applied in this study to solve the bi objective optimization problem borg hadka and reed 2013 is a unified framework consisting of ε dominance ε progress randomized restart and auto adaptive multi operator recombination this method involves a recombination process with the following six operators simulated binary crossover sbx differential evolution de patent centric crossover pcx unimodal normal distribution crossover undx simplex crossover spx and uniform mutation um applying these different search operators can result in a range of offspring distributions to improve the optimization process the principle of borg is illustrated in fig 1 during the application process fig 1 one recombination operator was selected using a self adaptive multi operator feedback mechanism for an operator that requires k parent solutions one of them is randomly and evenly selected from the archive and the other k 1 parent solutions are chosen from the population using tournament selection this is followed by the generation of offspring with the aid of the selected operator subsequently the offspring solutions are evaluated and added to the archive and the population the ε progress and population to archive ratio are key factors in activating a new search process which are regularly checked after a certain number of iterations of the main loop if the restart condition is satisfied the current main loop step is aborted and the restart process is executed by resizing the population this is followed by the resumption of another main loop step and finally the entire process may be terminated after a fixed number of evaluations 3 case studies 3 1 case study description a realistic dwds for city j in china was selected as a case study to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method as a river network the self purification ability of water in city j is relatively poor and the water resources especially high quality ones are in short supply with the implementation of urban rural integration presently city j has built approximately 1304 and 489 km of water supply pipelines above dn100 and dn300 respectively the water supply area has reached 968 km2 covering 10 towns and villages in total serving approximately 1 2 million people to mitigate the lack of high quality water lake q will be regarded as the new water source which has a superior quality in both chemical and biological aspects actually the water treatment processes of the two waterworks in city j and lake q also exist difference biological pretreatment enhanced conventional treatment ozone biological activated carbon treatment pattern is adopted by city j while the coagulation sedimentation filtration disinfection conventional drinking water treatment system is applied in lake q owing to the alteration of the water source the optimization of the initial chlorine was associated with the residual chlorine and chloric odor trichloramine was not detected in drinking water samples including all 60 tests of sampled water from water quality detection points in city j with dpd colorimetric method that may be because of the lack of sensitivity of the detection method concentration of trichloramine below 0 01 mg l had little impact on the current prediction of chloric odor model therefore residual chlorine monochloramine and dichloramine were recognized as the input parameters of the bp neural network however trichloramine should be added as the fourth input parameter to realize the chloric simulation in the dwds in the region where trichloramine is common in the water with higher concentrations in this case study the dwds model comprises two waterworks 2535 nodes i e m 2535 14 pumps 771 valves and 2782 pipe sections the diameter was between 200 and 1400 mm with many loops fig 2 the maximum water age of the dwds in city j is about 3 7 days thus the water quality model dwds has a demand pattern that varies over 96 h i e t 96 h with a hydraulic time step of 1 h and a quality time step of 5 min i e δ t 5 min additionally the original initial chlorine dosage at the five reservoirs was 0 8 mg l according to the current situation in city j the construction cost of the secondary chlorination point was 300 000 rmb yuan and the depreciation life of fixed assets were 5 years thus c was set as 60 000 rmb yuan and the per unit raw material cost e was set as 0 00125 rmb yuan m3 3 2 implementation procedures of the proposed method the implementation procedures of the proposed method are as follows establishing the hydraulic and water quality models for city j epanet 2 0 and epanet msx were used as the hydraulic and water quality simulation tools in this study respectively calibrating model parameters based on historical monitoring data in the present study the evolution algorithm borg was applied to calibrate the corresponding parameters including nodal demands pipe roughness coefficients and decay coefficients of the bulk water and wall the population size of borg was 500 following the parameters used by he et al 2018 and the maximum allowable number of evaluations was 500 000 for this case study the values of the remaining borg parameters are the default selections given in wang et al 2015 in the experiment there were 100 sets of water samples with different concentrations of residual chlorine monochloramine and dichloramine trichloramine should also be considered when it exists the performance of bp neural network is independent of the number of input parameters since mathematical theory has proved that the three layer neural network could realize the mapping between multi parameters input and output with arbitrary precision the fpa method was utilized to judge the chloric odor of the water samples and 80 sets of the water quality parameters including residual chlorine chloramines and chloric odor among the specified data were selected as the training samples for machine learning estimating the chloric odor intensity at the nodes of the dwds based on the calibrated water quality model and machine learning method the bp neural network was applied to build the relationships among the residual chlorine chloramines and chloric odor levels in the sample set obtained by the experiment in step 3 80 of the samples were randomly selected as the training set and the remaining 20 was the validation set the ne and output nodes were set as 3 and 1 respectively the hidden nodes were set as 5 the loop number was 50 000 the cumulative error was 0 000001 and the learning rates were 0 2 and 0 3 eventually by inputting the residual chlorine and chloramines obtained by the calibrated water quality model in step 2 the odor intensity can be obtained based on the established bp model optimization of chlorine dosage and secondary chlorination points in this case study the borg algorithm was used to solve the bi objective optimization problem to minimize the average chloric odor intensity and minimize the economic cost at the nodes of the dwds the parameter values of borg were set in the same way as in step 2 the maximum number of secondary chlorination points n is set as 20 the minimum required and maximum allowable chlorine dosages of waterworks and the secondary chlorination points are set as ky min 0 3 mg l and ky max 0 8 mg l ks min 0 05 mg l and ks max 0 8 mg l respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 residual chlorine and chloramines simulation the difference between the observed and simulated values residual chlorine concentration at 96 h in 16 test sample points calibrated by the borg algorithm optimization method are shown in fig 3 a it can be speculated that the largest difference between the observation and simulation was 0 02 mg l this study chose a 24 h variation process of the residual chlorination simulation situation and actual detection situation at two detection points to further verify the exactness of the water quality model si fig s1 showed that the data frequencies with relative errors greater than 10 at two dection points were 25 and 23 respectively overall the chlorine model built in epanet accurately reflects the actual situation in the dwds and satisfies the accuracy requirements the observed and simulated values of monochloramine and dichloramine at 96 h of 16 test sample points shown in fig 3 b and c differed from 0 12 to 0 03 mg l at most respectively the overall layout of the residual chlorine after dosing with 0 80 mg l of initial chlorine 96 h before water source switching is shown in fig 4 we observed that the low chlorine areas were mainly concentrated at the edge of the city center and the town regions that spread at the end of the dwds in total there were 77 nodes in the dwds with less than 0 05 mg l residual chlorine as indicated by the red points however the reasons for low chlorine concentrations below 0 05 mg l of these two zones were disparate with regard to the former fringe of the city center the explanation for low residual chlorine may be the aging pipe materials which provide regions for chlorine to react with the biofilm along with the corrosion deposits thereby decaying the chlorine more rapidly trinh et al 2020 demonstrated that biofilms formed in high density polyethylene hdpe and polyvinyl chloride pvc pipes played a significant role in the consumption of chlorine zhang and andrews 2012 illustrated that chlorine decay was accelerated by reacting with solid copper corrosion products on the pipes currently there are four types of pipe materials employed in city j including polyethylene pipes around 10 years of use plastic steel pipes around 10 years of use cement mortar lined ductile iron pipes around 10 years of use and unlined cast iron pipes around 30 years of use information provided by city j municipal water authority in particular the pipes are all older than 10 years and tend to accentuate the biofilm and attach many corrosion substances capable of reacting with chlorine the pipe service age is recognized as an important factor affecting the chlorine wall decay constant and steel and cast iron pipes are the most influential thus the proper strategy to solve the aforementioned problem low residual chlorine at the edge of the city center is to update or replace the entirety of the pipelines the low chlorine state in the peripheral zone could mainly be ascribed to the following reasons 1 the long distance between the initial chlorine dose position the waterworks making the consumption of chlorine significantly large along the way 2 the gross water consumption in the village is low thus resulting in slow water flow and considerably long water residence time incapable of maintaining a biologically stable residual chlorine concentration in other words the residents of the village are confronted with a greater risk of drinking substandard water which requires greater attention from the managers and the government the end of the pipes in the northern western northwestern southeastern and southern dwds in the case study belonged to this category in particular the residual chlorine in these nodes was mainly below 0 10 mg l and sometimes less than 0 05 mg l the construction of secondary chlorination points is considered to be feasible to resolve the chlorine deficiency problem in the peripheral area 4 2 identification of the location and dosage of secondary chlorination points after constant modification of the hidden layers loops and learning rates in the bp neural network and training 80 sets of samples the results of chloramines concentrations and chloric odor simulation of the remaining 20 sets of test data are shown in fig 5 the fpa of the analog values ranged from 0 to 8 which covered the possible range that may appear in the dwds moreover the deviation between the predicted and actual measured values was within 0 67 owing to the subjectivity of the odor evaluation it can be considered that this bp neural network model could accurately establish the relationships among the components residual chlorine chloramines and odor allowing us to obtain a reliable fpa grade of chloric odor in the dwds the bi objective optimization solutions by borg algorithm were shown as fig 6 and the circled point was chosen as the operation plan which cost 506 07 million rmb yuan per year while controlling the average chloric odor of dwds at fpa 3 39 the economic goal was in opposition to the esthetic goal when more secondary chlorination points were added to the dwds the cost budget would be increased construction had a greater impact on economic cost than raw material price but less chlorine need to be dosed to maintain the safety of water quality thus the average chloric odor intensity would be decreased the economic investment combined with the average chloric odor value both should be considered and the selected plan was able to achieve both objective functions simultaneously among the pareto optimization sets in this case 8 secondary chlorination points the marked cross shown in fig 4 were suggested as additional supplements of chlorine to the low residual chlorine area the red circled area and the chlorine dosage was 0 5 mg l by borg algorithm these 8 additional positions were primarily located in the area where the chlorine concentrations were approximately 0 40 mg l at 96 h originally regarding the set of chlorine supply points the number of left nodes with residual chlorine less than 0 05 mg l was reduced from 77 to 63 see fig 7 notably the whole peripheral region basically met the lowest residual chlorine requirements only 4 nodes had chlorine values lower than 0 05 mg l and the marked nodes were basically located at the edge of the city center the overall arrangement of the secondary chlorination replenished the chlorine in the peripheral zone however the end of the dwds could not get sufficient chlorine as it was far from the waterworks this measure promoted the peripheral water to achieve a more biologically stable condition which could reduce the occurrence of water pollution incidents consequently it ensured the safety of users in the rural community as they used water with less biomass moreover pipe upgradation was necessitated to mitigate the remaining chlorine problem points recent studies have demonstrated that adding secondary chlorination facilities to the distribution system could be a significant measure to solve the uneven distribution of the chlorine state and avoid the overgrowth of bacteria from chlorine insufficiency to optimize the temporal and spatial distribution of chlorine the number location and dosage of the secondary chlorination points have garnered interest nouiri 2017 proposed a multi objective genetic algorithm to optimize the chlorination design and management in the dwds considering the following three objectives the improvement of chlorination uniformity minimization of the number of chlorine booster stations and the injected chlorine mass ohar and ostfeld 2014 used epanet msx and genetic algorithms as a new methodology for the design placement and operation of the booster chlorination stations in the dwds this guaranteed the presence of sufficient chlorine to destroy undesirable microorganisms while also preventing the t o problems near the injection locations and the excessive dbps at the far network ends overall the effect of optimization in the construction of secondary chlorination points in city j was discussed in this paper which is crucial for setting a guideline of supplement of chlorine for drinking water treatment facilities however the optimized results of the secondary chlorination points location and dosage derived by borg algorithm could make minor adjustment according to the actual site conditions project and other factors in the application 4 3 chloric odor prediction after water source switching after switching the water source to lake q and maintaining the other conditions as before the residual chlorine concentrations at 60 actual detection points is presented in table 1 we found that the residual chlorine concentration at 96 h at the same monitoring position would be higher than employing original water source universally increasing by a maximum of 0 13 mg l additionally the qualified rate of residual chlorine the nodes 0 05 mg l in the end of the dwds increased to 94 3 and the spatial distributions of the residual chlorine were almost consistent with those when the initial chlorine dosage was still set to 0 80 mg l see as si fig s2 the chloric odor levels at the 60 nodes are shown in fig 8 and presented in table s3 the fpa results were similar with the variation of the residual chlorine concentrations and both have an approximate promotion in other words when switching to a superior water source the residual chlorine and chloric odor intensity should both be considered as critical water quality parameters for management in general the chloric odor intensity in majority of the noticed nodes would increase by 0 01 1 39 except for a few points that remained at fpa 0 furthermore we found that the points near the water plants were more prone to greater increase the main reasons contributing to this situation could be the obvious diversities between the two water sources and the decay rate of the residual chlorine decreased after switching the water source by comparing the water quality parameters of city j and lake q the detection indicators of the three different sampling times are presented in table 2 a comprehensive analysis can be proposed as follows 1 the nutritional levels of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus were relatively close but city j had higher nitrogen concentrations due to the death and decay of plants which occurred frequently in winter subsequently the nitrogen reacts with sodium hypochlorite converting the chlorine to chloramines in the water the high concentration of nitrogen had accelerated the chlorine decay to a certain extent 2 the total organic carbon buxton et al 1988 of lake q was much smaller than that in city j and even did not achieve half of the latter some studies have demonstrated that toc is a key factor influencing the decay rate of residual chlorine there is a strong positive correlation between the toc concentration and residual chlorine decay rate 3 lake q had a lower conductivity sulfate chloride alkalinity and hardness in other words lake q is both biologically and chemically more stable and switching the water source to the lake q project would fundamentally solve the problem of poor water source quality as the chlorine decay of water in lake q was low chlorine dosage should be lowered simultaneously otherwise the high chlorine and odor intensity would result in complex dbps and pungent smells that could threaten the health of users and are more likely to arouse complaints 4 4 initial chlorine dosage optimization it is important to control the chlorine dosage to a suitable value in the dwds on one hand dosing too much chlorine would lead to unnecessary economic waste produce a series of complicated dbps and also cause a pungent smell which would adversely impact users conversely if an adequate chlorine dosage is not provided it is difficult to guarantee the microbial stability of drinking water because of the weak disinfectant function the chlorine dosage is particularly worth exploring and discussing when the water source conditions have changed as mentioned above when switching to a more superior water source such as lake q the decay rate of chlorine would decrease and the residual chlorine and chloric odor would increase to a much larger value if the initial chlorine dosage was not promptly altered situations of low chlorine concentration nodes and the chloric odor intensity in the dwds under different chlorine dosages after the water source switches to lake q are listed in table 3 when the original chlorine dosage plan was retained initial chlorine dosage and secondary chlorination point dosage of 0 8 and 0 5 mg l respectively only 4 nodes could not achieve residual chlorine values of 0 05 mg l but the fpa of the chloric odor was too high and only 126 nodes were below fpa 3 the optimization model results had an initial chlorine dosage of 0 41 mg l and set the secondary chlorination dosage as 0 32 mg l through the borg algorithm considering the convenience of the actual operation the recommended initial and secondary dosages were adjusted to 0 4 and 0 3 mg l respectively at this time the chloric odor distribution shown as fig 9 showed that 2009 nodes were between fpa 0 3 and the chloric odor in the region near the waterworks was approximately at fpa 3 4 which was relatively high but still acceptable conversely there were 11 and 61 nodes with chlorine concentrations lower than 0 05 mg l in the peripheral area and city edge respectively this proved that the biological safety at the end of the dwds was within a stable stage moreover the chlorine distribution at 96 h of the dwds when the initial chlorine dosages were set to 0 7 0 6 0 5 0 4 and 0 3 mg l are respectively shown in si figs s3 s7 notably residual chlorine presents a clear downward trend when the chlorine dosage decreases the fpa of all nodes in the dwds was less than 3 when the chlorine dosage was continually altered to 0 3 mg l however the number of nodes with less than 0 05 mg l residual chlorine in the peripheral area increased to 22 which greatly increased the risk of contamination in other words an initial chlorine dosage of 0 30 mg l was inappropriate in the case study to summarize based on the results of the residual chlorine distribution and chloric odor intensity of the different working conditions the recommended initial chlorine and secondary chlorination point dosages after water source switching were 0 40 and 0 30 mg l respectively 5 conclusions the hydraulic and water quality model in epanet realized the simulation of the residual chlorine and chloramines in the dwds in city j moreover the prediction results were calibrated to real time detection values using the borg evolution algorithm the largest differences between the observation and simulation were 0 02 0 12 and 0 03 mg l for chlorine monochloramine and dichloramine respectively the chloric odor simulation at the nodes of dwds was estimated based on the calibrated water quality model and machine learning method additionally the deviation between the predicted and the actual fpa was within 0 67 which was optimal for application to the entire dwds to enhance the biological stability of the dwds in city j 8 secondary chlorination points were set and the sum of nodes with less than 0 05 mg l residual chlorine was reduced by 13 nodes which were mainly located at the end of the dwds when switching to a superior water source lake q both chlorine and odor intensity at the 60 detection points would have increased the chlorine concentration and fpa would have increased by 0 13 mg l and 1 39 at most respectively mainly because high quality water had a low residual chlorine decay rate furthermore the initial chlorine and secondary chlorination dosages were optimized to 0 40 and 0 30 mg l respectively by the borg algorithm when 90 1 nodes in the peripheral area had more than 0 05 mg l residual chlorine and 79 nodes in the dwds had a chloric odor below fpa 3 it is worth noting that trichloramine was not detected in our research which may be caused by the limitation of the detection method but the bp neural network we established is feasible to considering trichloramine as a new input variable to predict the chloric odor further research is required in the future to investigate a thorough chlorine dosage optimization plan simultaneously considering the dbps chloric odor and biosecurity declaration of competing interest none

15808,the traditional methods of increasing the chlorine disinfectant dosage in the drinking water distribution system dwds to control microorganisms and improve the safety of drinking water quality are subjected to several challenges one noticeable problem is the unpleasant odor generated by chlorine and chloramines however the generally proposed chlorine dosage optimization model ignores the chloric odor distribution in the dwds this study proposes a comprehensive multi parameter water quality model and aims to balance the trade offs between i minimize the flavor profile analysis fpa degree of the chloric odor produced by chlorine and chloramines in the dwds and ii minimize the economic investment chlorine dosage and operation cost epanet and back propagation bp network integrated with the borg algorithm were employed as innovative approaches to simulate the chlorine chloramines and chloric odor intensity in the dwds moreover the application of the multi parameter model was demonstrated in a real world dwds case study 0 5 mg cl2 l mg l chlorine at 8 secondary chlorination points was added to the dwds as an optimized chlorine dosing scheme considering the olfactory and financial objective functions simultaneously when switching to a superior water source the fpa of the chloric odor in dwds increased by a maximum of 1 4 at most if the initial chlorine dosage remained as before to avoid the occurrence of chloric odor and also control the residual free chlorine residual chlorine at a suitable value the initial and secondary chlorine dosages were optimized to 0 4 mg l and 0 3 mg l respectively under this condition the initial chlorine dosage was reduced by 50 compared to the original operation scheme in city j china the qualification rate of the residual chlorine reached 97 2 basically consistent with that before water source switching and the chloric odor intensity of the dwds was controlled below fpa 3 4 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chloric odor intensity water source switching bp neural network borg algorithm drinking water distribution system dwds 1 introduction chlorine has been widely regarded as an important disinfectant in drinking water for over 100 years to meet water quality standards lv et al 2021 scarpino et al 1972 as an effective disinfectant the higher the chlorine dosage of the points the better is the safety of the drinking water distribution system dwds excessive chlorine would make the water stable in contrast it would result in the complex disinfection by products dbps unpleasant odor with strong impacts on the users and even cause a large amount of cost investment it is particularly important to control the biological safety of the drinking water as much as possible and avoid the pungent odor caused by disinfection or dbps to monitor the water quality in dwds kennedy et al 2021 analyzed the residual free chlorine residual chlorine of water samples selected from various on site sampling points one shortcoming of the on site sampling method is its ability to only characterize the water quality at a limited number of sampling points and does not represent the residual chlorine of all other points in the entire dwds zhang et al 2021 therefore residual chlorine may have been too low to maintain the biological safety of water and could thus seriously affect the health of residents li et al 2018 pan et al 2021 this has motivated researchers to establish water quality models instead of using the usual sampling methods and gradually apply an increasing number of dwds abokifa et al 2016b the chlorine decay rates hua et al 2015 chlorine dosages sikder et al 2020 and setting up booster chlorination stations goyal and patel 2017 were treated as a single simulation target in some water quality models which can effectively benefit the operation and management of the dwds additionally multi parameter water quality models have garnered increasing attention globally some common water quality indicators ph value turbidity temperature total phosphor total nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand and the association between chlorine and dbps boccelli et al 2003 metal corrosives such as lead maheshwari et al 2020 and microbial biomass abokifa et al 2016a have been explored in forecast models the water quality models have improved the detection efficiency compared to normal water quality testing methods however some gaps still exist in the field of modeling and representing odors within a dwds the taste and odor t o problem in drinking water is one of the most crucial hotspots of current water quality research and has frequently been complained about in recent years owing to greater demand from residents regarding their drinking water and the dangers of unpleasant odors sun 2015 tap water may be replaced by bottled water in several households if the smell is too pungent however the waterworks should have a greater budget to handle the water that consequently contributes to the economic waste avvedimento et al 2020 the reasons for the peculiar smell of drinking water can be summarized in the following three points 1 chemical substances contained in the water source and odorants secreted by algae zhou et al 2017 2 agents or newly generated substances added during water treatment and 3 the secondary pollution process during the transportation or storage of the dwds most scholars have characterized the first type of odorants released by algae such as geosmin gsm 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib and other earthy and musty substances bu et al 2017 while ignoring the chloric odor directly caused by the disinfectant added in the treatment process the chloric odor generated by chlorine and chloramines is one important factor among the unpleasant odors in drinking water unfortunately to date no systematic assessment of the chloric odor of the entire dwds has been assessed in the literature it has been proven that residual chlorine concentration positively correlates with the chloric odor wang et al 2018 proposed that chloramines were another vital reason resulting in a chloric odor apart from chlorine the process of generation and the form of existence of hypochlorous acid is listed in eqs 1 and 2 the odor threshold of hypochlorous acid is 0 28 mg cl2 l mg l and is usually described as a bleach like odor krasner 1984 shen et al 2003 in the presence of hypochlorous acid and ammonia chloramines can be expressed by eqs 3 to 5 vikesland et al 2001 the formation of chloramines species is generally determined by the ph of water and the ratio of chlorine to ammonia nitrogen cl n ratio liu et al 2021 monochloramine is dominant when the ph value is between 7 and 11 dichloramine gradually becomes abundant when it is lowered to 4 4 7 and trichloramine would become predominant when it is below 4 4 the chloramines are described as having a swimming pool like odor with odor thresholds of 0 65 0 15 and 0 02 mg l respectively implying that they contribute to the chloric odor intensity lee and westerhoff 2009 matsushita et al 2017 monochloramine and dichloramine were considered as the main factors as the ph of drinking water is often around 7 but trichloramine also could exist in the drinking water which could not be ignored in some regions kosaka et al 2010 1 n a c l o h 2 o n a o h h c l o 2 h c l o h c l o 3 n h 3 h c l o n h 2

chloramines and chloric odor can be achieved duirk et al 2005 vikesland et al 2001 establishing the relationship between the chloric odor and the factors impacting the chloric odor intensity can be defined as a type of end to end learning wu et al 2020 a prediction result is obtained from the input to the output ends during the process an error would be produced when comparing it with the real observation in each layer which is propagated backpropagated in the model the representation of each layer is adjusted according to this error until the model converges or the expected effect is achieved the back propagation bp neural network is a species of artificial neural network models hao et al 2018 applied most widely in end to end learning including management science economics and sociology however it has not been employed in forecasting the chloric odor intensity in the water environment industry in this study epanet software maheshwari et al 2018 was integrated with a bp neural network as a systematic multi component prediction approach that could obtain the mathematical relationship between chlorine chloramines and the relative odor degree and consequently obtain the chloric odor intensity at any point in the dwds moreover the initial chlorine dosage and the location and dosage of the secondary chlorination points were optimized based on the economic investment and chloric odor intensity in this study by borg algorithm therefore this study can serve as a guide for smell control and is conducive to balancing the water quality and cost 2 materials and methods

shanghai china all chemicals were at least of analytical grade ultrapure water produced by a milli q apparatus millipore corporation billerica massachusetts usa was used to prepare solutions 2 2 determination experiment of chloric odor intensity the concentrations of residual chlorine and three chloramines were measured with dpd colorimetric method and the detection limit of the method for residual chlorine and chloramines was 0 01 mg l american public health association 2005 more advanced method could be used to detect the presence of residual chlorine and chloramines in the future to obtain more accurate detection values an initial chlorine range of 0 2 2 0 mg l with an interval of 0 2 mg l was respectively dosed in each sampled water and initial cl n ratio was subsequently set to various values in each sampled water to obtain different percentages of chlorine and chloramines a uv visible spectrophotometer dr6000 hach company united states was used to determine the free residual chlorine and chloramines subsequently each 200 ml water sample was collected in a 500 ml erlenmeyer flask and sealed with a plastic wrap the erlenmeyer flask was placed in a 45 c water bath for 10 min after heating the water bath the testers were requested to smell the water samples the testers were required to describe the type and intensity of the odor to guarantee that the odor of the water sample was not volatilized which could influence the accuracy of the experiment the erlenmeyer flask was sealed again and heated in a 45 c water bath for 2 3 min after being smelled by one tester five or seven testers were selected in this experiment to describe the chloric odor flavor profile analysis fpa was used to define the chloric odor levels from 0 to 12 the relationship between eight different fpa degrees and the chloric odor intensity is presented in table s1 in particular the larger the value of the fpa the more pungent was the chlorine odor the fpa results of each water sample were calculated using eq 6 and are listed in table s2 6 f p a i 1 s f i s where fi is the fpa result of the ith tester and s is the number of testers 2 3 application of the bp neural network to simulate the chloric odor the chloric odor was set as the forecast target based on its connection with the parameters chlorine and chloramines which could be speculated by the bp neural network zhang et al 2018 all data input to the bp neural network should be normalized first using eq 7 to be located in 0 1 the sigmoid function was adopted as the activation function in the experimental model 7 y x x m i n x m a x x m i n here y is the normalized result and x xmax and xmin are the origin maximum and minimum input values respectively 2 4 optimization of the chlorine dosage and secondary chlorination points the determination of the secondary chlorination points and chlorine dosage is a multi objective optimization problem which is typically difficult in the field of civil and infrastructure engineering because of its discrete nonlinear and high dimensional search spaces regarding the optimization formulation and implementation a phased evolutionary optimization algorithm was developed and applied in the dwds before and after water source switching during the first step the two objectives of this study are to 1 minimize the average chloric odor intensity and 2 maximize economic benefits reduce the costs on the construction of secondary chlorination points and chlorine dosing cost the decision variables considered are n secondary chlorination points as x l n i k s i l n i j and i 1 n the constraints considered for achieving the optimization objectives are the requirements for chlorine dosage and hydraulic conditions the formulation of the bi objective optimization can be generalized as follows 8 f x f o d f e c subject to secondary chlorine dosage constraints 9 k s m i n k s i k s m a x duplicated points constraints 10 n d u p 0 hydraulic constraints 11 h f d q where lni is the index of the secondary chlorination point i ksi is the chlorine dosage at point i n is the maximum number of secondary chlorination points to be placed within the dwds j is the set of points of candidate secondary chlorination f x is the vector valued objective function fod and fec are the chloric odor intensity at the nodes of dwds and the economic costs respectively ks min and ks max are the minimum required and maximum allowable chlorine dosages respectively at point i ndup is the number of duplicated points identified as secondary chlorination points in one solution h h 1 k s h m t is the vector of nodal pressure q q 1 k s q m t is the vector of node demands m is the number of demand nodes f d q is the nonlinear equation of the hydraulic model namely flow continuity and energy conservation equations for the assessment of hydraulic condition and water quality eqs 8 and 11 were solved using epanet 2 0 the aforementioned bi objective functions are used to evaluate the performance of secondary chlorination points in a given design scheme which are described in detail as follows 12 f o d i 1 m j 1 t o d i t j m t 13 f e c n c 365 24 t k 1 n j 1 t q k t j t j k s i e where o d i t j is the chloric odor intensity for demand node i at time tj q k t j is the flow rate of secondary chlorination k at time tj t is the duration of

point index k 1 2 n j is the time index j 1 2 t t j j δ t is the simulation time and δ t is the time step for water quality analysis in the second process the location of the secondary points remains unchanged the objective of the study is converted into minimizing the average chloric odor intensity while controlling the residual chlorine concentration above 0 05 mg l thus the dosage of initial chlorine and secondary chlorination are optimized the decision variables considered are n secondary chlorination points as y k s i i 1 n ksi is the chorine dosage at the secondary chlorination point lni i 1 n which should be determined in the first process the constraints considered for achieving the optimization objectives are no different from the first step the formulation of the objective optimization can be generalized as follows 14 f y f o d subject to eqs 9 11 and 15 initial chlorine dosage constraints 15 k y m i n k y k y m a x where ky is the chlorine dosage at waterwork y ky min and ky max are the minimum required and maximum allowable chlorine dosages respectively at waterwork y generally the aforementioned bi objective optimization problems need to be solved through multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas various moeas have been widely applied to handle complex real world optimization problems although these algorithms often work well on bi objective optimization problems the advantages of these algorithms can be severely deteriorated with an increase in objective numbers thus a state of the art hyper heuristic algorithm known as borg was introduced to improve the performance of multi objective optimization several scholars have comprehensively compared borg with other moeas in terms of its effectiveness efficiency reliability and scalability they found that borg exhibits superior performance and reliability in handling complex real world high dimensional optimization problems hadka and reed 2013 wang et al 2015 zheng et al 2016 therefore the borg algorithm was applied in this study to solve the bi objective optimization problem borg hadka and reed 2013 is a unified framework consisting of ε dominance ε progress randomized restart and auto adaptive multi operator recombination this method involves a recombination process with the following six operators simulated binary crossover sbx differential evolution de patent centric crossover pcx unimodal normal distribution crossover undx simplex crossover spx and uniform mutation um applying these different search operators can result in a range of offspring distributions to improve the optimization process the principle of borg is illustrated in fig 1 during the application process fig 1 one recombination operator was selected using a self adaptive multi operator feedback mechanism for an operator that requires k parent solutions one of them is randomly and evenly selected from the archive and the other k 1 parent solutions are chosen from the population using tournament selection this is followed by the generation of offspring with the aid of the selected operator subsequently the offspring solutions are evaluated and added to the archive and the population the ε progress and population to archive ratio are key factors in activating a new search process which are regularly checked after a certain number of iterations of the main loop if the restart condition is satisfied the current main loop step is aborted and the restart process is executed by resizing the population this is followed by the resumption of another main loop step and finally the entire process may be terminated after a fixed number of evaluations 3 case studies 3 1 case study description a realistic dwds for city j in china was selected as a case study to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method as a river network the self purification ability of water in city j is relatively poor and the water resources especially high quality ones are in short supply with the implementation of urban rural integration presently city j has built approximately 1304 and 489 km of water supply pipelines above dn100 and dn300 respectively the water supply area has reached 968 km2 covering 10 towns and villages in total serving approximately 1 2 million people to mitigate the lack of high quality water lake q will be regarded as the new water source which has a superior quality in both chemical and biological aspects actually the water treatment processes of the two waterworks in city j and lake q also exist difference biological pretreatment enhanced conventional treatment ozone biological activated carbon treatment pattern is adopted by city j while the coagulation sedimentation filtration disinfection conventional drinking water treatment system is applied in lake q owing to the alteration of the water source the optimization of the initial chlorine was associated with the residual chlorine and chloric odor trichloramine was not detected in drinking water samples including all 60 tests of sampled water from water quality detection points in city j with dpd colorimetric method that may be because of the lack of sensitivity of the detection method concentration of trichloramine below 0 01 mg l had little impact on the current prediction of chloric odor model therefore residual chlorine monochloramine and dichloramine were recognized as the input parameters of the bp neural network however trichloramine should be added as the fourth input parameter to realize the chloric simulation in the dwds in the region where trichloramine is common in the water with higher concentrations in this case study the dwds model comprises two waterworks 2535 nodes i e m 2535 14 pumps 771 valves and 2782 pipe sections the diameter was between 200 and 1400 mm with many loops fig 2 the maximum water age of the dwds in city j is about 3 7 days thus the water quality model dwds has a demand pattern that varies over 96 h i e t 96 h with a hydraulic time step of 1 h and a quality time step of 5 min i e δ t 5 min additionally the original initial chlorine dosage at the five reservoirs was 0 8 mg l according to the current situation in city j the construction cost of the secondary chlorination point was 300 000 rmb yuan and the depreciation life of fixed assets were 5 years thus c was set as 60 000 rmb yuan and the per unit raw material cost e was set as 0 00125 rmb yuan m3 3 2 implementation procedures of the proposed method the implementation procedures of the proposed method are as follows establishing the hydraulic and water quality models for city j epanet 2 0 and epanet msx were used as the hydraulic and water quality simulation tools in this study respectively calibrating model parameters based on historical monitoring data in the present study the evolution algorithm borg was applied to calibrate the corresponding parameters including nodal demands pipe roughness coefficients and decay coefficients of the bulk water and wall the population size of borg was 500 following the parameters used by he et al 2018 and the maximum allowable number of evaluations was 500 000 for this case study the values of the remaining borg parameters are the default selections given in wang et al 2015 in the experiment there were 100 sets of water samples with different concentrations of residual chlorine monochloramine and dichloramine trichloramine should also be considered when it exists the performance of bp neural network is independent of the number of input parameters since mathematical theory has proved that the three layer neural network could realize the mapping between multi parameters input and output with arbitrary precision the fpa method was utilized to judge the chloric odor of the water samples and 80 sets of the water quality parameters including residual chlorine chloramines and chloric odor among the specified data were selected as the training samples for machine learning estimating the chloric odor intensity at the nodes of the dwds based on the calibrated water quality model and machine learning method the bp neural network was applied to build the relationships among the residual chlorine chloramines and chloric odor levels in the sample set obtained by the experiment in step 3 80 of the samples were randomly selected as the training set and the remaining 20 was the validation set the ne and output nodes were set as 3 and 1 respectively the hidden nodes were set as 5 the loop number was 50 000 the cumulative error was 0 000001 and the learning rates were 0 2 and 0 3 eventually by inputting the residual chlorine and chloramines obtained by the calibrated water quality model in step 2 the odor intensity can be obtained based on the established bp model optimization of chlorine dosage and secondary chlorination points in this case study the borg algorithm was used to solve the bi objective optimization problem to minimize the average chloric odor intensity and minimize the economic cost at the nodes of the dwds the parameter values of borg were set in the same way as in step 2 the maximum number of secondary chlorination points n is set as 20 the minimum required and maximum allowable chlorine dosages of waterworks and the secondary chlorination points are set as ky min 0 3 mg l and ky max 0 8 mg l ks min 0 05 mg l and ks max 0 8 mg l respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 residual chlorine and chloramines simulation the difference between the observed and simulated values residual chlorine concentration at 96 h in 16 test sample points calibrated by the borg algorithm optimization method are shown in fig 3 a it can be speculated that the largest difference between the observation and simulation was 0 02 mg l this study chose a 24 h variation process of the residual chlorination simulation situation and actual detection situation at two detection points to further verify the exactness of the water quality model si fig s1 showed that the data frequencies with relative errors greater than 10 at two dection points were 25 and 23 respectively overall the chlorine model built in epanet accurately reflects the actual situation in the dwds and satisfies the accuracy requirements the observed and simulated values of monochloramine and dichloramine at 96 h of 16 test sample points shown in fig 3 b and c differed from 0 12 to 0 03 mg l at most respectively the overall layout of the residual chlorine after dosing with 0 80 mg l of initial chlorine 96 h before water source switching is shown in fig 4 we observed that the low chlorine areas were mainly concentrated at the edge of the city center and the town regions that spread at the end of the dwds in total there were 77 nodes in the dwds with less than 0 05 mg l residual chlorine as indicated by the red points however the reasons for low chlorine concentrations below 0 05 mg l of these two zones were disparate with regard to the former fringe of the city center the explanation for low residual chlorine may be the aging pipe materials which provide regions for chlorine to react with the biofilm along with the corrosion deposits thereby decaying the chlorine more rapidly trinh et al 2020 demonstrated that biofilms formed in high density polyethylene hdpe and polyvinyl chloride pvc pipes played a significant role in the consumption of chlorine zhang and andrews 2012 illustrated that chlorine decay was accelerated by reacting with solid copper corrosion products on the pipes currently there are four types of pipe materials employed in city j including polyethylene pipes around 10 years of use plastic steel pipes around 10 years of use cement mortar lined ductile iron pipes around 10 years of use and unlined cast iron pipes around 30 years of use information provided by city j municipal water authority in particular the pipes are all older than 10 years and tend to accentuate the biofilm and attach many corrosion substances capable of reacting with chlorine the pipe service age is recognized as an important factor affecting the chlorine wall decay constant and steel and cast iron pipes are the most influential thus the proper strategy to solve the aforementioned problem low residual chlorine at the edge of the city center is to update or replace the entirety of the pipelines the low chlorine state in the peripheral zone could mainly be ascribed to the following reasons 1 the long distance between the initial chlorine dose position the waterworks making the consumption of chlorine significantly large along the way 2 the gross water consumption in the village is low thus resulting in slow water flow and considerably long water residence time incapable of maintaining a biologically stable residual chlorine concentration in other words the residents of the village are confronted with a greater risk of drinking substandard water which requires greater attention from the managers and the government the end of the pipes in the northern western northwestern southeastern and southern dwds in the case study belonged to this category in particular the residual chlorine in these nodes was mainly below 0 10 mg l and sometimes less than 0 05 mg l the construction of secondary chlorination points is considered to be feasible to resolve the chlorine deficiency problem in the peripheral area 4 2 identification of the location and dosage of secondary chlorination points after constant modification of the hidden layers loops and learning rates in the bp neural network and training 80 sets of samples the results of chloramines concentrations and chloric odor simulation of the remaining 20 sets of test data are shown in fig 5 the fpa of the analog values ranged from 0 to 8 which covered the possible range that may appear in the dwds moreover the deviation between the predicted and actual measured values was within 0 67 owing to the subjectivity of the odor evaluation it can be considered that this bp neural network model could accurately establish the relationships among the components residual chlorine chloramines and odor allowing us to obtain a reliable fpa grade of chloric odor in the dwds the bi objective optimization solutions by borg algorithm were shown as fig 6 and the circled point was chosen as the operation plan which cost 506 07 million rmb yuan per year while controlling the average chloric odor of dwds at fpa 3 39 the economic goal was in opposition to the esthetic goal when more secondary chlorination points were added to the dwds the cost budget would be increased construction had a greater impact on economic cost than raw material price but less chlorine need to be dosed to maintain the safety of water quality thus the average chloric odor intensity would be decreased the economic investment combined with the average chloric odor value both should be considered and the selected plan was able to achieve both objective functions simultaneously among the pareto optimization sets in this case 8 secondary chlorination points the marked cross shown in fig 4 were suggested as additional supplements of chlorine to the low residual chlorine area the red circled area and the chlorine dosage was 0 5 mg l by borg algorithm these 8 additional positions were primarily located in the area where the chlorine concentrations were approximately 0 40 mg l at 96 h originally regarding the set of chlorine supply points the number of left nodes with residual chlorine less than 0 05 mg l was reduced from 77 to 63 see fig 7 notably the whole peripheral region basically met the lowest residual chlorine requirements only 4 nodes had chlorine values lower than 0 05 mg l and the marked nodes were basically located at the edge of the city center the overall arrangement of the secondary chlorination replenished the chlorine in the peripheral zone however the end of the dwds could not get sufficient chlorine as it was far from the waterworks this measure promoted the peripheral water to achieve a more biologically stable condition which could reduce the occurrence of water pollution incidents consequently it ensured the safety of users in the rural community as they used water with less biomass moreover pipe upgradation was necessitated to mitigate the remaining chlorine problem points recent studies have demonstrated that adding secondary chlorination facilities to the distribution system could be a significant measure to solve the uneven distribution of the chlorine state and avoid the overgrowth of bacteria from chlorine insufficiency to optimize the temporal and spatial distribution of chlorine the number location and dosage of the secondary chlorination points have garnered interest nouiri 2017 proposed a multi objective genetic algorithm to optimize the chlorination design and management in the dwds considering the following three objectives the improvement of chlorination uniformity minimization of the number of chlorine booster stations and the injected chlorine mass ohar and ostfeld 2014 used epanet msx and genetic algorithms as a new methodology for the design placement and operation of the booster chlorination stations in the dwds this guaranteed the presence of sufficient chlorine to destroy undesirable microorganisms while also preventing the t o problems near the injection locations and the excessive dbps at the far network ends overall the effect of optimization in the construction of secondary chlorination points in city j was discussed in this paper which is crucial for setting a guideline of supplement of chlorine for drinking water treatment facilities however the optimized results of the secondary chlorination points location and dosage derived by borg algorithm could make minor adjustment according to the actual site conditions project and other factors in the application 4 3 chloric odor prediction after water source switching after switching the water source to lake q and maintaining the other conditions as before the residual chlorine concentrations at 60 actual detection points is presented in table 1 we found that the residual chlorine concentration at 96 h at the same monitoring position would be higher than employing original water source universally increasing by a maximum of 0 13 mg l additionally the qualified rate of residual chlorine the nodes 0 05 mg l in the end of the dwds increased to 94 3 and the spatial distributions of the residual chlorine were almost consistent with those when the initial chlorine dosage was still set to 0 80 mg l see as si fig s2 the chloric odor levels at the 60 nodes are shown in fig 8 and presented in table s3 the fpa results were similar with the variation of the residual chlorine concentrations and both have an approximate promotion in other words when switching to a superior water source the residual chlorine and chloric odor intensity should both be considered as critical water quality parameters for management in general the chloric odor intensity in majority of the noticed nodes would increase by 0 01 1 39 except for a few points that remained at fpa 0 furthermore we found that the points near the water plants were more prone to greater increase the main reasons contributing to this situation could be the obvious diversities between the two water sources and the decay rate of the residual chlorine decreased after switching the water source by comparing the water quality parameters of city j and lake q the detection indicators of the three different sampling times are presented in table 2 a comprehensive analysis can be proposed as follows 1 the nutritional levels of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus were relatively close but city j had higher nitrogen concentrations due to the death and decay of plants which occurred frequently in winter subsequently the nitrogen reacts with sodium hypochlorite converting the chlorine to chloramines in the water the high concentration of nitrogen had accelerated the chlorine decay to a certain extent 2 the total organic carbon buxton et al 1988 of lake q was much smaller than that in city j and even did not achieve half of the latter some studies have demonstrated that toc is a key factor influencing the decay rate of residual chlorine there is a strong positive correlation between the toc concentration and residual chlorine decay rate 3 lake q had a lower conductivity sulfate chloride alkalinity and hardness in other words lake q is both biologically and chemically more stable and switching the water source to the lake q project would fundamentally solve the problem of poor water source quality as the chlorine decay of water in lake q was low chlorine dosage should be lowered simultaneously otherwise the high chlorine and odor intensity would result in complex dbps and pungent smells that could threaten the health of users and are more likely to arouse complaints 4 4 initial chlorine dosage optimization it is important to control the chlorine dosage to a suitable value in the dwds on one hand dosing too much chlorine would lead to unnecessary economic waste produce a series of complicated dbps and also cause a pungent smell which would adversely impact users conversely if an adequate chlorine dosage is not provided it is difficult to guarantee the microbial stability of drinking water because of the weak disinfectant function the chlorine dosage is particularly worth exploring and discussing when the water source conditions have changed as mentioned above when switching to a more superior water source such as lake q the decay rate of chlorine would decrease and the residual chlorine and chloric odor would increase to a much larger value if the initial chlorine dosage was not promptly altered situations of low chlorine concentration nodes and the chloric odor intensity in the dwds under different chlorine dosages after the water source switches to lake q are listed in table 3 when the original chlorine dosage plan was retained initial chlorine dosage and secondary chlorination point dosage of 0 8 and 0 5 mg l respectively only 4 nodes could not achieve residual chlorine values of 0 05 mg l but the fpa of the chloric odor was too high and only 126 nodes were below fpa 3 the optimization model results had an initial chlorine dosage of 0 41 mg l and set the secondary chlorination dosage as 0 32 mg l through the borg algorithm considering the convenience of the actual operation the recommended initial and secondary dosages were adjusted to 0 4 and 0 3 mg l respectively at this time the chloric odor distribution shown as fig 9 showed that 2009 nodes were between fpa 0 3 and the chloric odor in the region near the waterworks was approximately at fpa 3 4 which was relatively high but still acceptable conversely there were 11 and 61 nodes with chlorine concentrations lower than 0 05 mg l in the peripheral area and city edge respectively this proved that the biological safety at the end of the dwds was within a stable stage moreover the chlorine distribution at 96 h of the dwds when the initial chlorine dosages were set to 0 7 0 6 0 5 0 4 and 0 3 mg l are respectively shown in si figs s3 s7 notably residual chlorine presents a clear downward trend when the chlorine dosage decreases the fpa of all nodes in the dwds was less than 3 when the chlorine dosage was continually altered to 0 3 mg l however the number of nodes with less than 0 05 mg l residual chlorine in the peripheral area increased to 22 which greatly increased the risk of contamination in other words an initial chlorine dosage of 0 30 mg l was inappropriate in the case study to summarize based on the results of the residual chlorine distribution and chloric odor intensity of the different working conditions the recommended initial chlorine and secondary chlorination point dosages after water source switching were 0 40 and 0 30 mg l respectively 5 conclusions the hydraulic and water quality model in epanet realized the simulation of the residual chlorine and chloramines in the dwds in city j moreover the prediction results were calibrated to real time detection values using the borg evolution algorithm the largest differences between the observation and simulation were 0 02 0 12 and 0 03 mg l for chlorine monochloramine and dichloramine respectively the chloric odor simulation at the nodes of dwds was estimated based on the calibrated water quality model and machine learning method additionally the deviation between the predicted and the actual fpa was within 0 67 which was optimal for application to the entire dwds to enhance the biological stability of the dwds in city j 8 secondary chlorination points were set and the sum of nodes with less than 0 05 mg l residual chlorine was reduced by 13 nodes which were mainly located at the end of the dwds when switching to a superior water source lake q both chlorine and odor intensity at the 60 detection points would have increased the chlorine concentration and fpa would have increased by 0 13 mg l and 1 39 at most respectively mainly because high quality water had a low residual chlorine decay rate furthermore the initial chlorine and secondary chlorination dosages were optimized to 0 40 and 0 30 mg l respectively by the borg algorithm when 90 1 nodes in the peripheral area had more than 0 05 mg l residual chlorine and 79 nodes in the dwds had a chloric odor below fpa 3 it is worth noting that trichloramine was not detected in our research which may be caused by the limitation of the detection method but the bp neural network we established is feasible to considering trichloramine as a new input variable to predict the chloric odor further research is required in the future to investigate a thorough chlorine dosage optimization plan simultaneously considering the dbps chloric odor and biosecurity declaration of competing interest none

introduction dissolved natural organic matter dom occurs in all surface waters where it originates from the decomposition and leaching of vegetation and in situ primary productivity and undergoes continuous biotic and abiotic processing aiken 2014 moran et al 2016 moran et al 1991 natural waters consequently contain thousands of different dom molecules with varying physicochemical characteristics removing dom is a major objective of drinking water treatment since too much dom protects pathogens causes aesthetic issues at the tap such as unpleasant colour taste and odour and leads to harmful by products being formed during disinfection leenheer and croué 2003 leenheer et al 2001 additionally dom undermines treatment performance and increases costs by increasing coagulant and oxidant demand and fouling membranes kennedy et al 2005 since various organic matter fractions respond differently to physical and chemical treatment croué et al 1993 edzwald 1993 moona et al 2021 dom character should directly inform the selection and operation of best available treatment options an important step toward optimising drinking water treatment is to predict the performance of specific treatment barriers i e doc removal efficiency from the chemical composition of the incoming raw water waters with similar chemical compositions are expected to respond similarly to a given treatment process for example specific uv254 absorption relative to doc concentration suva in water samples is directly proportional to percent aromaticity measured by c13 nmr weishaar et al 2003 suva strongly predicts coagulation performance across diverse water resources archer and singer 2006 edwards 1997 and also predicts other parameters of interest including disinfection byproduct formation potential edzwald et al 1985 hua et al 2015 and potential for membrane fouling amy 2008 a disadvantage of suva is that to measure it according to standard us epa method 415 3 requires two different instruments i e a uv spectrophotometer and a toc analyzer potter and wimsatt 2005 toc analyzers are rare at treatment plants due to expense and operational challenges that make them susceptible to a range of analytical interferences mopper and qian 2006 additionally commercial toc analyses for drinking water are expensive relative to other monitoring parameters and often have relatively high detection limits 1 mg l uv spectrophotometers also vary greatly in sensitivity mopper and qian 2006 and the overall result is that suva measured at different labs can vary significantly even under carefully controlled conditions potter and wimsatt 2005 this makes it difficult for water utilities to monitor changes in suva especially when concentrations of doc and or cdom are low finally while useful for predicting a range of treatment variables water treatment processes like oxidation van geluwe et al 2011 and adsorption newcombe et al 2002 are not well predicted by suva due to their dependence on low molecular weight dom fractions that are invisible to uv spectrophotometers analysis by liquid chromotography with organic carbon detection lc ocd can provide both a more accurate suva quantification and can distinguish and quantify several non absorbing low molecular weight dom fractions but is too costly for routine monitoring consequently there is a high value in identifying affordable single instrument approaches to measuring water aromaticity and tracking low molecular weight dom fractions in drinking water fluorescence spectroscopy is increasingly used to study water treatment due to high sensitivity and affordability coupled with two directional wavelength scanning capabilities that inform about water character as well as concentration ahmad and reynolds 1999 aiken 2014 bhattacharya and osburn 2020 despite accounting for a small fraction of the total dissolved carbon pool in aquatic samples fluorescent dom tracks major changes in dom molecular composition kellerman et al 2015 stubbins et al 2014 wünsch et al 2018a raw fluorescence measurements capture the sum of fluorescence emitted at each excitation and emission wavelength by all dissolved chemicals present thus combining signals from many different fluorophores accordingly fluorescence spectroscopy is frequently coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac to mathematically isolate and quantify independently varying dom fractions bro 1997 murphy et al 2014a stedmon and markager 2005b a number of prior studies have used parafac to analyse fluorescence datasets in the context of water treatment shutova and colleagues shutova et al 2014 reported linear correlations between between ratios of humic like parafac components vs percent doc removal in treatments involving coagulation however in that study as in many others e g murphy et al 2011 vines and terry 2020 parafac models of drinking water resources were site specific with only modest statistical similarities obtained when comparing models from different treatment plants this reflects a serious limitation of the parafac approach namely that selecting a different model tends to produce systematically different fluorescence intensities and ratios this has greatly limited the generality of conclusions about dom behaviour and treatability drawn from parafac analyses ishii and boyer 2012 there are two main prerequisites for defining useful global models that predict water treatability from fluorescence measurements the first is that the spectral properties of underlying fluorophore groups are highly similar between geographically diverse water resources fortunately although a diverse array of parafac components appear in published literature wünsch et al 2019 there are strong indications that a handful of well described parafac components of apparently ubiquitous distribution are responsible for most observed steady state fluorescence kowalczuk et al 2009 murphy et al 2018 wünsch et al 2019 several of these have been shown to respond similarly to similar environmental stressors ishii and boyer 2012 murphy et al 2018 wünsch et al 2017 suggesting that it may be possible to use parafac components to predict certain aspects of water chemistry across aquatic ecosystems a second requirement is that at least some of these parafac components track chemical characteristics with a deciding influence upon water treatability whether directly or indirectly aromaticity often measured as suva is a key property for predicting treatability in conventional water treatment as already described previously a fluorescence index fix that tracks the ratio between emissions at a specific pair of wavelengths in the visible range was shown to correlate inversely to both aromaticity and suva mcknight et al 2001 weishaar et al 2003 other fluorescence indicies that are investigated frequently in the context of drinking water treatability include the freshness or biological index bix and the humification index hix which attempt to track the ratio of labile to recalcitrant fractions ohno 2002 parlanti et al 2000 fluorescence indices have the advantage that they are simple to obtain and can indicate environmentally relevant variations in water quality and reactivity bhattacharya and osburn 2020 korak et al 2015 however since they are derived from total fluorescence they are susceptible to uncalibrated spectral interferences e g from contaminants it therefore seems likely that greater sensitivity for detecting environmentally relevant changes in dom composition might be achievable from tracking ratios between ubiquitous parafac components this study assessed the utility of fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parafac for predicting surface water aromaticity and treatability the aim was to first identify the spectral properties of fluorophore groups common to geographically diverse drinking water samples and second to identify global relationships between fluorescence aromaticity and molecular composition lc ocd fractions in order to predict doc removal in water samples subject to a standard set of drinking water treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling campaigns 2 1 1 global campaign filtered 0 45 µm water samples n 190 were collected from water resources and treatment plants in europe france sweden spain italy n 148 usa n 19 asia china n 6 and africa cameroon n 3 table s1 samples were collected in acid cleaned and combusted amber glass bottles when possible though some were collected in sample washed hdpe bottles to prevent breakage during international shipping each sample represented a single whole water grab sample collected at a particular location on a particular day samples from water resources were collected from the surface of rivers or lakes or the intakes of treatment plants sampled treatment plants employed a diverse range of treatments ranging from conventional treatment to treatments involving membrane filtration nanofiltration reverse osmosis adsorption onto activated carbon gac pac and advanced oxidation ozone and samples were collected from various stages in each treatment process samples were air shipped at 4 c to paris within 48 h of sampling for fluorescence absorbance and doc analysis at suez research laboratories aliquots from a subset of samples n 63 were additionally shipped in small batches from paris to karlsruhe germany for analysis by lc ocd overall the time elapsed between sampling and measurement ranged from 1 7 days for spectroscopic and doc analyses and 5 10 days for lc ocd analyses the only exceptions were the samples from china which were analysed for lc ocd at a local university laboratory 2 1 2 local campaign unfiltered 20 l water samples natural challenge samples were collected in clean hdpe drums from five french rivers table 1 at the intakes to water treatment plants each sample n 5 was shipped overnight to the suez laboratory where it was subdivided and used in an experiment consisting of nine standard treatment tests each test measured the changes in dom quantity and character resulting from one type of treatment as detailed in section 2 4 below challenge samples from the local campaigns were analysed using absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy and doc analysis aliquots from all samples arising from the bretagne challenge tests were additionally shipped to germany for lc ocd analysis 2 1 3 synthetic nom samples synthetic challenge samples were prepared by combining three natural dom isolates reference materials from the international humic substances society with various mineral substances to create a suite n 20 of samples representing properties that are commonly encountered in raw drinking surface water tables s2 and s3 the three dom isolates were suwannee river srnom nordic reservoir and mississippi river dissolved at concentrations representative of average surface water resources 3 mgl 1 for each isolate the mineral background was adjusted using cacl2 to simulate hardness nahco3 to simulate alkalinity and kaolinite added to simulate turbidity aliquots from all samples arising from the srnom 100 mgl 1 caco3 challenge experiment were shipped to germany for lc ocd analysis 2 2 analytical methods doc analysis was performed in the suez lab using a benchtop analyzer aurora 1030w oi instruments that uses

1000 g mol 1 lc ocd analysis also measures doc concentration and suva total uv absorbance total doc 2 3 statistical methods parallel factor analysis was used to mathematically decompose the global fluorescence eem dataset according to well established methodologies bro 1997 parafac identifies the unique underlying spectra of a fixed number of independent components that sum to reproduce the measured eems with least error and determines the relative concentrations fmax for each component modelling was implemented using the dreem toolbox in matlab murphy et al 2013 extensive modelling iterations confirmed that a nine component model provided the best fit to the dataset however only post membrane samples from a pilot plant contained the ninth component and this component had spectral properties indicating a whitening agent section 3 3 after excluding outlier samples affected by whitening agents only eight components remained in the model the 8 component model was validated both by split half analysis s2t1 and by separately modelling short wavelength protein like and longer wavelength humic like regions of each eem and fusing the resulting spectra after the model was finalized the fluorescence eems from challenge samples and outliers were projected on the model producing fmax for every sample in the study fmax ratios were determined by dividing fmax for one parafac component by fmax for another regression equations relating fmax ratios with other measurements were determined in matlab 2020a using either a standard linear model for small sample sizes n 5 or a robust linear model determined by iteratively reweighted least squares regression n 10 holland and welsch 1977 to determine prediction errors rmsep for regression analyses regression models were tested on a prediction dataset consisting of randomly selected samples that had not been used to develop the regression model in the case of regressions involving parafac components the prediction dataset consisted of the five challenge samples together with 19 other samples that were collected after the model had been finalized for these samples parafac scores were determined by projecting the eems on the existing parafac model then regression fits were determined by projecting those scores on the existing regression equations in the case of fluorescence ratios the prediction samples were selected randomly by algorithm then projected on the regression equation derived from the remaining samples 2 4 treatability experiments the natural and synthetic challenge samples were submitted to nine different treatments at bench scale table 2 first samples were equilibrated with lab atmosphere and temperature then divided into subsamples that were individually submitted to one test coagulation enhanced coagulation powdered activated carbon pac ion exchange iex and chlorination were each tested individually ozone o3 was tested individually and in combination with coagulation iex and pac these tests were completed using a jar test set up with 1l cylindrical beakers ozone was tested using a specially designed container allowing for gas injection through a septum the contact times and chemical doses corresponded to conventionally applied operational conditions for lab scale simulation of surface water treatment plants ferric chloride coagulant sa super powder activated carbon and amberlite ira458cl ion exchange resin were selected due to their specific capacity for organic matter removal the same doses were administered to each synthetic and natural water sample since the synthetic samples each had similar doc concentrations they each received similar effective doses making removal a function of only dom source and mineral matrix doc concentrations in the natural water samples varied between 2 5 5 7 mgl 1 making removal a function of both dom source and effective dose two natural samples had nearly identical doc concentrations sarthe loire and received similar effective doses 3 results and discussion 3 1 fluorescence composition fig 1 depicts the spectral properties of all nine parafac components identified in the global eem database and table 3

models raw spectral data for the parafac components in this study will be made available upon publication in openfluor suez 9c five identified components hi hii hiii hiv wi each had emission maxima at wavelengths longer than 400 nm as is characteristic for fluorescence derived from humic and fulvic like organic matter all have been identified previously and recent studies highlight their apparently ubiquitous distribution table 3 three published parafac models of drinking water samples are particularly strongly congruent a 5 component model of swedish river water kungalv 5 moona et al 2021 is practically a perfect match for five components in the current model fig s1 additionally five of six parafac components in the sab6 model of seawater from the south atlantic bight kowalczuk et al 2009 are very highly congruent correlation coefficients exceeding 0 97 when comparing excitation or emission spectra finally three components in drinking water models from australia and sweden model d and dw sweden gavle respectively are similarly highly congruent heibati et al 2017 shutova et al 2014 component hi coincides with the fulvic like c peak position coble et al 1990 with spectrally similar components common to virtually all parafac models of dom fluorescence table 3 in samples from diverse freshwater systems hi is typically the first or second most important abundant component in the model accounting for a large proportion of total variability hi tends to covary with hii in surveys from river to sea with the latter being associated with higher aromaticity and greater susceptibility to flocculation processes in natural systems and water treatment kothawala et al 2014 yamashita et al 2010 in parafac models with only three or four components hi and hii are often combined indicating stable relative abundances across many datasets wünsch et al 2019 however hii has more humic character and represents are more aromatic and higher molecular weight fraction than hi cuss and guéguen 2015 component hiii is reported to represent soluble microbial products other than proteins wells et al 2022 and is typically abundant in wastewater dom and at agriculturally impacted and eutrophic sites stedmon and markager 2005a yamashita et al 2010 its emission peak overlaps with the position of the microbial m peak coble 1996 stedmon and markager 2005b wünsch et al 2019 although m also captures emission wavelengths associated with hi and hiv although produced by microbial activity hiii is itself resistant to biological degradation ishii and boyer 2012 moona et al 2021 and tends to accumulate in sediments krasner et al 1996 hiii is additionally resistant to coagulation flocculation kothawala et al 2014 and has been implicated in irreversible membrane fouling ly et al 2018 component hiv has a broad peak with slightly longer emission maximum than hiii and is only typically found in models having four or more humic like components sometimes with a spectral shape indicating a combination of protein like and humic like fractions kowalczuk et al 2010 murphy et al 2018 wells et al 2022 unlike hiii hiv is readily biodegraded cohen et al 2014 moona et al 2021 the large spectral overlap between hiii and hiv despite different sources and reactivities accounts for sometimes contradictory reports regarding the behaviour of components responsible for peak m fluorescence components pi and pii match protein like fluorescence similar to pure tryptophan pi and pure tyrosine pii pi emits at slightly longer wavelengths than is usually observed for pure tryptophan λem 330 350 and may represent multiple unresolved protein like fluorophores signals similar to piii have been reported from chinese surface waters yang et al 2019 huang et al 2022 and from petroleum derived fluorescence zito et al 2019 although this does not preclude the possibility of a biological origin only two components identified in this study are previously unreported from drinking water resources one of these wi is a near perfect spectral match for a component identified previously as pulp mill effluent cawley et al 2012 it was abundant only in the challenge sample from river nancy fig s2 where several pulp mills are located upstream of the sampling location the other wii matches a spectrum isolated from wastewater cohen et al 2014 and has a multi peaked emission spectrum characteristic of optical brighteners that are used widely in textile and paper industries fig s1 in this study wii was the ninth component and observed only in some samples of membrane permeates and not in any challenge test samples the isolation of these components from a diverse drinking water dataset highlights the sensitivity of fluorescence spectroscopy in combination with parafac for detecting the potential organic contamination of drinking water samples 3 2 surface water aromaticity suva in the dataset ranged between 1 0 and 5 5 lmg 1m 1 and thus spanned a range from low to very high aromaticity fig 2 shows correlations between established and newly derived predictors of surface water aromaticity in the first two subplots raw water samples accounted for most measurements in the upper right portion of each subplot suva 1 7 5 5 mean 3 1 0 8 lmg 1m 1 and partially or fully treated water samples accounted for the lower left portion suva 1 0 3 7 mean 1 8 0 6 lmg 1m 1 however a single linear regression line fits all samples equally well with no indication that treatment altered the underlying relationship between suva and fluorescence a better predictor of suva discovered in this study was the ratio between fmax for the longest emitting parafac component hii λem 520 nm versus the shortest emitting component within the humic region hiii λem 404 nm hereafter referred to hii hiii or parix standing for parafac index note that hiii fluorescence overlaps spectrally with component hiv λem 420 nm although these two signals have distinct sources and behave differently during water treatment see further below in fig 2 circular markers indicate the calibration dataset i e 166 samples from cameroon china france italy and usa that were included when building the parafac model of which 53 had matching lc ocd measurements red stars indicate the prediction dataset consisting of samples that were excluded from parafac modelling the prediction dataset consists of 24 samples from spain usa and france including the five natural challenge samples of which 10 samples had lc ocd measurements for prediction samples parafac scores were estimated by projecting the sample eems on the model with the one exception described below no data points were omitted from any graph so the depicted correlations are robust across continents and ecosystems with visible outliers that show the range of departure to be expected due to combined sampling measurement and modelling errors the single exception was the hix subplot where six extreme outliers from france and china were removed for visual clarity hix in the range of 0 15 0 6 and parix below 0 5 fig 2a correlates parix with suva measurements made according to the traditional usepa method and by lc ocd a much stronger linear correlation is seen with the lc ocd dataset than with the traditional suva dataset indicating that much of the scatter among grey points in fig 2a is attributable to measurement error in the traditional suva dataset for this reason and because it is typical to favour the lc ocd dataset in cases of disagreement hutchins et al 2017 the lc ocd dataset was used to derive equations to predict suva from fluorescence fig 2a b and table 4 show that suva in the calibration dataset could be estimated with good accuracy by simply multiplying parix by a constant equal to four rmsec 0 64 lmg 1m 1 this applied to surface water samples in various stages of water treatment and was the case even for the prediction dataset i e when this ratio was estimated by projecting new eems upon the pre existing parafac model rmsep 0 55 lmg 1m 1 note that the magnitude of the constant in a regression equation involving parafac components depends on their spectral ranges and shapes thus this constant may vary between datasets if fitted with slightly different parafac components conversely a general result e g a linear relationship between suva and the ratio of components representing hii and hiii would be expected to hold for two different parafac models it is relevant to compare the predictive power of parix with the predictive power of fix and other well established fluorescence indices fig 2c d shows that fix is non linearly correlated to suva and parix which mirrors early observations of nonlinearity between fix and aromaticity when measured by nmr mcknight et al 2001 other indices that primarily track the ratio between tryptophan like and humic like fluorescence freshness index or bix and hix ohno 2002 parlanti et al 2000 also show some non linearity plus significant scatter when correlated with parix fig 2c e f table 4 lists robust regression equations and fit statistics for predicting suva from fluorescence ratios and parix since these relationships were developed from diverse raw and treated surface waters from three continents they may hold widely for freshwaters in other geographical locations except for scaling factors that will apply to parix estimated using different parafac models overall the established indices each had weaker correlations and lower accuracy for predicting suva compared to parix table 4 furthermore parix was only marginally worse at predicting suva measured by lc ocd than was suva measured according to the standard method table 4 this is presumably due the higher measurement precision of fluorescence measurements compared to absorbance and doc measurements 3 3 treatability fig 3 compares treatment efficiencies determined in bench scale experiments on natural and synthetic challenge samples treatment efficiencies are shown as percent removals of bulk dom doc its total chromophoric fraction cdom and its total fluorescent fraction fdom differences in treatment efficiencies between the synthetic samples were negligible even when deliberately varying their background mineral content thus fig 3 shows average removals for the complete set of trials performed with each isolate fig 3 shows several expected trends including much better removal of cdom than doc and slightly better removal of fdom than cdom exceptions included iex and pac which had similar removal efficiencies for doc as for cdom the isolates showed little variation in removal efficiencies when subjected to a particular treatment whereas the natural samples showed a wider range consistent with their variable dom characters removal efficiencies for the isolates generally tracked the highest removal efficiencies measured for natural samples i e similar to the bretagne sample in treatments involving coagulation and similar to the seine sample in treatments involving pac and ozonation biopolymers were largely excluded in the process of extracting dom isolates table s4 and this may have resulted in water that is relatively easy to treat by a wide range of processes applied on its own ozonation did not significantly remove doc from river samples this is consistent with results from prior studies demonstrating that larger molecular weight fractions humics and biopolymers are not removed by ozonation so much as converted to lower molecular weight fractions sarathy and mohseni 2007 additionally pre ozonation did not improve doc removal when followed by pac iex or coagulation but did improve the removal of cdom and fdom particularly for the seine sample this does not seem to reflect a variation in ozone dose since both seine and bretagne samples had a similar doc concentration but for bretagne only pre ozonation had little effect doc removal by conventional coagulation was high especially among samples with high suva bretagne nancy as has been reported in many previous studies archer and singer 2006 edwards 1997 the performance of pac and iex for removing doc was rather similar across all natural and synthetic samples 35 5 6 and 3 respectively suggesting that all these had similar sized adsorbable around 27 45 and charged 31 40 fractions pac removed slightly greater proportions of chromophoric and fluorescent material than did iex 43 and 56 compared to 38 and 42 fig 4 compares the average performance of each treatment barrier when removing fluorescent dom fractions from natural and synthetic waters consistent with earlier results sections 3 1 and 3 2 performance on synthetic challenge samples was always better than or equal to performance on the natural samples however comparing natural and synthetic samples each fraction s relative treatability by different treatment barriers was strikingly similar overall humic like components hi hii hiv and wi were well removed by coagulation but hiii was removed relatively poorly published reports on the behaviour of components like hiii are often contradictory because many parafac models have hiii and hi combined in a single component although in models where they are separated the two vary independently chen et al 2010 ishii and boyer 2012 palma et al 2021 this is probably the reason why hiii is sometimes described as being of terrestrial allochthonous origin and sometimes as microbially derived autochthonous in this study the only treatments that effectively removed hiii involved ozonation similarly protein like components pi and pii were always difficult to treat the low abundance of piii precluded studying its removal efficiency pac or ozone in combination with other barriers were most effective at removing protein like fluorescence 3 4 predicting treatability from fdom ratios fig 5 shows treatability results for the five french rivers since there were nine different treatments to apply only a small number of different raw waters could be tested however suva in these samples spanned most of the normal range observed in freshwater systems approx 1 6 6 kellerman 2015 massicotte et al 2017 weishaar et al 2003 and in total fig 5 shows data from 40 separate pilot tests treatability assessed as percent doc removal was generally well predicted from the fluorescence composition of raw river when represented as ratios between hiii and either hii pi or pii especially since parix was highly correlated with suva it was also an excellent predictor of water treatability by any process in which aromaticity plays a deciding role especially coagulation and ozonation and combinations thereof in contrast there was typically no correlation between initial doc concentration and doc removal which indicates that differences in effective dose was not a major factor determining treatability in these experiments this is seen by the seine and bretagne samples occupying the extremes of most graphs despite these samples having similar initial doc concentration there were two treatments for which doc removal was uncorrelated with fluorescence composition but was somewhat correlated with initial doc concentration these were enhanced coagulation r2 0 72 and ozonation combined with ion exchange r2 0 47 fig 5 shows that high parix resulted in strong coagulation and ozonation performance while low parix resulted in better performance by ion exchange since lc ocd analysis confirmed that low parix indicated of a higher proportion of lmw molecules see below water with lower parix might be expected to adsorb more strongly onto activated carbon shimabuku et al 2017 however this was not observed for the tested river waters instead for pac treatability was strongly correlated to pi hiii and uncorrelated to parix previous work indicates that adsorption onto activated carbon involves a complex interplay of factors related to molecular size polarity and aromaticity as well as the number and size of available adsorption sites thus can vary over time and according to the degree of saturation of the carbon substrate lee and hur 2016 moona et al 2018 this leads to apparently contradictory results whereby adsorption may be favoured by either high aromaticity or low molecular size depending on substate properties and water chemistry in this study the relationship between pi hiii and doc removal by pac indicates a competition for adsorption sites within the lower molecular weight fraction with hiii excluding small amino acids and non fluorescent molecules from pac adsorption sites 3 5 fluorescence surrogates of lc ocd fractions correlations between fluorescence and lc ocd measurements were explored after first normalising lc ocd concentrations to humic substance hs concentration and normalising fluorescence parameters to hii intensity this avoids apparently strong correlations driven by concentration artefacts i e higher dom concentrations tended to produce higher signals for both fluorescence and lc ocd parameters additionally eight samples with hs concentration below 600 μg l were deleted due to low signal to noise leaving 60 samples in the dataset the aromaticity index was strongly correlated to nominal molecular weight as would be expected from its relationship with suva fig 6 the inverse of parix was strongly positively correlated to hs normalised concentrations of building blocks the regression equation goes through the origin bb hs 0 19 parix rmse 0 073 r2 0 86 indicating a parsimonious model with good predictive capacity hiv hii was also positively correlated to normalised building block concentrations bb hs 0 20 hiv hii rmse 0 144 r2 0 73 the building block fraction in lc ocd analysis is attributed to weathering and oxidation products of humic substances huber 2011 this aligns with interpretation that hiii is due to aquagenic refractory organic matter with relatively high n c ratio whereas hiv represents labile degradation products including photochemically produced dom murphy et al 2018 the building block fraction is of lower molecular weight than other humic substances and experiments have shown it to be poorly removed by coagulation flocculation huber et al 2011 which is consistent with the treatability tests fig 5 several weaker correlations were seen between hii normalised fluorescence intensities and hs normalised concentrations of lmw neutrals the inverse of parix was moderately correlated lmwn hs 0 04 0 14 parix r2 0 67 rmse 0 091 as was pi hiii lmwn hs 0 16 0 07 pi hii r2 0 63 rmse 0 080 tryptophan like pii was only weakly correlated with lmw neutrals r2 0 5 due to considerable scatter positive correlations with tyrosine like and tryptophan like fluorescence are expected since amino acids belong to the lmw neutral fraction huber 2011 however the correlation with hiii may be indirect rather than causal i e a result of degradation processes tending to produce both amino acids and building blocks at the same time there were no correlations observed between any fluorescence component and either biopolymers or lmw acids an earlier study of drinking water treatment reported a link between biopolymer concentrations and protein like fluorescence baghoth et al 2011 however in that analysis the lc ocd measurements were not normalised to doc which is needed to account for bulk doc removal between treatment steps and hence nearly all investigated correlations were highly statistically significant hutchins and co workers hutchins et al 2017 reported that tryptophan like fluorescence and biopolymers covaried along a stream water continuum after first normalising tryptophan like fluorescence to total fluorescence and biopolymers to doc concentration although they did not draw attention to additional correlations their principal components analysis additionally indicated the existence of correlations that closely match this study i e between components similar to hiii and hi and both the building block and lmw neutral fractions these relationships help to explain the differences in treatability observed for the seine and bretagne challenge samples despite similar initial doc the seine sample was most susceptible to pac treatment whereas the bretagne sample was most susceptible to coagulation fig 5 in their parafac decompositions fig s3 both were dominated by component hi however the seine sample had higher pi hii and pii hii in addition to lower parix and pii hiii 1 3 0 3 0 5 and 0 15 respectively indicating low susceptibility to coagulation due to a high proportion of lmw neutrals and building blocks but only moderate susceptibility to pac adsorption due to relatively high hiii compared to pii in contrast the bretagne sample had lower pi hii and pii hii and higher parix and pii hiii 0 6 0 15 1 4 and 0 2 respectively indicating high aromaticity and susceptibility to both coagulation and pac but less susceptibility to ion exchange 3 6 the molecular basis of parix recent studies have attempted to deduce the molecular origin of dom fluorescence by linking fluorescence spectroscopy with ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry the usual approach is to obtain a collection of samples subsampled and measured by each of the two analytical techniques and search for post hoc correlations between the two datasets herzsprung et al 2012 although the specific molecular structures responsible for specific fluorescence components can t be identified this way this approach has been used many times to indicate the relative proportions of carbon hydrogen and oxygen in the ionizable molecular formulas that covary with parafac components in two prior studies that both identified components similar to hii and hiii and mapped post hoc correlations in van krevlan space each was associated with a broad range of molecular formulae properties with no apparent differences between the two kellerman et al 2015 wünsch et al 2018a however wünsch and colleagues also tested a different approach whereby the fluorescence and mass spectrometry datasets were simultaneously decomposed using a coupled tensor factorization model in that analysis hii and hiii mapped in distinct regions of van krevlen space with hiii h c 1 2 1 4 o c 0 5 0 6 more saturated and less aromatic than hii h c 0 9 1 3 o c 0 6 which is consistent with the interpretation of parix in this study the same analysis indicated that hi encompassed nearly the full range of molecular formulae correlated with hiii as well as additional formulae of more aliphatic character this is consistent with fix and parix each representing the ratio between a condensed aromatic humic fraction compared to a relatively aliphatic humic fraction thus for fix the aliphatic fraction is hi while for parix the aliphatic fraction is hiii 3 7 applications in water treatment fluorescence ratios will be useful for monitoring doc removal in water treatment so long as they sensitively track small changes in water quality this study builds upon earlier studies indicating that a large number of treatment options cause measurable changes in fluorescence ratios e g fig 3 by demonstrating that some changes are predictable in size and direction across diverse surface waters biological filters are a widely used treatment option that was not tested in this study but earlier studies offer insights that can be used as the basis of predictions biodegradation predominantly removes hydrophilic dom so is generally associated with an increase in suva consistent with the relative enrichment of aliphatic carbon fractions hansen et al 2016 moran et al 2000 a recent study showed that biodegradation efficiently removed hiv and pii but not hi hii or hiii moona et al 2021 this explains why fix for surface water samples is relatively unchanged by biodegradation fellman et al 2008 hansen et al 2016 and suggests that the same will be true of parix parix and suva appear to have rather similar capacities for predicting drinking water treatability but parix has the advantage of being measurable on a single affordable instrument with high precision which is especially useful when doc concentrations are low and difficult to accurately quantify as with all optical indices there will be limits to usefulness of parix for tracking changes in water composition or predicting reactivity and treatability hansen et al 2016 helms et al 2008 korak et al 2014 korak et al 2015 weishaar et al 2003 parix is likely to overestimate suva and susceptibility to coagulation in samples with relatively low aromaticity if this was caused by the production of small dom fractions that fluoresce at wavelengths shorter than 400 nm or not at all and that were produced more efficiently than hiii conversely parix will underestimate suva in samples with relatively high aromaticity if this was due to the efficient removal of lmw fractions not covarying with hiii ratios involving hiv or protein like components are likely to be better predictors of bioavailable doc than parix fellman et al 2008 moona et al 2021 despite apparently widespread relevance for predicting the composition of surface waters at varying stages of treatment parix has not been tested for other sample types e g groundwater wastewater and seawater in iron rich lakes light absorption by iron causes over estimated suva values but would likely have the opposite effect on parix due to greater quenching of long wavelength fluorescence poulin et al 2014 while in wastewaters dyes and other fluorescent contaminants often are present carstea 2012 cohen et al 2014 goffin et al 2018 some of which like wii may interfere with the measurement of hii or hiii future work should determine the utility of parix and other parafac ratios for tracking physical and biogeochemical processes across the land sea continuum and in different types of engineered environment 4 conclusions this study found that parafac fractions with specific spectral and chemical properties are ubiquitous in surface waters and tend to behave predictably during drinking water treatment a new fluorescence proxy parix was proposed that tracks the ratio of condensed aromatic humic acids containing abundant carboxyl and phenolate groups hii to aquagenic refractory organic matter hiii including weathered and de aggregated polyphenolics and polyaromatic acids with relatively high nitrogen content in addition to predicting suva parix is correlated to indices used to predict dom freshness and extent of humification more data are also needed to confirm the treatability results in this study and determine whether parix and other ratios especially pi hii and pii hiii are consistent predictors of doc removal in treatments similar to those examined in this study and how they relate to other types of treatments that were not studied indirectly this study provides further support for the parafac approach to interpreting steady state dom fluorescence which relies upon the assumption that different dom fractions produce linearly additive fluorescence signals as a consequence of mathematical and

15809,samples from fifty five surface water resources and twenty five drinking water treatment plants in europe africa asia and usa were used to analyse the fluorescence composition of global surface

introduction dissolved natural organic matter dom occurs in all surface waters where it originates from the decomposition and leaching of vegetation and in situ primary productivity and undergoes continuous biotic and abiotic processing aiken 2014 moran et al 2016 moran et al 1991 natural waters consequently contain thousands of different dom molecules with varying physicochemical characteristics removing dom is a major objective of drinking water treatment since too much dom protects pathogens causes aesthetic issues at the tap such as unpleasant colour taste and odour and leads to harmful by products being formed during disinfection leenheer and croué 2003 leenheer et al 2001 additionally dom undermines treatment performance and increases costs by increasing coagulant and oxidant demand and fouling membranes kennedy et al 2005 since various organic matter fractions respond differently to physical and chemical treatment croué et al 1993 edzwald 1993 moona et al 2021 dom character should directly inform the selection and operation of best available treatment options an important step toward optimising drinking water treatment is to predict the performance of specific treatment barriers i e doc removal efficiency from the chemical composition of the incoming raw water waters with similar chemical compositions are expected to respond similarly to a given treatment process for example specific uv254 absorption relative to doc concentration suva in water samples is directly proportional to percent aromaticity measured by c13 nmr weishaar et al 2003 suva strongly predicts coagulation performance across diverse water resources archer and singer 2006 edwards 1997 and also predicts other parameters of interest including disinfection byproduct formation potential edzwald et al 1985 hua et al 2015 and potential for membrane fouling amy 2008 a disadvantage of suva is that to measure it according to standard us epa method 415 3 requires two different instruments i e a uv spectrophotometer and a toc analyzer potter and wimsatt 2005 toc analyzers are rare at treatment plants due to expense and operational challenges that make them susceptible to a range of analytical interferences mopper and qian 2006 additionally commercial toc analyses for drinking water are expensive relative to other monitoring parameters and often have relatively high detection limits 1 mg l uv spectrophotometers also vary greatly in sensitivity mopper and qian 2006 and the overall result is that suva measured at different labs can vary significantly even under carefully controlled conditions potter and wimsatt 2005 this makes it difficult for water utilities to monitor changes in suva especially when concentrations of doc and or cdom are low finally while useful for predicting a range of treatment variables water treatment processes like oxidation van geluwe et al 2011 and adsorption newcombe et al 2002 are not well predicted by suva due to their dependence on low molecular weight dom fractions that are invisible to uv spectrophotometers analysis by liquid chromotography with organic carbon detection lc ocd can provide both a more accurate suva quantification and can distinguish and quantify several non absorbing low molecular weight dom fractions but is too costly for routine monitoring consequently there is a high value in identifying affordable single instrument approaches to measuring water aromaticity and tracking low molecular weight dom fractions in drinking water fluorescence spectroscopy is increasingly used to study water treatment due to high sensitivity and affordability coupled with two directional wavelength scanning capabilities that inform about water character as well as concentration ahmad and reynolds 1999 aiken 2014 bhattacharya and osburn 2020 despite accounting for a small fraction of the total dissolved carbon pool in aquatic samples fluorescent dom tracks major changes in dom molecular composition kellerman et al 2015 stubbins et al 2014 wünsch et al 2018a raw fluorescence measurements capture the sum of fluorescence emitted at each excitation and emission wavelength by all dissolved chemicals present thus combining signals from many different fluorophores accordingly fluorescence spectroscopy is frequently coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac to mathematically isolate and quantify independently varying dom fractions bro 1997 murphy et al 2014a stedmon and markager 2005b a number of prior studies have used parafac to analyse fluorescence datasets in the context of water treatment shutova and colleagues shutova et al 2014 reported linear correlations between between ratios of humic like parafac components vs percent doc removal in treatments involving coagulation however in that study as in many others e g murphy et al 2011 vines and terry 2020 parafac models of drinking water resources were site specific with only modest statistical similarities obtained when comparing models from different treatment plants this reflects a serious limitation of the parafac approach namely that selecting a different model tends to produce systematically different fluorescence intensities and ratios this has greatly limited the generality of conclusions about dom behaviour and treatability drawn from parafac analyses ishii and boyer 2012 there are two main prerequisites for defining useful global models that predict water treatability from fluorescence measurements the first is that the spectral properties of underlying fluorophore groups are highly similar between geographically diverse water resources fortunately although a diverse array of parafac components appear in published literature wünsch et al 2019 there are strong indications that a handful of well described parafac components of apparently ubiquitous distribution are responsible for most observed steady state fluorescence kowalczuk et al 2009 murphy et al 2018 wünsch et al 2019 several of these have been shown to respond similarly to similar environmental stressors ishii and boyer 2012 murphy et al 2018 wünsch et al 2017 suggesting that it may be possible to use parafac components to predict certain aspects of water chemistry across aquatic ecosystems a second requirement is that at least some of these parafac components track chemical characteristics with a deciding influence upon water treatability whether directly or indirectly aromaticity often measured as suva is a key property for predicting treatability in conventional water treatment as already described previously a fluorescence index fix that tracks the ratio between emissions at a specific pair of wavelengths in the visible range was shown to correlate inversely to both aromaticity and suva mcknight et al 2001 weishaar et al 2003 other fluorescence indicies that are investigated frequently in the context of drinking water treatability include the freshness or biological index bix and the humification index hix which attempt to track the ratio of labile to recalcitrant fractions ohno 2002 parlanti et al 2000 fluorescence indices have the advantage that they are simple to obtain and can indicate environmentally relevant variations in water quality and reactivity bhattacharya and osburn 2020 korak et al 2015 however since they are derived from total fluorescence they are susceptible to uncalibrated spectral interferences e g from contaminants it therefore seems likely that greater sensitivity for detecting environmentally relevant changes in dom composition might be achievable from tracking ratios between ubiquitous parafac components this study assessed the utility of fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parafac for predicting surface water aromaticity and treatability the aim was to first identify the spectral properties of fluorophore groups common to geographically diverse drinking water samples and second to identify global relationships between fluorescence aromaticity and molecular composition lc ocd fractions in order to predict doc removal in water samples subject to a standard set of drinking water treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling campaigns 2 1 1 global campaign filtered 0 45 µm water samples n 190 were collected from water resources and treatment plants in europe france sweden spain italy n 148 usa n 19 asia china n 6 and africa cameroon n 3 table s1 samples were collected in acid cleaned and combusted amber glass bottles when possible though some were collected in sample washed hdpe bottles to prevent breakage during international shipping each sample represented a single whole water grab sample collected at a particular location on a particular day samples from water resources were collected from the surface of rivers or lakes or the intakes of treatment plants sampled treatment plants employed a diverse range of treatments ranging from conventional treatment to treatments involving membrane filtration nanofiltration reverse osmosis adsorption onto activated carbon gac pac and advanced oxidation ozone and samples were collected from various stages in each treatment process samples were air shipped at 4 c to paris within 48 h of sampling for fluorescence absorbance and doc analysis at suez research laboratories aliquots from a subset of samples n 63 were additionally shipped in small batches from paris to karlsruhe germany for analysis by lc ocd overall the time elapsed between sampling and measurement ranged from 1 7 days for spectroscopic and doc analyses and 5 10 days for lc ocd analyses the only exceptions were the samples from china which were analysed for lc ocd at a local university laboratory 2 1 2 local campaign unfiltered 20 l water samples natural challenge samples were collected in clean hdpe drums from five french rivers table 1 at the intakes to water treatment plants each sample n 5 was shipped overnight to the suez laboratory where it was subdivided and used in an experiment consisting of nine standard treatment tests each test measured the changes in dom quantity and character resulting from one type of treatment as detailed in section 2 4 below challenge samples from the local campaigns were analysed using absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy and doc analysis aliquots from all samples arising from the bretagne challenge tests were additionally shipped to germany for lc ocd analysis 2 1 3 synthetic nom samples synthetic challenge samples were prepared by combining three natural dom isolates reference materials from the international humic substances society with various mineral substances to create a suite n 20 of samples representing properties that are commonly encountered in raw drinking surface water tables s2 and s3 the three dom isolates were suwannee river srnom nordic reservoir and mississippi river dissolved at concentrations representative of average surface water resources 3 mgl 1 for each isolate the mineral background was adjusted using cacl2 to simulate hardness nahco3 to simulate alkalinity and kaolinite added to simulate turbidity aliquots from all samples arising from the srnom 100 mgl 1 caco3 challenge experiment were shipped to germany for lc ocd analysis 2 2 analytical methods doc analysis was performed in the suez lab using a benchtop analyzer aurora 1030w oi instruments that uses

ccd detector 220 800 nm at 4 nm increments fluorescence data exported from the aqualog were fully corrected for instrumental and sample related biases first spectral corrections accounting for wavelength related biases were applied using factory generated excitation and emission correction factors second fluorescence quenching caused by sample self shading inner filter effect was corrected in the instrument using correction factors derived from the fluorometers s simultaneously collected absorbance spectrum kothawala et al 2013 lc ocd analyses were performed by doc labor in karlsruhe germany according to published procedures huber et al 2011 this technique uses size exclusion chromatography to quantify five doc subfractions operationally classified as low molecular weight lmw

fluorescence eem dataset according to well established methodologies bro 1997 parafac identifies the unique underlying spectra of a fixed number of independent components that sum to reproduce the measured eems with least error and determines the relative concentrations fmax for each component modelling was implemented using the dreem toolbox in matlab murphy et al 2013 extensive modelling iterations confirmed that a nine component model provided the best fit to the dataset however only post membrane samples from a pilot plant contained the ninth component and this component had spectral properties indicating a whitening agent section 3 3 after excluding outlier samples affected by whitening agents only eight components remained in the model the 8 component model was validated both by split half analysis s2t1 and by separately modelling short wavelength protein like and longer wavelength humic like regions of each eem and fusing the resulting spectra after the model was finalized the fluorescence eems from challenge samples and outliers were projected on the model producing fmax for every sample in the study fmax ratios were determined by dividing fmax for one parafac component by fmax for another regression equations relating fmax ratios with other measurements were determined in matlab 2020a using either a standard linear model for small sample sizes n 5 or a robust linear model determined by iteratively reweighted least squares regression n 10 holland and welsch 1977 to determine prediction errors rmsep for regression analyses regression models were tested on a prediction dataset consisting of randomly selected samples that had not been used to develop the regression model in the case of regressions involving parafac components the prediction dataset consisted of the five challenge samples together with 19 other samples that were collected after the model had been finalized for these samples parafac scores were determined by projecting the eems on the existing parafac model then regression fits were determined by projecting those scores on the existing regression equations in the case of fluorescence ratios the prediction samples were selected randomly by algorithm then projected on the regression equation derived from the remaining samples 2 4 treatability experiments the natural and synthetic challenge samples were submitted to nine different treatments at bench scale table 2 first samples were equilibrated with lab atmosphere and temperature then divided into subsamples that were individually submitted to one test coagulation enhanced coagulation powdered activated carbon pac ion exchange iex and chlorination were each tested individually ozone o3 was tested individually and in combination with coagulation iex and pac these tests were completed using a jar test set up with 1l cylindrical beakers ozone was tested using a specially designed container allowing for gas injection through a septum the contact times and chemical doses corresponded to conventionally applied operational conditions for lab scale simulation of surface water treatment plants ferric chloride coagulant sa super powder activated carbon and amberlite ira458cl ion exchange resin were selected due to their specific capacity for organic matter removal the same doses were administered to each synthetic and natural water sample since the synthetic samples each had similar doc concentrations they each received similar effective doses making removal a function of only dom source and mineral matrix doc concentrations in the natural water samples varied between 2 5 5 7 mgl 1 making removal a function of both dom source and effective dose two natural samples had nearly identical doc concentrations sarthe loire and received similar effective doses 3 results and discussion 3 1 fluorescence composition fig 1 depicts the spectral properties of all nine parafac components identified in the global eem database and table 3 lists their similarity with published spectra tucker congruence coefficient tcc according to the openfluor database murphy et al 2014b which at the time of writing contained 237 published parafac models raw spectral data for the parafac components in this study will be made available upon publication in openfluor suez 9c five identified components hi hii hiii hiv wi each had emission maxima at wavelengths longer than 400 nm as is characteristic for fluorescence derived from humic and fulvic like organic matter all have been identified previously and recent studies highlight their apparently ubiquitous distribution table 3 three published parafac models of drinking water samples are particularly strongly congruent a 5 component model of swedish river water kungalv 5 moona et al 2021 is practically a perfect match for five components in the current model fig s1 additionally five of six parafac components in the sab6 model of seawater from the south atlantic bight kowalczuk et al 2009 are very highly congruent correlation coefficients exceeding 0 97 when comparing excitation or emission spectra finally three components in drinking water models from australia and sweden model d and dw sweden gavle respectively are similarly highly congruent heibati et al 2017 shutova et al 2014 component hi coincides with the fulvic like c peak position coble et al 1990 with spectrally similar components common to virtually all parafac models of dom fluorescence table 3 in samples from diverse freshwater systems hi is typically the first or second most important abundant component in the model accounting for a large proportion of total variability hi tends to covary with hii in surveys from river to sea with the latter being associated with higher aromaticity and greater susceptibility to flocculation processes in natural systems and water treatment kothawala et al 2014 yamashita et al 2010 in parafac models with only three or four components hi and hii are often combined indicating stable relative abundances across many datasets wünsch et al 2019 however hii has more humic character and represents are more aromatic and higher molecular weight fraction than hi cuss and guéguen 2015 component hiii is reported to represent soluble microbial products other than proteins wells et al 2022 and is typically abundant in wastewater dom and at agriculturally impacted and eutrophic sites stedmon and markager 2005a yamashita et al 2010 its emission peak overlaps with the position of the microbial m peak coble 1996 stedmon and markager 2005b wünsch et al 2019 although m also captures emission wavelengths associated with hi and hiv although produced by microbial activity hiii is itself resistant to biological degradation ishii and boyer 2012 moona et al 2021 and tends to accumulate in sediments krasner et al 1996 hiii is additionally resistant to coagulation flocculation kothawala et al 2014 and has been implicated in irreversible membrane fouling ly et al 2018 component hiv has a broad peak with slightly longer emission maximum than hiii and is only typically found in models having four or more humic like components sometimes with a spectral shape indicating a combination of protein like and humic like fractions kowalczuk et al 2010 murphy et al 2018 wells et al 2022 unlike hiii hiv is readily biodegraded cohen et al 2014 moona et al 2021 the large spectral overlap between hiii and hiv despite different sources and reactivities accounts for sometimes contradictory reports regarding the behaviour of components responsible for peak m fluorescence components pi and pii match protein like fluorescence similar to pure tryptophan pi and pure tyrosine pii pi emits at slightly longer wavelengths than is usually observed for pure tryptophan λem 330 350 and may represent multiple unresolved protein like fluorophores signals similar to piii have been reported from chinese surface waters yang et al 2019 huang et al 2022 and from petroleum derived fluorescence zito et al 2019 although this does not preclude the possibility of a biological origin only two components identified in this study are previously unreported from drinking water resources one of these wi is a near perfect spectral match for a component identified previously as pulp mill effluent cawley et al 2012 it was abundant only in the challenge sample from river nancy fig s2 where several pulp mills are located upstream of the sampling location the other wii matches a spectrum isolated from wastewater cohen et al 2014 and has a multi peaked emission spectrum characteristic of optical brighteners that are used widely in textile and paper industries fig s1 in this study wii was the ninth component and observed only in some samples of membrane permeates and not in any challenge test samples the isolation of these components from a diverse drinking water dataset highlights the sensitivity of fluorescence spectroscopy in combination with parafac for detecting the potential organic contamination of drinking water samples 3 2 surface water aromaticity suva in the dataset ranged between 1 0 and 5 5 lmg 1m 1 and thus spanned a range from low to very high aromaticity fig 2 shows correlations between established and newly derived predictors of surface water aromaticity in the first two subplots raw water samples accounted for most measurements in the upper right portion of each subplot suva 1 7 5 5 mean 3 1 0 8 lmg 1m 1 and partially or fully treated water samples accounted for the lower left portion suva 1 0 3 7 mean 1 8 0 6 lmg 1m 1 however a single linear regression line fits all samples equally well with no indication that treatment altered the underlying relationship between suva and fluorescence a better predictor of suva discovered in this study was the ratio between fmax for the longest emitting parafac component hii λem 520 nm versus the shortest emitting component within the humic region hiii λem 404 nm hereafter referred to hii hiii or parix standing for parafac index note that hiii fluorescence overlaps spectrally with component hiv λem 420 nm although these two signals have distinct sources and behave differently during water treatment see further below in fig 2 circular markers indicate the calibration dataset i e 166 samples from cameroon china france italy and usa that were included when building the parafac model of which 53 had matching lc ocd measurements red stars indicate the prediction dataset consisting of samples that were excluded from parafac modelling the prediction dataset consists of 24 samples from spain usa and france including the five natural challenge samples of which 10 samples had lc ocd measurements for prediction samples parafac scores were estimated by projecting the sample eems on the model with the one exception described below no data points were omitted from any graph so the depicted correlations are robust across continents and ecosystems with visible outliers that show the range of departure to be expected due to combined sampling measurement and modelling errors the single exception was the hix subplot where six extreme outliers from france and china were removed for visual clarity hix in the range of 0 15 0 6 and parix below 0 5 fig 2a correlates parix with suva measurements made according to the traditional usepa method and by lc ocd a much stronger linear correlation is seen with the lc ocd dataset than with the traditional suva dataset indicating that much of the scatter among grey points in fig 2a is attributable to measurement error in the traditional suva dataset for this reason and because it is typical to favour the lc ocd dataset in cases of disagreement hutchins et al 2017 the lc ocd dataset was used to derive equations to predict suva from fluorescence fig 2a b and table 4 show that suva in the calibration dataset could be estimated with good accuracy by simply multiplying parix by a constant equal to four rmsec 0 64 lmg 1m 1 this applied to surface water samples in various stages of water treatment and was the case even for the prediction dataset i e when this ratio was estimated by projecting new eems upon the pre existing parafac model rmsep 0 55 lmg 1m 1 note that the magnitude of the constant in a regression equation involving parafac components depends on their spectral ranges and shapes thus this constant may vary between datasets if fitted with slightly different parafac components conversely a general result e g a linear relationship between suva and the ratio of components representing hii and hiii would be expected to hold for two different parafac models it is relevant to compare the predictive power of parix with the predictive power of fix and other well established fluorescence indices fig 2c d shows that fix is non linearly correlated to suva and parix which mirrors early observations of nonlinearity between fix and aromaticity when measured by nmr mcknight et al 2001 other indices that primarily track the ratio between tryptophan like and humic like fluorescence freshness index or bix and hix ohno 2002 parlanti et al 2000 also show some non linearity plus significant scatter when correlated with parix fig 2c e f table 4 lists robust regression equations and fit statistics for predicting suva from fluorescence ratios and parix since these relationships were developed from diverse raw and treated surface waters from three continents they may hold widely for freshwaters in other geographical locations except for scaling factors that will apply to parix estimated using different parafac models overall the established indices each had weaker correlations and lower accuracy for predicting suva compared to parix table 4 furthermore parix was only marginally worse at predicting suva measured by lc ocd than was suva measured according to the standard method table 4 this is presumably due the higher measurement precision of fluorescence measurements compared to absorbance and doc measurements 3 3 treatability fig 3 compares treatment efficiencies determined in bench scale experiments on natural and synthetic challenge samples treatment efficiencies are shown as percent removals of bulk dom doc its total chromophoric fraction cdom and its total fluorescent fraction fdom differences in treatment efficiencies between the synthetic samples were negligible even when deliberately varying their background mineral content thus fig 3 shows average removals for the complete set of trials performed with each isolate fig 3 shows several expected trends including much better removal of cdom than doc and slightly better removal of fdom than cdom exceptions included iex and pac which had similar removal efficiencies for doc as for cdom the isolates showed little variation in removal efficiencies when subjected to a particular treatment whereas the natural samples showed a wider range consistent with their variable dom characters removal efficiencies for the isolates generally tracked the highest removal efficiencies measured for natural samples i e similar to the bretagne sample in treatments involving coagulation and similar to the seine sample in treatments involving pac and ozonation biopolymers were largely excluded in the process of extracting dom isolates table s4 and this may have resulted in water that is relatively easy to treat by a wide range of processes applied on its own ozonation did not significantly remove doc from river samples this is consistent with results from prior studies demonstrating that larger molecular weight fractions humics and biopolymers are not removed by ozonation so much as converted to lower molecular weight fractions sarathy and mohseni 2007 additionally pre ozonation did not improve doc removal when followed by pac iex or coagulation but did improve the removal of cdom and fdom particularly for the seine sample this does not seem to reflect a variation in ozone dose since both seine and bretagne samples had a similar doc concentration but for bretagne only pre ozonation had little effect doc removal by conventional coagulation was high especially among samples with high suva bretagne nancy as has been reported in many previous studies archer and singer 2006 edwards 1997 the performance of pac and iex for removing doc was rather similar across all natural and synthetic samples 35 5 6 and 3 respectively suggesting that all these had similar sized adsorbable around 27 45 and charged 31 40 fractions pac removed slightly greater proportions of chromophoric and fluorescent material than did iex 43 and 56 compared to 38 and 42 fig 4 compares the average performance of each treatment barrier when removing fluorescent dom fractions from natural and synthetic waters consistent with earlier results sections 3 1 and 3 2 performance on synthetic challenge samples was always better than or equal to performance on the natural samples however comparing natural and synthetic samples each fraction s relative treatability by different treatment barriers was strikingly similar overall humic like components hi hii hiv and wi were well removed by coagulation but hiii was removed relatively poorly published reports on the behaviour of components like hiii are often contradictory because many parafac models have hiii and hi combined in a single component although in models where they are separated the two vary independently chen et al 2010 ishii and boyer 2012 palma et al 2021 this is probably the reason why hiii is sometimes described as being of terrestrial allochthonous origin and sometimes as microbially derived autochthonous in this study the only treatments that effectively removed hiii involved ozonation similarly protein like components pi and pii were always difficult to treat the low abundance of piii precluded studying its removal efficiency pac or ozone in combination with other barriers were most effective at removing protein like fluorescence 3 4 predicting treatability from fdom ratios fig 5 shows treatability results for the five french rivers since there were nine different treatments to apply only a small number of different raw waters could be tested however suva in these samples spanned most of the normal range observed in freshwater systems approx 1 6 6 kellerman 2015 massicotte et al 2017 weishaar et al 2003 and in total fig 5 shows data from 40 separate pilot tests treatability assessed as percent doc removal was generally well predicted from the fluorescence composition of raw river when represented as ratios between hiii and either hii pi or pii especially since parix was highly correlated with suva it was also an excellent predictor of water treatability by any process in which aromaticity plays a deciding role especially coagulation and ozonation and combinations thereof in contrast there was typically no correlation between initial doc concentration and doc removal which indicates that differences in effective dose was not a major factor determining treatability in these experiments this is seen by the seine and bretagne samples occupying the extremes of most graphs despite these samples having similar initial doc concentration there were two treatments for which doc removal was uncorrelated with fluorescence composition but was somewhat correlated with initial doc concentration these were enhanced coagulation r2 0 72 and ozonation combined with ion exchange r2 0 47 fig 5 shows that high parix resulted in strong coagulation and ozonation performance while low parix resulted in better performance by ion exchange since lc ocd analysis confirmed that low parix indicated of a higher proportion of lmw molecules see below water with lower parix might be expected to adsorb more strongly onto activated carbon shimabuku et al 2017 however this was not observed for the tested river waters instead for pac treatability was strongly correlated to pi hiii and uncorrelated to parix previous work indicates that adsorption onto activated carbon involves a complex interplay of factors related to molecular size polarity and aromaticity as well as the number and size of available adsorption sites thus can vary over time and according to the degree of saturation of the carbon substrate lee and hur 2016 moona et al 2018 this leads to apparently contradictory results whereby adsorption may be favoured by either high aromaticity or low molecular size depending on substate properties and water chemistry in this study the relationship between pi hiii and doc removal by pac indicates a competition for adsorption sites within the lower molecular weight fraction with hiii excluding small amino acids and non fluorescent molecules from pac adsorption sites 3 5 fluorescence surrogates of lc ocd fractions correlations between fluorescence and lc ocd measurements were explored after first normalising lc ocd concentrations to humic substance hs concentration and normalising fluorescence parameters to hii intensity this avoids apparently strong correlations driven by concentration artefacts i e higher dom concentrations tended to produce higher signals for both fluorescence and lc ocd parameters additionally eight samples with hs concentration below 600 μg l were deleted due to low signal to noise leaving 60 samples in the dataset the aromaticity index was strongly correlated to nominal molecular weight as would be expected from its relationship with suva fig 6 the inverse of parix was strongly positively correlated to hs normalised concentrations of building blocks the regression equation goes through the origin bb hs 0 19 parix rmse 0 073 r2 0 86 indicating a parsimonious model with good predictive capacity hiv hii was also positively correlated to normalised building block concentrations bb hs 0 20 hiv hii rmse 0 144 r2 0 73 the building block fraction in lc ocd analysis is attributed to weathering and oxidation products of humic substances huber 2011 this aligns with interpretation that hiii is due to aquagenic refractory organic matter with relatively high n c ratio whereas hiv represents labile degradation products including photochemically produced dom murphy et al 2018 the building block fraction is of lower molecular weight than other humic substances and experiments have shown it to be poorly removed by coagulation flocculation huber et al 2011 which is consistent with the treatability tests fig 5 several weaker correlations were seen between hii normalised fluorescence intensities and hs normalised concentrations of lmw neutrals the inverse of parix was moderately correlated lmwn hs 0 04 0 14 parix r2 0 67 rmse 0 091 as was pi hiii lmwn hs 0 16 0 07 pi hii r2 0 63 rmse 0 080 tryptophan like pii was only weakly correlated with lmw neutrals r2 0 5 due to considerable scatter positive correlations with tyrosine like and tryptophan like fluorescence are expected since amino acids belong to the lmw neutral fraction huber 2011 however the correlation with hiii may be indirect rather than causal i e a result of degradation processes tending to produce both amino acids and building blocks at the same time there were no correlations observed between any fluorescence component and either biopolymers or lmw acids an earlier study of drinking water treatment reported a link between biopolymer concentrations and protein like fluorescence baghoth et al 2011 however in that analysis the lc ocd measurements were not normalised to doc which is needed to account for bulk doc removal between treatment steps and hence nearly all investigated correlations were highly statistically significant hutchins and co workers hutchins et al 2017 reported that tryptophan like fluorescence and biopolymers covaried along a stream water continuum after first normalising tryptophan like fluorescence to total fluorescence and biopolymers to doc concentration although they did not draw attention to additional correlations their principal components analysis additionally indicated the existence of correlations that closely match this study i e between components similar to hiii and hi and both the building block and lmw neutral fractions these relationships help to explain the differences in treatability observed for the seine and bretagne challenge samples despite similar initial doc the seine sample was most susceptible to pac treatment whereas the bretagne sample was most susceptible to coagulation fig 5 in their parafac decompositions fig s3 both were dominated by component hi however the seine sample had higher pi hii and pii hii in addition to lower parix and pii hiii 1 3 0 3 0 5 and 0 15 respectively indicating low susceptibility to coagulation due to a high proportion of lmw neutrals and building blocks but only moderate susceptibility to pac adsorption due to relatively high hiii compared to pii in contrast the bretagne sample had lower pi hii and pii hii and higher parix and pii hiii 0 6 0 15 1 4 and 0 2 respectively indicating high aromaticity and susceptibility to both coagulation and pac but less susceptibility to ion exchange 3 6 the molecular basis of parix recent studies have attempted to deduce the molecular origin of dom fluorescence by linking fluorescence spectroscopy with ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry the usual approach is to obtain a collection of samples subsampled and measured by each of the two analytical techniques and search for post hoc correlations between the two datasets herzsprung et al 2012 although the specific molecular structures responsible for specific fluorescence components can t be identified this way this approach has been used many times to indicate the relative proportions of carbon hydrogen and oxygen in the ionizable molecular formulas that covary with parafac components in two prior studies that both identified components similar to hii and hiii and mapped post hoc correlations in van krevlan space each was associated with a broad range of molecular formulae properties with no apparent differences between the two kellerman et al 2015 wünsch et al 2018a however wünsch and colleagues also tested a different approach whereby the fluorescence and mass spectrometry datasets were simultaneously decomposed using a coupled tensor factorization model in that analysis hii and hiii mapped in distinct regions of van krevlen space with hiii h c 1 2 1 4 o c 0 5 0 6 more saturated and less aromatic than hii h c 0 9 1 3 o c 0 6 which is consistent with the interpretation of parix in this study the same analysis indicated that hi encompassed nearly the full range of molecular formulae correlated with hiii as well as additional formulae of more aliphatic character this is consistent with fix and parix each representing the ratio between a condensed aromatic humic fraction compared to a relatively aliphatic humic fraction thus for fix the aliphatic fraction is hi while for parix the aliphatic fraction is hiii 3 7 applications in water treatment fluorescence ratios will be useful for monitoring doc removal in water treatment so long as they sensitively track small changes in water quality this study builds upon earlier studies indicating that a large number of treatment options cause measurable changes in fluorescence ratios e g fig 3 by demonstrating that some changes are predictable in size and direction across diverse surface waters biological filters are a widely used treatment option that was not tested in this study but earlier studies offer insights that can be used as the basis of predictions biodegradation predominantly removes hydrophilic dom so is generally associated with an increase in suva consistent with the relative enrichment of aliphatic carbon fractions hansen et al 2016 moran et al 2000 a recent study showed that biodegradation efficiently removed hiv and pii but not hi hii or hiii moona et al 2021 this explains why fix for surface water samples is relatively unchanged by biodegradation fellman et al 2008 hansen et al 2016 and suggests that the same will be true of parix parix and suva appear to have rather similar capacities for predicting drinking water treatability but parix has the advantage of being measurable on a single affordable instrument with high precision which is especially useful when doc concentrations are low and difficult to accurately quantify as with all optical indices there will be limits to usefulness of parix for tracking changes in water composition or predicting reactivity and treatability hansen et al 2016 helms et al 2008 korak et al 2014 korak et al 2015 weishaar et al 2003 parix is likely to overestimate suva and susceptibility to coagulation in samples with relatively low aromaticity if this was caused by the production of small dom fractions that fluoresce at wavelengths shorter than 400 nm or not at all and that were produced more efficiently than hiii conversely parix will underestimate suva in samples with relatively high aromaticity if this was due to the efficient removal of lmw fractions not covarying with hiii ratios involving hiv or protein like components are likely to be better predictors of bioavailable doc than parix fellman et al 2008 moona et al 2021 despite apparently widespread relevance for predicting the composition of surface waters at varying stages of treatment parix has not been tested for other sample types e g groundwater wastewater and seawater in iron rich lakes light absorption by iron causes over estimated suva values but would likely have the opposite effect on parix due to greater quenching of long wavelength fluorescence poulin et al 2014 while in wastewaters dyes and other fluorescent contaminants often are present carstea 2012 cohen et al 2014 goffin et al 2018 some of which like wii may interfere with the measurement of hii or hiii future work should determine the utility of parix and other parafac ratios for tracking physical and biogeochemical processes across the land sea continuum and in different types of engineered environment 4 conclusions this study found that parafac fractions with specific spectral and chemical properties are ubiquitous in surface waters and tend to behave predictably during drinking water treatment a new fluorescence proxy parix was proposed that tracks the ratio of condensed aromatic humic acids containing abundant carboxyl and phenolate groups hii to aquagenic refractory organic matter hiii including weathered and de aggregated polyphenolics and polyaromatic acids with relatively high nitrogen content in addition to predicting suva parix is correlated to indices used to predict dom freshness and extent of humification more data are also needed to confirm the treatability results in this study and determine whether parix and other ratios especially pi hii and pii hiii are consistent predictors of doc removal in treatments similar to those examined in this study and how they relate to other types of treatments that were not studied indirectly this study provides further support for the parafac approach to interpreting steady state dom fluorescence which relies upon the assumption that different dom fractions produce linearly additive fluorescence signals as a consequence of mathematical and
