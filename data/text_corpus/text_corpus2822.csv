14110,in this study performance of a lab scale anaerobic aerobic hybrid reactor treating swine wastewater was evaluated under three different organic loading rates olr the operating of integral hybrid system consisted of two experimental sections first an uasb section and second a uasb section aerobic packed bed with polyethylene rings during the reactor operation three assays of sma were carried out and according to these results 0 26 0 32 and 0 81 kg cod ch4 kg vss d the olr was gradually step increased from 3 26 to 4 02 and finally 10 14 kg cod m3 d with this strategy the removal efficiency of organic matter during the last operational condition increased 34 3 compared to the initial using the sma as a control tool in addition the nitrogen accumulated that could not be removed in the uasb section was treated by the aerobic packed bed by nitrification denitrification simultaneous achieving almost a total removal this removal was attributed 55 11 to nitrification process 30 to denitrification and stripping were 11 1 therefore this anaerobic aerobic hybrid reactor is an integral unit that allowed greater operating efficiencies than other hybrid systems that operate in two or more units and is capable of complying with current regulations for discharge to water bodies keywords organic load rate ammonification hybrid reactor specific methanogenic activity swine wastewater 1 introduction it is estimated that in mexico a pig produces around 0 27 m3 of effluent every month feces and urine 1 and it is report that around 38 of pig farms disposed their wastes without any treatment directly into soils and water bodies 2 in addition other authors reported that almost no farm in mexico complies with mexican regulations for discharge into water and national goods 3 the above mentioned generates a significant impact on the environment owing to the large volumes of solids and wastewater generated in the pig farm whish altering the physical chemical and microbiology composition of solid and water bodies 4 another important pollutant that has been found in the effluent of pig farms is total nitrogen and can be present in a concentration range between 524 to 1907 mg l 3 in this regard systems used to treat porcine effluents are those focused on the removal of organic matter like biodigesters with efficiencies 50 5 anaerobic ponds 56 6 facultative ponds 30 3 and uasb reactors 60 6 on the contrary organic nitrogenous compounds present in the wastewater like proteins amino acids or urea are mainly reduced to ammonia which is poorly degraded on anaerobic conditions 7 limited performance of nitrogen removal has been reported in anaerobic system some examples are those reported by karakashev et al 6 in a uasb reactor with removal efficiencies of 11 and in an anaerobic digester of 0 techio et al 5 reported removal of 56 using anaerobic ponds and biodigesters efficiencies were 17 quite often the low nitrogen removal leads an unsuccessful anaerobic process accompanied with an acidification and negative effects in the biogas production rate therefore these biological processes are ungood enough to produce acceptable quality effluents to reuse in agricultural irrigation or included in the pig farm according to the legal mexican standard due to the need to improve not only the removal of organic matter but also nutrients such as nitrogen new wastewater treatment systems called hybrids have been introduced in the last years which combine biological chemical and or physical processes in a single system or separated units 8 9 anaerobic hybrid reactors have been used to treat successfully industrial effluents recalcitrant compounds and high loads of organic matter such as for example effluents from distilleries 10 slaughterhouses or pig farms 11 hybrid reactors are efficient cost effective and small space requirement 12 in addition the used of support media into the hybrid reactors could improves the developed of biofilm biomass to increase pollutant removal and system stability due to the high sludge retention time srt leads to the formation of bacterial community such as nitrifies and denitrifies microorganisms 13 as a result higher organic matter removal rates and better effluent quality are achieved in these systems compared to conventional processes treatment 14 despite these advantages there are poor reported hybrid technologies to swine wastewater treatment 15 11 in this context it is necessary a new type of integral systems more efficient at higher organic matter and nitrogen removal that operate with short hrt 1 d and high olr 10 kg cod m3 d that allow to treat the significant amounts of swine wastes produced daily the success of hybrid systems depends on the substrate and the quality of the biomass swine wastewater represent a good substrate that promotes the growth of anaerobic microorganisms thanks to its content of carbohydrates 53 hemicellulose and cellulose 20 followed by proteins 20 fats and lipids 7 and a small amount of lignin 4 4 and starch 1 6 16 in addition the high performance of a hybrid reactor which is contained an anaerobic section depends on the presence of an adequate level of methanogenic activity therefore it is necessary to monitor changes in the groups or activities of the methanogenic microorganisms in the digester using such available techniques as a microscope count most probable number coenzyme f420 quantification or the specific methanogenic activity sma 17 the disadvantage of some of these techniques is that is not practical and is too complex to the routine analysis nevertheless the sma technique is more rapid and reliable than the other test 18 sma is defined as the methane production capacity of a specific methanogenic population for a precise substrate where the availability of the substrate is not a limiting factor 19 moreover the sma is also a valuable tool to determine the maximum organic load rate olr to be treated in a system maintaining the capacity of anaerobic microorganisms to remove biodegradable organic matter and produce methane 20 according to yan and tay 21 the olr must correspond to the 60 80 of the sma value which has been proved as appropriate for rapid start up to anaerobic system this ratio resulting in high operating stability and an excellent cod removal in the anaerobic system however a low cod removal and poor stability can result when 80 of the value of the sma is exceeded the sma test can be complemented with the quantification of volatile suspended solids vss to differentiate between active microbial biomass and any other inert particulate material 22 the sma has been used by several authors in various anaerobic processes mchugh et al 23 investigated the microbial community structure with the application the sma test during the start up of psychrophilic anaerobic digesters treating volatile fatty acids vfa and sucrose which reached a high cod removal efficiency 90 at an olr of 20 kg cod m3 d as a consequence of a shift of the dominance response from acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic oktem et al 24 used a sma initial test to control the olr in the range of 3 to 9 kg cod m3 d in a hybrid uasb reactor treating pharmaceutical wastewater evidencing there was no obvious inhibitory effect and a 99 of cod removal was achieved on the contrary wijekoon et al 25 operated a thermophilic anaerobic membrane bioreactor tanmbr to molasses residues treatment the sma test was used before olr changes though the cod removal decreased from 81 to 61 when the olr increasing from 8 to 12 kg cod m3 d based on these reports it is important to emphasize the suitability of the anaerobic aerobic hybrid system in a unique unit for treatment of swine wastewater has been uninvestigated with the contribution of pertinent sma information in this context the aim of this study was to develop an anaerobic aerobic hybrid reactor for the removal of macropollutants from swine wastewater on one hand the removal of the intensest amount of organic matter was carried out through the anaerobic section using the sma as a control tool for the purpose of to improve the operational efficiencies in a hybrid system on the other hand the aerobic packed bed section treated the nitrogen accumulated that could be unremoved by the anaerobic sludge by nitrification denitrification simultaneous 2 materials and methods 2 1 swine wastewater characteristics swine wastewater was obtained from a pig farm located in sonora mexico the parameters evaluated are shown in table 1 and correspond to the effluents generated in a maternity farm the ranges presented correspond to nine sample lots of wastewater analyzed during the 500 days of the operation of the hybrid reactor the swine wastewater fed to the hybrid reactor was previously conditioned in order to reduce the size of large solids and to prevent clogging system pipes the liquid waste efficiently was blende and strain subsequently the wastewater was diluted to achieve by adequate concentration of cod in the influent that fed to the system 2 2 characteristics of the anaerobic and aerobic biomass the anaerobic biomass was obtained from a stable uasb reactor used to treat wastewater from a brewery cervecería cuauhtémoc moctezuma in mexico city the inoculum presented suitable physical characteristics such as an initial concentration of tss of 33 93 g l and vss of 31 71 g l and it was constituted by 96 of granules with an approximate diameter of 0 6 cm with a sedimentation rate of 42 56 m h and a sludge volume index svi of 37 ml g tss in addition the inoculum was previously adapted with brewery wastewater at high olr nitrifying biomass was obtained from an urban wastewater treatment plant located south of ciudad obregón méxico the aerobic biomass had a concentration of 20 4 g l of tss and 7 66 g l of vss the initial physical characteristics of the biomass was a flocculent form with poor sedimentation svi 200 ml g tss 2 3 start up and operation of the anaerobic aerobic hybrid reactor the experiment was carried out in a laboratory scale hybrid reactor with a useful volume between 2 and 3 l a flow rate of 2 82 0 76 l d and hydraulic retention time hrt of 0 79 0 20 days a schematic representation of hybrid reactor is shown in fig 1 the system was configured in two sections a start up and stabilization of the uasb section under anaerobic conditions 0 188 days with an initial volume of 2 l and b uasb section aerobic packed bed 189 500 days with a total volume of 3 l the uasb section was inoculated with 800 ml of anaerobic granular sludge which corresponded to a third of the volume s section the temperature inside the reactor was adjusted by an external thermostatically controlled hot water serpentine on the other hand the aerobic packed bed section was installed which had a volume of 0 9 l with a flow air that supply an average oxygen concentration of 3 35 mg l provide by a flow meter this section was filled with polyethylene rings of 3 cm in diameter and 3 cm in height and a density of 77 8 g l the rings used as support media promoted the colonization of a biofilm inside and outside of them the operation of the hybrid reactor was divided in three periods in which the olr was increased progressively the sma measure was used previously to stablish each change in the olr as control tool for the reactor operation the olr was gradually increased from 3 26 0 174 days up to 4 02 175 459 days and finally to 10 17 kg cod m3 d 460 500 days according to the sma test results therefore the system constantly operated below its maximum olr established by the sma test avoiding exceeding the capacity of the anaerobic microorganisms due to the supplied substrate finally the olr increments were made by increasing the cod concentration in the feeding trying to have a constant flow 2 4 determination of specific methanogenic activity sma anaerobic biomass was sampled in the days 0 175 and 460 during the reactor operation in order to quantify their specific activities sma assays were performed in 60 ml serological bottles with a working volume of 20 ml 4 ml of the anaerobic consortium and 16 ml of a mineral medium g l nah2po4 h2o 0 703 k2hpo4 0 600 nh4cl 0 500 mgso4 7h2o 0 111 cacl2 2h2o 0 100 and nahco3 3 000 the operating conditions of the anaerobic tests were a substrate biomass ratio of 0 4 g cod g vss a temperature of 37 2 c and a ph of 7 quantification of produced ch4 was carried out by gas chromatography fisher gas partitioner model 1200 with a thermal conductivity detector and a porapak q column the sma value eq 1 was estimated by plotting the production of ch4 kg of cod against time days and dividing by the amount of vss added to each bottle 1 sma kg cod c h 4 kg vss d methane production kg cod c h4 d biomass kg vss once the sma was determined the maximum olr allowed by the reactor kg cod ch4 m3 d was calculated with eq 2 2 olr k g c o d m 3 d v l v r vss sma where vl is the volume of biomass in the reactor m3 vr is the reactor volume m3 vss is the amount of volatile suspended solids kg m3 and the sma value of the biomass kg cod ch4 kg vss d 2 5 analytical methods the anaerobic biomass was used to calculate the sedimentation velocity the sludge volume index svi and the distribution size of the granules which was measured through 6 and 4 mm sieves in the influent and effluent of the hybrid reactor the following analyzes were performed cod total solids ts total volatile solids tvs no3 n no2 n nh4 n according to the 26 other parameters such as vfas and alkalinity were also monitored following the method described by anderson and yang 27 and proteins and carbohydrates using the methodology of lowry 28 and michael 29 respectively 2 6 statistical analysis of results the results are expressed as means standard deviation the data were analyzed using two way analysis of variance anova with minitab software version 17 0 when the anova identified differences among groups multiple comparisons among the means were performed using hsd honestly significant difference tukey a significance level of p 0 05 was chosen 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of specific methanogenic activity sma in this study three sma values were obtained for the anaerobic biomass in three different operational times of the hybrid reactor on day 0 the sma was 0 26 kg cod ch4 kg vss d increased to 0 32 on day 175 and finally to 0 81 on day 460 the statistical analysis shows that the mentioned increases in the sma of the hybrid system improved and were significantly different for each of the periods even without detecting a notable increase in the vss from operational periods two to three during the first operation period 0 174 days the increase in vss 31 71 55 44 g l is attributed to the stage of exponential growth of the microorganisms at the start up of the process and as consequence of the adaptation of the biomass is possible to promote the growth of the methanogenic microorganisms and increase the sma 30 however in the third operational period 460 500 days there was no significant increase in the biomass concentration 57 04 g l with respect to the second period so it is inferred that the increase in sma is because the same microorganisms were capable to adapt to the swine wastewater a distinct behavior was found by yan and tay 21 who report a sma increase from 0 07 to 1 4 kg cod ch4 kg almost immediately after uasb reactor start up due to the easy biodegradability of the substrate glucose and peptone since it would be wiser to start with a more biodegradable substrate than swine wastewater and which leads to the rapid bacterial adaptation generally the increase in sma is due to an increase in the biomass concentration or its adaptation to specific types of wastewaters 31 moreover other reasons for the sma increase is high substrate sufficiency applied the appropriate environment maintained and rapid multiplication of the methanogenic microorganisms the behavior observed has been confirmed both najafpour et al 31 and hussain and dubay 19 whom operated working anaerobic reactors with high load rates and palm oil mill effluent and phenolic wastewaters respectively these researches reported both increases in sma and vss at the start up period in a proportional way and in a steady state stage in which only sma increases due to the adaptation to the substrate najafpour et al 31 reported an increased in the vss from 41 7 74 2 g l in an upflow anaerobic sludge fixed film bioreactor which is reflected in an increase in sma from 0 14 to 0 46 kg cod ch4 kg vss d at the beginning of the reactor operation moreover in a steady state an increase in sma of 0 80 kg cod ch4 kg vss d was observed when the vss had a concentration of 75 2 g l additionally hussain and dubey 20 observed in a uasb an increase in the first stage of operation of sma and vss from 0 25 to 0 31 cod ch4 kg vss d and from 38 to 43 g l respectively however when the vss concentration was maintained constant in a second period of uasb operation the sma increased to 0 66 cod ch4 kg vss d furthermore the sma value obtained in this study is similar to other reports for methanogenic activity tests based on an acetoclastic pathway in granular sludge which must be greater than or equal to 0 45 kg cod ch4 kg vss d 32 we want to underscore that our tests after 460 days of operation had a value of 0 81 kg cod ch4 kg vss d indicating an adaptation to the substrate as stated above additionally the sma values obtained from the reactor were higher than that reported by colleran et al 17 who places a reference value of 0 1 kg cod ch4 kg vss d as a criterion of low activity in continuous anaerobic reactors comparing our results with other hybrid or conventional systems table 2 shows sma values lowest than the obtained in this study furthermore the same table shows that systems operating with suspended biomass form had lower values of sma 0 1 0 2 kg cod ch4 kg vss d than granular sludge 0 4 0 8 kg cod ch4 kg vss d the above could be supported by the fact that the suspended biomass has higher specific surface area and suffers greater inhibition in presence of toxic compounds 33 this can indicate the value of sma depends among other factors on physical properties like the granule size the granule size can be a direct parameter to demonstrate the growth and aging process in these microbial consortiums and plays a significant role in the limitation of mass transport and diffusion 34 bhunia and ghangrekar 35 observed that increasing the diameter of the granule in a uasb reactor the value of sma also increased when using granules of 0 27 mm of diameter the maximum value of the sma was 0 5 kg cod ch4 kg vss d when the diameter of granules augmented to 3 mm on average these authors mention that the resistance to substrate diffusion inside the granule increases proportionally with physical size and eventually resulting in substrate deficiency or depletion inside large sized granules 35 however the particle size of the granules of the hybrid reactor was 6 mm while the sedimentation rate was 42 56 m h and both parameters remained was constant in every operation period in this case the large particle size did not imply a problem as the sma showed therefore even it was enough to reduce operational problems like poor sedimentation washing of the biomass and degranulation moreover the granules of the hybrid reactor could reduce the effect of olr increase preserving the stability of the system because of the use of the sma as a strategy the olr is another essential operational condition and allow the mass transfer preventing the accumulation of microorganisms with low activity which improves the biogas production and the characteristics of the biomass 36 in addition ch4 production in our system was increased from 0 16 to 0 84 l d when the olr enhanced from 4 02 10 17 kg dqo m3 d according to wijekoon et al 37 this can be attributed to two facts the increased microbial activity and the increased of organic matter content table 2 shows two different sma values achieved in reactors feeding with swine waste with higher olr s than 10 kg dqo m3 d similar to this study the biggest sma reported by rico 38 0 6 kg cod ch4 kg vss d in a uasb reactor was achieved as a consequence to operate with an olr progressive due to the variation of the hrt 3 2 y 1 5 d which were two fold higher than this study in contrast hill and bolte 39 report a daf reactor with the same strategy increased the olr by a reduction of the hrt progressively obtaining activity values from 0 4 to 0 2 kg cod ch4 kg vss d with hrt s from 5 to 2 d respectively however the principal difference between the two systems was the acclimation period in the first that could have influenced to achieve a higher value in addition sma test was used to measure the methanogenic activity after carry out changes in the operation of both reactors and not as a previous tool to prevent possible inhibition as it happened in the daf system 20 currently limited information is available about the treatment of swine wastewater in integrated hybrid reactors and most of the information reported is on complex systems or operated in different stages 20 the few studies applicable to the swine waste treatment reported the sma test is used only as a technique at the start up of the reactor to measure the quality of the inoculum and not as a periodic control parameter of the system obtaining a poor performance of the systems as well a very low capacity to tolerate high olr as a result it is necessary to monitor any change in the activities of the methanogenic microorganisms in the anaerobic reactors using available techniques sma is attractive because of rapid reliable results with a low cost to employ as routine analysis in this study we observe a positive impact on the anaerobic aerobic hybrid reactor operation allowing suitable olr s applied knowing the limitations of the biomass by sma analysis so as not to affect the removal efficiencies of the pollutants 3 2 operation of the anaerobic aerobic hybrid reactor the three periods in which the hybrid reactor was operated correspond to increases in olr using the previous determination of the sma as a basis eq 2 fig 2 a shows the average removal efficiency of cod during the uasb section 0 174 days which was 65 13 according to akram and stuckey 49 the start up of anaerobic reactors is characterized by a low methanogenic activity related to the growth of the bacteria involved which affects the removal of macropollutants and explains the observed results in the first period of this work however in the later days with the aerobic packed bed from day 188 showed a significant increase leading to the removal of 99 0 2 of cod which coincides with the maximum olr value 10 17 kg cod m3 d additional to these results the hybrid system showed a ts removal of 83 0 54 in the first period after the aerobic packed stage operation the removal ts increased to 93 1 03 and 97 2 62 in the last period considering a ts concentration in the feed of 10 25 g l the above is consistent with liu and tay 50 where high olrs maintain a rapid microbial growth reflected in a greater removal efficiency of macropollutants in this regard continuous increments in methanogenic microbial activity indicate the ability of the reactor to continue operated in even higher olr s 25 nevertheless reactors treating swine wastewater at high olr and without a good strategy to operate the system might cause problems such as overloading acidification risk and therefore process instability 51 in this work the previous determination of the sma had a positive impact on the system operation since these increases were made knowing the limitations of the biomass so as not to affect the removal efficiencies of the contaminants in addition the statistical analysis showed a significant difference at each olr increment due to the sma enhancement additionally the mexican legal standard indicates that the organic matter content expressed in terms of biochemical oxygen demand should not exceed the maximum allowed limit of 150 mg l applicable to wastewater released into rivers whose water is used for agricultural irrigation 52 there is no maximum permissible limit for cod in mexico however given that cod is equivalent approximately to 1 33 times the bod5 the effluent complied with the mexican standards 3 showing a mean concentration in the last operation period of 84 5 mg l further the international standards are stricter than those in mexico for example the maximum permissible limit for using wastewater treated in agriculture in italy is 100 mg l 53 therefore the cod levels in the effluent of this research would comply with the standard for wastewater reuse in some other countries additionally fig 2 b shows that the olr was increased in the hybrid reactor based on the sma of the biomass previously measured yan and tay 21 recommended an solr sma ratio of 0 8 which means an increasing of the olr based on an 80 reduction of biodegradable cod accordingly the olr value during the first operation period was maintained at 88 of the sma this ratio indicating that the system was operating near its maximum load leading to the conclusion that further increments in olr without the prior knowledge about the limitation of the biomass probably have resulted in a sharp increase in volatile fatty acids in the system causing a decrease in the cod removal efficiency whereas in the second period this percentage was 69 and according to these it was assumed that the hybrid system could be loaded at higher olrs furthermore in the third operation period the reactor was at 56 of their capacity stating the hybrid reactor can operate with olr higher than 10 kg dqo m3 d in the future fig 3 shows the total cod and ammonium removal efficiencies according with olr variations from day 0 188 there was a indeed higher ammonium accumulation 183 104 mg l fig 3b and there are within the typical range of discharges from pig farms 3 in addition an increase of ammonium was observed in the effluent of the uasb section of the hybrid reactor recording an outlet concentration of 253 158 mg nh4 n l this process known as ammonification due to the degradation of organic compounds such as urea proteins and amino acids from the excreta of pigs and where the final product is the ammonium ion 54 a similar behavior has been observed in a methanogenic anaerobic system when treating slaughterhouse waste with ammonium concentrations 500 mg l 55 as a result of the ammonification from day 189 an aerobic packed bed section was added to the reactor to increase nitrogen removal which reached an efficiency of 99 83 0 1 fig 3b at the end of the hybrid reactor operation the percentage of nitrogen species in the effluent was 57 the remaining percentage can be attributed to two phenomena in the packed bed section i 11 1 losses by stripping and ii 30 removed as molecular nitrogen by simultaneous nitrification and denitrification the latter due to the nitrates produced on the surface of the biomass which can to penetrate by concentration difference the deeper layers of the biofilm where oxygen is scarce or null resulting in denitrifying metabolic processes 56 table 3 shows a balance of nitrogen species in the hybrid reactor where the no3 n produced in the second and third operation period were 49 and 54 of the total at the influent the results obtained in first generation systems like anaerobic ponds have a removal efficiency of organic matter between 47 and 51 54 conventional reactors such as uasb have removal efficiencies of 70 with an olr of 4 09 kg cod m3 d 57 and 57 removal with an olr of 3 8 kg cod m3 d 6 all those examples have lower efficiencies than this study using an olr higher than 10 kg cod m3 d other authors have reported higher removal efficiencies using more advanced systems than conventional ones deng 15 evaluated the treatment of swine wastewater in a combined system of internal circulation anaerobic reactor and sequencing batch reactor ic sbr and obtained removal efficiencies of 95 5 of organic matter and 99 4 of ammoniacal nitrogen operating with an olr of 7 kg cod m3 d and hrt of 5 6 days however we observe that this last parameter is superior to the one applied to the hybrid system of this study which was 0 79 0 20 days and that operates with higher loads 10 17 kg cod m3 d shin 58 evaluated the combination of two systems an anaerobic up flow bed filter was followed by a submerged membrane bioreactor aubf mbr to treat swine wastewater the efficiency of both systems operating with a maximum olr of 3 kg cod m3 d and in a range of hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 5 7 8 days reports a removal of organic matter of 91 whiles for the removal of ammoniacal nitrogen was 60 it should be noted the hybrid systems operate as uncoupled units while the system evaluated in this study is a single unit in addition we report the removal process of organic matter carried out in anaerobic digestion and removal of ammonium by simultaneous nitrification denitrification in the packed area the latter due to the anoxic microzones formed in the biofilm and to nitrification through autotrophic bacteria in suspension 59 on balance the hybrid anaerobic aerobic system technology is a promising solution for swine wastewater treatment due to the compact reactor required low waste generation and high process efficiency accordingly the anaerobic aerobic hybrid reactor demonstrated a satisfactory performance operating with olr superior to those shown in other studies and very short hrt as well as concentration 200 mg nh4 n l achieving up to 99 removal of the aforementioned compounds in agreement with the advantages above mentioned the authors infer that the integrated anaerobic aerobic hybrid system using the sma as control parameter might be a good option to treat complex wastewater with a high content of organic matter and decreasing the total nitrogen discharges of the reactor some examples of wastewater that can be treat in the hybrid system are from food industry milk and starch production sugar processing and brewery with a high cod 5000 mg l 60 however wastewater with low olr and chemical complexity by the presence of certain compounds as the case of textile wastewater is another option in which the anaerobic zone could be reduce the azo bond resulting aromatic amines that aerobic zone could be completely mineralized by the biofilm and or suspended bacteria 61 finally the hybrid system could be economically advantageous both on a pilot scale or large scale reactor due to the high removal efficiency obtained compared to other systems shown and which have a high energy potential by the biogas production from pig waste 62 goffi et al 63 realized an economic feasibility analysis for selecting wastewater treatment systems thus the hybrid system cost could be inferred for example the cost of the energy demand of the anaerobic aerobic system has a maximum cost of 3 50 usd w person lower than aerobic conventional systems in addition regarding to cost of land used a uasb aerated biofilter similar to hybrid system but decoupled it is up to 90 cheaper than anaerobic ponds commonly used in the swine wastewater treatment due to its compact design furthermore operation investment of an anaerobic aerobic system is more economical 26 67 u d person compared with an aerobic system coupled to tertiary treatment 50 67 usd person and a conventional nitrification denitrification system 45 33 usd person 4 conclusions integrated anaerobic aerobic hybrid reactor showed advantage over other schemes with separate units being a feasible technology for treating real swine wastewater the use of sma to improve its performance provides a value addition to the hybrid technology maintaining a solr sma ratio under 0 8 and achieving an adequate stability with an olr of 10 kg cod m3 d hybrid system complying with current regulations for water bodies discharge achieving high removal efficiencies of cod 99 and a complete ammonium elimination 99 8 the proposal technology could be used for other industrial wastewater with high organic load rates with a possible economic advantage over conventional systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare

14110,in this study performance of a lab scale anaerobic aerobic hybrid reactor treating swine wastewater was evaluated under three different organic loading rates olr the operating of integral hybrid system consisted of two experimental sections first an uasb section and second a uasb section aerobic packed bed with polyethylene rings during the reactor operation three assays of sma were carried out and according to these results 0 26 0 32 and 0 81 kg cod ch4 kg vss d the olr was gradually step increased from 3 26 to 4 02 and finally 10 14 kg cod m3 d with this strategy the removal efficiency of organic matter during the last operational condition increased 34 3 compared to the initial using the sma as a control tool in addition the nitrogen accumulated that could not be removed in the uasb section was treated by the aerobic packed bed by nitrification denitrification simultaneous achieving almost a total removal this removal was attributed 55 11 to nitrification process 30 to denitrification and stripping were 11 1 therefore this anaerobic aerobic hybrid reactor is an integral unit that allowed greater operating efficiencies than other hybrid systems that operate in two or more units and is capable of complying with current regulations for discharge to water bodies keywords organic load rate ammonification hybrid reactor specific methanogenic activity swine wastewater 1 introduction it is estimated that in mexico a pig produces around 0 27 m3 of effluent every month feces and urine 1 and it is report that around 38 of pig farms disposed their wastes without any treatment directly into soils and water bodies 2 in addition other authors reported that almost no farm in mexico complies with mexican regulations for discharge into water and national goods 3 the above mentioned generates a significant impact on the environment owing to the large volumes of solids and wastewater generated in the pig farm whish altering the physical chemical and microbiology composition of solid and water bodies 4 another important pollutant that has been found in the effluent of pig farms is total nitrogen and can be present in a concentration range between 524 to 1907 mg l 3 in this regard systems used to treat porcine effluents are those focused on the removal of organic matter like biodigesters with efficiencies 50 5 anaerobic ponds 56 6 facultative ponds 30 3 and uasb reactors 60 6 on the contrary organic nitrogenous compounds present in the wastewater like proteins amino acids or urea are mainly reduced to ammonia which is poorly degraded on anaerobic conditions 7 limited performance of nitrogen removal has been reported in anaerobic system some examples are those reported by karakashev et al 6 in a uasb reactor with removal efficiencies of 11 and in an anaerobic digester of 0 techio et al 5 reported removal of 56 using anaerobic ponds and biodigesters efficiencies were 17 quite often the low nitrogen removal leads an unsuccessful anaerobic process accompanied with an acidification and negative effects in the biogas production rate therefore these biological processes are ungood enough to produce acceptable quality effluents to reuse in agricultural irrigation or included in the pig farm according to the legal mexican standard due to the need to improve not only the removal of organic matter but also nutrients such as nitrogen new wastewater treatment systems called hybrids have been introduced in the last years which combine biological chemical and or physical processes in a single system or separated units 8 9 anaerobic hybrid reactors have been used to treat successfully industrial effluents recalcitrant compounds and high loads of organic matter such as for example effluents from distilleries 10 slaughterhouses or pig farms 11 hybrid reactors are efficient cost effective and small space requirement 12 in addition the used of support media into the hybrid reactors could improves the developed of biofilm biomass to increase pollutant removal and system stability due to the high sludge retention time srt leads to the formation of bacterial community such as nitrifies and denitrifies microorganisms 13 as a result higher organic matter removal rates and better effluent quality are achieved in these systems compared to conventional processes treatment 14 despite these advantages there are poor reported hybrid technologies to swine wastewater treatment 15 11 in this context it is necessary a new type of integral systems more efficient at higher organic matter and nitrogen removal that operate with short hrt 1 d and high olr 10 kg cod m3 d that allow to treat the significant amounts of swine wastes produced daily the success of hybrid systems depends on the substrate and the quality of the biomass swine wastewater represent a good substrate that promotes the growth of anaerobic microorganisms thanks to its content of carbohydrates 53 hemicellulose and cellulose 20 followed by proteins 20 fats and lipids 7 and a small amount of lignin 4 4 and starch 1 6 16 in addition the high performance of a hybrid reactor which is contained an anaerobic section depends on the presence of an adequate level of methanogenic activity therefore it is necessary to monitor changes in the groups or activities of the methanogenic microorganisms in the digester using such available techniques as a microscope count most probable number coenzyme f420 quantification or the specific methanogenic activity sma 17 the disadvantage of some of these techniques is that is not practical and is too complex to the routine analysis nevertheless the sma technique is more rapid and reliable than the other test 18 sma is defined as the methane production capacity of a specific methanogenic population for a precise substrate where the availability of the substrate is not a limiting factor 19 moreover the sma is also a valuable tool to determine the maximum organic load rate olr to be treated in a system maintaining the capacity of anaerobic microorganisms to remove biodegradable organic matter and produce methane 20 according to yan and tay 21 the olr must correspond to the 60 80 of the sma value which has been proved as appropriate for rapid start up to anaerobic system this ratio resulting in high operating stability and an excellent cod removal in the anaerobic system however a low cod removal and poor stability can result when 80 of the value of the sma is exceeded the sma test can be complemented with the quantification of volatile suspended solids vss to differentiate between active microbial biomass and any other inert particulate material 22 the sma has been used by several authors in various anaerobic processes mchugh et al 23 investigated the microbial community structure with the application the sma test during the start up of psychrophilic anaerobic digesters treating volatile fatty acids vfa and sucrose which reached a high cod removal efficiency 90 at an olr of 20 kg cod m3 d as a consequence of a shift of the dominance response from acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic oktem et al 24 used a sma initial test to control the olr in the range of 3 to 9 kg cod m3 d in a hybrid uasb reactor treating pharmaceutical wastewater evidencing there was no obvious inhibitory effect and a 99 of cod removal was achieved on the contrary wijekoon et al 25 operated a thermophilic anaerobic membrane bioreactor tanmbr to molasses residues treatment the sma test was used before olr changes though the cod removal decreased from 81 to 61 when the olr increasing from 8 to 12 kg cod m3 d based on these reports it is important to emphasize the suitability of the anaerobic aerobic hybrid system in a unique unit for treatment of swine wastewater has been uninvestigated with the contribution of pertinent sma information in this context the aim of this study was to develop an anaerobic aerobic hybrid reactor for the removal of macropollutants from swine wastewater on one hand the removal of the intensest amount of organic matter was carried out through the anaerobic section using the sma as a control tool for the purpose of to improve the operational efficiencies in a hybrid system on the other hand the aerobic packed bed section treated the nitrogen accumulated that could be unremoved by the anaerobic sludge by nitrification denitrification simultaneous 2 materials and methods 2 1 swine wastewater characteristics swine wastewater was obtained from a pig farm located in sonora mexico the parameters evaluated are shown in table 1 and correspond to the effluents generated in a maternity farm the ranges presented correspond to nine sample lots of wastewater analyzed during the 500 days of the operation of the hybrid reactor the swine wastewater fed to the hybrid reactor was previously conditioned in order to reduce the size of large solids and to prevent clogging system pipes the liquid waste efficiently was blende and strain subsequently the wastewater was diluted to achieve by adequate concentration of cod in the influent that fed to the system 2 2 characteristics of the anaerobic and aerobic biomass the anaerobic biomass was obtained from a stable uasb reactor used to treat wastewater from a brewery cervecería cuauhtémoc moctezuma in mexico city the inoculum presented suitable physical characteristics such as an initial concentration of tss of 33 93 g l and vss of 31 71 g l and it was constituted by 96 of granules with an approximate diameter of 0 6 cm with a sedimentation rate of 42 56 m h and a sludge volume index svi of 37 ml g tss in addition the inoculum was previously adapted with brewery wastewater at high olr nitrifying biomass was obtained from an urban wastewater treatment plant located south of ciudad obregón méxico the aerobic biomass had a concentration of 20 4 g l of tss and 7 66 g l of vss the initial physical characteristics of the biomass was a flocculent form with poor sedimentation svi 200 ml g tss 2 3 start up and operation of the anaerobic aerobic hybrid reactor the experiment was carried out in a laboratory scale hybrid reactor with a useful volume between 2 and 3 l a flow rate of 2 82 0 76 l d and hydraulic retention time hrt of 0 79 0 20 days a schematic representation of hybrid reactor is shown in fig 1 the system was configured in two sections a start up and stabilization of the uasb section under anaerobic conditions 0 188 days with an initial volume of 2 l and b uasb section aerobic packed bed 189 500 days with a total volume of 3 l the uasb section was inoculated with 800 ml of anaerobic granular sludge which corresponded to a third of the volume s section the temperature inside the reactor was adjusted by an external thermostatically controlled hot water serpentine on the other hand the aerobic packed bed section was installed which had a volume of 0 9 l with a flow air that supply an average oxygen concentration of 3 35 mg l provide by a flow meter this section was filled with polyethylene rings of 3 cm in diameter and 3 cm in height and a density of 77 8 g l the rings used as support media promoted the colonization of a biofilm inside and outside of them the operation of the hybrid reactor was divided in three periods in which the olr was increased progressively the sma measure was used previously to stablish each change in the olr as control tool for the reactor operation the olr was gradually increased from 3 26 0 174 days up to 4 02 175 459 days and finally to 10 17 kg cod m3 d 460 500 days according to the sma test results therefore the system constantly operated below its maximum olr established by the sma test avoiding exceeding the capacity of the anaerobic microorganisms due to the supplied substrate finally the olr increments were made by increasing the cod concentration in the feeding trying to have a constant flow 2 4 determination of specific methanogenic activity sma anaerobic biomass was sampled in the days 0 175 and 460 during the reactor operation in order to quantify their specific activities sma assays were performed in 60 ml serological bottles with a working volume of 20 ml 4 ml of the anaerobic consortium and 16 ml of a mineral medium g l nah2po4 h2o 0 703 k2hpo4 0 600 nh4cl 0 500 mgso4 7h2o 0 111 cacl2 2h2o 0 100 and nahco3 3 000 the operating conditions of the anaerobic tests were a substrate biomass ratio of 0 4 g cod g vss a temperature of 37 2 c and a ph of 7 quantification of produced ch4 was carried out by gas chromatography fisher gas partitioner model 1200 with a thermal conductivity detector and a porapak q column the sma value eq 1 was estimated by plotting the production of ch4 kg of cod against time days and dividing by the amount of vss added to each bottle 1 sma kg cod c h 4 kg vss d methane production kg cod c h4 d biomass kg vss once the sma was determined the maximum olr allowed by the reactor kg cod ch4 m3 d was calculated with eq 2 2 olr k g c o d m 3 d v l v r vss sma where vl is the volume of biomass in the reactor m3 vr is the reactor volume m3 vss is the amount of volatile suspended solids kg m3 and the sma value of the biomass kg cod ch4 kg vss d 2 5 analytical methods the anaerobic biomass was used to calculate the sedimentation velocity the sludge volume index svi and the distribution size of the granules which was measured through 6 and 4 mm sieves in the influent and effluent of the hybrid reactor the following analyzes were performed cod total solids ts total volatile solids tvs no3 n no2 n nh4 n according to the 26 other parameters such as vfas and alkalinity were also monitored following the method described by anderson and yang 27 and proteins and carbohydrates using the methodology of lowry 28 and michael 29 respectively 2 6 statistical analysis of results the results are expressed as means standard deviation the data were analyzed using two way analysis of variance anova with minitab software version 17 0 when the anova identified differences among groups multiple comparisons among the means were performed using hsd honestly significant difference tukey a significance level of p 0 05 was chosen 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of specific methanogenic activity sma in this study three sma values were obtained for the anaerobic biomass in three different operational times of the hybrid reactor on day 0 the sma was 0 26 kg cod ch4 kg vss d increased to 0 32 on day 175 and finally to 0 81 on day 460 the statistical analysis shows that the mentioned increases in the sma of the hybrid system improved and were significantly different for each of the periods even without detecting a notable increase in the vss from operational periods two to three during the first operation period 0 174 days the increase in vss 31 71 55 44 g l is attributed to the stage of exponential growth of the microorganisms at the start up of the process and as consequence of the adaptation of the biomass is possible to promote the growth of the methanogenic microorganisms and increase the sma 30 however in the third operational period 460 500 days there was no significant increase in the biomass concentration 57 04 g l with respect to the second period so it is inferred that the increase in sma is because the same microorganisms were capable to adapt to the swine wastewater a distinct behavior was found by yan and tay 21 who report a sma increase from 0 07 to 1 4 kg cod ch4 kg almost immediately after uasb reactor start up due to the easy biodegradability of the substrate glucose and peptone since it would be wiser to start with a more biodegradable substrate than swine wastewater and which leads to the rapid bacterial adaptation generally the increase in sma is due to an increase in the biomass concentration or its adaptation to specific types of wastewaters 31 moreover other reasons for the sma increase is high substrate sufficiency applied the appropriate environment maintained and rapid multiplication of the methanogenic microorganisms the behavior observed has been confirmed both najafpour et al 31 and hussain and dubay 19 whom operated working anaerobic reactors with high load rates and palm oil mill effluent and phenolic wastewaters respectively these researches reported both increases in sma and vss at the start up period in a proportional way and in a steady state stage in which only sma increases due to the adaptation to the substrate najafpour et al 31 reported an increased in the vss from 41 7 74 2 g l in an upflow anaerobic sludge fixed film bioreactor which is reflected in an increase in sma from 0 14 to 0 46 kg cod ch4 kg vss d at the beginning of the reactor operation moreover in a steady state an increase in sma of 0 80 kg cod ch4 kg vss d was observed when the vss had a concentration of 75 2 g l additionally hussain and dubey 20 observed in a uasb an increase in the first stage of operation of sma and vss from 0 25 to 0 31 cod ch4 kg vss d and from 38 to 43 g l respectively however when the vss concentration was maintained constant in a second period of uasb operation the sma increased to 0 66 cod ch4 kg vss d furthermore the sma value obtained in this study is similar to other reports for methanogenic activity tests based on an acetoclastic pathway in granular sludge which must be greater than or equal to 0 45 kg cod ch4 kg vss d 32 we want to underscore that our tests after 460 days of operation had a value of 0 81 kg cod ch4 kg vss d indicating an adaptation to the substrate as stated above additionally the sma values obtained from the reactor were higher than that reported by colleran et al 17 who places a reference value of 0 1 kg cod ch4 kg vss d as a criterion of low activity in continuous anaerobic reactors comparing our results with other hybrid or conventional systems table 2 shows sma values lowest than the obtained in this study furthermore the same table shows that systems operating with suspended biomass form had lower values of sma 0 1 0 2 kg cod ch4 kg vss d than granular sludge 0 4 0 8 kg cod ch4 kg vss d the above could be supported by the fact that the suspended biomass has higher specific surface area and suffers greater inhibition in presence of toxic compounds 33 this can indicate the value of sma depends among other factors on physical properties like the granule size the granule size can be a direct parameter to demonstrate the growth and aging process in these microbial consortiums and plays a significant role in the limitation of mass transport and diffusion 34 bhunia and ghangrekar 35 observed that increasing the diameter of the granule in a uasb reactor the value of sma also increased when using granules of 0 27 mm of diameter the maximum value of the sma was 0 5 kg cod ch4 kg vss d when the diameter of granules augmented to 3 mm on average these authors mention that the resistance to substrate diffusion inside the granule increases proportionally with physical size and eventually resulting in substrate deficiency or depletion inside large sized granules 35 however the particle size of the granules of the hybrid reactor was 6 mm while the sedimentation rate was 42 56 m h and both parameters remained was constant in every operation period in this case the large particle size did not imply a problem as the sma showed therefore even it was enough to reduce operational problems like poor sedimentation washing of the biomass and degranulation moreover the granules of the hybrid reactor could reduce the effect of olr increase preserving the stability of the system because of the use of the sma as a strategy the olr is another essential operational condition and allow the mass transfer preventing the accumulation of microorganisms with low activity which improves the biogas production and the characteristics of the biomass 36 in addition ch4 production in our system was increased from 0 16 to 0 84 l d when the olr enhanced from 4 02 10 17 kg dqo m3 d according to wijekoon et al 37 this can be attributed to two facts the increased microbial activity and the increased of organic matter content table 2 shows two different sma values achieved in reactors feeding with swine waste with higher olr s than 10 kg dqo m3 d similar to this study the biggest sma reported by rico 38 0 6 kg cod ch4 kg vss d in a uasb reactor was achieved as a consequence to operate with an olr progressive due to the variation of the hrt 3 2 y 1 5 d which were two fold higher than this study in contrast hill and bolte 39 report a daf reactor with the same strategy increased the olr by a reduction of the hrt progressively obtaining activity values from 0 4 to 0 2 kg cod ch4 kg vss d with hrt s from 5 to 2 d respectively however the principal difference between the two systems was the acclimation period in the first that could have influenced to achieve a higher value in addition sma test was used to measure the methanogenic activity after carry out changes in the operation of both reactors and not as a previous tool to prevent possible inhibition as it happened in the daf system 20 currently limited information is available about the treatment of swine wastewater in integrated hybrid reactors and most of the information reported is on complex systems or operated in different stages 20 the few studies applicable to the swine waste treatment reported the sma test is used only as a technique at the start up of the reactor to measure the quality of the inoculum and not as a periodic control parameter of the system obtaining a poor performance of the systems as well a very low capacity to tolerate high olr as a result it is necessary to monitor any change in the activities of the methanogenic microorganisms in the anaerobic reactors using available techniques sma is attractive because of rapid reliable results with a low cost to employ as routine analysis in this study we observe a positive impact on the anaerobic aerobic hybrid reactor operation allowing suitable olr s applied knowing the limitations of the biomass by sma analysis so as not to affect the removal efficiencies of the pollutants 3 2 operation of the anaerobic aerobic hybrid reactor the three periods in which the hybrid reactor was operated correspond to increases in olr using the previous determination of the sma as a basis eq 2 fig 2 a shows the average removal efficiency of cod during the uasb section 0 174 days which was 65 13 according to akram and stuckey 49 the start up of anaerobic reactors is characterized by a low methanogenic activity related to the growth of the bacteria involved which affects the removal of macropollutants and explains the observed results in the first period of this work however in the later days with the aerobic packed bed from day 188 showed a significant increase leading to the removal of 99 0 2 of cod which coincides with the maximum olr value 10 17 kg cod m3 d additional to these results the hybrid system showed a ts removal of 83 0 54 in the first period after the aerobic packed stage operation the removal ts increased to 93 1 03 and 97 2 62 in the last period considering a ts concentration in the feed of 10 25 g l the above is consistent with liu and tay 50 where high olrs maintain a rapid microbial growth reflected in a greater removal efficiency of macropollutants in this regard continuous increments in methanogenic microbial activity indicate the ability of the reactor to continue operated in even higher olr s 25 nevertheless reactors treating swine wastewater at high olr and without a good strategy to operate the system might cause problems such as overloading acidification risk and therefore process instability 51 in this work the previous determination of the sma had a positive impact on the system operation since these increases were made knowing the limitations of the biomass so as not to affect the removal efficiencies of the contaminants in addition the statistical analysis showed a significant difference at each olr increment due to the sma enhancement additionally the mexican legal standard indicates that the organic matter content expressed in terms of biochemical oxygen demand should not exceed the maximum allowed limit of 150 mg l applicable to wastewater released into rivers whose water is used for agricultural irrigation 52 there is no maximum permissible limit for cod in mexico however given that cod is equivalent approximately to 1 33 times the bod5 the effluent complied with the mexican standards 3 showing a mean concentration in the last operation period of 84 5 mg l further the international standards are stricter than those in mexico for example the maximum permissible limit for using wastewater treated in agriculture in italy is 100 mg l 53 therefore the cod levels in the effluent of this research would comply with the standard for wastewater reuse in some other countries additionally fig 2 b shows that the olr was increased in the hybrid reactor based on the sma of the biomass previously measured yan and tay 21 recommended an solr sma ratio of 0 8 which means an increasing of the olr based on an 80 reduction of biodegradable cod accordingly the olr value during the first operation period was maintained at 88 of the sma this ratio indicating that the system was operating near its maximum load leading to the conclusion that further increments in olr without the prior knowledge about the limitation of the biomass probably have resulted in a sharp increase in volatile fatty acids in the system causing a decrease in the cod removal efficiency whereas in the second period this percentage was 69 and according to these it was assumed that the hybrid system could be loaded at higher olrs furthermore in the third operation period the reactor was at 56 of their capacity stating the hybrid reactor can operate with olr higher than 10 kg dqo m3 d in the future fig 3 shows the total cod and ammonium removal efficiencies according with olr variations from day 0 188 there was a indeed higher ammonium accumulation 183 104 mg l fig 3b and there are within the typical range of discharges from pig farms 3 in addition an increase of ammonium was observed in the effluent of the uasb section of the hybrid reactor recording an outlet concentration of 253 158 mg nh4 n l this process known as ammonification due to the degradation of organic compounds such as urea proteins and amino acids from the excreta of pigs and where the final product is the ammonium ion 54 a similar behavior has been observed in a methanogenic anaerobic system when treating slaughterhouse waste with ammonium concentrations 500 mg l 55 as a result of the ammonification from day 189 an aerobic packed bed section was added to the reactor to increase nitrogen removal which reached an efficiency of 99 83 0 1 fig 3b at the end of the hybrid reactor operation the percentage of nitrogen species in the effluent was 57 the remaining percentage can be attributed to two phenomena in the packed bed section i 11 1 losses by stripping and ii 30 removed as molecular nitrogen by simultaneous nitrification and denitrification the latter due to the nitrates produced on the surface of the biomass which can to penetrate by concentration difference the deeper layers of the biofilm where oxygen is scarce or null resulting in denitrifying metabolic processes 56 table 3 shows a balance of nitrogen species in the hybrid reactor where the no3 n produced in the second and third operation period were 49 and 54 of the total at the influent the results obtained in first generation systems like anaerobic ponds have a removal efficiency of organic matter between 47 and 51 54 conventional reactors such as uasb have removal efficiencies of 70 with an olr of 4 09 kg cod m3 d 57 and 57 removal with an olr of 3 8 kg cod m3 d 6 all those examples have lower efficiencies than this study using an olr higher than 10 kg cod m3 d other authors have reported higher removal efficiencies using more advanced systems than conventional ones deng 15 evaluated the treatment of swine wastewater in a combined system of internal circulation anaerobic reactor and sequencing batch reactor ic sbr and obtained removal efficiencies of 95 5 of organic matter and 99 4 of ammoniacal nitrogen operating with an olr of 7 kg cod m3 d and hrt of 5 6 days however we observe that this last parameter is superior to the one applied to the hybrid system of this study which was 0 79 0 20 days and that operates with higher loads 10 17 kg cod m3 d shin 58 evaluated the combination of two systems an anaerobic up flow bed filter was followed by a submerged membrane bioreactor aubf mbr to treat swine wastewater the efficiency of both systems operating with a maximum olr of 3 kg cod m3 d and in a range of hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 5 7 8 days reports a removal of organic matter of 91 whiles for the removal of ammoniacal nitrogen was 60 it should be noted the hybrid systems operate as uncoupled units while the system evaluated in this study is a single unit in addition we report the removal process of organic matter carried out in anaerobic digestion and removal of ammonium by simultaneous nitrification denitrification in the packed area the latter due to the anoxic microzones formed in the biofilm and to nitrification through autotrophic bacteria in suspension 59 on balance the hybrid anaerobic aerobic system technology is a promising solution for swine wastewater treatment due to the compact reactor required low waste generation and high process efficiency accordingly the anaerobic aerobic hybrid reactor demonstrated a satisfactory performance operating with olr superior to those shown in other studies and very short hrt as well as concentration 200 mg nh4 n l achieving up to 99 removal of the aforementioned compounds in agreement with the advantages above mentioned the authors infer that the integrated anaerobic aerobic hybrid system using the sma as control parameter might be a good option to treat complex wastewater with a high content of organic matter and decreasing the total nitrogen discharges of the reactor some examples of wastewater that can be treat in the hybrid system are from food industry milk and starch production sugar processing and brewery with a high cod 5000 mg l 60 however wastewater with low olr and chemical complexity by the presence of certain compounds as the case of textile wastewater is another option in which the anaerobic zone could be reduce the azo bond resulting aromatic amines that aerobic zone could be completely mineralized by the biofilm and or suspended bacteria 61 finally the hybrid system could be economically advantageous both on a pilot scale or large scale reactor due to the high removal efficiency obtained compared to other systems shown and which have a high energy potential by the biogas production from pig waste 62 goffi et al 63 realized an economic feasibility analysis for selecting wastewater treatment systems thus the hybrid system cost could be inferred for example the cost of the energy demand of the anaerobic aerobic system has a maximum cost of 3 50 usd w person lower than aerobic conventional systems in addition regarding to cost of land used a uasb aerated biofilter similar to hybrid system but decoupled it is up to 90 cheaper than anaerobic ponds commonly used in the swine wastewater treatment due to its compact design furthermore operation investment of an anaerobic aerobic system is more economical 26 67 u d person compared with an aerobic system coupled to tertiary treatment 50 67 usd person and a conventional nitrification denitrification system 45 33 usd person 4 conclusions integrated anaerobic aerobic hybrid reactor showed advantage over other schemes with separate units being a feasible technology for treating real swine wastewater the use of sma to improve its performance provides a value addition to the hybrid technology maintaining a solr sma ratio under 0 8 and achieving an adequate stability with an olr of 10 kg cod m3 d hybrid system complying with current regulations for water bodies discharge achieving high removal efficiencies of cod 99 and a complete ammonium elimination 99 8 the proposal

14111,this paper presents a new approach to recover energy and producing freshwater from an oil and gas field using a reverse osmosis ro system we proposed three different ro system configurations i the ro system without energy recovery i e configuration 1 ii the ro system with one energy recovery device i e configuration 2 and iii the ro system with two energy recovery devices i e configuration 3 each specific energy consumption sec was then analyzed by solving the mathematical model of ro using matlab software as the feed pressure increased from 4 559 to 6 586 mpa the sec decreased from 12 235 to 0 977 kw h m3 for configuration 1 from 10 680 to 0 727 kw h m3 for configuration 2 and from 3 367 to 0 323 kw h m3 for configuration 3 respectively thus indicating the lowest sec in configuration 3 in addition the sensitivity analysis results showed that the sec decreases significantly with an increase in the stream crude oil natural gas and produced water pressure flow rate and density in conclusion the ro system of configuration 3 exhibited a significant decrease in sec and freshwater from the ro system makes it beneficial in water scarce regions keywords desalination

are steadily decreasing due to population growth and increased living standards therefore freshwater production is necessary to meet growing demand which can be achieved through the desalination of seawater and brackish water 1 2 many countries have arid regions away from the coast so desalination of produced water is an alternative to desalination of seawater and brackish water in such countries exploration and production companies work on the extraction of crude oil and natural gas produced water is associated with hydrocarbons in the subsurface when crude oil and natural gas are extracted from the subsurface and it comes as a by product 3 4 produced water comes from the subsurface and contains traces of oil and large quantities of suspended solids that must be separated before being treated in the desalination process 4 5 produced water can cause corrosion in the system because it contains large number of impurities e g total organic content total dissolved solids and total suspended solids and corrosive materials e g sodium chloride and sulphate that are hazardous to the environment and thus it cannot be left untreated 6 9 produced water is always associated with oil and gas but the ratio of the fluids varies with respect to location and time of production 10 11 the quantity of produced water from a given reservoir can reach up to 2 times that of the hydrocarbons produced from the same reservoir in the later stages of production the percentage of produced water reaches up to 90 with only 10 hydrocarbons 12 14 without pre treatment desalination of produced water causes coagulation degradation due to suspended solids and the presence of oil 15 16 therefore the water flux decreases and a large pressure drop occurs in the desalination system 17 18 if the produced water contains microbial particles they evolve very quickly due to concentration polarization producing colonies and fouling is caused on the surface of the membrane therefore it is necessary to desalinate produced water and make it feasible for use 12 desalination processes are classified into two categories thermal and membrane desalination thermal desalination includes multi stage flash msf membrane distillation md and multi effect distillation med 19 membrane desalination includes reverse osmosis ro which separates water and impurities via diffusion principle 20 22 ro membranes remove all dissolved particles floating particles and suspended particles from the feed solution provide freshwater on the other side of the membrane 20 23 25 ro is a pressure driven method that uses a high pressure pump to pressurize the feed the advantage of the ro method over other desalination methods such as nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf is that it can purify different types of water with good performance low cost and low energy consumption 19 26 29 an ro system consists of three stages pre treatment ro main module and post treatment the ro pre treatment system uses filters to remove small floating particles like organic and biological substances the second stage is the ro module which removes salt and other impurities present in the feed water finally the post treatment system is used to add particles which are needed to provide appropriate characteristics to the freshwater 30 ro systems use crossflow filtration and a spiral wound design which is a widely used type of module for ro desalination 31 therefore ro is one of the techniques used to desalinate produced water 32 34 ro uses energy recovery devices to recover energy from brine and then transfers to high pressure pumps the specific energy consumption of ro varies between 6 7 and 8 kw h m3 which is less than other commercially available desalination techniques such as multi effect distillation med approximately 45 kw h m3 and multi stage flash msf approximately 51 7 kw h m3 35 in ro process energy recovery is affected by concentration polarization resistance and membrane fouling 36 there are five approaches for reducing energy consumption in the ro process the use of a high permeable membrane energy recovery device chemical demineralization renewable energy sources and optimization techniques 37 the first large ro plant for desalination of produced water was the mt poso plant in california 38 ҫakmakce et al reported an assessment of the desalination of produced water via ro and employed mf or nf as a pretreatment method they suggested mf as an excellent alternative to pretreatment of the ro desalination process in terms of permeate flux and water quality 32 ersahin et al examined the seawater sw and brackish water bw ro membranes for desalting the produced water and showed salt rejection and permeation flux of sw 90 and 12 7 l m2h respectively and bw membranes 70 and 9 4 l m2h respectively they also found that the energy consumption and water production cost of the ro desalination plant were 5 7 kw h m3 and 0 98 us m3 respectively 39 piemonte et al presented an assessment of produced water desalination by an ro process using three different feed concentrations i e 35546 71127 and 106 670 ppm and found that increasing feed concentrations reduced water production from 14 892 to 8322 and then 1748 m3 year 34 melo et al used ro and nf techniques to desalinate produced water via the pilot plant when the feed tds and salinity were 816 and 625 mg l for ro and 631 and 782 mg l for nf at a feed pressure of 15 bar the permeate tds and salinity were 33 and 18 mg l for ro and 35 and 44 mg l for nf 12 alzahrani et al used nf and ro membranes to desalinate produced water and the results showed that the total organic content toc and total dissolved solids tds were 6 7 and 244 mg l for the ro membrane and 22 9 and 520 mg l for the nf membrane respectively 40 thiel et al presented ro and other desalination methods for desalinating shale gas produced water and showed the energy consumption of ro med mechanical vapor compression mvc humidification dehumidification hdh permeate gap membrane distillation pgmd and forward osmosis fo the corresponding values were 15 200 28 400 500 and 600 kw h m3 respectively 41 most of the aforementioned studies have explored the ro desalination of produced water and focused on estimating its energy consumption and energy recovery from brine solutions however no studies have been conducted considering energy recovery from subsurface streams therefore this study focuses on the feasibility assessment of three different ro desalination configurations applicable to the oil and gas industry i the ro system without an energy recovery device configuration 1 ii the ro system with an energy recovery device configuration 2 and iii the ro system with two energy recovery devices configuration 3 the proposed approach i e configuration 3 was used to minimize the energy consumption of the ro desalination system the main objective of this study was to model and simulate an ro plant for produced water desalination and determine the energy consumption of the system in addition the study focused on energy recovery and sensitivity analysis with respect to key operating parameters e g feed pressure feed temperature and water recovery 2 system description in this study an oil and gas plant is considered as shown in fig 1 in the earth s subsurface there are three types of fluids natural gas crude oil and produced water the main stream of the plant is crude oil however the other two fluids associated with oil are natural gas and produced water over time natural gas and produced water also rise to the surface with crude oil when the well reaches its saturation stage the production of produced water and natural gas increases when the stream of fluids crude oil natural gas and produced water reaches the surface it flows to a separation plant through pipelines the crude oil natural gas and produced water from all wells combine at a gathering system after the gathering system the fluids enter the separator for the separation process which depends on the density effect gas has the lowest density and it is obtained from the top of the separator the density of crude oil lies between natural gas and produced water therefore it is obtained from the middle of the separator produced water is denser than oil and natural gas so it is extracted from the bottom of the separator produced water then enters the ro system for purification in ro process energy consumption accounts for approximately 35 of the overall cost of operation 42 therefore several techniques for recovering energy from brine have been proposed but it cannot be recovered completely 42 in this study three configurations are proposed for the ro system with respect to its electrical energy consumption configuration 1 the ro system without an energy recovery system configuration 2 the ro system with an energy recovery device configuration 3 the ro system with two energy recovery devices the first configuration includes only an ro system to remove undesired particles from produced water it includes a high pressure pump to pressurize the feed in order to drive fluid across the membrane the second configuration comprises of using a kaplan turbine and generator after the ro process to recover energy from the brine pressure and flow rate configuration 3 is the novel idea presented in this study it constitutes the installation of a pelton turbine and generator before the three phase separator to recover energy that would otherwise be wasted 2 1 configuration 1 the stream of fluids enters the production system by the production tubing the fluids contain intrinsic pressure to reach the surface of the earth upon reaching the surface the stream enters the christmas tree which is the upper part of a producing well after moving through the christmas tree the stream of fluids moves through pipelines and mixes in the gathering system where production from all wells is combined after mixing the stream moves to the three phase separator where separation takes place with respect to the density and specific gravity of the fluids a schematic diagram of configuration 1 is shown in fig 2 after pre treatment the produced water enters the ro main stage where it interacts with membranes in this system permeate is achieved in a spiral direction and is appropriate for usage 2 2 configuration 2 two types of turbines are widely used in ro energy recovery systems pelton and kaplan turbines 43 in the early 1980 s francis turbines were used for energy recovery systems but after some time newly developed pelton turbines were introduced to the market which replaced francis turbines pelton turbines are currently being used in ro seawater desalination systems 44 when the feed passes through the membranes two streams are recovered the first is the permeate freshwater which moves in a spiral direction and the second is retentate brine which is recovered in an axial direction at a certain pressure and flow rate fig 3 showed a schematic diagram of configuration 2 where the stream of fluids came from wells in a similar manner of that seen in configuration 1 however configuration 2 incorporated an energy recovery system which extracted the energy from the pressure and flow rate of the brine retentate the energy recovery system used in configuration 2 includes a kaplan turbine with a generator the kaplan turbine extracted the fluid power which moved the turbine and the generator converted the fluid power to electrical power which was then provided to the high pressure pump 2 3 configuration 3 in the three phase separator there is no need for a high pressure as the fluids are separated due to settling time in which energy pressure is wasted instead there is the possibility of recovering this energy from the fluid and using it to power the high pressure pump of the ro system therefore configuration 3 includes a pelton turbine with a generator installed before the three phase separator the pelton turbine is installed before the separator to derive energy from moving fluid the turbine converts fluid energy to mechanical energy while the generator converts mechanical energy to electrical energy and utilizes it to power the high pressure pump of the ro system in configuration 3 energy was recovered from the brine solution using a kaplan turbine operating with a low pressure head while a pelton turbine operating with a medium pressure head was installed in front of the three phase separator a schematic diagram of configuration 3 is shown in fig 4 3 theory 3 1 theoretical model the ro principle consists of three stages absorption of a feed solution at the surface of the membrane diffusion through the membrane and desorption of pure water from the permeate side of the membrane ro membranes are semi permeable which allows water to move through them but restricts the movement of other molecules pressure is applied to the feed side of the membrane to overcome the osmotic pressure of the feed solution separating pure water from the undesirable brine 19 fig 5 schematically describes this process a mathematical model has been used to analyse the ro system the model used in the present study was taken from 45 47 this study focuses on the spiral wound module of the ro process water flux and salt flux are important properties of the ro system which are directly dependent on applied pressure and concentration of the feed when the percentage of dissolved and suspended particles in the feed solution is large the water flux will be small if there is a small rejection of suspended and dissolved particles from the feed solution the salt flux will decrease the solution diffusion technique is used to determine the water and salt flux of the ro system the water flux can be calculated using the following expression 1 j v a w δ p δ π where jv denotes the water flux aw denotes the water permeability coefficient δp denotes the

concentration of the water molecules bs can be calculated as 48 6 b s d j k j ρ where dj denotes the diffusion coefficient and kj denotes the membrane liquid sorption coefficient when a certain amount of dissolved and suspended particles are removed through the ro membrane some of the particles are deposited at the surface through a phenomenon called concentration polarization concentration polarization affects the ro membrane efficiency by attacking its performance and ability to permeate water molecules concentration polarization can be determined from the following equation 7 c w c p c b c p e j v k where cw denotes the concentration at the membrane and k denotes the mass transfer coefficient the properties of the fluid change with respect to its location in the ro unit srinivasan et al 2011 assumed that permeate concentration does not change with respect to the location of the permeate channel the permeate pressure and concentration can be kept constant but the brine concentration and pressure changes along the channel length as shown in fig 6 47 the solvent flux depends directly on the transmembrane pressure at a distance x and can be described by the following equation 8 j v x a w δ p x 1 a w γ b s t c p where δp x denotes the transmembrane pressure at a distance x when the fluid moves through the feed channel a pressure drop occurs from pi to po representing the inlet and outlet of the module respectively this pressure drop is due to the friction of the fluid as it flows through the feed channel here darcy s law can be applied to solve the pressure gradient d p x d x at a distance x which directly depends on the volumetric flow rate f x 47 9 d p x d x b f x where b denotes the proportionality constant solvent flux can be determined by considering the axial gradient of flow rate d f x d x 10 j v x 1 w d f x d x where w denotes the membrane width the above equations are derived and solved to determine the brine flow rate fo brine

here δpi and δpo can be found from respectively 17 δ p i p i p p 18 δ p o p o p p the brine pressure po brine concentration co and brine flow rate fo can be found from the following equations respectively 19 f o f i cosh ϕ ϕ sinh ϕ b l δ p i 20 p o p i b l ϕ sinh ϕ f i f o cosh ϕ 1 21 c o c p f i c i c p f o the salt concentrations at the inlet and outlet of permeate side can be calculated

salt rejection sr can be found from the equation 24 s r 1 c p c o the mass transfer coefficient changes from the inlet to the outlet because of change in parameters such as pressure flow rate and concentration these parameters change with respect to location along the length of the feed channel thus the mass transfer coefficient can be calculated at the inlet and outlet of the module as 25 k i

feed channel which can be calculated as 31 d e 2 t f where tf denotes the feed spacer thickness water recovery r through the ro module can be determined from 32 r f p f i as the feed solution flows

diameter for the simulation of ro system the mathematical model was solved using the matlab 2017a software an iterative method was used to find the concentration of permeate through the described model initially its value was assumed to be half of the concentration of the feed a flow chart of the described model is presented in fig 7 3 2 model validation the ro model discussed in the previous section is validated with experimental data from the literature the model is taken from 45 47 and was validated with experimental results 47 the simulation and experimental data are presented in figs 8 10 the operating parameters were feed flow rate fi feed pressure pi temperature t and feed concentration ci these parameters were used to obtain the output parameters that are salt rejection sr permeate concentration cp and brine flow rate fo the operating conditions were as follows feed flow rate 2 166 10 4 m3 s feed pressure 0 591 to 1 376 mpa temperature 32 5 and feed concentration 0 819 mol m3 fig 8 presents the salt rejection sr with respect to feed pressure pi it can be concluded that with an increase in feed pressure from 0 591 to 1 376 mpa the salt rejection increases and fig 8 shows that the maximum relative error of salt rejection sr was 3 at a feed pressure of 1 376 mpa in addition fig 9 presents the permeate concentration profile with respect to the feed pressure pi and it was found that with an increase in feed pressure from 0 591 to 1 376 mpa the permeate concentration cp decreases but a point comes when the permeate concentration ceases to decrease and the line become stable fig 9 shows that the maximum relative error of permeate concentration cp was 1 5 at a feed pressure of 0 591 mpa further it can be seen in fig 10 that the increase in feed pressure from 0 591 to 1 376 mpa causes a decrease in the brine flow rate fo and the maximum relative error of the brine flow rate was 5 5 at a feed pressure of 1 376 mpa hence the simulation results were in consistent with the experimental results 4 results and discussions in the ro process pressure is applied to the feed solution leading the water to move through the membrane while removing ions molecules and larger particles to make it drinkable the membrane is made up of a polymer material that separates water from impurities detailed specifications of the ro module are presented in table 1 the effective area of the membrane module was 8 5 m2 other operating parameters were kept constant at a temperature of 25 feed concentration of 396 mol m3 and a flow rate of 0 217 l s a schematic diagram of the ro module with its membrane was shown in fig 11 the ro process requires energy for high pressure pumps and the specific energy consumption sec of the high pressure pump in configuration 1 was given by 35 s e c p w f p where pw denotes the electrical energy required by high pressure pump and can be determined from 36 p w f i p i e h p where ehp denotes the efficiency of the high pressure pump an energy recovery device was used to recover the energy from the brine side in configuration 2 a kaplan turbine was used to recover energy from the brine and it was determined as 51 37 p r η e r s p o f o where pr denotes the electrical energy recovered from the brine solution and ηers denotes the efficiency of the kaplan turbine installed in the brine side after recovering the electrical energy from the brine solution eq 35 can be modified for configuration 2 as 38 s e c p w p r f p all of the oil fields produce different amounts of crude oil natural gas and produced water for configuration 3 oil field data was taken from 52 which presented the daily production of crude oil natural gas and produced water as shown in table 2 the pressure head was calculated as 53 39 h 2 31 p s γ s where h denotes the pressure head and ps and γs denote the stream pressure and specific gravity of the fluid e g crude oil natural gas and produced water before the separator respectively in addition the electrical energy obtained from the fluid stream through the pelton turbine can be calculated as 40 p e η f ρ s f s g h s where ηf denotes the pelton turbine efficiency ρs denotes the density of the stream e g oil gas and produced water before the separator fs denotes the flow rate of the stream before the separator g denotes the gravitational constant and hs denotes the pressure head of the stream before the separator since energy is recovered through a pelton turbine installed in front of the three phase separator eq 38 can be modified for configuration 3 as follows 41 s e c p w p r p e f p 4 1 parametric study on ro configurations figs 12 14 compared the effect of the feed pressure temperature and water recovery on the electrical energy consumption and sec of the three configurations fig 12 shows the trade off between electrical energy consumption and sec with increasing feed pressure this phenomenon indicates that increasing the feed pressure enhances the permeate flow rate and ultimately lowers the sec of the system as shown in fig 12a as the feed pressure increased from 4 559 to 6 586 mpa the electrical energy consumption increased from 1 317 to 1 902 kw configuration 1 from 1 149 to 1 416 kw configuration 2 and from 0 362 to 0 629 kw configuration 3 in contrast increasing the feed pressure decreased the sec from 12 235 to 0 977 kw h m3 in configuration 1 from 10 680 to 0 727 kw h m3 in configuration 2 and from 3 367 to 0 323 kw h m3 in configuration 3 fig 12b fig 13 shows that increasing the feed temperature does not affect electrical energy consumption but does affect the sec of the system this is due to an increase in osmotic pressure which ultimately increases the sec as the feed temperature increased from 10 to 30 the electrical energy consumption of configuration 1 was kept constant at 1 317 kw while the values of configurations 2 and 3 increased from 1 121 to 1 159 kw and from 0 334 to 0 372 kw respectively fig 13a meanwhile as shown in fig 13b increasing the feed temperature increased the sec from 4 341 to 30 729 kw h m3 configuration 1 from 3 697 to 27 043 kw h m3 configuration 2 and from 1 102 to 8 676 kw h m3 configuration 3 fig 14 shows that increasing the ro system s water recovery has no significant effect on electrical energy consumption however the higher the water recovery the higher the permeate flow rate resulting in a lower sec as illustrated in fig 14a increasing water recovery from 13 8 to 33 1 reduced electrical energy consumption from 1 317 to 1 256 kw configuration 1 from 1 149 to 1 073 kw configuration 2 and from 0 362 to 0 286 kw configuration 3 in addition as the water recovery increased the sec of configurations 1 2 and 3 decreased from 12 235 to 5 103 kw h m3 from 10 680 to 4 358 kw h m3 and from 3 367 to 1 161 kw h m3 respectively this indicates that the installation of kaplan and pelton turbines has reduced electrical energy consumption making it essential to use this technique to reduce energy consumption in oil and gas industries it is well known that ro processes require a higher feed pressure than the osmotic pressure that restricts the flow of permeate through the ro membrane as the feed flows through the ro module friction losses occur due to fluid concentration viscosity and module characteristics causing pressure loss due to friction in addition as the permeate separates and passes through the membrane the concentration on the feed side membrane increases causing filtration losses thus when considering the energy consumption of an ro system three different factors should be considered osmotic pressure friction loss and filtration loss fig 15 shows the effect of feed pressure on sec in three different configurations while fig 16 a c represent the effect of osmotic pressure friction loss and filtration loss on sec in three different configurations respectively as shown in fig 15 as the feed pressure increased from 4 559 to 6 586 mpa the sec of configurations 1 2 and 3 decreased from 12 235 to 0 977 kw h m3 from 10 680 to 0 727 kw h m3 and from 3 368 to 0 323 kw h m3 respectively this is mainly due to the increase in permeate flow rate with increasing feed pressure meanwhile as demonstrated in fig 16a the effect of osmotic pressure on sec i e secosmotic pressure sec 100 increased from approximately 4 to 43 with increasing feed pressure in addition as the feed pressure increased the effect of friction loss on sec i e secfriction loss sec 100 increased from approximately 3 to 36 fig 16b and the effect of filtration loss i e secfiltration loss sec 100 increased from approximately 12 to 70 fig 16c in summary it was noted that the effect of filtration loss on sec was more pronounced that the effects of osmotic pressure and friction loss 4 2 specific energy consumption of configuration 3 thermodynamics has many concepts regarding minimum energy requirements that can provide the minimum energy requirements for ro 54 55 the ro process requires energy to flow the fresh water from the high concentration side to the low concentration side of the membrane the ideal minimum work required for desalting feed solutions can be calculated from 54 40 w m i n v δ p 1 283 10 4 ρ w t 1 10 2 1609 10 4 s 3 5012 10 7 s 2 where v denotes the volume of the saturated water vapor ρw denotes the density of the pure water and s denotes the salinity of the feed solution this is an ideal sec equation which works in an ideal situation but not in a real ro desalination system the actual minimum work required for an ro system can be calculated from 54 41 w m i n r t m w x sf x s p x s b x s f x s b ln x s b x s f x w b ln x w b x w f x s p ln x s p x s f x w p ln x w p x w f where mw denotes the molecular weight of water x denotes the mole fraction of the component and subscripts f b p w and s denote the feed brine permeate water and salt respectively 42 x s m w m s 1000 s 1 m w where ms denotes the molecular weight of salt 43 x s b x s f x s p r 1 r 44 x w b x w f x w p r 1 r 1 x s f x w p r 1 r fig 17 shows the actual theoretical minimum energy required for the system the energy recovered by the kaplan and pelton turbines i e configuration 3 and the additional energy required for the system i e difference between the theoretical minimum energy consumption and the energy recovered by configuration 3 as shown in fig 16 as water recovery increases the salt concentration in the brine solution eventually increases requiring more feed flow to keep the brine solution away from the membrane surface thus as minimum energy consumption increases and feed flow rate increases the sec in configuration 3 eventually increases 4 3 sensitivity analysis of configuration 3 several factors that vary with respect to conditions such as time and location can have a significant influence on system performance therefore the sensitivity analysis of such factors is necessary to reflect real applications 56 57 in this study the sensitivity analysis was carried out in terms of sec with respect to pressure flow rate and density of stream i e oil gas and water as shown in table 2 the baseline operating conditions were assumed to be 1 379 mpa 0 111 m3 s and 75 4 kg m3 respectively in the sensitivity analysis pressure flow rate and fluid density varied within 50 based on the corresponding values of baseline operating conditions through sensitivity analysis the marginal forecast of energy can be calculated which provides insight into the future energy needs for the ro system in the exploration and production fields sensitivity analysis was performed on the stream i e pressure density and flow rate and feed i e pressure temperature and flow rate parameters by evaluating the sec of configuration 3 here the sec was plotted in terms of beta β which represents the relative variation with respect to stream pressure density and flow rate as follows 45 β p s e c p s s e c 200 psi s e c p s 100 46 β ρ s e c ρ s s e c 75 4 kg m 3 s e c ρ s 100 47 β f s e c f s s e c 0 111 m 3 s s e c f s 100 where s e c p s s e c f s and s e c ρ s denote the sensitivity analysis values of stream pressure flow rate and density respectively figs 18 20 show the effects of stream pressure density and flow rate on the sec of ro systems respectively the sec decreases with an increase in the pressure flow rate and density of the stream based on eq 41 as shown in fig 18 for a stream pressure of 1 379 mpa the sec of configuration 3 ranged from 3 368 to 0 323 kw h m3 at a feed pressure of 4 559 6 586 mpa with a 25 deviation in stream pressure i e 1 034 mpa the sec of the system ranged from 5 196 to 0 424 kw h m3 similarly as the stream pressure decreased by 50 i e 0 689 mpa the sec of the system further increased from 7 024 to 0 525 kw h m3 on the other hand with a 25 deviation in stream pressure i e 1 724 mpa the sec of the system decreased from 1 539 to 0 222 kw h m3 similarly as the stream pressure increased by 50 i e 2 068 mpa the sec of the system further decreased from 0 289 to 0 121 kw h m3 as depicted in fig 19 for a stream density of 75 4 kg m3 the sec of configuration 3 ranged from 1 102 to 8 676 kw h m3 at a feed temperature of 10 30 c given a 25 deviation in stream density i e 56 55 kg m3 the sec increased from 1 750 to 13 264 kw h m3 as the stream density changed by 50 i e 37 7 kg m3 the sec of the system increased from 2 399 to 17 859 kw h m3 on the contrary given a 25 deviation in stream density i e 94 22 kg m3 the sec of the system decreased from 0 453 to 4 085 kw h m3 similarly as the stream density increased by 50 i e 113 1 kg m3 the sec range of the system was further reduced to 0 195 and 0 507 kw h m3 in fig 20 for a stream flow rate of 0 111 m3 s the sec of configuration 3 was in the range of 3 368 and 1 161 kw h m3 at a feed flow rate of 0 217 to 0 207 l s when the stream flow rate changed by 25 i e 0 083 m3 s the sec of the system increased from 5 196 to 1 959 kw h m3 in addition with a 50 deviation in stream flow rate i e 0 0555 m3 s the sec of the system further increased from 7 024 to 2 759 kw h m3 on the other hand the sec of the system ranged from 1 539 to 0 361 kw h m3 as the stream flow rate increased by 25 i e 0 139 m3 s similarly as the stream flow rate increased by 50 i e 0 1665 m3 s the sec of the system decreased in the range of 0 289 and 0 438 kw h m3 in addition sec was observed to decrease significantly with an increase in stream pressure flow rate and density in summary it can be concluded that installing a pelton turbine in front of a three phase separator in the oil and gas industry can significantly reduce the energy consumption of ro system 5 conclusions in this study we introduced system modeling and energy recovery analysis for three different ro configurations in the oil and gas industry three configurations were considered to analyze the ro system in terms of sec as the feed pressure increased from 4 559 to 6 586 mpa the sec decreased from 12 235 to 0 9771 kw h m3 in configuration 1 from 10 680 to 0 727 kw h m3 in configuration 2 and from 3 367 to 0 323 kw h m3 in configuration 3 similarly when the feed pressure was applied from 4 559 to 6 586 mpa the electrical energy consumption of configuration 1 increased from 1 317 to 1 902 kw while in configuration 2 increased from 1 149 to 1 416 kw and in configuration 3 increased from 0 362 to 0 629 kw it was found that the sec and electrical energy consumption of configuration 3 was the lowest the usage of the pelton turbine had two advantages a reduction in the energy consumption and an improvement in the separation quality of the fluids due to a decrease in the fluids pressure before the three phase separator in addition the sensitivity analysis indicated that sec decreased significantly with an increase in stream pressure flow rate and density therefore installing a pelton turbine and generator before the three phase separator in the oil and gas industry was recommended in this study as a means to reduce the energy consumption of ro systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

configuration 3 in addition the sensitivity analysis results showed that the sec decreases significantly with an increase in the stream crude oil natural gas and produced water pressure flow rate and

sensitivity analysis value ps pressure sensitivity analysis value fs flow rate sensitivity analysis value 1 introduction water is the most important resource of modern times and freshwater resources are steadily decreasing due to population growth and increased living standards therefore freshwater production is necessary to meet growing demand which can be achieved through the desalination of seawater and brackish water 1 2 many countries have arid regions away from the coast so desalination of produced water is an alternative to desalination of seawater and brackish water in such countries exploration and production companies work on the extraction of crude oil and natural gas produced water is associated with hydrocarbons in the subsurface when crude oil and natural gas are extracted from the subsurface and it comes as a by product 3 4 produced water comes from the subsurface and contains traces of oil and large quantities of suspended solids that must be separated before being treated in the desalination process 4 5 produced water can cause corrosion in the system because it contains large number of impurities e g total organic content total dissolved solids and total suspended solids and corrosive materials e g sodium chloride and sulphate that are hazardous to the environment and thus it cannot be left untreated 6 9 produced water is always associated with oil and gas but the ratio of the fluids varies with respect to location and time of production 10 11 the quantity of produced water from a given reservoir can reach up to 2 times that of the hydrocarbons produced from the same reservoir in the later stages of production the percentage of produced water reaches up to 90 with only 10 hydrocarbons 12 14 without pre treatment desalination of produced water causes coagulation degradation due to suspended solids and the presence of oil 15 16 therefore the water flux decreases and a large pressure drop occurs in the desalination system 17 18 if the produced water contains microbial particles they evolve very quickly due to concentration polarization producing colonies and fouling is caused on the surface of the membrane therefore it is necessary to desalinate produced water and make it feasible for use 12 desalination processes are classified into two categories thermal and membrane desalination thermal desalination includes multi stage flash msf membrane distillation md and multi effect distillation med 19 membrane desalination includes reverse osmosis ro which separates water and impurities via diffusion principle 20 22 ro membranes remove all dissolved particles floating particles and suspended particles from the feed solution provide freshwater on the other side of the membrane 20 23 25 ro is a pressure driven method that uses a high pressure pump to pressurize the feed the advantage of the ro method over other desalination methods such as nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf is that it can purify different types of water with good performance low cost and low energy consumption 19 26 29 an ro system consists of three stages pre treatment ro main module and post treatment the ro pre treatment system uses filters to remove small floating particles like organic and biological substances the second stage is the ro module which removes salt and other impurities present in the feed water finally the post treatment system is used to add particles which are needed to provide appropriate characteristics to the freshwater 30 ro systems use crossflow filtration and a spiral wound design which is a widely used type of module for ro desalination 31 therefore ro is one of the techniques used to desalinate produced water 32 34 ro uses energy recovery devices to recover energy from brine and then transfers to high pressure pumps the specific energy consumption of ro varies between 6 7 and 8 kw h m3 which is less than other commercially available desalination techniques such as multi effect distillation med approximately 45 kw h m3 and multi stage flash msf approximately 51 7 kw h m3 35 in ro process energy recovery is affected by concentration polarization resistance and membrane fouling 36 there are five approaches for reducing energy consumption in the ro process the use of a high permeable membrane energy recovery device chemical demineralization renewable energy sources and optimization techniques 37 the first large ro plant for desalination of produced water was the mt poso plant in california 38 ҫakmakce et al reported an assessment of the desalination of produced water via ro and employed mf or nf as a pretreatment method they suggested mf as an excellent alternative to pretreatment of the ro desalination process in terms of permeate flux and water quality 32 ersahin et al examined the seawater sw and brackish water bw ro membranes for desalting the produced water and showed salt rejection and permeation flux of sw 90 and 12 7 l m2h respectively and bw membranes 70 and 9 4 l m2h respectively they also found that the energy consumption and water production cost of the ro desalination plant were 5 7 kw h m3 and 0 98 us m3 respectively 39 piemonte et al presented an assessment of produced water desalination by an ro process using three different feed concentrations i e 35546 71127 and 106 670 ppm and found that increasing feed concentrations reduced water production from 14 892 to 8322 and then 1748 m3 year 34 melo et al used ro and nf techniques to desalinate produced water via the pilot plant when the feed tds and salinity were 816 and 625 mg l for ro and 631 and 782 mg l for nf at a feed pressure of 15 bar the permeate tds and salinity were 33 and 18 mg l for ro and 35 and 44 mg l for nf 12 alzahrani et al used nf and ro membranes to desalinate produced water and the results showed that the total organic content toc and total dissolved solids tds were 6 7 and 244 mg l for the ro membrane and 22 9 and 520 mg l for the nf membrane respectively 40 thiel et al presented ro and other desalination methods for desalinating shale gas produced water and showed the energy consumption of ro med mechanical vapor compression mvc humidification dehumidification hdh permeate gap membrane distillation pgmd and forward osmosis fo the corresponding values were 15 200 28 400 500 and 600 kw h m3 respectively 41 most of the aforementioned studies have explored the ro desalination of produced water and focused on estimating its energy consumption and energy recovery from brine solutions however no studies have been conducted considering energy recovery from subsurface streams therefore this study focuses on the feasibility assessment of three different ro desalination configurations applicable to the oil and gas industry i the ro system without an energy recovery device configuration 1 ii the ro system with an energy recovery device configuration 2 and iii the ro system with two energy recovery devices configuration 3 the proposed approach i e configuration 3 was used to minimize the energy consumption of the ro desalination system the main objective of this study was to model and simulate an ro plant for produced water desalination and determine the energy consumption of the system in addition the study focused on energy recovery and sensitivity analysis with respect to key operating parameters e g feed pressure feed temperature and water recovery 2 system description in this study an oil and gas plant is considered as shown in fig 1 in the earth s subsurface there are three types of fluids natural gas crude oil and produced water the main stream of the plant is crude oil however the other two fluids associated with oil are natural gas and produced water over time natural gas and produced water also rise to the surface with crude oil when the well reaches its saturation stage the production of produced water and natural gas increases when the stream of fluids crude oil natural gas and produced water reaches the surface it flows to a separation plant through pipelines the crude oil natural gas and produced water from all wells combine at a gathering system after the gathering system the fluids enter the separator for the separation process which depends on the density effect gas has the lowest density and it is obtained from the top of the separator the density of crude oil lies between natural gas and produced water therefore it is obtained from the middle of the separator produced water is denser than oil and natural gas so it is extracted from the bottom of the separator produced water then enters the ro system for purification in ro process energy consumption accounts for approximately 35 of the overall cost of operation 42 therefore several techniques for recovering energy from brine have been proposed but it cannot be recovered completely 42 in this study three configurations are proposed for the ro system with respect to its electrical energy consumption configuration 1 the ro system without an energy recovery system configuration 2 the ro system with an energy recovery device configuration 3 the ro system with two energy recovery devices the first configuration includes only an ro system to remove undesired particles from produced water it includes a high pressure pump to pressurize the feed in order to drive fluid across the membrane the second configuration comprises of using a kaplan turbine and generator after the ro process to recover energy from the brine pressure and flow rate configuration 3 is the novel idea presented in this study it constitutes the installation of a pelton turbine and generator before the three phase separator to recover energy that would otherwise be wasted 2 1 configuration 1 the stream of fluids enters the production system by the production tubing the fluids contain intrinsic pressure to reach the surface of the earth upon reaching the surface the stream enters the christmas tree which is the upper part of a producing well after moving through the christmas tree the stream of fluids moves through pipelines and mixes in the gathering system where production from all wells is combined after mixing the stream moves to the three phase separator where separation takes place with respect to the density and specific gravity of the fluids a schematic diagram of configuration 1 is shown in fig 2 after pre treatment the produced water enters the ro main stage where it interacts with membranes in this system permeate is achieved in a spiral direction and is appropriate for usage 2 2 configuration 2 two types of turbines are widely used in ro energy recovery systems pelton and kaplan turbines 43 in the early 1980 s francis turbines were used for energy recovery systems but after some time newly developed pelton turbines were introduced to the market which replaced francis turbines pelton turbines are currently being used in ro seawater desalination systems 44 when the feed passes through the membranes two streams are recovered the first is the permeate freshwater which moves in a spiral direction and the second is retentate brine which is recovered in an axial direction at a certain pressure and flow rate fig 3 showed a schematic diagram of configuration 2 where the stream of fluids came from wells in a similar manner of that seen in configuration 1 however configuration 2 incorporated an energy recovery system which extracted the energy from the pressure and flow rate of the brine retentate the energy recovery system used in configuration 2 includes a kaplan turbine with a generator the kaplan turbine extracted the fluid power which moved the turbine and the generator converted the fluid power to electrical power which was then provided to the high pressure pump 2 3 configuration 3 in the three phase separator there is no need for a high pressure as the fluids are separated due to settling time in which energy pressure is wasted instead there is the possibility of recovering this energy from the fluid and using it to power the high pressure pump of the ro system therefore configuration 3 includes a pelton turbine with a generator installed before the three phase separator the pelton turbine is installed before the separator to derive energy from moving fluid the turbine converts fluid energy to mechanical energy while the generator converts mechanical energy to electrical energy and utilizes it to power the high pressure pump of the ro system in configuration 3 energy was recovered from the brine solution using a kaplan turbine operating with a low pressure head while a pelton turbine operating with a medium pressure head was installed in front of the three phase separator a schematic diagram of configuration 3 is shown in fig 4 3 theory 3 1 theoretical model the ro principle consists of three stages absorption of a feed solution at the surface of the membrane diffusion through the membrane and desorption of pure water from the permeate side of the membrane ro membranes are semi permeable which allows water to move through them but restricts the movement of other molecules pressure is applied to the feed side of the membrane to overcome the osmotic pressure of the feed solution separating pure water from the undesirable brine 19 fig 5 schematically describes this process a mathematical model has been used to analyse the ro system the model used in the present study was taken from 45 47 this study focuses on the spiral wound module of the ro process water flux and salt flux are important properties of the ro system which are directly dependent on applied pressure and concentration of the feed when the percentage of dissolved and suspended particles in the feed solution is large the water flux will be small if there is a small rejection of suspended and dissolved particles from the feed solution the salt flux will decrease the solution diffusion technique is used to determine the water and salt flux of the ro system the water flux can be calculated using the following expression 1 j v a w δ p δ π where jv denotes the water flux aw denotes the water permeability coefficient δp denotes the pressure gradient and δπ denotes the change in osmotic pressure aw can be determined from the equation 48 2 a w d i k i c i o v i t r t where di denotes the diffusion coefficient ki denotes the

concentration of the water molecules bs can be calculated as 48 6 b s d j k j ρ where dj denotes the diffusion coefficient and kj denotes the membrane liquid sorption coefficient when a certain amount of dissolved and suspended particles are removed through the ro membrane some of the particles are deposited at the surface through a phenomenon called concentration polarization concentration polarization affects the ro membrane efficiency by attacking its performance and ability to permeate water molecules concentration polarization can be determined from the following equation 7 c w c p c b c p e j v k where cw denotes the concentration at the membrane and k denotes the mass transfer coefficient the properties of the fluid change with respect to its location in the ro unit srinivasan et al 2011 assumed that permeate concentration does not change with respect to the location of the permeate channel the permeate pressure and concentration can be kept constant but the brine concentration and pressure changes along the channel length as shown in fig 6 47 the solvent flux depends directly on the transmembrane pressure at a distance x and can be described by the following equation 8 j v x a w δ p x 1 a w γ b s t c p where δp x denotes the transmembrane pressure at a distance x when the fluid moves through the feed channel a pressure drop occurs from pi to po representing the inlet and outlet of the module respectively this pressure drop is due to the friction of the fluid as it flows through the feed channel here darcy s law can be applied to solve the pressure gradient d p x d x at a distance x which directly depends on the volumetric flow rate f x 47 9 d p x d x b f x where b denotes the proportionality constant solvent flux can be determined by considering the axial gradient of flow rate d f x d x 10 j v x 1 w d f x d x where w denotes the membrane width the above equations are derived and solved to determine the brine flow rate fo brine

here δpi and δpo can be found from respectively 17 δ p i p i p p 18 δ p o p o p p the brine pressure po brine concentration co and brine flow rate fo can be found from the following equations respectively 19 f o f i cosh ϕ ϕ sinh ϕ b l δ p i 20 p o p i b l ϕ sinh ϕ f i f o cosh ϕ 1 21 c o c p f i c i c p f o the salt concentrations at the inlet and outlet of permeate side can be calculated

salt rejection sr can be found from the equation 24 s r 1 c p c o the mass transfer coefficient changes from the inlet to the outlet because of change in parameters such as pressure flow rate and concentration these parameters change with respect to location along the length of the feed channel thus the mass transfer coefficient can be calculated at the inlet and outlet of the module as 25 k i

feed channel which can be calculated as 31 d e 2 t f where tf denotes the feed spacer thickness water recovery r through the ro module can be determined from 32 r f p f i as the feed solution flows through the ro module viscous drag causes a pressure drop across the spacer filled channel and the darcy friction factor can be determined as follows 49 50 33 δ p l f l d h ρ u 2 2 34 f 2 s h s c 1 3

diameter for the simulation of ro system the mathematical model was solved using the matlab 2017a software an iterative method was used to find the concentration of permeate through the described model initially its value was assumed to be half of the concentration of the feed a flow chart of the described model is presented in fig 7 3 2 model validation the ro model discussed in the previous section is validated with experimental data from the literature the model is taken from 45 47 and was validated with experimental results 47 the simulation and experimental data are presented in figs 8 10 the operating parameters were feed flow rate fi feed pressure pi temperature t and feed concentration ci these parameters were used to obtain the output parameters that are salt rejection sr permeate concentration cp and brine flow rate fo the operating conditions were as follows feed flow rate 2 166 10 4 m3 s feed pressure 0 591 to 1 376 mpa temperature 32 5 and feed concentration 0 819 mol m3 fig 8 presents the salt rejection sr with respect to feed pressure pi it can be concluded that with an increase in feed pressure from 0 591 to 1 376 mpa the salt rejection increases and fig 8 shows that the maximum relative error of salt rejection sr was 3 at a feed pressure of 1 376 mpa in addition fig 9 presents the permeate concentration profile with respect to the feed pressure pi and it was found that with an increase in feed pressure from 0 591 to 1 376 mpa the permeate concentration cp decreases but a point comes when the permeate concentration ceases to decrease and the line become stable fig 9 shows that the maximum relative error of permeate concentration cp was 1 5 at a feed pressure of 0 591 mpa further it can be seen in fig 10 that the increase in feed pressure from 0 591 to 1 376 mpa causes a decrease in the brine flow rate fo and the maximum relative error of the brine flow rate was 5 5 at a feed pressure of 1 376 mpa hence the simulation results were in consistent with the experimental results 4 results and discussions in the ro process pressure is applied to the feed solution leading the water to move through the membrane while removing ions molecules and larger particles to make it drinkable the membrane is made up of a polymer material that separates water from impurities detailed specifications of the ro module are presented in table 1 the effective area of the membrane module was 8 5 m2 other operating parameters were kept constant at a temperature of 25 feed concentration of 396 mol m3 and a flow rate of 0 217 l s a schematic diagram of the ro module with its membrane was shown in fig 11 the ro process requires energy for high pressure pumps and the specific energy consumption sec of the high pressure pump in configuration 1 was given by 35 s e c p w f p where pw denotes the electrical energy required by high pressure pump and can be determined from 36 p w f i p i e h p where ehp denotes the efficiency of the high pressure pump an energy recovery device was used to recover the energy from the brine side in configuration 2 a kaplan turbine was used to recover energy from the brine and it was determined as 51 37 p r η e r s p o f o where pr denotes the electrical energy recovered from the brine solution and ηers denotes the efficiency of the kaplan turbine installed in the brine side after recovering the electrical energy from the brine solution eq 35 can be modified for configuration 2 as 38 s e c p w p r f p all of the oil fields produce different amounts of crude oil natural gas and produced water for configuration 3 oil field data was taken from 52 which presented the daily production of crude oil natural gas and produced water as shown in table 2 the pressure head was calculated as 53 39 h 2 31 p s γ s where h denotes the pressure head and ps and γs denote the stream pressure and specific gravity of the fluid e g crude oil natural gas and produced water before the separator respectively in addition the electrical energy obtained from the fluid stream through the pelton turbine can be calculated as 40 p e η f ρ s f s g h s where ηf denotes the pelton turbine efficiency ρs denotes the density of the stream e g oil gas and produced water before the separator fs denotes the flow rate of the stream before the separator g denotes the gravitational constant and hs denotes the pressure head of the stream before the separator since energy is recovered through a pelton turbine installed in front of the three phase separator eq 38 can be modified for configuration 3 as follows 41 s e c p w p r p e f p 4 1 parametric study on ro configurations figs 12 14 compared the effect of the feed pressure temperature and water recovery on the electrical energy consumption and sec of the three configurations fig 12 shows the trade off between electrical energy consumption and sec with increasing feed pressure this phenomenon indicates that increasing the feed pressure enhances the permeate flow rate and ultimately lowers the sec of the system as shown in fig 12a as the feed pressure increased from 4 559 to 6 586 mpa the electrical energy consumption increased from 1 317 to 1 902 kw configuration 1 from 1 149 to 1 416 kw configuration 2 and from 0 362 to 0 629 kw configuration 3 in contrast increasing the feed pressure decreased the sec from 12 235 to 0 977 kw h m3 in configuration 1 from 10 680 to 0 727 kw h m3 in configuration 2 and from 3 367 to 0 323 kw h m3 in configuration 3 fig 12b fig 13 shows that increasing the feed temperature does not affect electrical energy consumption but does affect the sec of the system this is due to an increase in osmotic pressure which ultimately increases the sec as the feed temperature increased from 10 to 30 the electrical energy consumption of configuration 1 was kept constant at 1 317 kw while the values of configurations 2 and 3 increased from 1 121 to 1 159 kw and from 0 334 to 0 372 kw respectively fig 13a meanwhile as shown in fig 13b increasing the feed temperature increased the sec from 4 341 to 30 729 kw h m3 configuration 1 from 3 697 to 27 043 kw h m3 configuration 2 and from 1 102 to 8 676 kw h m3 configuration 3 fig 14 shows that increasing the ro system s water recovery has no significant effect on electrical energy consumption however the higher the water recovery the higher the permeate flow rate resulting in a lower sec as illustrated in fig 14a increasing water recovery from 13 8 to 33 1 reduced electrical energy consumption from 1 317 to 1 256 kw configuration 1 from 1 149 to 1 073 kw configuration 2 and from 0 362 to 0 286 kw configuration 3 in addition as the water recovery increased the sec of configurations 1 2 and 3 decreased from 12 235 to 5 103 kw h m3 from 10 680 to 4 358 kw h m3 and from 3 367 to 1 161 kw h m3 respectively this indicates that the installation of kaplan and pelton turbines has reduced electrical energy consumption making it essential to use this technique to reduce energy consumption in oil and gas industries it is well known that ro processes require a higher feed pressure than the osmotic pressure that restricts the flow of permeate through the ro membrane as the feed flows through the ro module friction losses occur due to fluid concentration viscosity and module characteristics causing pressure loss due to friction in addition as the permeate separates and passes through the membrane the concentration on the feed side membrane increases causing filtration losses thus when considering the energy consumption of an ro system three different factors should be considered osmotic pressure friction loss and filtration loss fig 15 shows the effect of feed pressure on sec in three different configurations while fig 16 a c represent the effect of osmotic pressure friction loss and filtration loss on sec in three different configurations respectively as shown in fig 15 as the feed pressure increased from 4 559 to 6 586 mpa the sec of configurations 1 2 and 3 decreased from 12 235 to 0 977 kw h m3 from 10 680 to 0 727 kw h m3 and from 3 368 to 0 323 kw h m3 respectively this is mainly due to the increase in permeate flow rate with increasing feed pressure meanwhile as demonstrated in fig 16a the effect of osmotic pressure on sec i e secosmotic pressure sec 100 increased from approximately 4 to 43 with increasing feed pressure in addition as the feed pressure increased the effect of friction loss on sec i e secfriction loss sec 100 increased from approximately 3 to 36 fig 16b and the effect of filtration loss i e secfiltration loss sec 100 increased from approximately 12 to 70 fig 16c in summary it was noted that the effect of filtration loss on sec was more pronounced that the effects of osmotic pressure and friction loss 4 2 specific energy consumption of configuration 3 thermodynamics has many concepts regarding minimum energy requirements that can provide the minimum energy requirements for ro 54 55 the ro process requires energy to flow the fresh water from the high concentration side to the low concentration side of the membrane the ideal minimum work required for desalting feed solutions can be calculated from 54 40 w m i n v δ p 1 283 10 4 ρ w t 1 10 2 1609 10 4 s 3 5012 10 7 s 2 where v denotes the volume of the saturated water vapor ρw denotes the density of the pure water and s denotes the salinity of the feed solution this is an ideal sec equation which works in an ideal situation but not in a real ro desalination system the actual minimum work required for an ro system can be calculated from 54 41 w m i n r t m w x sf x s p x s b x s f x s b ln x s b x s f x w b ln x w b x w f x s p ln x s p x s f x w p ln x w p x w f where mw denotes the molecular weight of water x denotes the mole fraction of the component and subscripts f b p w and s denote the feed brine permeate water and salt respectively 42 x s m w m s 1000 s 1 m w where ms denotes the molecular weight of salt 43 x s b x s f x s p r 1 r 44 x w b x w f x w p r 1 r 1 x s f x w p r 1 r fig 17 shows the actual theoretical minimum energy required for the system the energy recovered by the kaplan and pelton turbines i e configuration 3 and the additional energy required for the system i e difference between the theoretical minimum energy consumption and the energy recovered by configuration 3 as shown in fig 16 as water recovery increases the salt concentration in the brine solution eventually increases requiring more feed flow to keep the brine solution away from the membrane surface thus as minimum energy consumption increases and feed flow rate increases the sec in configuration 3 eventually increases 4 3 sensitivity analysis of configuration 3 several factors that vary with respect to conditions such as time and location can have a significant influence on system performance therefore the sensitivity analysis of such factors is necessary to reflect real applications 56 57 in this study the sensitivity analysis was carried out in terms of sec with respect to pressure flow rate and density of stream i e oil gas and water as shown in table 2 the baseline operating conditions were assumed to be 1 379 mpa 0 111 m3 s and 75 4 kg m3 respectively in the sensitivity analysis pressure flow rate and fluid density varied within 50 based on the corresponding values of baseline operating conditions through sensitivity analysis the marginal forecast of energy can be calculated which provides insight into the future energy needs for the ro system in the exploration and production fields sensitivity analysis was performed on the stream i e pressure density and flow rate and feed i e pressure temperature and flow rate parameters by evaluating the sec of configuration 3 here the sec was plotted in terms of beta β which represents the relative variation with respect to stream pressure density and flow rate as follows 45 β p s e c p s s e c 200 psi s e c p s 100 46 β ρ s e c ρ s s e c 75 4 kg m 3 s e c ρ s 100 47 β f s e c f s s e c 0 111 m 3 s s e c f s 100 where s e c p s s e c f s and s e c ρ s denote the sensitivity analysis values of stream pressure flow rate and density respectively figs 18 20 show the effects of stream pressure density and flow rate on the sec of ro systems respectively the sec decreases with an increase in the pressure flow rate and density of the stream based on eq 41 as shown in fig 18 for a stream pressure of 1 379 mpa the sec of configuration 3 ranged from 3 368 to 0 323 kw h m3 at a feed pressure of 4 559 6 586 mpa with a 25 deviation in stream pressure i e 1 034 mpa the sec of the system ranged from 5 196 to 0 424 kw h m3 similarly as the stream pressure decreased by 50 i e 0 689 mpa the sec of the system further increased from 7 024 to 0 525 kw h m3 on the other hand with a 25 deviation in stream pressure i e 1 724 mpa the sec of the system decreased from 1 539 to 0 222 kw h m3 similarly as the stream pressure increased by 50 i e 2 068 mpa the sec of the system further decreased from 0 289 to 0 121 kw h m3 as depicted in fig 19 for a stream density of 75 4 kg m3 the sec of configuration 3 ranged from 1 102 to 8 676 kw h m3 at a feed temperature of 10 30 c given a 25 deviation in stream density i e 56 55 kg m3 the sec increased from 1 750 to 13 264 kw h m3 as the stream density changed by 50 i e 37 7 kg m3 the sec of the system increased from 2 399 to 17 859 kw h m3 on the contrary given a 25 deviation in stream density i e 94 22 kg m3 the sec of the system decreased from 0 453 to 4 085 kw h m3 similarly as the stream density increased by 50 i e 113 1 kg m3 the sec range of the system was further reduced to 0 195 and 0 507 kw h m3 in fig 20 for a stream flow rate of 0 111 m3 s the sec of configuration 3 was in the range of 3 368 and 1 161 kw h m3 at a feed flow rate of 0 217 to 0 207 l s when the stream flow rate changed by 25 i e 0 083 m3 s the sec of the system increased from 5 196 to 1 959 kw h m3 in addition with a 50 deviation in stream flow rate i e 0 0555 m3 s the sec of the system further increased from 7 024 to 2 759 kw h m3 on the other hand the sec of the system ranged from 1 539 to 0 361 kw h m3 as the stream flow rate increased by 25 i e 0 139 m3 s similarly as the stream flow rate increased by 50 i e 0 1665 m3 s the sec of the system decreased in the range of 0 289 and 0 438 kw h m3 in addition sec was observed to decrease significantly with an increase in stream pressure flow rate and density in summary it can be concluded that installing a pelton turbine in front of a three phase separator in the oil and gas industry can significantly reduce the energy consumption of ro system 5 conclusions in this study we introduced system modeling and energy recovery analysis for three different ro configurations in the oil and gas industry three configurations were considered to analyze the ro system in terms of sec as the feed pressure increased from 4 559 to 6 586 mpa the sec decreased from 12 235 to 0 9771 kw h m3 in configuration 1 from 10 680 to 0 727 kw h m3 in configuration 2 and from 3 367 to 0 323 kw h m3 in configuration 3 similarly when the feed pressure was applied from 4 559 to 6 586 mpa the electrical energy consumption of configuration 1 increased from 1 317 to 1 902 kw while in configuration 2 increased from 1 149 to 1 416 kw and in configuration 3 increased from 0 362 to 0 629 kw it was found that the sec and electrical energy consumption of configuration 3 was the lowest the usage of the pelton turbine had two advantages a reduction in the energy consumption and an improvement in the separation quality of the fluids due to a decrease in the fluids pressure before the three phase separator in addition the sensitivity analysis indicated that sec decreased significantly with an increase in stream pressure flow rate and density therefore installing a pelton turbine and generator before the three phase separator in the oil and gas industry was recommended in this study as a means to reduce the energy consumption of ro systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

to chemical engineering and has found increasing industrial applications such as water and wastewater treatment water recycle and reuse food concentration gas separation and seawater desalination 1 5 the widespread utility of membrane technology is mainly attributed to several advantages including its uniform and precise performance simple scale up low energy requirement no change in phase and small land area 6 in particular membrane technology has been used widely to treat dye containing wastewater from textile industry due to their high flux and excellent retention of dye 7 the emerging shifts in industries towards more sustainable and green practices have also been responsible for the rapid development of membrane technology over the past few decades 8 the critical property of a membrane is its retention of a solute species and disallowing it from penetrating through a membrane matrix at a moderate permeation rate 9 in separation science one component of a mixture is typically allowed to freely permeate through the membrane matrix while the other components are hindered from such permeation the majority of commercially used membranes are polymer based given they cost less to fabricate are easier to implement and are more tunable for the quality of effluent 10 common polymers used for membrane synthesis include polyethyl acrylate poly n iso propylacrylamide pnipam polysulfone psu and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf 11 14 notwithstanding their valuable utility in separation processes the disposal of used polymeric membranes has contributed to sizeable volumes of solid waste thus raising environmental concern besides the manufacturing of polymer also contributed substantial effects on global warming where around 3 85 10 6 kg of cfc 11 eq g of membrane was emitted into the atmosphere by the polymerization of pvdf in chlorofluorocarbon cfc solvent during its manufacturing process 15 accordingly these environmental shortcomings are likely to not only hamper the application of membrane technology but also dampens its sustainability against this background in recent years there has been surging interest in membranes formed from natural polymers such as cellulose starch chitin chitosan gelatin dextran alginate pectin guar gum rubber and fibrin 16 the natural polymers have favourable properties including superior purity and crystallinity tensile solidity improved elasticity extensive surface area low cost availability and biodegradability 17 18 in this regard cellulose is the most abundantly available natural polysaccharide it is found in many sources such as agricultural residues water plants grasses and other plant based substances in the context of the palm oil industry in malaysia oil palm empty fruit bunches opefb which is the most abundant plantation waste consists of 40 50 cellulose 20 30 hemicellulose and 15 20 lignin 19 typically opefb is burned in boiler and the ash is used as fertilizer however the resulting air pollution and stringent regulations had raised awareness on the resource management rasli et al 20 had successfully extracted high amount of cellulose 40 w w from oil palm fronds indicated the potential recovery of cellulose from agricultural waste the high hydrophilicity of cellulose biodegradability and sustainable availability make it a favourable natural polymer for membrane synthesis lv et al 21 had incorporated cellulose nanocrystal into pvdf membrane to improve membrane properties it was reported that modified membrane showed improved water flux and flux recovery ratio due to the hydrophilicity of cellulose that formed a hydration layer on the membrane surface however the potential of extracted cellulose from opefb for the development of biodegradable

agricultural waste opefb the opefb derived cellulose membranes are formulated with two different types of solvents and at different cellulose pvdf ratios the produced membranes are evaluated in terms of their membrane permeate flux and rejection towards methylene blue mb dye the exploration of the opefb derived cellulose membranes would open a new chapter in the research and development of membrane technology as the long term economic social and environmental sustainability could be ensured using cost effective and abundantly available raw materials for dye wastewater treatment 2 materials and methodology 2 1 materials chemicals such as sodium hydroxide naoh and 30 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 were supplied by sigma aldrich usa while 85 formic acid ch2o2 97 lithium chloride licl and mb solution were provided by merck co germany 99 7 ethanol c2h5oh was purchased from hmbg chemicals germany pvdf solef 6010 powder purchased from solvay usa was employed as the membrane polymer 95 1 methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp and 98 n n dimethylacetamide dmac purchased from merck co germany were applied as a solvent to dissolve the membrane polymer 2 2 extraction of cellulose from opefb the extraction of cellulose from opefb was performed following study by sisak et al 22 opefb was washed with 1 washing detergent for several times to remove the oil grease and impurities deposited on its surface thereafter the opefb was dried and cut into pieces measuring 2 mm in length next the opefb was dewaxed through the soxhlet extraction setup with 200 ml of 70 v v c2h5oh for 6 h the dewaxed opefb was rinsed with deionized water to remove any residual c2h5oh and dried then 10 g of the dewaxed opefb was suspended in a mixture of 100 ml naoh 10 and 100 ml h2o2 10 the suspension was covered with an aluminium foil and autoclaved at 121 c for an hour the autoclaved opefb was washed thoroughly with distilled water this was followed by soaking it in a mixture of 20 ch2o2 and 10 h2o2 at the ratio of 1 1 at 85 c for 2 h finally the resultant white suspension was filtered and then washed in sequence with 10 c2h5oh and then with distilled water to obtain the insoluble fraction of cellulose 22 2 3 dissolution of cellulose the cellulose solution was prepared by direct dissolution of the extracted opefb cellulose into the solvent 23 such extracted opefb cellulose was first weighted and dissolved in nmp solvent under continuous stirring for 30 min at 140 c licl was then added into the mixture and stirred for another 30 min at 100 c until the mixture attained homogeneity this similar procedure was repeated with dmac as the solvent licl was used to disperse cellulose efficiently by the destruction of the hydroxyl groups of the cellulose to form homogenous solution 24 2 4 synthesis of opefb derived cellulose membrane the opefb derived cellulose membrane polymer solution was formulated by dissolving the pre weighted polymer pvdf into cellulose solution as prepared in section 2 3 25 the cellulose pvdf mixture was subjected to continuous stirring for 4 h at 60 c to ensure its complete dissolution subsequently the temperature was lowered to 40 c and stirred for another 8 h 26 the homogenous membrane polymer solution was poured onto a polyester fabric and casted at a nominal thickness of 500 μm with an automatic thin film applicator elcometer 4340 elcometer ltd uk the resultant membrane film was immediately immersed into a water bath at room temperature and left for a day the opefb derived membrane thus fabricated was air dried for characterization the formulations for the opefb derived cellulose membrane for elucidating the cellulose to polymer weight ratio and for elucidating the type of solvent are outlined in tables 1 and 2 respectively 2 5 characterization of opefb extracted cellulose and opefb derived cellulose membrane 2 5 1 surface morphology the surface morphology of the opefb extracted cellulose and synthesized opefb derived cellulose membranes was observed through scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss merlin compact germany for cross sectional observation of the opefb derived cellulose membranes membrane samples were dipped in liquid nitrogen for a minute and snapped into small pieces a k550 sputter coater was used to coat the outer surface of the sem sample with a thin layer of gold under vacuum to provide electrical conductivity during the sem analysis 2 5 2 crystalline phase the crystalline structures of the opefb and extracted cellulose were identified through x ray diffraction xrd with a bruker d8 advance diffractometer bruker corp germany the xrd analysis was performed by subjecting the sample to x ray radiation from 5 60 2θ angle with a sampling time of 0 3 s per step crystallinity index ci values are calculated through

surface roughness of opefb derived cellulose membranes was evaluated using atomic force microscopy afm ntegra prima nt mdt america inc russia in semi der ambient conditions 28 membrane sample was cut into appropriate size and adhered on a glass slide using carbon tape membrane surface was then scanned by the cantilevers tip within the scanned area of 10 μm x 10 μm the roughness value of the membrane surface was reported as root mean square rms rq using ia p9 software 2 5 4 pore size and porosity the membrane porosity was determined through the gravimetric method 29 membrane samples were cut into small pieces and immersed in distilled water for 24 h next the membrane surface was wiped with a filter paper the weight of the wet membrane ww was measured with an electronic balance the wet membrane was then dried in an oven at 60 c for a day after which the weight of the resultant dried membrane wd was measured the membrane porosity was calculated through eq 2 2 ε w w w d ρ w w w w d ρ p w d ρ p 100 where ww is the weight of the wet membrane g wd is the weight of the dried membrane g ρ w is the density of distilled water and ρ m is the density of polymer the pore size of the membrane was determined through the guerout elford ferry equation 30 31 3 r m 2 9 1 75 ε 8 η l q ε a δ p where η is the water viscosity 8 9 10 4 pa s l is the membrane thickness m q is the volume of permeate per unit time m3 s a is the effective surface area of the membrane m2 and δp is the operational pressure pa 2 6 performance evaluation of opefb derived cellulose membrane a bench scale dead end membrane filtration unit equipped with sterlitech hp4750 dead end cell sterlitech corp usa was used for evaluating the performance of opefb derived cellulose membranes as shown in fig 1 the synthesized opefb derived cellulose membrane was cut into disc shaped pieces with an effective surface area of 14 6 cm2 synthetic mb dye solution 20 mg l was used as the feed for membrane filtration

time h 5 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp is the concentration of the permeate mg l and cf is the concentration of the feed mg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of opefb and extracted cellulose fig 2 shows the surface morphology of the opefb and extracted cellulose from the opefb under 250 and 1 00 k magnification it is evident that the surfaces of the untreated opefb are rough and uneven over which non fibrous materials such as waxes and pectin are haphazardly scattered comparatively the surfaces of the cellulose extracted from the opefb are clean smooth and free of deposits of debris furthermore the individual strands of the extracted cellulose show a decrease in diameter signifying the removal of hemicelluloses lignin pectins and waxes from the opefb surface this finding corroborates with mzimela et al 33 as seen the diameter of opefb was reduced greatly from 228 88 6 63 μm to 13 63 3 10 μm after extraction of cellulose the diffractrograms fig 3 of the opefb and the extracted cellulose reveal two well defined characteristic peaks at 2θ 16 and 2θ 22 which are representative of the amorphous structure and crystalline structure respectively 34 the decrease of the peak intensity to 2θ 16 and the increase to 2θ 22 signifies the transformation of the nature of the material from amorphous to crystalline suggesting the depolymerization of hemicelluloses and the delignification during the extraction of cellulose from the opefb 35 the ci value of the opefb is 40 01 whereas that for the extracted cellulose is 65 72 the latter of which is in proximity with the ci value of 68 75 69 in the literature 20 36 the degradation of the amorphous structure of cellulose after treated with naoh and h2o2 produced higher crystallinity structure 37 therefore it is concluded that the pre treatment of the opefb for the extraction of cellulose has been successful through obtaining cellulose with the high crystalline phase 3 2 characterization of opefb derived cellulose membranes fig 4 presents the surface morphology and cross sectional views of the opefb derived cellulose membranes synthesized with a fixed cellulose pvdf ratio of 96 4 but with varied weight percent of cellulose the nomenclature of the membranes and their percentage weights of cellulose are as follows m1 b membrane 2 wt cellulose m2 b membrane 3 wt cellulose and m3 b indicated opefb derived membrane with 4 wt cellulose generally the surfaces of all m1 b m2 b and m3 b opefb derived cellulose membranes are not smooth due to the incorporation of the extracted cellulose into their membrane matrices m1 b and m2 b membranes are associated with larger and uneven pore sizes than their m3 b counterpart this is possibly due to lower weight percent of cellulose in their membrane polymer solutions which in turn led to lower viscosity such viscosity accelerated the exchange between the solvent and the non solvent thereby enhancing the phase inversion during the membrane fabrication and promoting the formation of larger membrane pore sizes 38 this is supported by li et al 39 study where the viscosity of membrane polymer solution increased nearly 10 times when the incorporated cellulose triacetate concentration increased by 4 wt conversely no obvious transition is observed for the cross sectional views of the sem micrographs of the opefb derived cellulose membranes with increasing weight percent of cellulose all m1 b m2 b and m3 b opefb derived cellulose membranes exhibit a sponge like structure advantageous to permeate flow 40 increasing cellulose weight percent from 2 wt to 4 wt the membrane cross sections were observed to be more compact due to the increasing fibrillated cellulose formed during precipitation process 41 fig 5 presents the surface morphology and cross sectional views of the opefb derived cellulose membranes synthesized with a fixed cellulose content of 3 wt but with varied cellulose pvdf ratios the nomenclature of the membranes and their ratios are as follows m4 a membrane 98 2 m4 b membrane 96 4 and m4 c membrane 94 6 by inspection membrane porosity decreases with declining weights of cellulose and therefore declining cellulose pvdf ratios in the following order 98 2 greatest porosity 96 4 94 6 least porosity two reasons underlie this observation firstly the appreciable content of the hydrophilic cellulose in the membrane polymer solution accelerated the exchange between the solvent and the non solvent 42 since the hydrophobic hydrophilic interactions between the hydrophobic pvdf polymer and the hydrophilic solvent water were reduced secondly the high cellulose pvdf ratio implied low viscosity in the membrane polymer solution thereby expediting the phase inversion and accelerating the exchange between the solvent and the non solvent collectively these contributed to the higher membrane porosity this is in accordance with study conducted by duong et al 43 by casting pvdf solution over cellulose acetate ca solution followed by phase inversion of composite membrane they observed that the inner structure of the pvdf ca composite membrane is fully porous and asymmetric with inter connecting pores due to the hydrophilic nature of ca that promotes a slower demixing during the phase inversion process the rms rq obtained from the afm images is used to indicate the surface roughness of the opefb derived cellulose membranes table 3 a high rq value implies greater membrane surface roughness accordingly the surfaces all opefb derived membranes are not smooth m2 b opefb derived cellulose membrane 3 wt cellulose exhibits the lowest surface roughness compared to m1 b membrane 2 wt cellulose and m3 b membrane 4 wt cellulose in general the increasing weight percent of cellulose in the membrane polymer solution enhanced its hydrophilicity thus contributing to a more homogenous membrane structure and a smoother membrane surface however the further addition of cellulose accelerated the exchange between the solvent and the non solvent thus promoting the aggregation of cellulose in the membrane matrix 44 45 this postulation is further verified by the rq value obtained for the opefb derived membrane synthesized at 3 wt cellulose but at different cellulose pvdf ratios the rq values of the opefb derived cellulose membranes decrease with declining cellulose pvdf ratios in the following order 98 2 highest rq value 96 4 94 6 lowest value a hydrophilic membrane polymer solution with an accelerated exchange between the solvent and the non solvent contributing to rough membrane surfaces could be a drawback for the application of membrane since such rough membrane surfaces predispose the membranes to fouling and compromise the membrane surface wettability 46 the membrane porosity and pore size of opefb derived cellulose membranes are summarized in table 4 generally the porosity and pore size increase with declining cellulose pvdf ratios from 98 2 to 96 4 and decreased further still when the ratio declined to 94 6 on the other hand batch m1 opefb derived cellulose membranes at 2 wt cellulose exhibit greater porosity than batch m2 m3 and m4 opefb derived membranes with higher cellulose content this is also supported by the surface morphology of membranes shown in figs 4 and 5 additionally batch m2 opefb derived cellulose membrane synthesized with nmp as the solvent exhibit greater porosity and larger pore size than batch m4 opefb derived cellulose membrane synthesized with dmac as the solvent this is mainly because the slightly higher solubility parameter 22 9 mpa1 2 of nmp compared to dmac 22 7 mpa1 2 47 the stronger solvent power of nmp resulted in faster precipitation rate flavouring the formation of sponge like membrane structure as evidenced in fig 4 greater porosity and larger pore size could be advantageous for the synthesized membrane as they improve the permeate flux 3 3 performance evaluation of opefb derived cellulose membranes the performance of the synthesized opefb derived cellulose membranes is assessed based on the membrane permeate flux and rejection table 5 towards the synthetic mb dye the permeate flux of the synthesized opefb derived cellulose membranes initially increases with the decline of the cellulose pvdf ratios from 98 2 to 96 4 but it decreases with a further decline of the ratio to 94 6 this result agrees with the analysis on the membrane porosity and pore size table 4 the greater porosity and larger pore size of batch m2 opefb derived cellulose membrane synthesized with nmp as the solvent with the cellulose pvdf ratio of 96 4 enabled the formation of more and larger pathway for the permeate to penetrate through the membrane matrix hence the permeate flux was higher besides it is observed that the permeate flux of membranes increased with the cellulose weight percent the permeate flux of opefb derived cellulose membrane increased from 136 23 l m2 h m1 b to 164 38 l m2 h m3 b when the weight percent of cellulose increased from 2 wt to 4 wt this could be due to the hydrophilicity of cellulose that formed a wetting layer on the membrane surface that promoted the water permeation across the membrane 48 lv et al 49 reported that an increase of pure water flux as high as 24 fold compared to the pristine cellulose diacetate 7 21 l m2 h upon addition of cellulose nanocrystals however the rejection of opefb derived cellulose membrane decreased from 34 85 m2 b to 24 04 m3 b due to the enlarged porosity as evidenced by membranes cross section in fig 4 b in general batch m2 opefb derived cellulose membranes are preferred among all membrane formulations given their relatively higher permeate flux ranging from 132 57 158 06 l m2 h and mb dye rejection ranging from 13 13 36 16 the m2 b opefb derived cellulose membrane with 3 wt cellulose content and the cellulose pvdf ratio of 96 4 is the optimum membrane formulation as it has exhibited high permeate flux without compromising its performance on mb dye rejection despite m4 b opefb derived cellulose membrane exhibited highest permeate flux 170 05 l m2 h and rejection 36 61 the surface roughness of m4 b opefb derived cellulose membrane 169 81 nm is relatively higher than m2 b opefb derived cellulose membrane 121 46 nm table 3 the rougher membrane surface is generally associated with membrane fouling as the colloidal particles preferentially accumulate at the valleys of the rough membrane surface subsequently caused severe membrane fouling 50 4 conclusion in conclusion this study had successfully explored a green synthesis method for the development of biodegradable cellulose membranes it is shown that the m4 opefb derived membranes produced using dmac solvent has higher permeate flux and rejection towards mb dye however the m4 opefb derived membranes have higher membrane surface roughness that is less beneficial for long term membrane treatment among the different membrane formulations batch m2 opefb derived membranes with 3 wt cellulose content is the preference as given their high permeate flux ranging from 132 57 to 158 06 l m2 h and high mb dye rejection ranging from 13 13 to 36 16 additionally the m2 b opefb derived cellulose membrane with 3 wt cellulose content and the cellulose pvdf ratio of 96 4 is the optimum membrane formulation as it exhibited lowest surface roughness high permeate flux due to large membrane pore size and high membrane porosity without compromising its performance on mb dye rejection future research should be conducted to

fig 2 shows the surface morphology of the opefb and extracted cellulose from the opefb under 250 and 1 00 k magnification it is evident that the surfaces of the untreated opefb are rough and uneven over which non fibrous materials such as waxes and pectin are haphazardly scattered comparatively the surfaces of the cellulose extracted from the opefb are clean smooth and free of deposits of debris furthermore the individual strands of the extracted cellulose show a decrease in diameter signifying the removal of hemicelluloses lignin pectins and waxes from the opefb surface this finding corroborates with mzimela et al 33 as seen the diameter of opefb was reduced greatly from 228 88 6 63 μm to 13 63 3 10 μm after extraction of cellulose the diffractrograms fig 3 of the opefb and the extracted cellulose reveal two well defined characteristic peaks at 2θ 16 and 2θ 22 which are representative of the amorphous structure and crystalline structure respectively 34 the decrease of the peak intensity to 2θ 16 and the increase to 2θ 22 signifies the transformation of the nature of the material from amorphous to crystalline suggesting the depolymerization of hemicelluloses and the delignification during the extraction of cellulose from the opefb 35 the ci value of the opefb is 40 01 whereas that for the extracted cellulose is 65 72 the latter of which is in proximity with the ci value of 68 75 69 in the literature 20 36 the degradation of the amorphous structure of cellulose after treated with naoh and h2o2 produced higher crystallinity structure 37 therefore it is concluded that the pre treatment of the opefb for the extraction of cellulose has been successful through obtaining cellulose with the high crystalline phase 3 2 characterization of opefb derived cellulose membranes fig 4 presents the surface morphology and cross sectional views of the opefb derived cellulose membranes synthesized with a fixed cellulose pvdf ratio of 96 4 but with varied weight percent of cellulose the nomenclature of the membranes and their percentage weights of cellulose are as follows m1 b membrane 2 wt cellulose m2 b membrane 3 wt cellulose and m3 b indicated opefb derived membrane with 4 wt cellulose generally the surfaces of all m1 b m2 b and m3 b opefb derived cellulose membranes are not smooth due to the incorporation of the extracted cellulose into their membrane matrices m1 b and m2 b membranes are associated with larger and uneven pore sizes than their m3 b counterpart this is possibly due to lower weight percent of cellulose in their membrane polymer solutions which in turn led to lower viscosity such viscosity accelerated the exchange between the solvent and the non solvent thereby enhancing the phase inversion during the membrane fabrication and promoting the formation of larger membrane pore sizes 38 this is supported by li et al 39 study where the viscosity of membrane polymer solution increased nearly 10 times when the incorporated cellulose triacetate concentration increased by 4 wt conversely no obvious transition is observed for the cross sectional views of the sem micrographs of the opefb derived cellulose membranes with increasing weight percent of cellulose all m1 b m2 b and m3 b opefb derived cellulose membranes exhibit a sponge like structure advantageous to permeate flow 40 increasing cellulose weight percent from 2 wt to 4 wt the membrane cross sections were observed to be more compact due to the increasing fibrillated cellulose formed during precipitation process 41 fig 5 presents the surface morphology and cross sectional views of the opefb derived cellulose membranes synthesized with a fixed cellulose content of 3 wt but with varied cellulose pvdf ratios the nomenclature of the membranes and their ratios are as follows m4 a membrane 98 2 m4 b membrane 96 4 and m4 c membrane 94 6 by inspection membrane porosity decreases with declining weights of cellulose and therefore declining cellulose pvdf ratios in the following order 98 2 greatest porosity 96 4 94 6 least porosity two reasons underlie this observation firstly the appreciable content of the hydrophilic cellulose in the membrane polymer solution accelerated the exchange between the solvent and the non solvent 42 since the hydrophobic hydrophilic interactions between the hydrophobic pvdf polymer and the hydrophilic solvent water were reduced secondly the high cellulose pvdf ratio implied low viscosity in the membrane polymer solution thereby expediting the phase inversion and accelerating the exchange between the solvent and the non solvent collectively these contributed to the higher membrane porosity this is in accordance with study conducted by duong et al 43 by casting pvdf solution over cellulose acetate ca solution followed by phase inversion of composite membrane they observed that the inner structure of the pvdf ca composite membrane is fully porous and asymmetric with inter connecting pores due to the hydrophilic nature of ca that promotes a slower demixing during the phase inversion process the rms rq obtained from the afm images is used to indicate the surface roughness of the opefb derived cellulose membranes table 3 a high rq value implies greater membrane surface roughness accordingly the surfaces all opefb derived membranes are not smooth m2 b opefb derived cellulose membrane 3 wt cellulose exhibits the lowest surface roughness compared to m1 b membrane 2 wt cellulose and m3 b membrane 4 wt cellulose in general the increasing weight percent of cellulose in the membrane polymer solution enhanced its hydrophilicity thus contributing to a more homogenous membrane structure and a smoother membrane surface however the further addition of cellulose accelerated the exchange between the solvent and the non solvent thus promoting the aggregation of cellulose in the membrane matrix 44 45 this postulation is further verified by the rq value obtained for the opefb derived membrane synthesized at 3 wt cellulose but at different cellulose pvdf ratios the rq values of the opefb derived cellulose membranes decrease with declining cellulose pvdf ratios in the following order 98 2 highest rq value 96 4 94 6 lowest value a hydrophilic membrane polymer solution with an accelerated exchange between the solvent and the non solvent contributing to rough membrane surfaces could be a drawback for the application of membrane since such rough membrane surfaces predispose the membranes to fouling and compromise the membrane surface wettability 46 the membrane porosity and pore size of opefb derived cellulose membranes are summarized in table 4 generally the porosity and pore size increase with declining cellulose pvdf ratios from 98 2 to 96 4 and decreased further still when the ratio declined to 94 6 on the other hand batch m1 opefb derived cellulose membranes at 2 wt cellulose exhibit greater porosity than batch m2 m3 and m4 opefb derived membranes with higher cellulose content this is also supported by the surface morphology of membranes shown in figs 4 and 5 additionally batch m2 opefb derived cellulose membrane synthesized with nmp as the solvent exhibit greater porosity and larger pore size than batch m4 opefb derived cellulose membrane synthesized with dmac as the solvent this is mainly because the slightly higher solubility parameter 22 9 mpa1 2 of nmp compared to dmac 22 7 mpa1 2 47 the stronger solvent power of nmp resulted in faster precipitation rate flavouring the formation of sponge like membrane structure as evidenced in fig 4 greater porosity and larger pore size could be advantageous for the synthesized membrane as they improve the permeate flux 3 3 performance evaluation of opefb derived cellulose membranes the performance of the synthesized opefb derived cellulose membranes is assessed based on the membrane permeate flux and rejection table 5 towards the synthetic mb dye the permeate flux of the synthesized opefb derived cellulose membranes initially increases with the decline of the cellulose pvdf ratios from 98 2 to 96 4 but it decreases with a further decline of the ratio to 94 6 this result agrees with the analysis on the membrane porosity and pore size table 4 the greater porosity and larger pore size of batch m2 opefb derived cellulose membrane synthesized with nmp as the solvent with the cellulose pvdf ratio of 96 4 enabled the formation of more and larger pathway for the permeate to penetrate through the membrane matrix hence the permeate flux was higher besides it is observed that the permeate flux of membranes increased with the cellulose weight percent the permeate flux of opefb derived cellulose membrane increased from 136 23 l m2 h m1 b to 164 38 l m2 h m3 b when the weight percent of cellulose increased from 2 wt to 4 wt this could be due to the hydrophilicity of cellulose that formed a wetting layer on the membrane surface that promoted the water permeation across the membrane 48 lv et al 49 reported that an increase of pure water flux as high as 24 fold compared to the pristine cellulose diacetate 7 21 l m2 h upon addition of cellulose nanocrystals however the rejection of opefb derived cellulose membrane decreased from 34 85 m2 b to 24 04 m3 b due to the enlarged porosity as evidenced by membranes cross section in fig 4 b in general batch m2 opefb derived cellulose membranes are preferred among all membrane formulations given their relatively higher permeate flux ranging from 132 57 158 06 l m2 h and mb dye rejection ranging from 13 13 36 16 the m2 b opefb derived cellulose membrane with 3 wt cellulose content and the cellulose pvdf ratio of 96 4 is the optimum membrane formulation as it has exhibited high permeate flux without compromising its performance on mb dye rejection despite m4 b opefb derived cellulose membrane exhibited highest permeate flux 170 05 l m2 h and rejection 36 61 the surface roughness of m4 b opefb derived cellulose membrane 169 81 nm is relatively higher than m2 b opefb derived cellulose membrane 121 46 nm table 3 the rougher membrane surface is generally associated with membrane fouling as the colloidal particles preferentially accumulate at the valleys of the rough membrane surface subsequently caused severe membrane fouling 50 4 conclusion in conclusion this study had successfully explored a green synthesis method for the development of biodegradable cellulose membranes it is shown that the m4 opefb derived membranes produced using dmac solvent has higher permeate flux and rejection towards mb dye however the m4 opefb derived membranes have higher membrane surface roughness that is less beneficial for long term membrane treatment among the different membrane formulations batch m2 opefb derived membranes with 3 wt cellulose content is the preference as given their high permeate flux ranging from 132 57 to 158 06 l m2 h and high mb dye rejection ranging from 13 13 to 36 16 additionally the m2 b opefb derived cellulose membrane with 3 wt cellulose content and the cellulose pvdf ratio of 96 4 is the optimum membrane formulation as it exhibited lowest surface roughness high permeate flux due to large membrane pore size and high membrane porosity without compromising its performance on mb dye rejection future research should be conducted to employ opefb derived membranes in treating wastewater from other industry declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors wish to gratefully acknowledge the funding for this work

langmuir freundlich molecular dynamics 1 introduction dyes are known as the major water pollutants 1 2 using adsorbents is one the most effective ways for removing dyes from water and wastewaters 3 8 different carbon based materials such as activated carbon have been used as effective adsorbent although this category of material is efficient in removing dyes still their production from wood or coal is not sustainable and economical 9 11 therefore many studies have been carried out to introduce alternative materials as the replacement for activated carbon 3 9 12 16 metal organic frameworks mofs consist of the organic ligands and metal ions possess a unique structure with high porosity and surface area 17 18 the possibility to generate a new engineered structure by changing the metal ion and organic ligand makes mofs appropriate candidates for various applications such as gas separation 19 drug delivery 20 and gas adsorption 21 22 the most common ligands for mofs synthesis are of 1h 1 2 4 triazole benzene 1 3 5 tricarboxylic acid btc copper zinc iron and manganese ions are the common metallic ions for the synthesis of mofs 17 the organic part of the mof with various functional groups and numerous active sites provides more opportunities to act as a bridge for reaching to the other compounds 23 30 mofs are efficient adsorbents for phenols 31 33 sulfur compounds 34 35 pharmaceuticals 33 and dyes 36 the bulk shape of the mofs is a setback for their adsorption proficiency therefore it is necessary to modify mof morphology towards a more hospitable environment for dye absorbency 37 copper as a low cost metal ion showed acceptable dye adsorption 38 39 asfaram et al 40 investigated the adsorption of auramine o ao erythrosine er and mb into copper doped zinc sulfide nanoparticles loaded on activated carbon and reported adsorption capacity of 123 mg g for ao 123 5 mg g for mb and 84 5 mg g for er cheng et al 41 reported the complete decomposition of acid orange 7

modification candidate go as the effective dye such as methyl violet methyl green and neutral red adsorbent 43 the high reactivity of the go is due to the different functional groups such as epoxide and hydroxyl groups on the basal planes and carboxyl groups on the edges 44 the high number of active sites negative electrical surface charge and multiple oxygen containing functional groups provide a facile reaction environment with other compounds for go 45 47 in this study the novel hybrid adsorbent of cu mofs embellished with go was synthesized through the rapid facile and eco friendly

characterization analysis the xrd patterns of the cu mof and go cu mof was depicted in fig 2 a the multiple characteristic peaks were labeled indicating the presence of cu btc as reported in the literature 57 the peaks at 2θ 6 88 9 35 13 3 16 4 17 16 18 78 21 45 23 54 26 21 28 63 and 29 0 represent 200 220 4000 331 422 511 440 620 444 731 822 and 751 indices 58 59 a peak at 2θ 42 3 confirmed the presence of go in a go cu mof pattern 60 the crystal size average d nm was calculated using the debye scherrer equation eq 1 61 1 d k s λ b cos θ where ks is dimensionless shape factor equal to 0 9 for cu kα radiation λ nm wavelength 0 15405 nm for cu kα radiation θ is the diffraction angle and b is the peak width at half maximum rad the crystalline size of the cu mof particles is about 32 2 nm using the peak at 2θ 9 35 the xrd result of cu mof and go cu mof showed a similar pattern fig 2a the go exfoliation can be explained by the two possible interactions between go and cu mof i the π π stacking interaction between aromatic rings of go and cu mof ii possible hydrogen bonding between btc carboxylic group of cu mof and hydroxyl and carbonyl go the uv vis spectrum figure s1 of go cu mof revealed three peaks around 260 280 and 290 nm corresponding to the electronic transition of aromatic rings π π and n π transitions of co bonds respectively 62 63 figure s2a shows the xps spectra of the go go cu mof and cu mof the characteristic peaks for cu 2p around 954 and 934 ev revealed the existence of the copper nanoparticles especially in go cu mof 64 table s1 shows the atomic concentrations of the go go cu mof and cu mof the lower carbon concentration and the higher copper concentration from go to cu mof were in agreement with the experimental fabrication procedure the go c1 s spectrum showed four carbon bands including cc cc 284 7 ev coh and coc at 285 5 ev and 286 8 ev at the 288 3 ev for carboxylate carbon 47 65 the c1s spectra of the cu mof and go cu mof figure s2h and figure s2i indicated three peaks for cc cc at 284 7 ev co at 285 2 ev and co at 288 7 ev 66 in the go cu mof sample around 286 9 ev the epoxy group peak of go emerged which verified the presence of the go in the go cu mof structure 47 the high resolution spectra of the cu mof and go cu mof revealed the presence of cu 2p1 2 and cu 2p3 2 at around 934 and 953 ev for both samples that confirmed cu btc formation in both samples 67 fig 2 b represents the ftir spectrums of materials the ft ir spectrum of go showed an intense peak at 1725 cm 1 corresponds to fingerprint co stretch from carboxyl groups and a nearly broadband at 1600 cm 1 which was assigned to the sp2 cc bonds and the phenyl cc ring 68 in addition coc epoxy group vibration at 1100 cm 1 and oh deformation vibration around 1400 cm 1 and coh stretching vibration at 1253 cm 1 also appeared in the spectrum of go 2 moreover the broadband between 2700 and 3500 cm 1 corresponds to the oh groups coh stretching mode 69 the two bands of btc ring at 1112 and 938 cm 1 correspond to the oh in and out of plane bending modes while 793 and 729 cm 1 peaks correspond to the cc ring of btc out of plane mode the major peaks at the 1390 cm 1 and 1440 and 1705 cm 1 attributed to the co and asymmetric and symmetric types of co of the carboxylic groups respectively and the band at 1605 cm 1 is attributed to the presence of aromatic cc stretching mode 67 70 as illustrated in fig 2b the ft ir spectra of the cu mof and go cu mof represents similarities the strong absorption peaks related to the stretching mode of co and co were assigned at 1384 1435 and 1699 cm 1 respectively the shift of these three peaks in comparison with the free btc might be due to the interaction of the cooh group of btc with cu ions during the formation of cu btc coordination compound fig 3 a b and c exhibits the sem images of the typical sheet like structure of go fig 3 d e and f shows the crystalline structure of cu mof as discussed in previous sections the similarity between sem images of the go cu mof and cu mof revealed as concluded based on the xrd information that go completely exfoliated and cu mof covered most of the surface of the nanoparticle figure s3 and s4 show the edx mapping and spectrum of go cu mof respectively table s2 summarized the elemental composition of nps extracted from the edx analysis the edx data is in perfect agreement within the xps data the uniform distribution of copper element in the go cu mof edx map revealed that there was not any agglomeration in go cu mof along with tem images of go cu mof table s3 presents the porosity and surface area of the fabricated nanoparticles the mesoporous volume vm of go cu mof 2 1 cm3 g 1 was around three times greater than the mesoporous volume of cu mof 0 74 cm3 g 1 the total pore volume of go cu mof was 2 2 times greater than the pore volume of cu mof also surface area as of the go cu mof was around four times greater than cu mof the adsorption desorption results figure s3c show that go cu mof had hysteresis in its curve type3 resulting from higher mesoporous volume share 71 the mesoporous regions in the structure directly affect the surface area and increase the active sites figure s3d and s3e show the zeta potential of fabricated mofs adsorbents and dye mb at different ph due to the cationic and anionic nature of mb and adsorbents respectively by increasing the ph from acidic to basic the adsorbents negative zeta potential and mb solution positive zeta potential were increased 3 2 adsorption characterization fig 4 c and figure s5 show the edx map and spectrum of go cu mof nanoparticles after adsorption of mb 50 mg l solution loaded go cu mof since only one sulfur atom existed in the mb molecular formula and due to the sulfur mapping fig 4c and number of sulfur atoms it can be concluded that mb covered the surface of the material this proof is in agreement with the ftir spectrum of loaded go cu mof fig 4a the characteristic peaks of go cu mof and cu mof were shifted to lower or higher wavenumbers and showed the surface bonding between mb and adsorbents table s4 summarizes the peak shift of the ftir spectrum of cu mof and go cu mof after dye adsorption the xrd patterns of go cu mof and loaded go cu mof was shown in fig 4 b the sharp peak of mb around 2 θ 16 o exist at both the mb and loaded go cu mof these two peaks were overlapped each other completely and confirmed the dye presence in go cu mof particles both the loaded go cu mof and the go cu mof patterns approximately followed the same shape but with the difference in peak angle and intensity for instance a peak at 2 θ 9 35 o represented 220 indices of cu btc shifted to 10 6 for the loaded sample the same inclination was observed for other characteristic peaks this change in peak location and intensity along with peak shifts in ftir spectrum of the loaded go cu mof fig 4a all justify that the major adsorption mechanism was the surface adsorption due to the bondage between active groups of adsorbents and mb 72 the tem images of loaded go cu mof clearly showed the dye particles in the structure of go cu mof fig 5 the mb visual size distribution and clear boundaries between dye particles demonstrated no dye agglomeration which decreasesd the chance of dye physical adsorption as one of the main adsorption mechanisms 3 3 adsorption evaluation series of dye adsorption tests were conducted for systematic evaluation of the adsorption process of mb on the fabricated nps at different conditions as listed in section 2 3 3 1 effect of ph on adsorption fig 6 illustrates the effect of ph on the adsorption of mb on the fabricated mofs compounds for both adsorbents the adsorption versus ph curves followed the same trend the adsorption of mb on the mofs decreased by increasing ph the electrostatic interactions affect the reaction of cationic groups of methylene blue and anionic groups of cu mof and go cu mof at lower ph this interaction can occur through two mechanisms including i methyl groups of mb and carboxylate group of cu btc in both cu mof and go cu mof ii carbonyl and epoxide groups of go cu mof 72 increasing the ph weakened the electrostatic interaction between the dye and adsorbents since the dye solutions zeta potential and adsorbents change in the same direction fig 6 and then at the alkaline ph π π interactions and van der waals bonds are the dominates go cu mof at lower ph showed around 20 more adsorption than the cu mof this behavior can be justified based on the fact that the presence of the extra functional groups such as the carbonyl and epoxide in the go cu mof as a result of go exfoliation provided more adsorption active sites and hospitable environment for dye capture 73 also there is a possible interaction between benzene rings of go and mb might 74 3 3 2 kinetics of adsorption process fig 7 a and b show the dye concentration pattern with adsorption contact time the same trend was reported in the literature 75 76 both materials were shown fast dye uptake in the first 2 h of the process with a slight reduction in 8 h the equilibrium stage was reached after twelve hours towards the end of the adsorption process for 24 h the adsorption behavior can be interpreted based on two different mechanisms of chemical interaction and physical entrapment the fast adsorption at the first 30 min of contact time implied the external surface diffusion 77 the numerous active surface sites of organic ligands in cu mof and various functional groups on go provided appropriate physicochemical environments for chemical interaction surface adsorption with dyes molecules to be captured after the saturation of these sites the probability of chemical adsorption decreased since there were fewer places available for interacting with the dyes molecules then the physical adsorption intraparticle adsorption became dominant finally the electrostatic dye repulsion phenomena happened until reaching the equilibrium stage table s5 represents the curve fitting of experimental data with the pseudo first order and pseudo second order equations and based on the analyzed data the pseudo second order reaction is the valid expression of the adsorption reaction 3 3 3 thermodynamics analysis of the isotherms adsorption process fig 8 c and d demonstrates the isotherm curves of cu mof and go cu mof also table 1 represents isothermal parameters obtained from the langmuir freundlich and langmuir freundlich models the qmax value for cu mof at 25 c was 110 mg g and for go cu mof it was 155 mg g that implied 40 increment in adsorption as can be seen in fig 7 c and d at lower concentrations of dye reaching the equilibrium occurs rapidly and intense this intensity shows the probability of adsorption in different regions this is in agreement with the hypothesis that dye molecules were adsorbed on the outer surface of materials and made monolayer coverage there are more available capture sites in nanoparticles for dyes in lower initial dye concentration in comparison with higher initial dye concentration increasing the temperature from 25 to 65 c for both adsorbents enhanced the qmax the qmax for cu mof increased from 106 to 142 mg g and for go cu mof increased from 173 to 262 mg g for this change might be the result of adsorption active site reinforcement at higher temperature 78 79 the active sites reinforcement happen due to the breakage on internal bonds of the adsorbents go cu mof at a higher temperature and results in the generation of more active

langmuir freundlich molecular dynamics 1 introduction dyes are known as the major water pollutants 1 2 using adsorbents is one the most effective ways for removing dyes from water and wastewaters 3 8 different carbon based materials such as activated carbon have been used as effective adsorbent although this category of material is efficient in removing dyes still their production from wood or coal is not sustainable and economical 9 11 therefore many studies have been carried out to introduce alternative materials as the replacement for activated carbon 3 9 12 16 metal organic frameworks mofs consist of the organic ligands and metal ions possess a unique structure with high porosity and surface area 17 18 the possibility to generate a new engineered structure by changing the metal ion and organic ligand makes mofs appropriate candidates for various applications such as gas separation 19 drug delivery 20 and gas adsorption 21 22 the most common ligands for mofs synthesis are of 1h 1 2 4 triazole benzene 1 3 5 tricarboxylic acid btc copper zinc iron and manganese ions are the common metallic ions for the synthesis of mofs 17 the organic part of the mof with various functional groups and numerous active sites provides more opportunities to act as a bridge for reaching to the other compounds 23 30 mofs are efficient adsorbents for phenols 31 33 sulfur compounds 34 35 pharmaceuticals 33 and dyes 36 the bulk shape of the mofs is a setback for their adsorption proficiency therefore it is necessary to modify mof morphology towards a more hospitable environment for dye absorbency 37 copper as a low cost metal ion showed acceptable dye adsorption 38 39 asfaram et al 40 investigated the adsorption of auramine o ao erythrosine er and mb into copper doped zinc sulfide nanoparticles loaded on activated carbon and reported adsorption capacity of 123 mg g for ao 123 5 mg g for mb and 84 5 mg g for er cheng et al 41 reported the complete decomposition of acid orange 7 dye using the copper ii complex of dithiocarbamate modified starch graphene oxide go is one of the pioneers in adsorption applicability and productivity 42 the low cost and high flexibility towards modification candidate go as the effective dye such as methyl violet methyl green and neutral red adsorbent 43 the high reactivity of the go is due to the different functional groups such as epoxide and hydroxyl groups on the basal planes and carboxyl groups on the edges 44 the high number of active sites negative electrical surface charge and multiple oxygen containing functional groups provide a facile reaction environment with other compounds for go 45 47 in this study the novel hybrid adsorbent of cu mofs embellished with go was synthesized through the rapid facile and eco friendly

characterization analysis the xrd patterns of the cu mof and go cu mof was depicted in fig 2 a the multiple characteristic peaks were labeled indicating the presence of cu btc as reported in the literature 57 the peaks at 2θ 6 88 9 35 13 3 16 4 17 16 18 78 21 45 23 54 26 21 28 63 and 29 0 represent 200 220 4000 331 422 511 440 620 444 731 822 and 751 indices 58 59 a peak at 2θ 42 3 confirmed the presence of go in a go cu mof pattern 60 the crystal size average d nm was calculated using the debye scherrer equation eq 1 61 1 d k s λ b cos θ where ks is dimensionless shape factor equal to 0 9 for cu kα radiation λ nm wavelength 0 15405 nm for cu kα radiation θ is the diffraction angle and b is the peak width at half maximum rad the crystalline size of the cu mof particles is about 32 2 nm using the peak at 2θ 9 35 the xrd result of cu mof and go cu mof showed a similar pattern fig 2a the go exfoliation can be explained by the two possible interactions between go and cu mof i the π π stacking interaction between aromatic rings of go and cu mof ii possible hydrogen bonding between btc carboxylic group of cu mof and hydroxyl and carbonyl go the uv vis spectrum figure s1 of go cu mof revealed three peaks around 260 280 and 290 nm corresponding to the electronic transition of aromatic rings π π and n π transitions of co bonds respectively 62 63 figure s2a shows the xps spectra of the go go cu mof and cu mof the characteristic peaks for cu 2p around 954 and 934 ev revealed the existence of the copper nanoparticles especially in go cu mof 64 table s1 shows the atomic concentrations of the go go cu mof and cu mof the lower carbon concentration and the higher copper concentration from go to cu mof were in agreement with the experimental fabrication procedure the go c1 s spectrum showed four carbon bands including cc cc 284 7 ev coh and coc at 285 5 ev and 286 8 ev at the 288 3 ev for carboxylate carbon 47 65 the c1s spectra of the cu mof and go cu mof figure s2h and figure s2i indicated three peaks for cc cc at 284 7 ev co at 285 2 ev and co at 288 7 ev 66 in the go cu mof sample around 286 9 ev the epoxy group peak of go emerged which verified the presence of the go in the go cu mof structure 47 the high resolution spectra of the cu mof and go cu mof revealed the presence of cu 2p1 2 and cu 2p3 2 at around 934 and 953 ev for both samples that confirmed cu btc formation in both samples 67 fig 2 b represents the ftir spectrums of materials the ft ir spectrum of go showed an intense peak at 1725 cm 1 corresponds to fingerprint co stretch from carboxyl groups and a nearly broadband at 1600 cm 1 which was assigned to the sp2 cc bonds and the phenyl cc ring 68 in addition coc epoxy group vibration at 1100 cm 1 and oh deformation vibration around 1400 cm 1 and coh stretching vibration at 1253 cm 1 also appeared in the spectrum of go 2 moreover the broadband between 2700 and 3500 cm 1 corresponds to the oh groups coh stretching mode 69 the two bands of btc ring at 1112 and 938 cm 1 correspond to the oh in and out of plane bending modes while 793 and 729 cm 1 peaks correspond to the cc ring of btc out of plane mode the major peaks at the 1390 cm 1 and 1440 and 1705 cm 1 attributed to the co and asymmetric and symmetric types of co of the carboxylic groups respectively and the band at 1605 cm 1 is attributed to the presence of aromatic cc stretching mode 67 70 as illustrated in fig 2b the ft ir spectra of the cu mof and go cu mof represents similarities the strong absorption peaks related to the stretching mode of co and co were assigned at 1384 1435 and 1699 cm 1 respectively the shift of these three peaks in comparison with the free btc might be due to the interaction of the cooh group of btc with cu ions during the formation of cu btc coordination compound fig 3 a b and c exhibits the sem images of the typical sheet like structure of go fig 3 d e and f shows the crystalline structure of cu mof as discussed in previous sections the similarity between sem images of the go cu mof and cu mof revealed as concluded based on the xrd information that go completely exfoliated and cu mof covered most of the surface of the nanoparticle figure s3 and s4 show the edx mapping and spectrum of go cu mof respectively table s2 summarized the elemental composition of nps extracted from the edx analysis the edx data is in perfect agreement within the xps data the uniform distribution of copper element in the go cu mof edx map revealed that there was not any agglomeration in go cu mof along with tem images of go cu mof table s3 presents the porosity and surface area of the fabricated nanoparticles the mesoporous volume vm of go cu mof 2 1 cm3 g 1 was around three times greater than the mesoporous volume of cu mof 0 74 cm3 g 1 the total pore volume of go cu mof was 2 2 times greater than the pore volume of cu mof also surface area as of the go cu mof was around four times greater than cu mof the adsorption desorption results figure s3c show that go cu mof had hysteresis in its curve type3 resulting from higher mesoporous volume share 71 the mesoporous regions in the structure directly affect the surface area and increase the active sites figure s3d and s3e show the zeta potential of fabricated mofs adsorbents and dye mb at different ph due to the cationic and anionic nature of mb and adsorbents respectively by increasing the ph from acidic to basic the adsorbents negative zeta potential and mb solution positive zeta potential were increased 3 2 adsorption characterization fig 4 c and figure s5 show the edx map and spectrum of go cu mof nanoparticles after adsorption of mb 50 mg l solution loaded go cu mof since only one sulfur atom existed in the mb molecular formula and due to the sulfur mapping fig 4c and number of sulfur atoms it can be concluded that mb covered the surface of the material this proof is in agreement with the ftir spectrum of loaded go cu mof fig 4a the characteristic peaks of go cu mof and cu mof were shifted to lower or higher wavenumbers and showed the surface bonding between mb and adsorbents table s4 summarizes the peak shift of the ftir spectrum of cu mof and go cu mof after dye adsorption the xrd patterns of go cu mof and loaded go cu mof was shown in fig 4 b the sharp peak of mb around 2 θ 16 o exist at both the mb and loaded go cu mof these two peaks were overlapped each other completely and confirmed the dye presence in go cu mof particles both the loaded go cu mof and the go cu mof patterns approximately followed the same shape but with the difference in peak angle and intensity for instance a peak at 2 θ 9 35 o represented 220 indices of cu btc shifted to 10 6 for the loaded sample the same inclination was observed for other characteristic peaks this change in peak location and intensity along with peak shifts in ftir spectrum of the loaded go cu mof fig 4a all justify that the major adsorption mechanism was the surface adsorption due to the bondage between active groups of adsorbents and mb 72 the tem images of loaded go cu mof clearly showed the dye particles in the structure of go cu mof fig 5 the mb visual size distribution and clear boundaries between dye particles demonstrated no dye agglomeration which decreasesd the chance of dye physical adsorption as one of the main adsorption mechanisms 3 3 adsorption evaluation series of dye adsorption tests were conducted for systematic evaluation of the adsorption process of mb on the fabricated nps at different conditions as listed in section 2 3 3 1 effect of ph on adsorption fig 6 illustrates the effect of ph on the adsorption of mb on the fabricated mofs compounds for both adsorbents the adsorption versus ph curves followed the same trend the adsorption of mb on the mofs decreased by increasing ph the electrostatic interactions affect the reaction of cationic groups of methylene blue and anionic groups of cu mof and go cu mof at lower ph this interaction can occur through two mechanisms including i methyl groups of mb and carboxylate group of cu btc in both cu mof and go cu mof ii carbonyl and epoxide groups of go cu mof 72 increasing the ph weakened the electrostatic interaction between the dye and adsorbents since the dye solutions zeta potential and adsorbents change in the same direction fig 6 and then at the alkaline ph π π interactions and van der waals bonds are the dominates go cu mof at lower ph showed around 20 more adsorption than the cu mof this behavior can be justified based on the fact that the presence of the extra functional groups such as the carbonyl and epoxide in the go cu mof as a result of go exfoliation provided more adsorption active sites and hospitable environment for dye capture 73 also there is a possible interaction between benzene rings of go and mb might 74 3 3 2 kinetics of adsorption process fig 7 a and b show the dye concentration pattern with adsorption contact time the same trend was reported in the literature 75 76 both materials were shown fast dye uptake in the first 2 h of the process with a slight reduction in 8 h the equilibrium stage was reached after twelve hours towards the end of the adsorption process for 24 h the adsorption behavior can be interpreted based on two different mechanisms of chemical interaction and physical entrapment the fast adsorption at the first 30 min of contact time implied the external surface diffusion 77 the numerous active surface sites of organic ligands in cu mof and various functional groups on go provided appropriate physicochemical environments for chemical interaction surface adsorption with dyes molecules to be captured after the saturation of these sites the probability of chemical adsorption decreased since there were fewer places available for interacting with the dyes molecules then the physical adsorption intraparticle adsorption became dominant finally the electrostatic dye repulsion phenomena happened until reaching the equilibrium stage table s5 represents the curve fitting of experimental data with the pseudo first order and pseudo second order equations and based on the analyzed data the pseudo second order reaction is the valid expression of the adsorption reaction 3 3 3 thermodynamics analysis of the isotherms adsorption process fig 8 c and d demonstrates the isotherm curves of cu mof and go cu mof also table 1 represents isothermal parameters obtained from the langmuir freundlich and langmuir freundlich models the qmax value for cu mof at 25 c was 110 mg g and for go cu mof it was 155 mg g that implied 40 increment in adsorption as can be seen in fig 7 c and d at lower concentrations of dye reaching the equilibrium occurs rapidly and intense this intensity shows the probability of adsorption in different regions this is in agreement with the hypothesis that dye molecules were adsorbed on the outer surface of materials and made monolayer coverage there are more available capture sites in nanoparticles for dyes in lower initial dye concentration in comparison with higher initial dye concentration increasing the temperature from 25 to 65 c for both adsorbents enhanced the qmax the qmax for cu mof increased from 106 to 142 mg g and for go cu mof increased from 173 to 262 mg g for this change might be the result of adsorption active site reinforcement at higher temperature 78 79 the active sites reinforcement happen due to the breakage on internal bonds of the adsorbents go cu mof at a higher temperature and results in the generation of more active sites 78 79 also dye molecules can penetrate more easily into the material network at higher temperature due to the increment in their diffusion potential which is higher at higher temperature 3 3 3 4

14114,in this paper water from the yellow river reservoir was treated with polyaluminum chloride pac and a pac chitosan cts composite to study the flocculation efficiency changes in the flocculation characteristics and the role played by cts in the process of coagulation the floc microstructure was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and the floc characteristics and fractal dimension were studied using a laser particle size analyzer the results showed that addition of a small quantity of cts could produce a relatively good coagulation effect and the removal effect of each index increased by 8 7 46 83 compared with that obtained with only pac however as the dose increased the effects on various indexes did not increase significantly under the same conditions the growth rate and size of flocs formed with the composite coagulant containing cts were better than those obtained with only pac with an increase in the floc size about 36 67 with cts the floc regeneration capacity showed the opposite trend it is likely that when long chain bridging is dominant the conditions are more conducive to rapid formation of structured and dense flocs by contrast when electrical neutralization plays a leading role the flocs have better disintegration and regeneration abilities keywords flocculation drug distribution floc characteristic flocculation mechanism 1 introduction shandong china is a region with severe water shortages because it is located along the lower reaches of the yellow river the river has become the main water source for cities in this region the water quality in the lower reaches of the river is poor because of the serious pollution the turbidity of water in the downstream reservoir can be greatly decreased by long term storage but because of the influence of nonpoint source pollution the contents of nitrogen phosphorus and other substances in the water increase sharply with storage as temperatures rise the growth of algae increases in the nutrient rich water which can decrease the water quality consequently effective removal of algae from water is becoming increasingly important in modern water treatment systems in winter the reservoir has a low temperature and low turbidity because it contains fewer particles which increases the difficulty of water treatment removal of organic compounds is of great significance for reducing the use of coagulants and disinfectants and reducing the production of disinfection by products and carcinogens one of the best ways to remove natural organic matter from the water and ensure the safety of the water supply is to improve the effect of coagulation used with existing technology in the current drinking water treatment process coagulation is used to remove particles and organic matter from the water this is followed by precipitation air flotation sand filtration and other processes the conventional treatment process shows good removal of turbidity but not organic matter on the premise of not changing the existing process improving coagulation is one of the best ways to remove natural organic matter from water and control formation of disinfection by products in the process of drinking water treatment coagulation is mainly used to remove particles and organic matter from the water and this is followed by precipitation air flotation sand filtration and other processes 1 the removal of organic compounds is important for reducing the use of coagulants and disinfectants and reducing the production of disinfection by products and carcinogens the type of coagulant used plays an important role in the coagulation process and affects the performance 2 aluminum salt coagulants are more widely used than iron salts because they have better treatment effects and iron containing flocculants such as molysite can change the water color which is not desirable however aluminum salts have some environmental and health problems for example residual aluminum in water has been linked with alzheimer s disease 3 therefore research has increasingly focused on new types of coagulants chitosan cts is a linear polymer polysaccharide obtained by deacetylation of chitin 4 it contains β 1 4 glycosidic bonds is rich in amino and hydroxyl groups and contains some polar n acetyl amino groups 5 the structure of cts makes it suitable for adsorption and chemical modification consequently it is used for many as applications in medicine food agriculture and environmental protection 6 10 it is available from a wide range of sources and because it is natural non toxic and environmentally friendly it has been approved by the united states food and drug administration as a food additive and as a drinking water purification purifier by the united states environmental protection agency 11 however presently cts and its derivatives are mainly used as flocculants and adsorbents in sewage treatment and are rarely used in drinking water treatment their only application in drinking water treatment is as flocculants 12 14 studies have shown that the sizes and structures of flocs affect coagulation the removal efficiency of small flocs is low and the sedimentation rate is generally slower than that of large flocs with similar density 15 floc growth is the process of floc formation and disintegration 16 a change in the water shear force will affect the floc size and the floc regeneration ability will affect the subsequent treatment effect therefore it is necessary to explore the characteristics of flocs generated with different coagulants there have been relatively few studies on pollutant removal mechanisms and flocculation characteristics with cts in this study cts was investigated as a coagulant and a simulation test was carried out with it in a mixture with polyaluminum chloride pac the effect of cts polymer adsorption bridging in coagulation was explored to study the coagulation mechanism of suspended particles and agents the results could be used to

mixing 200 r min 30 s slow mixing 50 r min 15 min and static hold for 30 min then we determined the turbidity of the supernatant fluid codmn uv254 the detection methods were carried out in accordance with the method described in the methods for the analysis of water and wastewater fourth edition supplement the dose range of aluminum salt coagulant was 0 6 mg l al3 the composite coagulant was prepared according to preliminary optimization test results from shan et al the pac cts ratio was 5 9 2 4 apparatus and analysis of floc morphology a beaker test device was used for process improvement fig 1 the ipda was used to detect the flocculation process the output signals of the ipda were the average light transmission intensity pulse value and flocculation index which is an indicator of flocculation changes in water the ipda was set to record measurements every 3 5 s the mastersizer 3000e was used to detect changes in the floc particle size the output signals of the mastersizer 3000e were the median particle size and specific surface area which can sensitively reflect changes in the floc particle size in water this instrument was set to record measurements every 3 5 s both the ipda and the mastersizer 3000e used the same measurement interval and same water sample for detection the zeta potential of the outlet water was using a marvin zeta potential analyzer

calculated by image analysis scattering and particle size distribution methods 17 the scattering method was used in this study a mastersizer 3000e laser particle size meter was used to measure the fractal dimensions of the flocs by laser diffraction for each condition six experiments were performed for the complete process of initiation dosing coagulation disintegration and regrowth the laser in the mastersizer 3000e has a wavelength of 630 nm this was used to irradiate the flocs in the coagulated water sample and 47 photosensitive detectors were used to receive the scattered laser light from the flocs the scattering vector corresponding to the photosensitive detector q was calculated using eq 1 1 as follows 1 1 q 4 π n sin θ 2 λ where n is the refractive index of the floc suspension medium i e the refractive index of water θ is the scattering angle of the laser and λ is the wavelength of the laser the exponential relationship between the scattered light intensity i the scattering vector q and the flocs fractal dimension d f is given by eq 2 1 2 i q df the slope of the straightest segment of the logi and logq fitted curve is the flocculation fractal dimension d f the larger the d f the denser the fractal structure by contrast flocs with smaller d f values are less dense 2 6 determination of floc regeneration after partial coagulation section 2 3 disintegration 200 r min was performed for 5 min then the stirring speed was reduced to 50 r min for 15 min and the flocculant mass was increased the particle size of the flocs was expressed as the mean particle size d 50 the breaking resistance of flocs under a strong shear force was evaluated using the strength factor as follows 1 3 r f 1 d 1 d 2 100 where d 1 is the average particle size before disintegration and d 2 is the average particle size after disintegration 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of coagulant type and dose on different indexes the effects of different coagulant types and their doses on the effluent characteristics and coagulation were investigated the coagulation effect of cts with and without pac was first studied from the perspective of turbidity removal efficiency and the zeta potential change in the coagulation process was measured with both the single and composite coagulants the turbidity removal effect increased as the dose increased fig 2 when only pac was used the turbidity removal effect was linearly related to increases in the zeta potential the highest turbidity removal effect 87 16 was achieved when the potential was near the isoelectric point when cts was added the turbidity removal effect at low doses was high and the removal efficiency increased by 46 84 compared with that of only pac however as the compound dose increased further the turbidity removal effect did not increase significantly and was basically in a stable state the turbidity removal effect under the same conditions with cts was not as good as that with only pac and decreased by about 10 in the same period which was consistent with the change in the number of particles fig 3 in addition with the addition of cts although the zeta potential increased with increases in the coagulant dose the turbidity removal efficiency did not increase accordingly fig 2 this indicates that after addition of cts the entire coagulation process is not dominated by electric neutralization and most of the potential increase is caused by the large positive charge of cts itself the results of henderson et al show that cts has a long macromolecular chain structure which can enhance the adsorption bridging 18 the effect of adding cts after pac was not was not as good as that of introduction of cts before pac because it resulted in excess cts excess cts would increase the repulsive force between the flocs and decrease their stability these results are consistent with those from other studies 19 therefore when cts is used in a composite coagulant it is advisable to add it to the ground 3 2 changes in the flocs with different coagulant doses and methods of addition research has shown that the stability of the floc particle size determines the settling performance and coagulation effect to some extent 20 this study explored changes in flocculation characteristics with different coagulant types and doses fig 4 generally there are two stages of floc growth after the addition of a coagulant one is rapid growth stage in which floc particle size increases rapidly the other is a stable stage where the floc size reaches a stable state with a balance between growth and fragmentation 21 a high flocculation rate can shorten the flocculation time the parts of fig 4a and b to the left of the dotted line shows changes in floc growth over the whole coagulation process with different coagulant types and doses the floc particle size and growth rate increase with increases in the coagulant dose a comparison of the coagulation results achieved under different conditions shows that the maximum flocculation particle size is reached with a pac dose of 5 mg l and cts dose of 2 78 mg l during the rapid growth stage as the coagulant dose increases the floc size increases to a maximum the time taken to reach the stable stage gradually decreased from around 780 600 s at a low dose to about 200 s at the optimum dose the composite coagulant reached the stable stage at a much faster rate than only pac in addition compared with only pac the composite coagulant formed large flocs which may be attributed to the adsorption bridging capacity of cts which is more conducive to the formation of large flocs than electric neutralization to study the strengths of flocs generated under different conditions and the influence of different mechanisms on the flocs the flocs in this study were broken and regenerated after the flocs grew steadily floc regeneration under various conditions is shown to the right of the dotted line in fig 4a and b the results showed that the flocs disintegrated to different degrees after the mixing speed was suddenly changed and the shear force increased however after decreasing the mixing speed to the original speed the broken flocs tended to regenerate and gradually increase in size until they became stable the degree of flocs disintegration depended on the strength of adhesion and shear force when only pac was used the floc strength factor decreased gradually 0 99 to 0 78 as the electroneutralization effect was enhanced with the composite coagulant the bridging effect and the floc strength factor gradually increased 0 88 to 0 91 with increases in the dose therefore flocs produced by electric neutralization is weaker than those produced by adsorption bridging further experimental studies are needed to determine the effect of net trapping fig 4a and b also shows floc disintegration for the two types of coagulants at low doses when the shear force was increased suddenly floc formation stopped and obvious disintegration occurred the floc size then stabilized and was slightly higher than that from before the floc disintegration this may occur because a low floc dose will give slow floc growth and the floc will not have reached the maximum particle size by the end of the coagulation process then after the change in the shear force the flocs can grow more the floc regeneration results obtained after changing the shear force showed that the flocs only regenerated to their previous size at a low dose which is similar to the results of zhao et al 22 the recovery of flocs generated by the cts composite coagulation after disintegration was not as good as with only pac this may occur because the main mechanism of action of the composite coagulant is adsorption bridging and the regeneration ability for the flocs is poor with only pac the electroneutralization effect was dominant and the floc recovery was stronger this is similar to the results of aguilar et al who found that flocs formed by electroneutralization could be completely regenerated and those formed by net capture and adsorption showed poor regeneration 23 24 fig 4c and d shows changes in the floc fractal dimension d f during coagulation with different coagulant types and different dose throughout the coagulation process d f increased continuously and slowly as the coagulation time increased and reached a maximum value after completion of the slow stirring stage fig 4c a comparison of the floc size and the fractal dimension showed that larger particles were stronger denser and had larger fractal dimensions than smaller particles after reaching the maximum value any further increases in the coagulant dose or stirring time resulted in a decrease in the fractal dimension this may be caused by internal restructuring of the floc during growth 3 3 effect of the coagulant type and dose on the removal efficiency of organic matter different types of coagulants will affect the effluent characteristics and coagulation effect we investigated the influence of cts addition on the coagulation performance using the toc uv254 and zeta potential fig 5 when only pac was used the removal rate of each index gradually increased with increases in the coagulant dose the removal rates of toc and uv254 increased from 6 03 to 23 7 and 1 96 to 35 29 respectively the zeta potential of the outlet water also increased and gradually approached the point of zero charge these results suggest that pac will be important in environments where electric neutralization is the dominant mechanism when cts was added to the coagulant a very good coagulation effect was achieved at a low dose compared with pac on its own the removal efficiency of each index increased by 8 7 46 83 which was similar to the results of bolot et al 25 when metal coagulants are used together with organic polymers the same removal performance can be achieved at a lower dose however as drug dose continues to increase the removal effect becomes less obvious and some indexes such as the toc increase this may occur because the cts is macromolecular organic matter and at high doses not all of the cts will combine with impurities in the water consequently there will be an excess of cts that will affect the toc in addition when the composite coagulant was used the zeta potential of the effluent increased with increases in the coagulant dose and reached the point of zero charge according to earlier research 26 at this point the electrical neutralization mechanism will be dominant and the electricity neutralization capacity will be high however in our results the removal rates for the various indexes showed that the zeta potential moved toward the point of zero charge the removal rate of each index does not highlight changes and with the augmentation of the electrical neutralization effect the removal efficiency of pollutants and no obvious growth it is in low dose achieved good effect therefore we speculated that the composite coagulation process was dominated by the adsorption bridging mechanism and the electrical neutralization mechanism played a secondary role after the zeta potential increased to zero the removal effects of some indexes also increased the net capture and sweep mechanism may have played a role in this but further study is required to determine whether it is the dominant mechanism at this time and what role it plays the presence of fluorescent organic compounds in the water was evaluated to investigate the removal effect of the composite coagulant and their relationship with the coagulation mechanism three dimensional 3d fluorescence spectra are obtained by projecting the fluorescence intensity as a contour line on a plane with the wavelengths of excitation and emission light as the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively the relationships between fluorescence intensity and the excitation and emission wavelengths can be obtained simultaneously substances can be qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed using the unique 3d fluorescence spectral information for fluorescent compounds because 3d fluorescence spectra contain abundant spectral information they are referred to as fingerprints in recent years because of its high sensitivity simple detection and intuitive imaging this technology has been widely used in the environmental field especially for studies of dissolved organic compounds 27 when analyzing the fluorescence spectrum the excitation emission wavelength of each fluorescence peak and the corresponding fluorescence intensity can be obtained by analyzing the spectral matrix of the the aqueous sample in this experiment 3d fluorescence spectra were used to investigate the effluent produced with different coagulant types and doses the obtained excitation emission matrices were divided into the following five regions for statistical analysis and sorting tyrosine containing proteins emission em 220 250 nm and excitation ex 280 330 nm tryptophan containing proteins em 220 250 nm and ex 330 380 nm fulvic acids em 220 250 nm and ex 380 480 nm soluble microbial metabolites em 250 360 nm and ex 280 380 nm and humic acids em 250 420 nm and ex 380 520 nm microbial metabolites were the main components in the water analyzed in this study and their fluorescence intensities were much higher than those of other substances fig 6 in order of abundance these metabolites were followed by tyrosine containing proteins humic acids and fulvic acids as the coagulant dose increased the removal effect of each fluorescent substance also increased when the dose was 1 mg l the effects of the composite coagulant on removal of soluble microbial products smps and tyrosine proteins were significantly lower than those of pac on its own however when the dose increased the effect of the composite coagulant on the treatment of two fluorescent substances was significantly enhanced because of the former the content of alb depends on the ph of the water because the ph of raw water is in the range of 8 1 8 4 the effect of alb content on the removal effect is limited therefore it may be that with the increase of the dosage the cts in the compound strengthens the bridging effect and enhances the removal effect of smps 28 however with a low dose further studies are need to evaluate whether the addition of cts causes a change in the coagulation mechanism affect alb content or the ability of electrical neutralization resulting in poor removal effect of smp the removal rates of humic acids with the pac and pac cts coagulants were 30 06 and 26 85 respectively the removal rate with only pac was better than that with the composite coagulant indicating that electrical neutralization was beneficial for the removal of humic acids when it had a dominant role these results are similar to those of cheng 29 and kam et al 30 the increase was not large which may be because the electrical neutralization mechanism was active in both dosing modes even if it was more obvious when only pac was used the removal rates of fulvic acids with the pac and pac cts coagulants were 26 79 and 26 89 respectively the removal effect on fulvic acids was better in some cases these results are consistent with those of zhou na and others 31 32 compared with fluvic acids humic acids may combine more with al3 to increase the particle size change the zeta potential and promote the formation of flocs the results in section 3 1 showed that the removal rate of uv254 was very similar to that of humic acids therefore the aromatic conjugated structure may be the main functional group in humic acids 3 4 changes in the floc structure with different coagulant types and doses to analyze the floc structure from a micro perspective two groups of flocs with obvious effects were selected and analyzed by sem after coagulation the images were recorded at 1000 to 10 000 magnification and differences in the floc surface morphology were compared the sem images of flocs produced with different coagulants under the same conditions were measured after freeze drying panels labeled with a 1 show the surfaces of flocs produced with only pac and those labeled with a 2 shows the surfaces of flocs generated with the pac cts composite fig 7 in the absence of the bridging effect the formation of flocs mainly depends on the addition of aluminum salt coagulants aluminum ions or polymers to neutralize the surface charge of a colloid and destroy its stability so it can break through the energy barrier and have contact and collisions between particles this process is referred to as colloid condensation generated by single point and neutralization a comparison of figs 1b and 2 b shows that when only pac is used the floc surface is uneven with many large clusters flake like structures and rod like structures addition of cts leads to production of flocs with smooth surfaces fig 2c and d because cts increases the floc density which results in fewer cavities and small flocs are wrapped in and have stronger adsorption capacity generally the bridging effect of a polymer plays a very important role in the formation of flocs and can effectively aggregate particles into flocs 33 at the same time particles with poor regeneration abilities or no activity can be adsorbed on the surfaces of the flocs this removes particles that are inactive or have low activity 4 conclusions the coagulation performances of pac and a pac cts composite were studied by evaluating basic water quality indexes the coagulation mechanism and floc growth disintegration and regrowth the results were used to explore the role of cts in coagulation treatment under normal conditions as the quantity of coagulant added increased the non uniform growth time of the flocs decreased gradually and the fractal dimension increased linearly there was a linear relationship between the turbidity removal efficiency and the floc fractal dimension at different coagulant doses compared with pac on its own the composite with cts was very effective at removing turbidity and various organic compounds in the floc growth stage flocs formed with the pac cts composite had higher growth rates and average particle sizes than flocs formed using only pac however the flocs formed with only pac had better transformation abilities than those formed with pac cts the regeneration abilities of flocs formed by electric neutralization were better than those formed by bridging an analysis of the fractal dimensions of flocs with the different coagulants showed that when the bridging mechanism was dominant the fractal dimensions of the flocs and their densities increased sem of the flocs under these conditions also confirmed that the bridging action of long chain

14114,in this paper water from the yellow river reservoir was treated with polyaluminum chloride pac and a pac chitosan cts composite to study the flocculation efficiency changes in the flocculation characteristics and the role played by cts in the process of coagulation the floc microstructure was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and the floc characteristics and fractal dimension were studied using a laser particle size analyzer the results showed that addition of a small quantity of cts could produce a relatively good coagulation effect and the removal effect of each index increased by 8 7 46 83 compared with that obtained with only pac however as the dose increased the effects on various indexes did not increase significantly under the same conditions the growth rate and size of flocs formed with the composite coagulant containing cts were better than those obtained with only pac with an increase in the floc size about 36 67 with cts the floc regeneration capacity showed the opposite trend it is likely that when long chain bridging is dominant the conditions are more conducive to rapid formation of structured and dense flocs by contrast when electrical neutralization plays a leading role the flocs have better disintegration and regeneration abilities keywords flocculation drug distribution floc characteristic flocculation mechanism 1 introduction shandong china is a region with severe water shortages because it is located along the lower reaches of the yellow river the river has become the main water source for cities in this region the water quality in the lower reaches of the river is poor because of the serious pollution the turbidity of water in the downstream reservoir can be greatly decreased by long term storage but because of the influence of nonpoint source pollution the contents of nitrogen phosphorus and other substances in the water increase sharply with storage as temperatures rise the growth of algae increases in the nutrient rich water which can decrease the water quality consequently effective removal of algae from water is becoming increasingly important in modern water treatment systems in winter the reservoir has a low temperature and low turbidity because it contains fewer particles which increases the difficulty of water treatment removal of organic compounds is of great significance for reducing the use of coagulants and disinfectants and reducing the production of disinfection by products and carcinogens one of the best ways to remove natural organic matter from the water and ensure the safety of the water supply is to improve the effect of coagulation used with existing technology in the current drinking water treatment process coagulation is used to remove particles and organic matter from the water this is followed by precipitation air flotation sand filtration and other processes the conventional treatment process shows good removal of turbidity but not organic matter on the premise of not changing the existing process improving coagulation is one of the best ways to remove natural organic matter from water and control formation of disinfection by products in the process of drinking water treatment coagulation is mainly used to remove particles and organic matter from the water and this is followed by precipitation air flotation sand filtration and other processes 1 the removal of organic compounds is important for reducing the use of coagulants and disinfectants and reducing the production of disinfection by products and carcinogens the type of coagulant used plays an important role in the coagulation process and affects the performance 2 aluminum salt coagulants are more widely used than iron salts because they have better treatment effects and iron containing flocculants such as molysite can change the water color which is not desirable however aluminum salts have some environmental and health problems for example residual aluminum in water has been linked with alzheimer s disease 3 therefore research has increasingly focused on new types of coagulants chitosan cts is a linear polymer polysaccharide obtained by deacetylation of chitin 4 it contains β 1 4 glycosidic bonds is rich in amino and hydroxyl groups and contains some polar n acetyl amino groups 5 the structure of cts makes it suitable for adsorption and chemical modification consequently it is used for many as applications in medicine food agriculture and environmental protection 6 10 it is available from a wide range of sources and because it is natural non toxic and environmentally friendly it has been approved by the united states food and drug administration as a food additive and as a drinking water purification purifier by the united states environmental protection agency 11 however presently cts and its derivatives are mainly used as flocculants and adsorbents in sewage treatment and are rarely used in drinking water treatment their only application in drinking water treatment is as flocculants 12 14 studies have shown that the sizes and structures of flocs affect coagulation the removal efficiency of small flocs is low and the sedimentation rate is generally slower than that of large flocs with similar density 15 floc growth is the process of floc formation and disintegration 16 a change in the water shear force will affect the floc size and the floc regeneration ability will affect the subsequent treatment effect therefore it is necessary to explore the characteristics of flocs generated with different coagulants there have been relatively few studies on pollutant removal mechanisms and flocculation characteristics with cts in this study cts was investigated as a coagulant and a simulation test was carried out with it in a mixture with polyaluminum chloride pac the effect of cts polymer adsorption bridging in coagulation was explored to study the coagulation mechanism of suspended particles and agents the results could be used to improve the coagulation performance and effluent quality and provide reference data for future research on pharmaceuticals and mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw water quality the water intake

fractal dimensions of the flocs by laser diffraction for each condition six experiments were performed for the complete process of initiation dosing coagulation disintegration and regrowth the laser

breaking resistance of flocs under a strong shear force was evaluated using the strength factor as follows 1 3 r f 1 d 1 d 2 100 where d 1 is the average particle size before disintegration and d 2 is the average particle size after disintegration 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of coagulant type and dose on different indexes the effects of different coagulant types and their doses on the effluent characteristics and coagulation were investigated the coagulation effect of cts with and without pac was first studied from the perspective of turbidity removal efficiency and the zeta potential change in the coagulation process was measured with both the single and composite coagulants the turbidity removal effect increased as the dose increased fig 2 when only pac was used the turbidity removal effect was linearly related to increases in the zeta potential the highest turbidity removal effect 87 16 was achieved when the potential was near the isoelectric point when cts was added the turbidity removal effect at low doses was high and the removal efficiency increased by 46 84 compared with that of only pac however as the compound dose increased further the turbidity removal effect did not increase significantly and was basically in a stable state the turbidity removal effect under the same conditions with cts was not as good as that with only pac and decreased by about 10 in the same period which was consistent with the change in the number of particles fig 3 in addition with the addition of cts although the zeta potential increased with increases in the coagulant dose the turbidity removal efficiency did not increase accordingly fig 2 this indicates that after addition of cts the entire coagulation process is not dominated by electric neutralization and most of the potential increase is caused by the large positive charge of cts itself the results of henderson et al show that cts has a long macromolecular chain structure which can enhance the adsorption bridging 18 the effect of adding cts after pac was not was not as good as that of introduction of cts before pac because it resulted in excess cts excess cts would increase the repulsive force between the flocs and decrease their stability these results are consistent with those from other studies 19 therefore when cts is used in a composite coagulant it is advisable to add it to the ground 3 2 changes in the flocs with different coagulant doses and methods of addition research has shown that the stability of the floc particle size determines the settling performance and coagulation effect to some extent 20 this study explored changes in flocculation characteristics with different coagulant types and doses fig 4 generally there are two stages of floc growth after the addition of a coagulant one is rapid growth stage in which floc particle size increases rapidly the other is a stable stage where the floc size reaches a stable state with a balance between growth and fragmentation 21 a high flocculation rate can shorten the flocculation time the parts of fig 4a and b to the left of the dotted line shows changes in floc growth over the whole coagulation process with different coagulant types and doses the floc particle size and growth rate increase with increases in the coagulant dose a comparison of the coagulation results achieved under different conditions shows that the maximum flocculation particle size is reached with a pac dose of 5 mg l and cts dose of 2 78 mg l during the rapid growth stage as the coagulant dose increases the floc size increases to a maximum the time taken to reach the stable stage gradually decreased from around 780 600 s at a low dose to about 200 s at the optimum dose the composite coagulant reached the stable stage at a much faster rate than only pac in addition compared with only pac the composite coagulant formed large flocs which may be attributed to the adsorption bridging capacity of cts which is more conducive to the formation of large flocs than electric neutralization to study the strengths of flocs generated under different conditions and the influence of different mechanisms on the flocs the flocs in this study were broken and regenerated after the flocs grew steadily floc regeneration under various conditions is shown to the right of the dotted line in fig 4a and b the results showed that the flocs disintegrated to different degrees after the mixing speed was suddenly changed and the shear force increased however after decreasing the mixing speed to the original speed the broken flocs tended to regenerate and gradually increase in size until they became stable the degree of flocs disintegration depended on the strength of adhesion and shear force when only pac was used the floc strength factor decreased gradually 0 99 to 0 78 as the electroneutralization effect was enhanced with the composite coagulant the bridging effect and the floc strength factor gradually increased 0 88 to 0 91 with increases in the dose therefore flocs produced by electric neutralization is weaker than those produced by adsorption bridging further experimental studies are needed to determine the effect of net trapping fig 4a and b also shows floc disintegration for the two types of coagulants at low doses when the shear force was increased suddenly floc formation stopped and obvious disintegration occurred the floc size then stabilized and was slightly higher than that from before the floc disintegration this may occur because a low floc dose will give slow floc growth and the floc will not have reached the maximum particle size by the end of the coagulation process then after the change in the shear force the flocs can grow more the floc regeneration results obtained after changing the shear force showed that the flocs only regenerated to their previous size at a low dose which is similar to the results of zhao et al 22 the recovery of flocs generated by the cts composite coagulation after disintegration was not as good as with only pac this may occur because the main mechanism of action of the composite coagulant is adsorption bridging and the regeneration ability for the flocs is poor with only pac the electroneutralization effect was dominant and the floc recovery was stronger this is similar to the results of aguilar et al who found that flocs formed by electroneutralization could be completely regenerated and those formed by net capture and adsorption showed poor regeneration 23 24 fig 4c and d shows changes in the floc fractal dimension d f during coagulation with different coagulant types and different dose throughout the coagulation process d f increased continuously and slowly as the coagulation time increased and reached a maximum value after completion of the slow stirring stage fig 4c a comparison of the floc size and the fractal dimension showed that larger particles were stronger denser and had larger fractal dimensions than smaller particles after reaching the maximum value any further increases in the coagulant dose or stirring time resulted in a decrease in the fractal dimension this may be caused by internal restructuring of the floc during growth 3 3 effect of the coagulant type and dose on the removal efficiency of organic matter different types of coagulants will affect the effluent characteristics and coagulation effect we investigated the influence of cts addition on the coagulation performance using the toc uv254 and zeta potential fig 5 when only pac was used the removal rate of each index gradually increased with increases in the coagulant dose the removal rates of toc and uv254 increased from 6 03 to 23 7 and 1 96 to 35 29 respectively the zeta potential of the outlet water also increased and gradually approached the point of zero charge these results suggest that pac will be important in environments where electric neutralization is the dominant mechanism when cts was added to the coagulant a very good coagulation effect was achieved at a low dose compared with pac on its own the removal efficiency of each index increased by 8 7 46 83 which was similar to the results of bolot et al 25 when metal coagulants are used together with organic polymers the same removal performance can be achieved at a lower dose however as drug dose continues to increase the removal effect becomes less obvious and some indexes such as the toc increase this may occur because the cts is macromolecular organic matter and at high doses not all of the cts will combine with impurities in the water consequently there will be an excess of cts that will affect the toc in addition when the composite coagulant was used the zeta potential of the effluent increased with increases in the coagulant dose and reached the point of zero charge according to earlier research 26 at this point the electrical neutralization mechanism will be dominant and the electricity neutralization capacity will be high however in our results the removal rates for the various indexes showed that the zeta potential moved toward the point of zero charge the removal rate of each index does not highlight changes and with the augmentation of the electrical neutralization effect the removal efficiency of pollutants and no obvious growth it is in low dose achieved good effect therefore we speculated that the composite coagulation process was dominated by the adsorption bridging mechanism and the electrical neutralization mechanism played a secondary role after the zeta potential increased to zero the removal effects of some indexes also increased the net capture and sweep mechanism may have played a role in this but further study is required to determine whether it is the dominant mechanism at this time and what role it plays the presence of fluorescent organic compounds in the water was evaluated to investigate the removal effect of the composite coagulant and their relationship with the coagulation mechanism three dimensional 3d fluorescence spectra are obtained by projecting the fluorescence intensity as a contour line on a plane with the wavelengths of excitation and emission light as the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively the relationships between fluorescence intensity and the excitation and emission wavelengths can be obtained simultaneously substances can be qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed using the unique 3d fluorescence spectral information for fluorescent compounds because 3d fluorescence spectra contain abundant spectral information they are referred to as fingerprints in recent years because of its high sensitivity simple detection and intuitive imaging this technology has been widely used in the environmental field especially for studies of dissolved organic compounds 27 when analyzing the fluorescence spectrum the excitation emission wavelength of each fluorescence peak and the corresponding fluorescence intensity can be obtained by analyzing the spectral matrix of the the aqueous sample in this experiment 3d fluorescence spectra were used to investigate the effluent produced with different coagulant types and doses the obtained excitation emission matrices were divided into the following five regions for statistical analysis and sorting tyrosine containing proteins emission em 220 250 nm and excitation ex 280 330 nm tryptophan containing proteins em 220 250 nm and ex 330 380 nm fulvic acids em 220 250 nm and ex 380 480 nm soluble microbial metabolites em 250 360 nm and ex 280 380 nm and humic acids em 250 420 nm and ex 380 520 nm microbial metabolites were the main components in the water analyzed in this study and their fluorescence intensities were much higher than those of other substances fig 6 in order of abundance these metabolites were followed by tyrosine containing proteins humic acids and fulvic acids as the coagulant dose increased the removal effect of each fluorescent substance also increased when the dose was 1 mg l the effects of the composite coagulant on removal of soluble microbial products smps and tyrosine proteins were significantly lower than those of pac on its own however when the dose increased the effect of the composite coagulant on the treatment of two fluorescent substances was significantly enhanced because of the former the content of alb depends on the ph of the water because the ph of raw water is in the range of 8 1 8 4 the effect of alb content on the removal effect is limited therefore it may be that with the increase of the dosage the cts in the compound strengthens the bridging effect and enhances the removal effect of smps 28 however with a low dose further studies are need to evaluate whether the addition of cts causes a change in the coagulation mechanism affect alb content or the ability of electrical neutralization resulting in poor removal effect of smp the removal rates of humic acids with the pac and pac cts coagulants were 30 06 and 26 85 respectively the removal rate with only pac was better than that with the composite coagulant indicating that electrical neutralization was beneficial for the removal of humic acids when it had a dominant role these results are similar to those of cheng 29 and kam et al 30 the increase was not large which may be because the electrical neutralization mechanism was active in both dosing modes even if it was more obvious when only pac was used the removal rates of fulvic acids with the pac and pac cts coagulants were 26 79 and 26 89 respectively the removal effect on fulvic acids was better in some cases these results are consistent with those of zhou na and others 31 32 compared with fluvic acids humic acids may combine more with al3 to increase the particle size change the zeta potential and promote the formation of flocs the results in section 3 1 showed that the removal rate of uv254 was very similar to that of humic acids therefore the aromatic conjugated structure may be the main functional group in humic acids 3 4 changes in the floc structure with different coagulant types and doses to analyze the floc structure from a micro perspective two groups of flocs with obvious effects were selected and analyzed by sem after coagulation the images were recorded at 1000 to 10 000 magnification and differences in the floc surface morphology were compared the sem images of flocs produced with different coagulants under the same conditions were measured after freeze drying panels labeled with a 1 show the surfaces of flocs produced with only pac and those labeled with a 2 shows the surfaces of flocs generated with the pac cts composite fig 7 in the absence of the bridging effect the formation of flocs mainly depends on the addition of aluminum salt coagulants aluminum ions or polymers to neutralize the surface charge of a colloid and destroy its stability so it can break through the energy barrier and have contact and collisions between particles this process is referred to as colloid condensation generated by single point and neutralization a comparison of figs 1b and 2 b shows that when only pac is used the floc surface is uneven with many large clusters flake like structures and rod like structures addition of cts leads to production of flocs with smooth surfaces fig 2c and d because cts increases the floc density which results in fewer cavities and small flocs are wrapped in and have stronger adsorption capacity generally the bridging effect of a polymer plays a very important role in the formation of flocs and can effectively aggregate particles into flocs 33 at the same time particles with poor regeneration abilities or no activity can be adsorbed on the surfaces of the flocs this removes particles that are inactive or have low activity 4 conclusions the coagulation performances of pac and a pac cts composite were studied by evaluating basic water quality indexes the coagulation mechanism and floc growth disintegration and regrowth the results were used to explore the role of cts in coagulation treatment under normal conditions as the quantity of coagulant added increased the non uniform growth time of the flocs decreased gradually and the fractal dimension increased linearly there was a linear relationship between the turbidity removal efficiency and the floc fractal dimension at different coagulant doses compared with pac on its own the composite with cts was very effective at removing turbidity and various organic compounds in the floc growth stage flocs formed with the pac cts composite had higher growth rates and average particle sizes than flocs formed using only pac however the flocs formed with only pac had better transformation abilities than those formed with pac cts the regeneration abilities of flocs formed by electric neutralization were better than those formed by bridging an analysis of the fractal dimensions of flocs with the different coagulants showed that when the bridging mechanism was dominant the fractal dimensions of the flocs and their densities increased sem of the flocs under these conditions also confirmed that the bridging action of long chain molecules played an important role in the formation of flocs and could make the flocs more compact declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no financial and personal relationships
