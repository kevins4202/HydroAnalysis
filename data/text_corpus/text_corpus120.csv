600,riparian vegetation acts as a corridor filter or barrier for the flow of material energy and information between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems while dam construction especially cascade dam construction bring huge changes to riparian vegetation in this study the changing of riparian vegetation cover in response to the construction and operation of large dams at different scale was analyzed the variations of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in longitudinal and transverse directions during pre and post dam construction were calculated and analyzed the results showed that dam height was the main determining factor for the range of riparian vegetation affected in the longitudinal direction whereas valley contour and distance to dam site affect the transverse direction vegetation together a linear or logarithmic relation between submerged area in transverse and the distance to dam were founded after dam construction the ndvi in the valley becomes uniform and the vegetation grows more homogeneously influence extent of different elevation in different reaches was discussed the intensive affected area including inundated area and 200 m from the water surface in vertical direction as the altitude grows the influence gets weak positive effect of a single dam on vegetation in upstream reservoir was found except near channel grade and a potential oligotrophic threat for the downstream vegetation was posted for cascade dams the vegetation in the upstream of xiaowan dam became better from elevation 200 400 m above original water surface the ndvi between xiaowan dam and manwan dam which at downstream of xiaowan but in reservoir of manwan degraded after xiaowan dam constructed cascade dams have cumulative effects on vegetation the influence are positive or negative mainly depend on diversion of the dam key words dam cascade dam riparian vegetation ndvi spatiotemporal cumulative effect 1 introduction riparian systems are the transition zones between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems organized in networks across landscapes vought 1994 stoy et al 2011 riparian zones along rivers and creeks have been identified as important elements of the landscape owing to their facilitating the flow of species energy and nutrients and their provision of corridors between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems gregory et al 1991 naimanand and décamps 1997 riverside vegetation is an important component of the riparian zone as well as an important ecozone between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems riparian vegetation transfer the flow of material energy and information between the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems naiman et al 1993 meek et al 2010 and it also has important hydrological ecological aesthetic and socio economic functions steiger et al 2010 gumiero et al 2015 dam construction weed invasion agricultural practices and overgrazing are the main pressures that threaten riparian vegetation and then influence the river geomorphology and river ecosystem kondolf et al 2007 tánago et al 2016 these activities affect the dynamic processes and environments of river and lead to changes in vegetation succession in the riparian zone among these river damming is essential to anticipate a barrier s long term environmental influence and a dominant anthropological effect on river systems cecilia et al 2016 sternberg 2006 yi et al 2017 as riparian vegetation is closely connected to discharge stochasticity it can experience remarkable changes after the construction of artificial reservoirs tealdi et al 2011 according to recent statistics two thirds of the world s rivers are affected by the development of more than 45 000 large and 80 000 small hydropower stations almost half of large dams 22 000 out of an estimated 45 000 are located in china fuggle and smith 2000 hydropower stations have generated great social and economic benefits at the same time they brought several ecological and environmental problems huang et al 2010 moreover cascade dam construction is more frequently utilized to increase economic efficiency lobera et al 2015 the effects of cascading hydropower dams on riparian vegetation distribution are more complex than those of single dams cheng et al 2012 li et al 2012 zhong et al 2007 hydrological regimes greatly affect the characteristics of riparian zones toner and keddy 1997 ollero et al 2010 particularly seasonal variations in flow and alternating wet and dry cycles dam construction for human uses has led to severe changes in the functioning of riparian ecosystem areas that directly adjoin and influence inland water bodies william 1996 nilsson and berggren 2000 poff et al 1997 son et al 2014 dam hinders material and energy exchange disrupts the longitudinal spread of plant seeds zhong et al 2007 reservoir impoundment inundates the riparian vegetation habitat the increased water surface area affects the local climatic environment and affects the structure and type of vegetation communities in the transverse and longitudinal directions sankey et al 2015 reservoir operation adjusted the flow regime of downstream and changed the hydrologic condition of flood plain gurnell et al 2016 corenblit et al 2007 the effect of the construction of cascading hydropower stations on riparian vegetation is cumulativity variability far reaching potentiality and complexity zhong et al 2007 and requires examination from different aspects while few research has taken for ecological influence of cascade dams when evaluating the effect of hydropower development on riparian vegetation the traditional method has been to use remote sensing image interpretation and classification to analyze land use patterns explore the dynamic characteristics of vegetation under different land uses and analyze the response in the relationship between land use change and vegetation dynamics chen et al 2006 with advances in theoretical research in recent years different methods and indices are now used to characterize riparian vegetation coverage and change the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is widely used in vegetation research and plant phenology research in combination with remote sensing imagery li et al 2016 it has become a powerful tool for ecologists and geomorphologists in riverine studies cecilia et al 2016 it is a good indicator for plant growth status and vegetation spatial distribution density zhang et al 2010 valor and caselles 1996 the ndvi has already been successfully applied to research on temporal and spatial trends and variation in vegetation distribution productivity and dynamics as well as for monitoring habitat degradation and fragmentation and the ecological effects of climatic disasters such as drought or fire pettorelli et al 2005 furthermore ndvi has been successfully used in research regarding global environmental change birtwistle et al 2016 used a seasonal increase in ndvi from landsat imagery to estimate monsoonal precipitation in arizona usa and marchetti et al 2015 used ndvi time series to analyze the functioning dynamics and express the degree of connectivity between a main channel and its floodplain previous studies have made a significant contribution to the use of ndvi to directly analyze vegetation changes however few studies have conducted a quantitative assessment of effects of dam construction in the longitudinal and transverse directions along the river or investigated the cumulative spatiotemporal effects of cascade dams on the riverbank vegetation therefore changes in ndvi can illustrate the changes in vegetation in response to dam construction in this study effects of dams on the riparian vegetation in the middle reaches of the jinsha and mekong rivers were studied the vegetation cover developing trends to dam construction was studied by following steps 1 the effect of hydropower development on vegetation habitat was analysised by ndvi 2 the extent and degree of dam construction on vegetation in longitudinal and transverse direction in the valley was quantified and 3 the cumulative effects of cascade dam on vegetation developing in a time series was illustrated 2 method 2 1 study area the southwest region of china contains many alpine areas and valleys and experiences heavy rainfall which has many rivers flow through this region e g jinsha river mekong river and nujiang river the region has abundant water resources with high river gradients and therefore it contains key areas for planned hydropower development the climate in this area is affected by the upper air zonal circulation and the indian ocean and pacific monsoon circulation and has an annual average temperature of 12 5 15 c total annual precipitation is 642 946 mm winter is dry and rain occurs in summer generally mid may to mid october accounting for 85 of annual precipitation the wet and dry seasons are very distinct the jinsha river is the main upstream stem of the yangtze river it flows through four provinces including qinghai tibet sichuan and yunnan is approximately 2326 km long drops 3280 m in elevation and drains an area of 47 3 km2 at present there are a total of 20 large or giant hydropower stations on the jinsha river including those already built under construction or in the planning phase the upstream chuanzang branch of the jinsha river contains an arrangement of eight cascade hydropower stations with a total planned capacity of 8 98 million kw a reservoir has been developed with eight giant cascade hydropower stations on the middle reaches shanghutiaoxia liangjiaren liyuan ahai jinanqiao longkaikou ludila and guanyinyan fig 1 four world class giant cascade hydropower stations in downstream namely wudongde baihetan xiluodu and xiangjiaba fig 1 among them liyuan and xiluodu dam are selected the mekong river in yunnan province china has 15 planned cascade hydropower stations using an elevation drop of 1655 m which will generate a total installed capacity of approximately 25 8 million kw planned dams in the upper reaches include an initial seven hydropower stations with a total installed capacity of approximately 9 6 million kw in the middle and lower reaches of the mekong river two eight dam cascade development programs are planned one of which comprises from top to bottom gongguoqiao xiaowan manwan dachaoshan nuozhadu jinghong ganlanba and mengsong power stations fig 1 of these manwan and nuozhadu has many years regulating reservoir in addition the xiaowan dam is located approximately 60 km upstream of the manwan dam four dams along the two rivers were selected for this study according to following criteria table 1 1 different dam heights which can be used to analyze the range of the affected areas 2 different times of dam construction which can be applied to analyze the effects of dam construction on the time series 3 the climate types of liyuan dam is belong to arid hot valley the climate in valley area and high altitude area are different the climate of other three dams located are almost consistent due to the vegetation in downstream far away from dam is less affected by the dam and the upstream in the backwater area is disturbed relatively large 4 a set of cascade dams as the research object our criterion is based on the change of vegetation coverage in the downstream of the dam compared with the change of ndvi in upstream of the dam to get the impact of dam construction 2 2 analysis method based on the time of onset and completion of construction of the hydropower stations we selected the high quality landsat remote sensing image data supporting file image data from the same month of different years were used the ndvi is derived from the red near infrared reflectance ratio ndvi values range from 1 to 1 where negative values correspond to an absence of vegetation valor and caselles 1996 and image data are available on is http glovis usgs gov the data grid resolution was 30 30 m image data was processed using the envi5 1 software to extract ndvi values and gis10 1 was used to analyze changes in ndvi the vegetation coverage was characterized by ndvi using the dynamic change rate of each pixel in the study area to analyze the change trend gis was used to calculate the rate of vegetation change through the grid calculator and the ndvi rate of change was calculated as follows 1 n d v i r o c n d v i i n d v i j n d v i i 100 ndviroc is ndvi rate of change ndvi i represents the year before dam construction and ndvi j represents the year after dam construction in order to reflect the changes of ndvi accurately the area that may be affected by dam construction was assessed reservoir impoundment creates huge water surface which changes the water cycle of local area the reach 0 10 km downstream of dam site and 0 10 km 10 20 km 20 30 km 30 40 km 40 50 km upstream were divided for each reach average ndvi value of 200 m altitude gradient were calculated the average ndvi variation for each altitude gradient of each reach before and after the dam construction were compared the ndvi value represents the coverage of the vegetation when the ndvi value is smaller than 0 it indicates that there is submerged water surface after the dam construction a large backwater area is formed and the original vegetation habitat and land are submerged according to the distance from the dam we fits functional relationship between river width in backwater area and distance from dam ndvi data is obtained by interpreting landsat data elevation data for river topography were obtained from http www gscloud cn the data grid resolution was 30 30 m supporting file in order to emphasize the impact of dam construction on ndvi change we reviewed the historical literature and found that the species invasion in southwest of china mainly occurred in 1940s and the invasive species was the herbaceous plant eupatorium adenophorum therefore vegetation invasion is not main factor that lead to ndvi change before and after dam construction hou and liu 1999 3 results based on the landsat data the variation in riparian vegetation ndvi in longitudinal and transverse directions was calculated and the cumulative spatiotemporal effects of cascade dams on riparian vegetation were analyzed 3 1 range and intensity of effects of dams on riparian vegetation along rivers fig 2 a and b illustrate the distribution of ndvi before and after the liyuan dam construction the range of effects of the liyuan dam is from 75 km upstream to 10 km downstream whereas that of the xiluodu dam is from approximately 170 km upstream to 40 km downstream fig 2 c and d fig 2 e and f shows the change of ndvi in manwan dam nearby with a range of effect from approximately 55 km upstream to 30 km downstream fig 2 g and h reveals that the vegetation ndvi near the river zone of the xiaowan dam is affected from approximately 180 km upstream of the right branch to approximately 120 km upstream of the left branch the xiaowan dam is located approximately 60 km upstream of the manwan dam therefore the downstream range of effects of the xiaowan may also be affected by the manwan resulting in cumulative effects therefore the effects of xiaowan dam need to be discussed in concert with those of manwan dam table 2 lists the range of effect of dam construction in the longitudinal direction it indicates that the higher the dam the farther its range of effect in the longitudinal direction in the longitudinal direction upstream areas in the reservoir impounded plentiful water and inundated riparian vegetation the downstream area is mainly influenced by flood control in flood season or power generation in need the results show that the range of effects on the upstream vegetation was greater than that on the downstream vegetation fig 3 shows the change of ndvi in the 10 km buffer zone pre and post dam construction by using formula 1 it shows that the ndvi near the riparian zone increased at liyuan but decreased at other dams the overall value of ndvi at manwan increased after dam construction the upstream and downstream ndvi at the xiluodu dam increased except in the flood zone finally the ndvi of the riparian area at xiaowan increased whereas that of areas far from the river channel decreased in summary the ndvi values of vegetation near the riverbank areas increased after dam construction 3 2 range and intensity of effects of dams on vegetation at river valley transverse the effects of dam construction in the transverse direction were evaluated by overall change and change in reaches of the riparian zone the variations of area vegetation and climate are evaluated by reach at different distances to dam including 0 10 km downstream 0 10 km 10 20 km 20 30 km 30 40 km and 40 50 km downstream since downstream vegetation are less affected so it can compare to upstream this research chose downstream 0 10 km as the control reach to compare with the affected vegetation area in upstream the area affected by dam construction was divided into three grades intensely affected area inundated area and 200 m from the water surface moderately affected area 200 600 m in the vertical direction and lightly affected area higher than 600 m the mean ndvi and standard deviation of different altitudes of 6 reaches in upstream and downstream of liyuan dam are shown in fig 4 it showed that the ndvi in 2016 is greater than in 2004 the figure also showed that in arid hot valley of jinsha river as the altitude increasing the coverage of vegetation grows which is a main distribution character of arid hot valley vegetation the ndvi standard deviation of different altitudes after dam construction are smaller than before the difference in ndvi at different altitudes in the same section after dam construction becomes smaller fig 4 which represents less variation of ndvi and become more homogeneity after dam construction the most affected area is near riparian zone fig 5 altitude gradient from 1300 to 1500 m this belongs to intensive affected area since the vegetation were submerged after dam construction as it can be seen with the increase of altitude the difference of ndvi value became larger indicating that the higher the altitude in the arid hot valley the dam construction have greater the influence on vegetation the difference of ndvi is the smallest for the reach of 40 50 km away from the dam which reveal that the impact of dam construction on this reach is minimal the ndvi variation increases as the distance to river and ndvi variation of vegetation in valley are less than riparian zone and altitude in the valley of 1500 1900 m was divided into moderate affected area the higher area is lightly affected area figs 6 and 7 showed the mean ndvi standard deviation of different altitudes of 6 reaches in up and downstream before and after construction of xiluodu dam ndvi after dam construction 2016 are more than before 2003 while the standard deviation are less which means vegetation became more homogeneity after dam construction fig 6 fig 7 showed the variation of different altitude gradients under six reaches it can be seen that the farther away from the dam site the larger the difference of ndvi while the near to the dam site the smaller the difference of ndvi this indicated that the climate background made difference of these two year becomes larger but the regional climate generated after the dam construction makes the difference in ndvi smaller in two years at the same time we noticed that the low altitude vegetation ndvi was higher than the high altitude ndvi so the dam construction made the vegetation developing in a good direction the ndvi variation before and after manwan dam construction are shown in fig 8 the vegetation ndvi of 1989 pre was larger than 1996 post and the ndvi increased gradually as the altitude rising after dam construction compared the ndvi variation value the ndvi became more homogeneous it can be seen from the fig 9 that the farther away from the dam site the larger the difference of ndvi while the near to the dam site the smaller the difference of ndvi indicating that the area near the dam site and the ndvi is high in 1989 after the dam construction giving an evidence of that the construction of dams has a positive impact on the vegetation in the reservoir area according to the degree of influence the most affected area was innudated zone which was divided into intensive affected area then the area near riverbank with altitude of 600 800 m which was divided into moderate affected area the lightly affected area are higher than 800 m altitude the standard deviation of vegetation ndvi after dam construction are less than before figs 10 and 11 it revealed that the dam construction made the vegetation growth more consistent since the ndvi value before dam construction was higher than the ndvi value after dam construction the smaller the difference before and after dam construction and this illustrated that vegetation grow better and this occurred near the dam site of xiaowan dam in low altitude ndvi variation of 50 km changed the most caused by the climate background while the ndvi variation of 10 km up and downstream are least the variation of reaches near dam were less because the dam construction formed the local climate made the climate more consistent it can also be explained that the construction of dams is beneficial to vegetation development the relationship between the width of the area with submerged vegetation and the distance from the dam were shown in fig 12 the correlation between the submerged vegetation area and the distance from the dam was logarithmic with liyuan and xiluodu and linear with manwan and xiaowan thus the farther away from the dam the smaller the effect in the transverse the effect of the xiluodu hydropower station in the transverse direction was smaller than that of the xiaowan and the effect of liyuan was greater than that of manwan this may be related to topography according to elevation data xiluodu belongs to a deep v shaped valley whereas the xiaowan river channel is relatively gentle with a relatively low surrounding slope belonging to a u shaped valley 3 3 cumulative effect of cascade dam construction on riparian vegetation the effect of cascade dam construction is difficult to evaluate in terms of time and space manwan and xiaowan dams in the upper reaches of the mekong river were employed to study the effects of cascade dams on riparian vegetation we selected six remote sensing images of pre and post dam construction made during the corresponding time period to illustrate the cumulative effects of cascade hydropower station development in time series the manwan dam was constructed in 1993 and the xiaowan in 2005 therefore images from 1989 were selected to represent pre manwan images from 1998 and 2003 were chosen as pre xiaowan and images from 2005 2009 and 2016 were selected as post xiaowan the ndvi data from before and after the manwan dam construction were obtained figs 13 and 14 the overall change upstream and downstream of the manwan dam in different years is shown in fig 13 fig 14 is a box plot of the overall ndvi based on the left bank transect in the time series the ndvi change in the figures displayed an increasing trend before 2005 and then decreased until 2016 fig 13 after the construction of the manwan dam the ndvi of the upper reaches in 1998 was greater than before construction but the ndvi of the downstream area decreased in 2003 vegetation ndvi essentially returned to the level before dam construction the ndvi of the vegetation in 2005 was slightly greater than the previous ndvi value the xiaowan hydropower station was being constructed upstream from manwan in 2005 dam engineering activities began at that time but the reservoir did not start impounding water and generating electricity until 2008 at that point the downstream vegetation from the xiaowan was affected and vegetation coverage deteriorated after 2009 fig 14 also reveals that the change of vegetation ndvi near the dam area was relatively small and concentrated whereas the vegetation ndvi far away from the center of the river changed greatly this is mainly because climate remained humid in the riverside area whereas the ndvi change of other regions primarily depended on natural climate change after the construction of the manwan dam restoration of the vegetation to the original levels required approximately 10 years which may be due to seasonal water transfer at the manwan dam the results suggest that the construction of a single dam is conducive to the development of upstream vegetation for cascade dams the vegetation in the upstream of xiaowan dam became better and the vegetation ndvi between xiaowan and manwan showed lower than before xiaowan dam construction water interception by the cascade dam and xiaowan carryover storage reservoir may be the main reasons underlying a significant decline of ndvi after electricity generation began at 2008 4 discussion this paper presents an exploratory analysis of how dam construction affects vegetation in the riparian zone by analyzing the change of ndvi the ndvi was used to calculate and analyze the effects of four hydropower stations on riparian vegetation and the relationship between the width of flooded vegetation and distance from the dam was calculated results revealed a cumulative effect of cascade dams on the riverbank vegetation in time and space 4 1 spatial effects of dam construction in space dams have an effect on both longitudinal and transverse riparian vegetation in the longitudinal direction dam height was the main factor affecting the range of effect studies on four dams revealed that higher dams led to longer backwater areas larger submerged areas in the reservoirs and a wider range of effect on riparian vegetation this is also consistent with the results of wei et al 2011 who demonstrated the linear relationship between dam height and influence range vannote et al 1953 considered that from the headwaters to the mouth the physical variables within a river system present a continuous gradient however dam construction changes the shape of the river and blocks the natural connection material and energy between rivers leading to changes in flow mechanism water quality sedimentation and habitat maintenance in the river system hibbs and bower 2001 fu and burgher 2015 this may change the habitat of vegetation especially at the submerged riparian zone dam construction will destroy riparian vegetation communities and impair species richness even endanger or extinct some riparian species dam construction has changed the growth pattern of vegetation the reduction of floods has weakened the spread of vegetation seeds and reduced the probability of invasion of new species which will affect the diversity of riparian ecosystems to some extent in upstream areas riparian vegetation will be affected by seasonal rainfall resulting in two states of vegetation exposure and flooding which leads to sustaining infestation of vegetation habitat and eventually lead to habitat fragmentation and habitat loss wei et al 2009 which will affect a large number of species according to recent data after the construction of the three gorges reservoir 27 820 km2 of farmland was inundated directly and irreversibly affecting 120 families of terrestrial plant species including 358 genera and 560 species chen 2009 from map of ndvi change it can be seen drowned a lot of area after dam construction this observation agrees with that by mallik and richardson mallik and richardson 2009 that the upstream ndvi value is slightly greater than the downstream which may be due to the accumulation of a large amount of water upstream and greater river bed exposure in the downstream area vegetation cover reach seems to have attained a dynamic equilibrium between the active channel and braiding index and vegetated area picco et al 2016 some scholars believe that this is the moderate interference hypothesis in ecology sitzia et al 2016 because the dam construction disturbance provides a better source of water for the uninundated area which is conducive to the growth of vegetation the effect of hydropower station development on downstream areas due to flow regulation and diversion led to narrowing down of water area and a decreased water level figs 2 and 3 such an effect may reduce the flooding of vegetation downstream evans et al 2007 and provide habitat for plants and other organisms rood et al 2005 most studies considered that periodic flooding creates habitat for plant colonization contributing to an improvement in species adaptive traits and richness in the riparian area rood et al 1995 asaeda et al 2015 however flooding has adverse effects on water quality and plant communities mallik and richardson 2009 the differences in hydrological and geomorphic processes between the upper and lower reaches of the river will alter the type of vegetation and habitat reproduction nilsson and berggren 2000 in the transverse direction river channel topography and distance from the dam are the main factors affecting a dam s range of effect one of the initial most obvious environmental effects of the dam is the loss of vegetation through inundation new and xie 2008 according to the results the dam construction had intensive influence upon riparian vegetation especially areas of 200 m upward water surface this was mainly result from the dam and roads construction activities the change of water level of underground water or directly submerged the vegetation distribution went homogeneous after dams constructions which will result in rising humidity and a better condition and this is significant to vegetation recovery of arid hot valley in fact in the arid hot valley the impact of dam construction in the high altitude area higher than low altitude area which has a great relationship with the topography and water vapor cycle in the arid hot valley after construction of dam the water surface expanded and the evaporation increases causing more water to collect at the top of the mountain the rainfall at the top of the mountain increases and the rainfall in the valley is difficult to form so the higher elevation areas will be affected more however in the general valley there will be rainfall in the formation of water vapor so this will have a positive impact on the regional vegetation this positive effect of dam construction is similar to the research of mallik and richardson the results also shows that after dam construction the region climate affect is most intensive between 10 km up and downstream sections which is the strongest change area of vapour condition and degrades gradually at further sections upstream due to topographical changes in the river the width of the flooded vegetation varies the expanse of the river at u shaped valleys may be larger than that at v type valleys because the flatter u type valley terrain submerged most of vegetation in the transverse direction and the v shaped canyons being steeper submerged most of vegetation in the longitudinal direction thus although the dam height of xiaowan and xiluodu does not differ considerably the difference in the extent of flooding in the upper reaches of the river is high mainly because xiaowan is situated in a u type valley and xiluodu is located in a v type valley similar observations were made for the liyuan and manwan dams the transverse submerged formulas fig 8 of the two dam types present different functional relationships fig 10 the extent of flooding in the transverse direction can be predicted based on the distance from the dam in the transverse direction vegetation is affected with different intensities based on which three grades are identified intensely moderately or lightly affected areas the perennially and periodically submerged area hydro fluctuation belt and ndvi value the range of strong fluctuations more than natural variation belongs to the intensely affected area the moderate affect areas mainly distribute at altitude of 200 400 m and the slightly affect areas mainly distribute at altitude of higher than 400 m kellogg and zhou 2014 in general there is a strong extremely effect on ndvi in the intensely affected area the primary negative effects appear as that the area of the dam is flooded and the area of periodic fluctuation is only suitable for growing herbaceous vegetation the positive effects manifest that near the river bank area improved however dam construction may have a positive effect on moderately affected areas the areas away from the dam are conducive to growth because of improved groundwater level and humid climate due to presence of the dam 4 2 effect of the dam cascade development the environmental impact assessment of a single dam has thus far not satisfactorily accounted for the speed of development of cascade dams and the effects on the ecological environment of water conservation projects dam construction caused direct or indirect detrimental impacts on river systems by altering the water flow pattern and reshaping natural habitats chen et al 2015 and the habitat of riparian vegetation was altered by dam construction the nature and extent of the effects on vegetation in the riparian zone differ from that of a single reservoir and these dams have a cumulative spatiotemporal effect in space the vegetation state at a certain point at a certain place is affected by the interaction of all the reservoirs in the whole basin in time the effect of the reservoir shows a latent and lagging effect on vegetation habitat that accumulates over a long period pei et al 2011 this study demonstrates the cumulative effect of cascade dam construction on riparian vegetation owing to the change in vegetation ndvi in the manwan hydropower station area ndvi increased in the upper reaches after the construction of the dam in 1998 this increase may be attributed to the improved ground water level and increased atmospheric humidity owing to the impoundment of the reservoir and to subsequent precipitation in these areas caused by the lake effect kellogg and zhou 2014 the ndvi value in the downstream area decreased mainly due to downstream river narrowing and decreased flow vegetation was isolated from the river changing the vegetation habitat by 2003 vegetation was restored to the level before dam construction this period may represent the vegetation recovery time approximately 10 years in addition the manwan dam is used for the seasonal water diversion it ensures that the seasonal flow is relatively stable which may be beneficial to the restoration of vegetation vegetation coverage after 2005 was higher than that before construction which suggests that dam construction has a positive effect on riverbank vegetation the construction of the xiaowan hydropower station began in 2005 and it began to generate electricity in 2008 fig 10 shows that in 2009 the upper reaches of the xiaowan area were flooded because it intercepted a large quantity of water upstream the construction of the cascade dam led to a lower ndvi for downstream vegetation moreover xiaowan is the carryover storage reservoir yi et al 2017 this dam might therefore destabilize the downstream water and therefore have more serious effects the downstream area is affected mainly by the cascade dams upstream the construction of the xiaowan dam in the upstream regions intercepted a large amount of water and nutrients resulting in significant effects on the downstream area this reflects the spatiotemporal effect of the cascade dams cascading hydropower dams can enhance habitat fragmentation reduce the distribution ranges latitude and altitude of primary vegetation and reduce the complexity of the vegetation types along the river in conclusion cascade hydropower development projects have large scale long lasting and systematic effects on the riparian environment groupment accumulation spread potential superimposed synergy and hysteresis zhong et al 2007 it is important to further investigate the trend of vegetation dynamics and plant community succession at the micro scale we believe that using a micro scale reference in conjunction with multivariable analysis of spatially and temporally replicated observations is an effective approach for understanding habitat change and vegetation processes in response to cascade dam construction 5 conclusion river damming leads to considerable anthropological effects on river systems worldwide it induces spatial temporal changes in riparian vegetation the difference in dam height is the main factor leading to the differing extent of the effects in the longitudinal direction river channel topography and the distance from the dam mainly affect the extent of the effects in the transverse direction there is a functional relationship between the width of vegetation submerged and the distance from the dam the area affected by dam construction is divisible into three grades the intensive affected area including inundated area and 200 m from the water surface in the vertical direction manwan and xiaowan transverse submerged distance is greater than liyuan and xiluodu which is mainly due to manwan and xiaowan belong to u shaped valley and liyuan and xiluodu belong to v shaped valley the negative effects of dam construction are not absolute after dam construction the upstream area intercepts a large amount of water sediments and nutrients leading to increasing air humidity and nutrients which was conducive to vegetation growth we also found that dam construction made the vegetation coverage in the region more homogeneous in the arid hot valley the impact of dam on high altitude is greater than the low altitude area while for other river valley the impact became smaller as altitude rose the development of cascade dams has a cumulative spatiotemporal effect on vegetation the influences are positive or negative mainly depend on diversion of the dam the case of xiaowan and manwan demonstrated that the seasonal transfer water method is superior to the carryover storage reservoir on the influence of riparian vegetation therefore appropriate water control and management measures should be taken during the development of cascade hydropower stations to reduce the effect on downstream vegetation acknowledgements the study is supported by the national key research and development plan 2016yfc0502209 2018yfc0407403 and national natural science

600,riparian vegetation acts as a corridor filter or barrier for the flow of material energy and information between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems while dam construction especially cascade dam construction bring huge changes to riparian vegetation in this study the changing of riparian vegetation cover in response to the construction and operation of large dams at different scale was analyzed the variations of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in longitudinal and transverse directions during pre and post dam construction were calculated and analyzed the results showed that dam height was the main determining factor for the range of riparian vegetation affected in the longitudinal direction whereas valley contour and distance to dam site affect the transverse direction vegetation together a linear or logarithmic relation between submerged area in transverse and the distance to dam were founded after dam construction the ndvi in the valley becomes uniform and the vegetation grows more homogeneously influence extent of different elevation in different reaches was discussed the intensive affected area including inundated area and 200 m from the water surface in vertical direction as the altitude grows the influence gets weak positive effect of a single dam on vegetation in upstream reservoir was found except near channel grade and a potential oligotrophic threat for the downstream vegetation was posted for cascade dams the vegetation in the upstream of xiaowan dam became better from elevation 200 400 m above original water surface the ndvi between xiaowan dam and manwan dam which at downstream of xiaowan but in reservoir of manwan degraded after xiaowan dam constructed cascade dams have cumulative effects on vegetation the influence are positive or negative mainly depend on diversion of the dam key words dam cascade dam riparian vegetation ndvi spatiotemporal cumulative effect 1 introduction riparian systems are the transition zones between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems organized in networks across landscapes vought 1994 stoy et al 2011 riparian zones along rivers and creeks have been identified as important elements of the landscape owing to their facilitating the flow of species energy and nutrients and their provision of corridors between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems gregory et al 1991 naimanand and décamps 1997 riverside vegetation is an important component of the riparian zone as well as an important ecozone between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems riparian vegetation transfer the flow of material energy and information between the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems naiman et al 1993 meek et al 2010 and it also has important hydrological ecological aesthetic and socio economic functions steiger et al 2010 gumiero et al 2015 dam construction weed invasion agricultural practices and overgrazing are the main pressures that threaten riparian vegetation and then influence the river geomorphology and river ecosystem kondolf et al 2007 tánago et al 2016 these activities affect the dynamic processes and environments of river and lead to changes in vegetation succession in the riparian zone among these river damming is essential to anticipate a barrier s long term environmental influence and a dominant anthropological effect on river systems cecilia et al 2016 sternberg 2006 yi et al 2017 as riparian vegetation is closely connected to discharge stochasticity it can experience remarkable changes after the construction of artificial reservoirs tealdi et al 2011 according to recent statistics two thirds of the world s rivers are affected by the development of more than 45 000 large and 80 000 small hydropower stations almost half of large dams 22 000 out of an estimated 45 000 are located in china fuggle and smith 2000 hydropower stations have generated great social and economic benefits at the same time they brought several ecological and environmental problems huang et al 2010 moreover cascade dam construction is more frequently utilized to increase economic efficiency lobera et al 2015 the effects of cascading hydropower dams on riparian vegetation distribution are more complex than those of single dams cheng et al 2012 li et al 2012 zhong et al 2007 hydrological regimes greatly affect the characteristics of riparian zones toner and keddy 1997 ollero et al 2010 particularly seasonal variations in flow and alternating wet and dry cycles dam construction for human uses has led to severe changes in the functioning of riparian ecosystem areas that directly adjoin and influence inland water bodies william 1996 nilsson and berggren 2000 poff et al 1997 son et al 2014 dam hinders material and energy exchange disrupts the longitudinal spread of plant seeds zhong et al 2007 reservoir impoundment inundates the riparian vegetation habitat the increased water surface area affects the local climatic environment and affects the structure and type of vegetation communities in the transverse and longitudinal directions sankey et al 2015 reservoir operation adjusted the flow regime of downstream and changed the hydrologic condition of flood plain gurnell et al 2016 corenblit et al 2007 the effect of the construction of cascading hydropower stations on riparian vegetation is cumulativity variability far reaching potentiality and complexity zhong et al 2007 and requires examination from different aspects while few research has taken for ecological influence of cascade dams when evaluating the effect of hydropower development on riparian vegetation the traditional method has been to use remote sensing image interpretation and classification to analyze land use patterns explore the dynamic characteristics of vegetation under different land uses and analyze the response in the relationship between land use change and vegetation dynamics chen et al 2006 with advances in theoretical research in recent years different methods and indices are now used to characterize riparian vegetation coverage and change the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is widely used in vegetation research and plant phenology research in combination with remote sensing imagery li et al 2016 it has become a powerful tool for ecologists and geomorphologists in riverine studies cecilia et al 2016 it is a good indicator for plant growth status and vegetation spatial distribution density zhang et al 2010 valor and caselles 1996 the ndvi has already been successfully applied to research on temporal and spatial trends and variation in vegetation distribution productivity and dynamics as well as for monitoring habitat degradation and fragmentation and the ecological effects of climatic disasters such as drought or fire pettorelli et al 2005 furthermore ndvi has been successfully used in research regarding global environmental change birtwistle et al 2016 used a seasonal increase in ndvi from landsat imagery to estimate monsoonal precipitation in arizona usa and marchetti et al 2015 used ndvi time series to analyze the functioning dynamics and express the degree of connectivity between a main channel and its floodplain previous studies have made a significant contribution to the use of ndvi to directly analyze vegetation changes however few studies have conducted a quantitative assessment of effects of dam construction in the longitudinal and transverse directions along the river or investigated the cumulative spatiotemporal effects of cascade dams on the riverbank vegetation therefore changes in ndvi can illustrate the changes in vegetation in response to dam construction in this study effects of dams on the riparian vegetation in the middle reaches of the jinsha and mekong rivers were studied the vegetation cover developing trends to dam construction was studied by following steps 1 the effect of hydropower development on vegetation habitat was analysised by ndvi 2 the extent and degree of dam construction on vegetation in longitudinal and transverse direction in the valley was quantified and 3 the cumulative effects of cascade dam on vegetation developing in a time series was illustrated 2 method 2 1 study area the southwest region of china contains many alpine areas and valleys and experiences heavy rainfall which has many rivers flow through this region e g jinsha river mekong river and nujiang river the region has abundant water resources with high river gradients and therefore it contains key areas for planned hydropower development the climate in this area is affected by the upper air zonal circulation and the indian ocean and pacific monsoon circulation and has an annual average temperature of 12 5 15 c total annual precipitation is 642 946 mm winter is dry and rain occurs in summer generally mid may to mid october accounting for 85 of annual precipitation the wet and dry seasons are very distinct the jinsha river is the main upstream stem of the yangtze river it flows through four provinces including qinghai tibet sichuan and yunnan is approximately 2326 km long drops 3280 m in elevation and drains an area of 47 3 km2 at present there are a total of 20 large or giant hydropower stations on the jinsha river including those already built under construction or in the planning phase the upstream chuanzang branch of the jinsha river contains an arrangement of eight cascade hydropower stations with a total planned capacity of 8 98 million kw a reservoir has been developed with eight giant cascade hydropower stations on the middle reaches shanghutiaoxia liangjiaren liyuan ahai jinanqiao longkaikou ludila and guanyinyan fig 1 four world class giant cascade hydropower stations in downstream namely wudongde baihetan xiluodu and xiangjiaba fig 1 among them liyuan and xiluodu dam are selected the mekong river in yunnan province china has 15 planned cascade hydropower stations using an elevation drop of 1655 m which will generate a total installed capacity of approximately 25 8 million kw planned dams in the upper reaches include an initial seven hydropower stations with a total installed capacity of approximately 9 6 million kw in the middle and lower reaches of the mekong river two eight dam cascade development programs are planned one of which comprises from top to bottom gongguoqiao xiaowan manwan dachaoshan nuozhadu jinghong ganlanba and mengsong power stations fig 1 of these manwan and nuozhadu has many years regulating reservoir in addition the xiaowan dam is located approximately 60 km upstream of the manwan dam four dams along the two rivers were selected for this study according to following criteria table 1 1 different dam heights which can be used to analyze the range of the affected areas 2 different times of dam construction which can be applied to analyze the effects of dam construction on the time series 3 the climate types of liyuan dam is belong to arid hot valley the climate in valley area and high altitude area are different the climate of other three dams located are almost consistent due to the vegetation in downstream far away from dam is less affected by the dam and the upstream in the backwater area is disturbed relatively large 4 a set of cascade dams as the research object our criterion is based on the change of vegetation coverage in the downstream of the dam compared with the change of ndvi in upstream of the dam to get the impact of dam construction 2 2 analysis method based on the time of onset and completion of construction of the hydropower stations we selected the high quality landsat remote sensing image data supporting file image data from the same month of different years were used the ndvi is derived from the red near infrared reflectance ratio ndvi values range from 1 to 1 where negative values correspond to an absence of vegetation valor and caselles 1996 and image data are available on is http glovis usgs gov the data grid resolution was 30 30 m image data was processed using the envi5 1 software to extract ndvi values and gis10 1 was used to analyze changes in ndvi the vegetation coverage was characterized by ndvi using the dynamic change rate of each pixel in the study area to analyze the change trend gis was used to calculate the rate of vegetation change through the grid calculator and the ndvi rate of change was calculated as follows 1 n d v i r o c n d v i i n d v i j n d v i i 100 ndviroc is ndvi rate of change ndvi i represents the year before dam construction and ndvi j represents the year after dam construction in order to reflect the changes of ndvi accurately the area that may be affected by dam construction was assessed reservoir impoundment creates huge water surface which changes the water cycle of local area the reach 0 10 km downstream of dam site and 0 10 km 10 20 km 20 30 km 30 40 km 40 50 km upstream were divided for each reach average ndvi value of 200 m altitude gradient were calculated the average ndvi variation for each altitude gradient of each reach before and after the dam construction were compared the ndvi value represents the coverage of the vegetation when the ndvi value is smaller than 0 it indicates that there is submerged water surface after the dam construction a large backwater area is formed and the original vegetation habitat and land are submerged according to the distance from the dam we fits functional relationship between river width in backwater area and distance from dam ndvi data is obtained by interpreting landsat data elevation data for river topography were obtained from http www gscloud cn the data grid resolution was 30 30 m supporting file in order to emphasize the impact of dam construction on ndvi change we reviewed the historical literature and found that the species invasion in southwest of china mainly occurred in 1940s and the invasive species was the herbaceous plant eupatorium adenophorum therefore vegetation invasion is not main factor that lead to ndvi change before and after dam construction hou and liu 1999 3 results based on the landsat data the variation in riparian vegetation ndvi in longitudinal and transverse directions was calculated and the cumulative spatiotemporal effects of cascade dams on riparian vegetation were analyzed 3 1 range and intensity of effects of dams on riparian vegetation along rivers fig 2 a and b illustrate the distribution of ndvi before and after the liyuan dam construction the range of effects of the liyuan dam is from 75 km upstream to 10 km downstream whereas that of the xiluodu dam is from approximately 170 km upstream to 40 km downstream fig 2 c and d fig 2 e and f shows the change of ndvi in manwan dam nearby with a range of effect from approximately 55 km upstream to 30 km downstream fig 2 g and h reveals that the vegetation ndvi near the river zone of the xiaowan dam is affected from approximately 180 km upstream of the right branch to approximately 120 km upstream of the left branch the xiaowan dam is located approximately 60 km upstream of the manwan dam therefore the downstream range of effects of the xiaowan may also be affected by the manwan resulting in cumulative effects therefore the effects of xiaowan dam need to be discussed in concert with those of manwan dam table 2 lists the range of effect of dam construction in the longitudinal direction it indicates that the higher the dam the farther its range of effect in the longitudinal direction in the longitudinal direction upstream areas in the reservoir impounded plentiful water and inundated riparian vegetation the downstream area is mainly influenced by flood control in flood season or power generation in need the results show that the range of effects on the upstream vegetation was greater than that on the downstream vegetation fig 3 shows the change of ndvi in the 10 km buffer zone pre and post dam construction by using formula 1 it shows that the ndvi near the riparian zone increased at liyuan but decreased at other dams the overall value of ndvi at manwan increased after dam construction the upstream and downstream ndvi at the xiluodu dam increased except in the flood zone finally the ndvi of the riparian area at xiaowan increased whereas that of areas far from the river channel decreased in summary the ndvi values of vegetation near the riverbank areas increased after dam construction 3 2 range and intensity of effects of dams on vegetation at river valley transverse the effects of dam construction in the transverse direction were evaluated by overall change and change in reaches of the riparian zone the variations of area vegetation and climate are evaluated by reach at different distances to dam including 0 10 km downstream 0 10 km 10 20 km 20 30 km 30 40 km and 40 50 km downstream since downstream vegetation are less affected so it can compare to upstream this research chose downstream 0 10 km as the control reach to compare with the affected vegetation area in upstream the area affected by dam construction was divided into three grades intensely affected area inundated area and 200 m from the water surface moderately affected area 200 600 m in the vertical direction and lightly affected area higher than 600 m the mean ndvi and standard deviation of different altitudes of 6 reaches in upstream and downstream of liyuan dam are shown in fig 4 it showed that the ndvi in 2016 is greater than in 2004 the figure also showed that in arid hot valley of jinsha river as the altitude increasing the coverage of vegetation grows which is a main distribution character of arid hot valley vegetation the ndvi standard deviation of different altitudes after dam construction are smaller than before the difference in ndvi at different altitudes in the same section after dam construction becomes smaller fig 4 which represents less variation of ndvi and become more homogeneity after dam construction the most affected area is near riparian zone fig 5 altitude gradient from 1300 to 1500 m this belongs to intensive affected area since the vegetation were submerged after dam construction as it can be seen with the increase of altitude the difference of ndvi value became larger indicating that the higher the altitude in the arid hot valley the dam construction have greater the influence on vegetation the difference of ndvi is the smallest for the reach of 40 50 km away from the dam which reveal that the impact of dam construction on this reach is minimal the ndvi variation increases as the distance to river and ndvi variation of vegetation in valley are less than riparian zone and altitude in the valley of 1500 1900 m was divided into moderate affected area the higher area is lightly affected area figs 6 and 7 showed the mean ndvi standard deviation of different altitudes of 6 reaches in up and downstream before and after construction of xiluodu dam ndvi after dam construction 2016 are more than before 2003 while the standard deviation are less which means vegetation became more homogeneity after dam construction fig 6 fig 7 showed the variation of different altitude gradients under six reaches it can be seen that the farther away from the dam site the larger the difference of ndvi while the near to the dam site the smaller the difference of ndvi this indicated that the climate background made difference of these two year becomes larger but the regional climate generated after the dam construction makes the difference in ndvi smaller in two years at the same time we noticed that the low altitude vegetation ndvi was higher than the high altitude ndvi so the dam construction made the vegetation developing in a good direction the ndvi variation before and after manwan dam construction are shown in fig 8 the vegetation ndvi of 1989 pre was larger than 1996 post and the ndvi increased gradually as the altitude rising after dam construction compared the ndvi variation value the ndvi became more homogeneous it can be seen from the fig 9 that the farther away from the dam site the larger the difference of ndvi while the near to the dam site the smaller the difference of ndvi indicating that the area near the dam site and the ndvi is high in 1989 after the dam construction giving an evidence of that the construction of dams has a positive impact on the vegetation in the reservoir area according to the degree of influence the most affected area was innudated zone which was divided into intensive affected area then the area near riverbank with altitude of 600 800 m which was divided into moderate affected area the lightly affected area are higher than 800 m altitude the standard deviation of vegetation ndvi after dam construction are less than before figs 10 and 11 it revealed that the dam construction made the vegetation growth more consistent since the ndvi value before dam construction was higher than the ndvi value after dam construction the smaller the difference before and after dam construction and this illustrated that vegetation grow better and this occurred near the dam site of xiaowan dam in low altitude ndvi variation of 50 km changed the most caused by the climate background while the ndvi variation of 10 km up and downstream are least the variation of reaches near dam were less because the dam construction formed the local climate made the climate more consistent it can also be explained that the construction of dams is beneficial to vegetation development the relationship between the width of the area with submerged vegetation and the distance from the dam were shown in fig 12 the correlation between the submerged vegetation area and the distance from the dam was logarithmic with liyuan and xiluodu and linear with manwan and xiaowan thus the farther away from the dam the smaller the effect in the transverse the effect of the xiluodu hydropower station in the transverse direction was smaller than that of the xiaowan and the effect of liyuan was greater than that of manwan this may be related to topography according to elevation data xiluodu belongs to a deep v shaped valley whereas the xiaowan river channel is relatively gentle with a relatively low surrounding slope belonging to a u shaped valley 3 3 cumulative effect of cascade dam construction on riparian vegetation the effect of cascade dam construction is difficult to evaluate in terms of time and space manwan and xiaowan dams in the upper reaches of the mekong river were employed to study the effects of cascade dams on riparian vegetation we selected six remote sensing images of pre and post dam construction made during the corresponding time period to illustrate the cumulative effects of cascade hydropower station development in time series the manwan dam was constructed in 1993 and the xiaowan in 2005 therefore images from 1989 were selected to represent pre manwan images from 1998 and 2003 were chosen as pre xiaowan and images from 2005 2009 and 2016 were selected as post xiaowan the ndvi data from before and after the manwan dam construction were obtained figs 13 and 14 the overall change upstream and downstream of the manwan dam in different years is shown in fig 13 fig 14 is a box plot of the overall ndvi based on the left bank transect in the time series the ndvi change in the figures displayed an increasing trend before 2005 and then decreased until 2016 fig 13 after the construction of the manwan dam the ndvi of the upper reaches in 1998 was greater than before construction but the ndvi of the downstream area decreased in 2003 vegetation ndvi essentially returned to the level before dam construction the ndvi of the vegetation in 2005 was slightly greater than the previous ndvi value the xiaowan hydropower station was being constructed upstream from manwan in 2005 dam engineering activities began at that time but the reservoir did not start impounding water and generating electricity until 2008 at that point the downstream vegetation from the xiaowan was affected and vegetation coverage deteriorated after 2009 fig 14 also reveals that the change of vegetation ndvi near the dam area was relatively small and concentrated whereas the vegetation ndvi far away from the center of the river changed greatly this is mainly because climate remained humid in the riverside area whereas the ndvi change of other regions primarily depended on natural climate change after the construction of the manwan dam restoration of the vegetation to the original levels required approximately 10 years which may be due to seasonal water transfer at the manwan dam the results suggest that the construction of a single dam is conducive to the development of upstream vegetation for cascade dams the vegetation in the upstream of xiaowan dam became better and the vegetation ndvi between xiaowan and manwan showed lower than before xiaowan dam construction water interception by the cascade dam and xiaowan carryover storage reservoir may be the main reasons underlying a significant decline of ndvi after electricity generation began at 2008 4 discussion this paper presents an exploratory analysis of how dam construction affects vegetation in the riparian zone by analyzing the change of ndvi the ndvi was used to calculate and analyze the effects of four hydropower stations on riparian vegetation and the relationship between the width of flooded vegetation and distance from the dam was calculated results revealed a cumulative effect of cascade dams on the riverbank vegetation in time and space 4 1 spatial effects of dam construction in space dams have an effect on both longitudinal and transverse riparian vegetation in the longitudinal direction dam height was the main factor affecting the range of effect studies on four dams revealed that higher dams led to longer backwater areas larger submerged areas in the reservoirs and a wider range of effect on riparian vegetation this is also consistent with the results of wei et al 2011 who demonstrated the linear relationship between dam height and influence range vannote et al 1953 considered that from the headwaters to the mouth the physical variables within a river system present a continuous gradient however dam construction changes the shape of the river and blocks the natural connection material and energy between rivers leading to changes in flow mechanism water quality sedimentation and habitat maintenance in the river system hibbs and bower 2001 fu and burgher 2015 this may change the habitat of vegetation especially at the submerged riparian zone dam construction will destroy riparian vegetation communities and impair species richness even endanger or extinct some riparian species dam construction has changed the growth pattern of vegetation the reduction of floods has weakened the spread of vegetation seeds and reduced the probability of invasion of new species which will affect the diversity of riparian ecosystems to some extent in upstream areas riparian vegetation will be affected by seasonal rainfall resulting in two states of vegetation exposure and flooding which leads to sustaining infestation of vegetation habitat and eventually lead to habitat fragmentation and habitat loss wei et al 2009 which will affect a large number of species according to recent data after the construction of the three gorges reservoir 27 820 km2 of farmland was inundated directly and irreversibly affecting 120 families of terrestrial plant species including 358 genera and 560 species chen 2009 from map of ndvi change it can be seen drowned a lot of area after dam construction this observation agrees with that by mallik and richardson mallik and richardson 2009 that the upstream ndvi value is slightly greater than the downstream which may be due to the accumulation of a large amount of water upstream and greater river bed exposure in the downstream area vegetation cover reach seems to have attained a dynamic equilibrium between the active channel and braiding index and vegetated area picco et al 2016 some scholars believe that this is the moderate interference hypothesis in ecology sitzia et al 2016 because the dam construction disturbance provides a better source of water for the uninundated area which is conducive to the growth of vegetation the effect of hydropower station development on downstream areas due to flow regulation and diversion led to narrowing down of water area and a decreased water level figs 2 and 3 such an effect may reduce the flooding of vegetation downstream evans et al 2007 and provide habitat for plants and other organisms rood et al 2005 most studies considered that periodic flooding creates habitat for plant colonization contributing to an improvement in species adaptive traits and richness in the riparian area rood et al 1995 asaeda et al 2015 however flooding has adverse effects on water quality and plant communities mallik and richardson 2009 the differences in hydrological and geomorphic processes between the upper and lower reaches of the river will alter the type of vegetation and habitat reproduction nilsson and berggren 2000 in the transverse direction river channel topography and distance from the dam are the main factors affecting a dam s range of effect one of the initial most obvious environmental effects of the dam is the loss of vegetation through inundation new and xie 2008 according to the results the dam construction had intensive influence upon riparian vegetation especially areas of 200 m upward water surface this was mainly result from the dam and roads construction activities the change of water level of underground water or directly submerged the vegetation distribution went homogeneous after dams constructions which will result in rising humidity and a better condition and this is significant to vegetation recovery of arid hot valley in fact in the arid hot valley the impact of dam construction in the high altitude area higher than low altitude area which has a great relationship with the topography and water vapor cycle in the arid hot valley after construction of dam the water surface expanded and the evaporation increases causing more water to collect at the top of the mountain the rainfall at the top of the mountain increases and the rainfall in the valley is difficult to form so the higher elevation areas will be affected more however in the general valley there will be rainfall in the formation of water vapor so this will have a positive impact on the regional vegetation this positive effect of dam construction is similar to the research of mallik and richardson the results also shows that after dam construction the region climate affect is most intensive between 10 km up and downstream sections which is the strongest change area of vapour condition and degrades gradually at further sections upstream due to topographical changes in the river the width of the flooded vegetation varies the expanse of the river at u shaped valleys may be larger than that at v type valleys because the flatter u type valley terrain submerged most of vegetation in the transverse direction and the v shaped canyons being steeper submerged most of vegetation in the longitudinal direction thus although the dam height of xiaowan and xiluodu does not differ considerably the difference in the extent of flooding in the upper reaches of the river is high mainly because xiaowan is situated in a u type valley and xiluodu is located in a v type valley similar observations were made for the liyuan and manwan dams the transverse submerged formulas fig 8 of the two dam types present different functional relationships fig 10 the extent of flooding in the transverse direction can be predicted based on the distance from the dam in the transverse direction vegetation is affected with different intensities based on which three grades are identified intensely moderately or lightly affected areas the perennially and periodically submerged area hydro fluctuation belt and ndvi value the range of strong fluctuations more than natural variation belongs to the intensely affected area the moderate affect areas mainly distribute at altitude of 200 400 m and the slightly affect areas mainly distribute at altitude of higher than 400 m kellogg and zhou 2014 in general there is a strong extremely effect on ndvi in the intensely affected area the primary negative effects appear as that the area of the dam is flooded and the area of periodic fluctuation is only suitable for growing herbaceous vegetation the positive effects manifest that near the river bank area improved however dam construction may have a positive effect on moderately affected areas the areas away from the dam are conducive to growth because of improved groundwater level and humid climate due to presence of the dam 4 2 effect of the dam cascade development the environmental impact assessment of a single dam has thus far not satisfactorily accounted for the speed of development of cascade dams and the effects on the ecological environment of water conservation projects dam construction caused direct or indirect detrimental impacts on river systems by altering the water flow pattern and reshaping natural habitats chen et al 2015 and the habitat of riparian vegetation was altered by dam construction the nature and extent of the effects on vegetation in the riparian zone differ from that of a single reservoir and these dams have a cumulative spatiotemporal effect in space the vegetation state at a certain point at a certain place is affected by the interaction of all the reservoirs in the whole basin in time the effect of the reservoir shows a latent and lagging effect on vegetation habitat that accumulates over a long period pei et al 2011 this study demonstrates the cumulative effect of cascade dam construction on riparian vegetation owing to the change in vegetation ndvi in the manwan hydropower station area ndvi increased in the upper reaches after the construction of the dam in 1998 this increase may be attributed to the improved ground water level and increased atmospheric humidity owing to the impoundment of the reservoir and to subsequent precipitation in these areas caused by the lake effect kellogg and zhou 2014 the ndvi value in the downstream area decreased mainly due to downstream river narrowing and decreased flow vegetation was isolated from the river changing the vegetation habitat by 2003 vegetation was restored to the level before dam construction this period may represent the vegetation recovery time approximately 10 years in addition the manwan dam is used for the seasonal water diversion it ensures that the seasonal flow is relatively stable which may be beneficial to the restoration of vegetation vegetation coverage after 2005 was higher than that before construction which suggests that dam construction has a positive effect on riverbank vegetation the construction of the xiaowan hydropower station began in 2005 and it began to generate electricity in 2008 fig 10 shows that in 2009 the upper reaches of the xiaowan area were flooded because it intercepted a large quantity of water upstream the construction of the cascade dam led to a lower ndvi for downstream vegetation moreover xiaowan is the carryover storage reservoir yi et al 2017 this dam might therefore destabilize the downstream water and therefore have more serious effects the downstream area is affected mainly by the cascade dams upstream the construction of the xiaowan dam in the upstream regions intercepted a large amount of water and nutrients resulting in significant effects on the downstream area this reflects the spatiotemporal effect of the cascade dams cascading hydropower dams can enhance habitat fragmentation reduce the distribution ranges latitude and altitude of primary vegetation and reduce the complexity of the vegetation types along the river in conclusion cascade hydropower development projects have large scale long lasting and systematic effects on the riparian environment groupment accumulation spread potential superimposed synergy and hysteresis zhong et al 2007 it is important to further investigate the trend of vegetation dynamics and plant community succession at the micro scale we believe that using a micro scale reference in conjunction with multivariable analysis of spatially and temporally replicated observations is an effective approach for understanding habitat change and vegetation processes in response to cascade dam construction 5 conclusion river damming leads to considerable anthropological effects on river systems worldwide it induces spatial temporal changes in riparian vegetation the difference in dam height is the main factor leading to the differing extent of the effects in the longitudinal direction river channel topography and the distance from the dam mainly affect the extent of the effects in the transverse direction there is a functional relationship between the width of vegetation submerged and the distance from the dam the area affected by dam construction is divisible into three grades the intensive affected area including inundated area and 200 m from the water surface in the vertical direction manwan and xiaowan transverse submerged distance is greater than liyuan and xiluodu which is mainly due to manwan and xiaowan belong to u shaped valley and liyuan and xiluodu belong to v shaped valley the negative effects of dam construction are not absolute after dam construction the upstream area intercepts a large amount of water sediments and nutrients leading to increasing air humidity and nutrients which was conducive to vegetation growth we also found that dam construction made the vegetation coverage in the region more homogeneous in the arid hot valley the impact of dam on high altitude is greater than the low altitude area while for other river valley the impact became smaller as altitude rose the development of cascade dams has a cumulative spatiotemporal effect on vegetation the influences are positive or negative mainly depend on diversion of the dam the case of xiaowan and manwan demonstrated that the seasonal transfer water method is superior to the carryover storage reservoir on the influence of riparian vegetation therefore appropriate water control and management measures should be taken during the development of cascade hydropower stations to reduce the effect on downstream vegetation acknowledgements the study is supported by the national key research and development plan 2016yfc0502209 2018yfc0407403 and national natural science

601,submerged vanes alter sediment transport by inducing a secondary circulation without significantly compromising the conveyance capacity of the river here a laboratory study is conducted to investigate whether wood logs or trunks can be used for sediment management the effectivity of a traditional vane field is compared to set ups with screens of stacked logs and large individual trunks results indicate that all three set ups redistribute sediment but that the trunks are least effective in inducing a secondary circulation and cause higher turbulence and drag leading to a stronger decrease in streamwise velocity we conclude that a field of trunks acts as a sediment trap because of a strong reduction of the streamwise velocity without a strong secondary flow such as dominant in the other configurations screens of stacked logs can be successfully implemented in rivers as they are only slightly less effective than traditional vanes the risk of piping underneath objects and the associated scour are points of concern keywords wood logs submerged vanes sediment management physical scale model 1 introduction over the past centuries measures to assure flood protection and

pressure increases on one side of the vane creating a vertical pressure gradient that induces upward flow at the other side a reversed pressure gradient is created with relatively low pressure near the bed inducing downward flow by this a vortex is initiated altering magnitude and direction of the bed shear stress fig 1 because the direction of the bed shear stress is altered sediment is steered to one side of the vane odgaard and wang 1991a as a result the local morphology can be managed for instance by steering sediment away from a channel intake or steering sediment towards an outer river bend the vanes do not have a large impact on the conveyance capacity of the river the vanes are usually created using sheet piles odgaard and lee 1984 boniforti et al 2015 or made of reinforced concrete boniforti et al 2015 odgaard and wang 1991a dead wood can be a natural alternative for sheet piles and concrete it can provide habitat for a range of aquatic species and thus lead to increased productivity and respiration brooks et al 2004 benke and wallace 2003 klink 2015 mutz et al 2007 roni et al 2015 in some cases wood is not only applied to increase biodiversity but as a measure to control flow and sediment transport this is often done by using large structures of wood to form an obstruction to the flow and create a wake region where bed shear stress is reduced as well as scours due to flow acceleration wallerstein et al 2001 svoboda and russell 2011 bennett et al 2015 gallisdorfer et al 2014 shields et al 2004 pagliara and kurdistani 2017 this however has a large impact on the conveyance capacity of the river considering all objectives of modern river management this contribution investigates the possibility to use wood logs here defined as dead trees and tree trunks with a diameter larger than 10 cm keller and swanson 1979 to steer bedload sediment transport in a similar fashion as traditional vanes we report on a laboratory study that includes experimental set ups representing traditional vanes herein further referred to as vanes a screen of stacked logs referred to as screens and arrays of large individual trunks referred to as trunks in an additional experiment the effect of porosity is investigated 2 methodology 2 1 experimental set up fixed bed and mobile bed experiments were performed in a tilting flume of the kraijenhoff van de leur laboratory for water and sediment dynamics at wageningen university research the netherlands the flume has a length of 14 4 m a width of 1 2 m and depth of 0 5 m the water level can be adjusted with a weir at the downstream end discharge is monitored with an electromagnetic flow meter at the inlet tube a flow straightener at the upstream end of the flume suppresses secondary currents of inflowing water during the mobile bed experiments sediment was recirculated the river waal serves as prototype for the present study it represents a sand bed lowland river towards identifying dimensionless parameters and achieving dynamic similarity for the mobile bed experiments we adopted the approach of vermeulen et al 2014 the relevant non dimensional variables are presented in table 1 the first three terms l w and d 50 represent the degree of geometric similarity the geometric scaling factor for both fixed and mobile bed experiments was 15 except for sediment size the height of the vanes is 0 25 of the water depth which is a realistic height for smaller streams in rivers where navigation is important the relative height would be smaller for the mobile bed experiments scaling was primarily based on scaling of the shields parameter θ which represents mobility of the sediment δ was minimized in the model by using polystyrene granulates with d 50 2 1 mm and density ρ s 1055 kg m 3 the reduced density enabled good scaling of the shields parameter θ next to the shields parameter close resemblance between model and prototype values of the froude number fr bed slope s 0 particle number d and interaction parameter γ were important to achieve dynamic similarity of sediment transport and the water motion see also table 1 the buoyancy of sediment in the physical scale model was overestimated as a result particles entrained in suspension would easily remain in suspension and our experiments are particularly relevant for rivers where bedload transport dominates to ensure that bedload was the dominant mode of sediment transport the averaged flow velocity in the mobile bed experiments should not exceed 0 17 m s 1 boersema 2012 we further assured the reynolds number re remained sufficiently high to guarantee fully turbulent conditions we allowed a difference in the weber number we between model and prototype assuming surface effects to be negligible heller 2011 for the fixed bed experiments the design discharge was defined to achieve froude similarity as a consequence the mean velocity in the fixed bed experiments is larger than in the mobile bed experiments 2 1 1 fixed bed experiments the fixed bed experiments focussed on mean and turbulent flow three dimensional velocity measurements were performed for a total of seven configurations three different types of objects were constructed at laboratory scale vanes screens of stacked logs and trunks fig 2 these objects were placed in a set up that is similar to that of wang and odgaard 1993 in eight arrays consisting of four objects each in three fixed bed experiments the objects were placed with an angle of incidence α 15 and in three subsequent experiments with α 25 in an additional fixed bed experiment porous vanes were installed with α 15 to investigate the effect of permeability porous vanes were created by distributing small round holes with a diameter of 3 mm over the vanes this led to a porosity p 0 048 with p defined as the quotient of the cross sectional area of the holes and the total vane area height length the design of the experimental set ups was inspired by the experimental design of wang and odgaard 1993 and the design criteria defined by odgaard 2009 and odgaard and wang 1991b the height of the three alternative objects was 4 5 cm and the length was 13 5 cm the transverse spacing was equal to three times the height 13 5 cm the spacing between adjacent arrays was 53 8 cm an overview of the experimental set up of the experiments with trunks α 15 is depicted in fig 2 the vanes were created from plywood the screens and trunks were created with wooden sticks the objects were attached to large wooden boards with a total length of 7 5 m and a thickness of 1 8 cm which were placed in the flume 3 6 m downstream of the flow straightener the first array of objects was placed 2 m downstream of the front of the wooden boards to limit the effects of the upstream boundary the objects were place on one side of the flume whereas the other half was non obstructed this was done to be able to assess how the flow would adapt in this non obstructed half a layer of polystyrene was glued to the boards to create a realistic bed roughness and to facilitate the comparison between fixed bed and mobile bed experiments flow velocities were measured with a nortek vectrino side looking acoustic doppler velocimeter adv measurements were taken at a frequency of 25 hz for a period of 5 min at each measurement location the adv was installed on a carriage that enables computer controlled movement of the measuring device in three directions defined by the measurement scheme shown in fig 3 to gain understanding of the general flow conditions measurements were taken over the entire experimental range to obtain a detailed overview of flow patterns measurements were taken on a dense grid in one key cross section at four locations tubes were connected to stilling wells and water levels were measured with magnetostrictive linear position sensors for each experiment the tubes were deaerated and connected to the stilling wells to minimize the error of small air bubbles after this a precision of 1 mm was achieved at the start of each experiment the water level slope was determined based on the measured water levels the slope of the flume was adjusted to approach uniform flow conditions after this procedure water depth varied within a range of 1 2 table 2 over a distance of 5 5 m 2 1 2 mobile bed experiments based on the mobile bed experiments the effects of the objects on bed morphology were investigated in three experiments the three types of objects were installed with α 15 this angle was selected because the risk of scour near the objects would be smaller the three set ups in the mobile bed experiments were similar to the fixed bed experiments the same boundary conditions were imposed but the objects were elevated to tower above a layer of sediment in case of the vanes the height of the plywood vanes was increased and the plywood extended through the sediments towards the wooden boards at the bottom of the vane the wooden sticks for the other two set ups were attached to the bottom using two large nails two of the smaller sticks were placed directly under the objects both for the trunks and the screens and were buried in the sediment at the start of the experiment to limit the effects of piping when the experiments commenced the bed morphology adapted to the flow conditions and dunes developed by extending the objects into the sediments the occurrence of piping was minimized the layer of sediment had a thickness of 13 cm from the bottom of the flume at the start of each experiment the sediment surface was levelled subsequently the flume was slowly filled with water minimizing disturbance of the sediment layer each experiment ran for at least 12 hours before any measurements were performed to ensure proper development of the bed morphology after this period velocity measurements were taken at ten locations fig 3 at the end of an experiment the flume was slowly drained and bed morphology was measured using a line laser combined with a 3d camera sick 2012 de ruijsscher et al 2018 two experiments runs 9 and 10 in table 2 were repeated to gain insight in mean and turbulent flow characteristics during the mobile bed experiments the adv collected data for a period of 90 min at selected locations in the additional runs indicated in the bottom panel of fig 3 which was sufficient to capture several dune passages table 2 shows an overview of the experiments including mobile bed experiments for runs 9 to 13 values for sh are missing because surface slope magnitudes are smaller than the measurement accuracy 2 2 data processing the adv data were transformed to coordinates along and across the flume the raw data was filtered to remove data with correlation values below 70 lane et al 1998 spikes in the data were detected and removed using a bivariate kernel density function following islam and zhu 2013 who based their study on prior research of duong and hazelton 2003 and code developed by botev et al 2010 from the instanteneous velocities n 7500 the time averaged velocities indicated as u were determined the fluctuating component u was obtained as u i u the depth average of the time averaged velocities is indicated as u the same holds for the transverse v and vertical w velocities the fluctuating velocity components were used to calculate reynolds stress components τuw τvw and bed shear stress based on turbulence kinetic energy stapleton and huntley 1995 pope et al 2006 bennett et al 2015 according to 1 τ u w ρ u w 2 τ v w ρ v w 3 τ k 0 19 0 5 ρ u 2 v 2 w 2 dune migration renders the interpretation of the velocity data challenging it was worth verifying if the duration of the bursts of flow measurements in the mobile bed experiments was sufficiently long for each location the averages of the streamwise velocity were therefore recalculated with an increasing number of measurements and the deviation from the mean velocity over the 90 min time period was calculated according to 4 u n u u 100 where u n is the mean based on n measurements the data acquired with the line laser scanner and 3 d camera was also processed to correct for refraction and lens distortion sick 2012 de ruijsscher et al 2018 the precision of the measurements after correction is estimated as 3 mm this value was determined based on reference measurements before and after recalibration of the device a background correction was performed to eliminate structural deviations in the measured bed profile as described by de ruijsscher et al 2018 the values were interpolated to a 501 2401 grid 3 results and interpretation 3 1 fixed bed experiments 3 1 1 streamwise velocity fig 4 shows the mean flow characteristics in the object fields values provided in this section are based on measurements in cross section 5 and are significant based on the whitney u test p 0 005 for all experiments we observed a decreased depth averaged velocity within the object field compared to the non obstructed part of the flume 6 4 18 2 lower between y b 0 05 0 47 compared to y b 0 53 0 88 caused by the drag of the objects wang and odgaard 1993 the decrease in depth averaged velocity was largest in case of the trunks for both angles of incidence 2 1 3 9 lower compared to set ups with corresponding angle of incidence for all experiments the depth averaged velocity was slightly higher just outside the object field 1 7 8 4 higher between y b 0 50 0 53 compared to measurements at y b 0 71 0 88 the velocity gradient across the centreline of the flume which corresponds to the transition from the smooth side of the flume to the object field was comparatively large in the case of trunks whereas the adaptation in depth averaged velocity was more gradual for the other submerged objects this is especially true for experiments with α 15 where the maximum velocity gradient between two measuring locations is 86 214 higher such an abrupt velocity change may introduce a weak mixing layer and increase the total drag on the flow cf vermaas et al 2011 for six of the seven experiments a small peak in depth averaged velocity was observed around y b 0 12 top panel in fig 4 3 1 2 transverse velocity vanes steer sediment transport by inducing a vortex or secondary circulation fig 1 the effectivity of the different set ups in inducing a vortex can be assessed from the vertical profiles of transverse flow velocity across the flume near the water surface flow is steered to the right towards the centre of the flume near the bed flow is steered to the left to the side of the flume the magnitude of transverse velocities indicates effectiveness in creating secondary flow fig 5 we further averaged the normalized transverse velocities now indicated as v t u 0 at z d 0 13 over the width y b 0 05 0 47 as the transverse velocity close the bed is most important for steering bedload sediment transport both the impermeable and the porous versions of the vanes were more effective in creating a vortex than the other objects v t u 0 0 17 0 29 the trunks v t u 0 0 09 0 13 were less effective than the screens v t u 0 0 15 0 25 this held for both angles of incidence in the experiments which had limited influence on the transverse velocity structure in case of the trunks the depth of the vortex core visible as the transition of positive to negative transverse velocity in fig 5 changed through the cross section of the flume near the centreline of the flume the vortex core was below the top of the vane which agrees with the prediction by odgaard and wang 1991a towards the left side of the flume the vortex core shifted upwards this effect was more pronounced for a larger angle of incidence fig 6 shows the secondary circulation based on vectors of v and w for an experiment with vanes α 15 run 6 upper panel an experiment with screens α 15 run 4 second panel and an experiment with trunks α 15 run 2 bottom panel the top and bottom panels reveal an unexpected strong downward flow around y b 0 12 in the densely measured cross section which is directly downstream of the object closest to the side of the flume this flow phenomenon was detected in six out of seven experiments and corresponds to peaks in streamwise velocity fig 4 and shear stress 3 1 3 reynolds stress profiles vertical profiles of the main reynolds stress components and the total shear stress based on tke are shown in fig 7 shear stress values were larger in the field where objects were implemented increased values of shear stress were expected as the objects obstruct the approaching flow which may result in vortex structures around and downstream of the objects highest shear stresses were observed in the experiments with trunks between y b 0 05 0 47 averaged values of τk u 0 were 91 104 α 15 and 46 110 α 15 higher compared to experiments with screens and vanes 3 2 mobile bed experiments fig 8 presents results for the mobile bed experiments after each experiment the resulting bed morphology was scanned resulting in the elevation maps shown in fig 8 for each dune the maximum bed elevation for each y value was determined to visualize the crests of the dunes for one dune this extends over the width of the flume indicated in black for the other dunes in the object field this extends to y b 0 5 indicated in gray the latter is done because especially for the experiment with trunks dunes do not clearly extend over the entire width of the flume these objects as well as some erroneous values in the experiment with vanes were manually selected and deleted from this analysis it is clear that all three set ups were effective in redistributing sediment and showed increased bed elevation in the field where objects were implemented a distinct difference in dune shape and orientation between the experiments with vanes and screens on the one hand and trunks on the other hand can be observed for vanes and screens the dunes extended over the entire width of the flume between y b 0 2 and y b 0 4 the orientation of the dunes agreed with the secondary circulation in which a bottom current is directed towards the side of the flume y b 0 0 this is distinct from the bedforms observed in the experiment with trunks which did not show a similar oblique orientation fig 9 shows cross channel elevation profiles averaged over the range between x l 0 and x l 0 5 plus and minus the standard deviations the pattern of sediment redistribution by screens closely resembles the effect of traditional vanes sediment redistribution was induced by secondary circulation resulting in an increased bed elevation in the vane field and a decrease of the bed elevation just outside the object field odgaard and wang 1991b odgaard 2009 in the experiments with vanes and screens the bed elevation between y b 0 5 0 7 is significantly lower than the bed at y b 0 7 in the experiment with trunks however an opposite pattern is observed the measured velocities in the flume are influenced by dune migration to deal with this flow was measured over a 90 min time interval at each location fig 10 confirms that the velocity averages converge during this measurement period fig 11 shows vectors of the normalized mean velocity components u u 0 and v u 0 at two depths averaged over 90 min the vectors show small transverse velocities with an orientation that agrees with the patterns of the secondary circulation induced by the vanes in the fixed bed experiments in the lane of the flume where no objects were implemented the pattern may be reversed in all experiments scour developed locally directly upstream and along the objects induced by vortex structures initiated at the front of the objects fig 8 this was previously observed by gupta et al 2010 and boniforti et al 2015 who performed laboratory experiments with a single submerged vane although poorly visible from the bed elevation scans photographs reveal the presence of small sediment ridges downstream of the objects which are similar to sediment ridges reported by boniforti et al 2015 fig 12 an individual ridge may be the result of a coherent flow structure triggered by an object marelius and sinha 1998 studied the local flow patterns induced by a vane with a large angle of incidence α 40 they found that a horseshoe vortex is initiated at the head of the vane as well as two smaller vortices at the low pressure side of the vane referred to as suction side vortices the smallest of those is located near the bed and is directed such that the flow closest to the vane is directed downward an effect of the flow phenomenon that occurred during the fixed bed experiments shown in fig 6 was not apparent in the bed elevation scans 4 discussion 4 1 flow characteristics the vortices induced by the obliquely oriented objects in the flow may be considered a secondary circulation of prandtl s first kind governed by geometrical steering nezu et al 1993 vermaas et al 2011 showed that a lateral roughness transition in a flume may create a secondary circulation of prandtl s second kind induced by turbulence anisotropy the asymmetry in the turbulence field yields a near bottom flow from the rough lane to the smooth lane which is opposite to what is observed in the experiments presented in the present study the effect of turbulence anisotropy may partly counteract steering of the flow by the objects in the flow screens of stacked logs produce more turbulence are slightly less effective in creating a vortex and result in larger deceleration of the streamwise flow than traditional bottom vanes these differences appear to be of little relevance in the mobile bed experiments where the flow resistance was dominated by dune morphology during the experiment the objects were temporarily buried when a dune crest passed this has led to a reduction of the effectivity of the objects and might partly explain the relatively weak transverse flow in fig 11 tan et al 2005 recommend a vane height of 2 3 times the dune height for this reason 4 2 experimental design the experimental set ups were based on design rules suggested by odgaard 2009 and odgaard and wang 1991b the objects were placed at one side of the flume in order to enable to assess how flow in the non obstructed side would adapt however the wall of the flume appears to affect flow in the object fields we expect that near the flume side the flow structure represents vortices induced by an object array located upstream the strong transverse circulation locally induced by an object was transferred to higher water layers caused by vortex development in the downstream direction this explains why the vortex core moves up towards the flume wall in addition for 6 out of 7 fixed bed experiments a strong downward flow was observed near the left wall in the object field this downward flow corresponds to peaks in streamwise velocity and shear stress the left wall bounded the vortex that generated the downward velocity which may limit the direct translation to a field scale situation of a river with a sloping bank the resulting gradients in velocity caused increased values of the bed shear stress nezu et al 1993 lögdberg 2006 it is not clear why this downward flow is not observed in the experiment with screens with α 15 4 3 redistribution of sediment in our series of experiments two mechanisms can cause a redistribution of sediment the first mechanism is the vortex or secondary circulation initiated by the objects that alters the magnitude and direction of the bed shear stress the second is the deceleration of streamwise velocity due to form drag and enhanced roughness we argue based on presented results that the first mechanism the initiated vortex is most important in the case of vanes and screens compared to trunks the second reduction of streamwise velocity is particularly important for the experiments with trunks an indication for this can be found in the results of both the fixed bed and mobile bed experiments the reduction of streamwise velocity by trunks is large the trunks have a larger frontal area exert larger drag and induce a larger wake region where the streamwise flow is weak this reduction of streamwise velocity is observed throughout the object field whereas the adaptation of streamwise velocity for vanes and screens slowly decreases towards y b 0 0 we expect partly due to stagnation at the flume side fig 4 from fig 5 it is clear that the trunks induce a weaker vortex compared to vanes and screens for the trunks there is hardly any difference between the experiments with α 15 and α 25 fig 6 shows larger turbulence and shear for the experiments with trunks which relates to the larger reduction of streamwise velocity in the wake of the trunks pressure and flow velocity were relatively low we expect that the gradients in velocity caused flow instabilities and with that higher values for shear stress this is comparable to flow over and through submerged aquatic canopy where a mixing layer yields increased values of reynolds stress chen et al 2013 enhanced turbulence and corresponding reynolds stress increases the total drag imposed on the flow vermaas et al 2011 the results from the mobile bed experiments also show a clear distinction between trunks on the one hand and vanes and screens on the other in the experiments with vanes and screens the orientation of the dunes clearly follows the patterns of the expected secondary circulaton which is not the case for the experiment with trunks fig 8 furthermore fig 9 indicates that for vanes and screens sediment is redistributed from outside the object field around y b 0 55 to inside the object field which corresponds to submerged vane theory compare with fig 1 all the experiments induce a redistribution of sediment however vanes and screens redistribute the sediment locally from outside near the central axis of the flume to inside the object field the trunks however retain sediment mostly through flow velocity reduction inside the object field with a corresponding increase in streamwise velocity outside the object field this will lead to morphological adaptation over the entire river cross section and might even lead to decreased sediment supply downstream the reduction of flow velocity can be an issue in river management considering flood protection so for practical application trunks can be used to retain sediment but the redistribution of flow and the corresponding morphological impact might be limiting factors 4 4 implementation of wood logs in rivers in this study smooth wooden sticks represent trees however in the field especially when the ecological purpose of the sediment steering objects is considered branches and even rootwads can be included branches and rootwads might cause a larger reduction of the streamwise velocity and then have a similar effect as trunks svoboda and russell 2011 show that in the case of log jams upstream oriented rootwads deflect the flow in the zones with low flow velocity leaf patches might form which are often biodiversity hotspots de brouwer et al 2017 the deflection of flow by rootwads can also lead to local scours the effects of branches and rootwads on local flow dynamics is likely to reduce the effectivity of stacked logs in creating an secondary flow and to increase turbulence after implementation of wood logs the channel will adjust to accommodate flow to some extent decreasing drag wallerstein et al 2001 in the mobile bed experiments scour development resulted in piping in case of the screens and trunks this may be an important process to investigate more thoroughly prior to implementation in a river management program since it can jeopardize the stability of the objects in one of the fixed bed experiments the effects of porosity were studied results indicate that a low porosity has very limited effect on the flow it can be expected that in the field porosity of installed screens reduces with time as the screens will capture small pieces of wood and organic matter filling up potential gaps 4 5 perspectives and ways forward we reported a study that aimed to assess whether wood logs can be used to manage sediment transport by inducing a secondary circulation without having a large effect on the discharge conveyance capacity of a river the results indicate that screens of wood logs can be appropriate for this we identify two future research directions the experimental design can be improved by optimizing the height and spacing of the objects when considering field applications for instance to counteract erosion of a river bend it is likely that the effectiveness of the measure can be enhanced secondly to increase the ecological impact of the screens it is worth considering to include branches and possibly rootwads future research may quantify the effects of including branches and rootwads on flow and morphodynamics as on the ecological benefits kail et al 2007 and the risk of piping 5 summary and conclusions a laboratory study was conducted to investigate the suitability of wood logs for sediment management in rivers when placed in a set up similar to that of traditional submerged vanes in experiments with a fixed bed velocity measurements were taken for three set ups each containing different types of objects vanes screens and trunks the effects of changing the angle of incidence were measured and in a final set of experiments effects of vanes with porosity were investigated three experiments with a mobile bed were conducted for each of the configurations all with an angle of incidence α 15 traditional vanes and screens of stacked logs showed strong similarity in how they affect flow and bed morphological change stacked logs replacing a traditional vane are slightly less effective in redistributing flow decelerate the flow in the object field more strongly and result in higher levels of turbulence mean flow velocity patterns and turbulence properties are hardly sensitive to porosity but piping is identified as a potential problem that may jeopardize the stability of an object fixing the objects such as easily achieved in the laboratory may be costly to achieve at field scale the effects of trunks on flow and bed morphology are distinct from the effects of vanes and screens trunks induce a weaker vortex but are nonetheless effective in redistributing sediment deceleration of the streamwise velocity is expected to be the dominant cause of deposition in the field of trunks although this is effective in trapping sediment high drag may reduce the conveyance capacity of the river we conclude that wood logs can be used to alter sediment transport and have the potential to become a nature based alternative for traditional submerged vanes as the effects on flow and sediment transport are comparable to those of traditional vanes design rules for vanes can be a basis for implementation of screens e g odgaard 2009 tan et al 2005 ouyang 2009 ouyang and lu 2016 dey et al 2017 in addition anchoring could be achieved by vertical piles that extend into the river bed brooks et al 2006 single tree trunks can be used in areas where reduction of the conveyance capacity is not a problem as it is an effective measure for sediment trapping the stability of an object is a concern for objects placed directly on the river bed as piping and subsequent scour are likely to develop acknowledgments this research has been

601,submerged vanes alter sediment transport by inducing a secondary circulation without significantly compromising the conveyance capacity of the river here a laboratory study is conducted to investigate whether wood logs or trunks can be used for sediment management the effectivity of a traditional vane field is compared to set ups with screens of stacked logs and large individual trunks results indicate that all three set ups redistribute sediment but that the trunks are least effective in inducing a secondary circulation and cause higher turbulence and drag leading to a stronger decrease in streamwise velocity we conclude that a field of trunks acts as a sediment trap because of a strong reduction of the streamwise velocity without a strong secondary flow such as dominant in the other configurations screens of stacked logs can be successfully implemented in rivers as they are only slightly less effective than traditional vanes the risk of piping underneath objects and the associated scour are points of concern keywords wood logs submerged vanes sediment management physical scale model 1 introduction over the past centuries measures to assure flood protection and

attention as nature friendly control measures odgaard 2009 boniforti et al 2015 tan et al 2005 sinha and marelius 2000 flokstra 2006 ouyang 2009 gupta et al 2010 dey et al 2017 submerged vanes are objects with a small angle of incidence with respect to the approaching flow they steer the bottom transport of sediment in a direction depending on the oblique orientation of vanes at the river bed pressure increases on one side of the vane creating a vertical pressure gradient that induces upward flow at the other side a reversed pressure gradient is created with relatively low pressure near the bed inducing downward flow by this a vortex is initiated altering magnitude and direction of the bed shear stress fig 1 because the direction of the bed shear stress is altered sediment is steered to one side of the vane odgaard and wang 1991a as a result the local morphology can be managed for instance by steering sediment away from a channel intake or steering sediment towards an outer river bend the vanes do not have a large impact on the conveyance capacity of the river the vanes are usually created using sheet piles odgaard and lee 1984 boniforti et al 2015 or made of reinforced concrete boniforti et al 2015 odgaard and wang 1991a dead wood can be a natural alternative for sheet piles and concrete it can provide habitat for a range of aquatic species and thus lead to increased productivity and respiration brooks et al 2004 benke and wallace 2003 klink 2015 mutz et al 2007 roni et al 2015 in some cases wood is not only applied to increase biodiversity but as a measure to control flow and sediment transport this is often done by using large structures of wood to form an obstruction to the flow and create a wake region where bed shear stress is reduced as well as scours due to flow acceleration wallerstein et al 2001 svoboda and russell 2011 bennett et al 2015 gallisdorfer et al 2014 shields et al 2004 pagliara and kurdistani 2017 this however has a large impact on the conveyance capacity of the river considering all objectives of modern river management this contribution investigates the possibility to use wood logs here defined as dead trees and tree trunks with a diameter larger than 10 cm keller and swanson 1979 to steer bedload sediment transport in a similar fashion as traditional vanes we report on a laboratory study that includes experimental set ups representing traditional vanes herein further referred to as vanes a screen of stacked logs referred to as screens and arrays of large individual trunks referred to as trunks in an additional experiment the effect of porosity is investigated 2 methodology 2 1 experimental set up fixed bed and mobile bed experiments were performed in a tilting flume of the kraijenhoff van de leur laboratory for water and sediment dynamics at wageningen university research the netherlands the flume has a length of 14 4 m a width of 1 2 m and depth of 0 5 m the water level can be adjusted with a weir at the downstream end discharge is monitored with an electromagnetic flow meter at the inlet tube a flow straightener at the upstream end of the flume suppresses secondary currents of inflowing water during the mobile bed experiments sediment was recirculated the river waal serves as prototype for the present study it represents a sand bed lowland river towards identifying dimensionless parameters and achieving dynamic similarity for the mobile bed experiments we adopted the approach of vermeulen et al 2014 the relevant non dimensional variables are presented in table 1 the first three terms l w and d 50 represent the degree of geometric similarity the geometric scaling factor for both fixed and mobile bed experiments was 15 except for sediment size the height of the vanes is 0 25 of the water depth which is a realistic height for smaller streams in rivers where navigation is important the relative height would be smaller for the mobile bed experiments scaling was primarily based on scaling of the shields parameter θ which represents mobility of the sediment δ was minimized in the model by using polystyrene granulates with d 50 2 1 mm and density ρ s 1055 kg m 3 the reduced density enabled good scaling of the shields parameter θ next to the shields parameter close resemblance between model and prototype values of the froude number fr bed slope s 0 particle number d and interaction parameter γ were important to achieve dynamic similarity of sediment transport and the water motion see also table 1 the buoyancy of sediment in the physical scale model was overestimated as a result particles entrained in suspension would easily remain in suspension and our experiments are particularly relevant for rivers where bedload transport dominates to ensure that bedload was the dominant mode of sediment transport the averaged flow velocity in the mobile bed experiments should not exceed 0 17 m s 1 boersema 2012 we further assured the reynolds number re remained sufficiently high to guarantee fully turbulent conditions we allowed a difference in the weber number we between model and prototype assuming surface effects to be negligible heller 2011 for the fixed bed experiments the design discharge was defined to achieve froude similarity as a consequence the mean velocity in the fixed bed experiments is larger than in the mobile bed experiments 2 1 1 fixed bed experiments the fixed bed experiments focussed on mean and turbulent flow three dimensional velocity measurements were performed for a total of seven configurations three different types of objects were constructed at laboratory scale vanes screens of stacked logs and trunks fig 2 these objects were placed in a set up that is similar to that of wang and odgaard 1993 in eight arrays consisting of four objects each in three fixed bed experiments the objects were placed with an angle of incidence α 15 and in three subsequent experiments with α 25 in an additional fixed bed experiment porous vanes were installed with α 15 to investigate the effect of permeability porous vanes were created by distributing small round holes with a diameter of 3 mm over the vanes this led to a porosity p 0 048 with p defined as the quotient of the cross sectional area of the holes and the total vane area height length the design of the experimental set ups was inspired by the experimental design of wang and odgaard 1993 and the design criteria defined by odgaard 2009 and odgaard and wang 1991b the height of the three alternative objects was 4 5 cm and the length was 13 5 cm the transverse spacing was equal to three times the height 13 5 cm the spacing between adjacent arrays was 53 8 cm an overview of the experimental set up of the experiments with trunks α 15 is depicted in fig 2 the vanes were created from plywood the screens and trunks were created with wooden sticks the objects were attached to large wooden boards with a total length of 7 5 m and a thickness of 1 8 cm which were placed in the flume 3 6 m downstream of the flow straightener the first array of objects was placed 2 m downstream of the front of the wooden boards to limit the effects of the upstream boundary the objects were place on one side of the flume whereas the other half was non obstructed this was done to be able to assess how the flow would adapt in this non obstructed half a layer of polystyrene was glued to the boards to create a realistic bed roughness and to facilitate the comparison between fixed bed and mobile bed experiments flow velocities were measured with a nortek vectrino side looking acoustic doppler velocimeter adv measurements were taken at a frequency of 25 hz for a period of 5 min at each measurement location the adv was installed on a carriage that enables computer controlled movement of the measuring device in three directions defined by the measurement scheme shown in fig 3 to gain understanding of the general flow conditions measurements were taken over the entire experimental range to obtain a detailed overview of flow patterns measurements were taken on a dense grid in one key cross section at four locations tubes were connected to stilling wells and water levels were measured with magnetostrictive linear position sensors for each experiment the tubes were deaerated and connected to the stilling wells to minimize the error of small air bubbles after this a precision of 1 mm was achieved at the start of each experiment the water level slope was determined based on the measured water levels the slope of the flume was adjusted to approach uniform flow conditions after this procedure water depth varied within a range of 1 2 table 2 over a distance of 5 5 m 2 1 2 mobile bed experiments based on the mobile bed experiments the effects of the objects on bed morphology were investigated in three experiments the three types of objects were installed with α 15 this angle was selected because the risk of scour near the objects would be smaller the three set ups in the mobile bed experiments were similar to the fixed bed experiments the same boundary conditions were imposed but the objects were elevated to tower above a layer of sediment in case of the vanes the height of the plywood vanes was increased and the plywood extended through the sediments towards the wooden boards at the bottom of the vane the wooden sticks for the other two set ups were attached to the bottom using two large nails two of the smaller sticks were placed directly under the objects both for the trunks and the screens and were buried in the sediment at the start of the experiment to limit the effects of piping when the experiments commenced the bed morphology adapted to the flow conditions and dunes developed by extending the objects into the sediments the occurrence of piping was minimized the layer of sediment had a thickness of 13 cm from the bottom of the flume at the start of each experiment the sediment surface was levelled subsequently the flume was slowly filled with water minimizing disturbance of the sediment layer each experiment ran for at least 12 hours before any measurements were performed to ensure proper development of the bed morphology after this period velocity measurements were taken at ten locations fig 3 at the end of an experiment the flume was slowly drained and bed morphology was measured using a line laser combined with a 3d camera sick 2012 de ruijsscher et al 2018 two experiments runs 9 and 10 in table 2 were repeated to gain insight in mean and turbulent flow characteristics during the mobile bed experiments the adv collected data for a period of 90 min at selected locations in the additional runs indicated in the bottom panel of fig 3 which was sufficient to capture several dune passages table 2 shows an overview of the experiments including mobile bed experiments for runs 9 to 13 values for sh are missing because surface slope magnitudes are smaller than the measurement accuracy 2 2 data processing the adv data were transformed to coordinates along and across the flume the raw data was filtered to remove data with correlation values below 70 lane et al 1998 spikes in the data were detected and removed using a bivariate kernel density function following islam and zhu 2013 who based their study on prior research of duong and hazelton 2003 and code developed by botev et al 2010 from the instanteneous velocities n 7500 the time averaged velocities indicated as u were determined the fluctuating component u was obtained as u i u the depth average of the time averaged velocities is indicated as u the same holds for the transverse v and vertical w velocities the fluctuating velocity components were used to calculate reynolds stress components τuw τvw and bed shear stress based on turbulence kinetic energy stapleton and huntley 1995 pope et al 2006 bennett et al 2015 according to 1 τ u w ρ u w 2 τ v w ρ v w 3 τ k 0 19 0 5 ρ u 2 v 2 w 2 dune migration renders the interpretation of the velocity data challenging it was worth verifying if the duration of the bursts of flow measurements in the mobile bed experiments was sufficiently long for each location the averages of the streamwise velocity were therefore recalculated with an increasing number of measurements and the deviation from the mean velocity over the 90 min time period was calculated according to 4 u n u u 100 where u n is the mean based on n measurements the data acquired with the line laser scanner and 3 d camera was also processed to correct for refraction and lens distortion sick 2012 de ruijsscher et al 2018 the precision of the measurements after correction is estimated as 3 mm this value was determined based on reference measurements before and after recalibration of the device a background correction was performed to eliminate structural deviations in the measured bed profile as described by de ruijsscher et al 2018 the values were interpolated to a 501 2401 grid 3 results and interpretation 3 1 fixed bed experiments 3 1 1 streamwise velocity fig 4 shows the mean flow characteristics in the object fields values provided in this section are based on measurements in cross section 5 and are significant based on the whitney u test p 0 005 for all experiments we observed a decreased depth averaged velocity within the object field compared to the non obstructed part of the flume 6 4 18 2 lower between y b 0 05 0 47 compared to y b 0 53 0 88 caused by the drag of the objects wang and odgaard 1993 the decrease in depth averaged velocity was largest in case of the trunks for both angles of incidence 2 1 3 9 lower compared to set ups with corresponding angle of incidence for all experiments the depth averaged velocity was slightly higher just outside the object field 1 7 8 4 higher between y b 0 50 0 53 compared to measurements at y b 0 71 0 88 the velocity gradient across the centreline of the flume which corresponds to the transition from the smooth side of the flume to the object field was comparatively large in the case of trunks whereas the adaptation in depth averaged velocity was more gradual for the other submerged objects this is especially true for experiments with α 15 where the maximum velocity gradient between two measuring locations is 86 214 higher such an abrupt velocity change may introduce a weak mixing layer and increase the total drag on the flow cf vermaas et al 2011 for six of the seven experiments a small peak in depth averaged velocity was observed around y b 0 12 top panel in fig 4 3 1 2 transverse velocity vanes steer sediment transport by inducing a vortex or secondary circulation fig 1 the effectivity of the different set ups in inducing a vortex can be assessed from the vertical profiles of transverse flow velocity across the flume near the water surface flow is steered to the right towards the centre of the flume near the bed flow is steered to the left to the side of the flume the magnitude of transverse velocities indicates effectiveness in creating secondary flow fig 5 we further averaged the normalized transverse velocities now indicated as v t u 0 at z d 0 13 over the width y b 0 05 0 47 as the transverse velocity close the bed is most important for steering bedload sediment transport both the impermeable and the porous versions of the vanes were more effective in creating a vortex than the other objects v t u 0 0 17 0 29 the trunks v t u 0 0 09 0 13 were less effective than the screens v t u 0 0 15 0 25 this held for both angles of incidence in the experiments which had limited influence on the transverse velocity structure in case of the trunks the depth of the vortex core visible as the transition of positive to negative transverse velocity in fig 5 changed through the cross section of the flume near the centreline of the flume the vortex core was below the top of the vane which agrees with the prediction by odgaard and wang 1991a towards the left side of the flume the vortex core shifted upwards this effect was more pronounced for a larger angle of incidence fig 6 shows the secondary circulation based on vectors of v and w for an experiment with vanes α 15 run 6 upper panel an experiment with screens α 15 run 4 second panel and an experiment with trunks α 15 run 2 bottom panel the top and bottom panels reveal an unexpected strong downward flow around y b 0 12 in the densely measured cross section which is directly downstream of the object closest to the side of the flume this flow phenomenon was detected in six out of seven experiments and corresponds to peaks in streamwise velocity fig 4 and shear stress 3 1 3 reynolds stress profiles vertical profiles of the main reynolds stress components and the total shear stress based on tke are shown in fig 7 shear stress values were larger in the field where objects were implemented increased values of shear stress were expected as the objects obstruct the approaching flow which may result in vortex structures around and downstream of the objects highest shear stresses were observed in the experiments with trunks between y b 0 05 0 47 averaged values of τk u 0 were 91 104 α 15 and 46 110 α 15 higher compared to experiments with screens and vanes 3 2 mobile bed experiments fig 8 presents results for the mobile bed experiments after each experiment the resulting bed morphology was scanned resulting in the elevation maps shown in fig 8 for each dune the maximum bed elevation for each y value was determined to visualize the crests of the dunes for one dune this extends over the width of the flume indicated in black for the other dunes in the object field this extends to y b 0 5 indicated in gray the latter is done because especially for the experiment with trunks dunes do not clearly extend over the entire width of the flume these objects as well as some erroneous values in the experiment with vanes were manually selected and deleted from this analysis it is clear that all three set ups were effective in redistributing sediment and showed increased bed elevation in the field where objects were implemented a distinct difference in dune shape and orientation between the experiments with vanes and screens on the one hand and trunks on the other hand can be observed for vanes and screens the dunes extended over the entire width of the flume between y b 0 2 and y b 0 4 the orientation of the dunes agreed with the secondary circulation in which a bottom current is directed towards the side of the flume y b 0 0 this is distinct from the bedforms observed in the experiment with trunks which did not show a similar oblique orientation fig 9 shows cross channel elevation profiles averaged over the range between x l 0 and x l 0 5 plus and minus the standard deviations the pattern of sediment redistribution by screens closely resembles the effect of traditional vanes sediment redistribution was induced by secondary circulation resulting in an increased bed elevation in the vane field and a decrease of the bed elevation just outside the object field odgaard and wang 1991b odgaard 2009 in the experiments with vanes and screens the bed elevation between y b 0 5 0 7 is significantly lower than the bed at y b 0 7 in the experiment with trunks however an opposite pattern is observed the measured velocities in the flume are influenced by dune migration to deal with this flow was measured over a 90 min time interval at each location fig 10 confirms that the velocity averages converge during this measurement period fig 11 shows vectors of the normalized mean velocity components u u 0 and v u 0 at two depths averaged over 90 min the vectors show small transverse velocities with an orientation that agrees with the patterns of the secondary circulation induced by the vanes in the fixed bed experiments in the lane of the flume where no objects were implemented the pattern may be reversed in all experiments scour developed locally directly upstream and along the objects induced by vortex structures initiated at the front of the objects fig 8 this was previously observed by gupta et al 2010 and boniforti et al 2015 who performed laboratory experiments with a single submerged vane although poorly visible from the bed elevation scans photographs reveal the presence of small sediment ridges downstream of the objects which are similar to sediment ridges reported by boniforti et al 2015 fig 12 an individual ridge may be the result of a coherent flow structure triggered by an object marelius and sinha 1998 studied the local flow patterns induced by a vane with a large angle of incidence α 40 they found that a horseshoe vortex is initiated at the head of the vane as well as two smaller vortices at the low pressure side of the vane referred to as suction side vortices the smallest of those is located near the bed and is directed such that the flow closest to the vane is directed downward an effect of the flow phenomenon that occurred during the fixed bed experiments shown in fig 6 was not apparent in the bed elevation scans 4 discussion 4 1 flow characteristics the vortices induced by the obliquely oriented objects in the flow may be considered a secondary circulation of prandtl s first kind governed by geometrical steering nezu et al 1993 vermaas et al 2011 showed that a lateral roughness transition in a flume may create a secondary circulation of prandtl s second kind induced by turbulence anisotropy the asymmetry in the turbulence field yields a near bottom flow from the rough lane to the smooth lane which is opposite to what is observed in the experiments presented in the present study the effect of turbulence anisotropy may partly counteract steering of the flow by the objects in the flow screens of stacked logs produce more turbulence are slightly less effective in creating a vortex and result in larger deceleration of the streamwise flow than traditional bottom vanes these differences appear to be of little relevance in the mobile bed experiments where the flow resistance was dominated by dune morphology during the experiment the objects were temporarily buried when a dune crest passed this has led to a reduction of the effectivity of the objects and might partly explain the relatively weak transverse flow in fig 11 tan et al 2005 recommend a vane height of 2 3 times the dune height for this reason 4 2 experimental design the experimental set ups were based on design rules suggested by odgaard 2009 and odgaard and wang 1991b the objects were placed at one side of the flume in order to enable to assess how flow in the non obstructed side would adapt however the wall of the flume appears to affect flow in the object fields we expect that near the flume side the flow structure represents vortices induced by an object array located upstream the strong transverse circulation locally induced by an object was transferred to higher water layers caused by vortex development in the downstream direction this explains why the vortex core moves up towards the flume wall in addition for 6 out of 7 fixed bed experiments a strong downward flow was observed near the left wall in the object field this downward flow corresponds to peaks in streamwise velocity and shear stress the left wall bounded the vortex that generated the downward velocity which may limit the direct translation to a field scale situation of a river with a sloping bank the resulting gradients in velocity caused increased values of the bed shear stress nezu et al 1993 lögdberg 2006 it is not clear why this downward flow is not observed in the experiment with screens with α 15 4 3 redistribution of sediment in our series of experiments two mechanisms can cause a redistribution of sediment the first mechanism is the vortex or secondary circulation initiated by the objects that alters the magnitude and direction of the bed shear stress the second is the deceleration of streamwise velocity due to form drag and enhanced roughness we argue based on presented results that the first mechanism the initiated vortex is most important in the case of vanes and screens compared to trunks the second reduction of streamwise velocity is particularly important for the experiments with trunks an indication for this can be found in the results of both the fixed bed and mobile bed experiments the reduction of streamwise velocity by trunks is large the trunks have a larger frontal area exert larger drag and induce a larger wake region where the streamwise flow is weak this reduction of streamwise velocity is observed throughout the object field whereas the adaptation of streamwise velocity for vanes and screens slowly decreases towards y b 0 0 we expect partly due to stagnation at the flume side fig 4 from fig 5 it is clear that the trunks induce a weaker vortex compared to vanes and screens for the trunks there is hardly any difference between the experiments with α 15 and α 25 fig 6 shows larger turbulence and shear for the experiments with trunks which relates to the larger reduction of streamwise velocity in the wake of the trunks pressure and flow velocity were relatively low we expect that the gradients in velocity caused flow instabilities and with that higher values for shear stress this is comparable to flow over and through submerged aquatic canopy where a mixing layer yields increased values of reynolds stress chen et al 2013 enhanced turbulence and corresponding reynolds stress increases the total drag imposed on the flow vermaas et al 2011 the results from the mobile bed experiments also show a clear distinction between trunks on the one hand and vanes and screens on the other in the experiments with vanes and screens the orientation of the dunes clearly follows the patterns of the expected secondary circulaton which is not the case for the experiment with trunks fig 8 furthermore fig 9 indicates that for vanes and screens sediment is redistributed from outside the object field around y b 0 55 to inside the object field which corresponds to submerged vane theory compare with fig 1 all the experiments induce a redistribution of sediment however vanes and screens redistribute the sediment locally from outside near the central axis of the flume to inside the object field the trunks however retain sediment mostly through flow velocity reduction inside the object field with a corresponding increase in streamwise velocity outside the object field this will lead to morphological adaptation over the entire river cross section and might even lead to decreased sediment supply downstream the reduction of flow velocity can be an issue in river management considering flood protection so for practical application trunks can be used to retain sediment but the redistribution of flow and the corresponding morphological impact might be limiting factors 4 4 implementation of wood logs in rivers in this study smooth wooden sticks represent trees however in the field especially when the ecological purpose of the sediment steering objects is considered branches and even rootwads can be included branches and rootwads might cause a larger reduction of the streamwise velocity and then have a similar effect as trunks svoboda and russell 2011 show that in the case of log jams upstream oriented rootwads deflect the flow in the zones with low flow velocity leaf patches might form which are often biodiversity hotspots de brouwer et al 2017 the deflection of flow by rootwads can also lead to local scours the effects of branches and rootwads on local flow dynamics is likely to reduce the effectivity of stacked logs in creating an secondary flow and to increase turbulence after implementation of wood logs the channel will adjust to accommodate flow to some extent decreasing drag wallerstein et al 2001 in the mobile bed experiments scour development resulted in piping in case of the screens and trunks this may be an important process to investigate more thoroughly prior to implementation in a river management program since it can jeopardize the stability of the objects in one of the fixed bed experiments the effects of porosity were studied results indicate that a low porosity has very limited effect on the flow it can be expected that in the field porosity of installed screens reduces with time as the screens will capture small pieces of wood and organic matter filling up potential gaps 4 5 perspectives and ways forward we reported a study that aimed to assess whether wood logs can be used to manage sediment transport by inducing a secondary circulation without having a large effect on the discharge conveyance capacity of a river the results indicate that screens of wood logs can be appropriate for this we identify two future research directions the experimental design can be improved by optimizing the height and spacing of the objects when considering field applications for instance to counteract erosion of a river bend it is likely that the effectiveness of the measure can be enhanced secondly to increase the ecological impact of the screens it is worth considering to include branches and possibly rootwads future research may quantify the effects of including branches and rootwads on flow and morphodynamics as on the ecological benefits kail et al 2007 and the risk of piping 5 summary and conclusions a laboratory study was conducted to investigate the suitability of wood logs for sediment management in rivers when placed in a set up similar to that of traditional submerged vanes in experiments with a fixed bed velocity measurements were taken for three set ups each containing different types of objects vanes screens and trunks the effects of changing the angle of incidence were measured and in a final set of experiments effects of vanes with porosity were investigated three experiments with a mobile bed were conducted for each of the configurations all with an angle of incidence α 15 traditional vanes and screens of stacked logs showed strong similarity in how they affect flow and bed morphological change stacked logs replacing a traditional vane are slightly less effective in redistributing flow decelerate the flow in the object field more strongly and result in higher levels of turbulence mean flow velocity patterns and turbulence properties are hardly sensitive to porosity but piping is identified as a potential problem that may jeopardize the stability of an object fixing the objects such as easily achieved in the laboratory may be costly to achieve at field scale the effects of trunks on flow and bed morphology are distinct from the effects of vanes and screens trunks induce a weaker vortex but are nonetheless effective in redistributing sediment deceleration of the streamwise velocity is expected to be the dominant cause of deposition in the field of trunks although this is effective in trapping sediment high drag may reduce the conveyance capacity of the river we conclude that wood logs can be used to alter sediment transport and have the potential to become a nature based alternative for traditional submerged vanes as the effects on flow and sediment transport are comparable to those of traditional vanes design rules for vanes can be a basis for implementation of screens e g odgaard 2009 tan et al 2005 ouyang 2009 ouyang and lu 2016 dey et al 2017 in addition anchoring could be achieved by vertical piles that extend into the river bed brooks et al 2006 single tree trunks can be used in areas where reduction of the conveyance capacity is not a problem as it is an effective measure for sediment trapping the stability of an object is a concern for objects placed directly on the river bed as piping and subsequent scour are likely to develop acknowledgments this research has been

602,the quantification of recharge and trans valley underflow is needed in arid regions to estimate the impacts of new water withdrawals on the water table however for mountainous desert areas such estimates are highly challenging due to data scarcity heterogeneous soils and long residence times conventional assessment employs isolated groundwater models configured with simplified uniform estimates of recharge here we employed a data constrained surface subsurface process model to provide an ensemble of spatially distributed recharge and underflow estimates using perturbed parameters then the model independent parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification pest package was used to calibrate the aquifer hydraulic conductivity field in modflow for this ensemble and reject implausible recharge values this novel dual model approach broadly applicable to mountainous arid regions was designed to maximally exploit available data sources it can assimilate groundwater head observations reject unrealistic parameters and narrow the range of estimated drawdowns due to pumping we applied this approach to the chuckwalla basin in california usa to determine natural recharge simulated recharge concentrates along alluvial fans at the mountain fronts and ephemeral washes where run off water infiltrates if an evenly distributed recharge was employed as in conventional studies it would result in regional biases in estimated drawdown and larger uncertainty bounds we also note that the speed of groundwater recovery does not guarantee sustainability heavy pumping induces large hydraulic gradients that initially recover quickly when pumping is halted but the system may not ultimately recover to pre pumping levels 1 introduction for the allocation of groundwater resources in desert or semi desert areas the amount of groundwater recharge is an important quantity since it determines the amount of groundwater that can be renewably extracted estimating recharge in mountainous desert basins is especially challenging recharge there occurs through spatially sporadic infiltration flint et al 2004 of ephemeral runoff along many washes descending from those mountains cadwr 1979 and through associated alluvial fans wilson and guan 2004 to accurately measure this recharge requires dense long term collection of infiltration data in many ephemeral washes and playas for example infiltration was found underneath some washes in the mojave desert but not others izbicki et al 2000 such fieldwork and the measurements collected from it are highly valuable and should be strongly supported these measurements are however prohibitively expensive and often unavailable in our study area the chuckwalla basin of southwestern california to be described in section 2 there are no data that provide direct measurements of recharge conventionally groundwater systems have often been modeled with isolated groundwater models such as modflow harbaugh 2005 in that approach recharge needs to be estimated through independent means e g as a percentage of precipitation maxey and eakin 1949 or via precipitation runoff regression scanlon 2004 wilson and guan 2004 previous environmental impact assessments eias in the chuckwalla basin have used maxey eakin type recharge estimates assuming 2 10 of precipitation gei 2010 worleyparsons 2009 however this method has strong limitations because it does not consider the location and mechanism of recharge maurer and berger 2006 additionally using water balance methods even small errors in evapotranspiration estimates can result in large percentage errors in recharge large scale land surface models such as the community land model fan et al 2013 and pcr globwb sutanudjaja et al 2017 are also sometimes employed to estimate recharge but they typically do not have the detailed processes needed to describe desert mountain front recharge physically based integrated hydrologic models e g gsflow markstrom et al 2008 tian et al 2015 hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2006 parflow munévar and mariño 1999 and paws shen et al 2016 shen and phanikumar 2010 calculate recharge as an internal flux adapted properly for arid mountainous domains they can serve as practical tools for recharge estimation however the chosen model must provide physically based descriptions of the coupling between surface water run on infiltration and groundwater this is because hillslope infiltration and ephemeral channel percolation are coupled processes controlling the partition of water into soil infiltration channel percolation and streamflow yield schreiner mcgraw and vivoni 2018 note also that a joint estimation of recharge and the aquifer hydraulic conductivity field based on groundwater data is typically not a robust approach because it has been shown to require a large amount of groundwater head data knowling and werner 2016 or sufficient prior knowledge erdal and cirpka 2016 integrated hydrologic modeling also faces a range of challenges including data scarcity in less inhabited desert areas first pedotransfer functions ptf wösten et al 2001 are often used to parameterize soil hydrologic functioning in integrated large scale models e g maxwell et al 2015 and mirus 2015 but desert soil properties differ greatly from what can be inferred from typical ptfs for example in desert areas we find closely packed interlocking rock fragments called desert pavement mcfadden et al 1987 or widely occurring near surface calcium carbonate formations called caliche these soils are hydraulically distinct from soils elsewhere with similar sand clay compositions and can vary substantially depending on age mirus et al 2009 young et al 2004 therefore uncertainty analysis is necessary second recharge that does occur can take decades to reach the deep water table requiring expensive long term simulations on the order of decades or even longer finally aquifer conductivity data are often scarce to estimate pumping drawdowns we need estimates of the regional aquifer conductivity k or transmissivity the product of conductivity and thickness in many desert or semi desert basins there are scattered groundwater observations that could be utilized to constrain the highly uncertain k field there might also be some locations with known k values estimated from pumping tests or lithologic estimates in these data scarce regions we should use all available information and existing tools to calibrate the spatially heterogeneous k field e g using pest doherty 2003 tonkin and doherty 2009 pest is a model independent parameter estimation package that can work with highly parameterized models by exploring covariance structures it can be challenging to fully integrate varied sources of information e g groundwater head soil moisture and pumping test data to constrain integrated modeling while also considering the inherent uncertainties one potential approach is data assimilation da e g ensemble kalman filtering which updates model states and parameters based on estimating a covariance matrix using ensemble members da is a powerful approach that can assimilate multiple data sources but most applications so far have involved only a few parameters such as the conductivity value for a few different zones in a model e g rasmussen et al 2015 2016 and zhang et al 2015 2016 by default da does not impose geostatistical constraints such as spatial auto correlation more recent research has incorporated da with multi point geostatistics mpg to identify subsurface preferential flow structures zovi et al 2017 but found that the addition of mpg conditioning did not improve their results researchers have also employed da to retrieve the k field from synthetic simulations pasetto et al 2015 xu and gómez hernández 2016 but the spatial autocorrelation length was assumed and not adjusted in addition such specialized techniques have only been tested in idealized hypothetical scenarios while real world cases often possess unique boundary and forcing conditions that are challenging to implement in real world cases with scarce k data but some hydraulic head observations it is often not practical to establish usable semi variograms the key research question we pose is how can we make plausible estimations of recharge ranges in a mountainous desert basin given scattered observations of soil moisture groundwater head and limited or uncertain hydrogeology knowledge owing to limited observations we did not attempt to estimate a probability distribution of the recharge but rather to put a bound on the estimate furthermore given uncertain parameters we want to know how the conditioning of the models on available information influences the estimated pumping drawdown in this paper we demonstrate the usefulness of a dual model approach to best exploit multiple sources of data for the purpose of putting bounds on natural recharge in the basin and constraining future projections of pumping effects it is possible that further research in da will better incorporate different forms of geostatistical constraints however here we take the simpler approach of coupling a process based model with a widely used parameter estimation package that can impose geospatial autocorrelation importantly the straightforward nature of the framework makes it more accessible to practitioners who may also wish to replace the hydrologic model and calibration procedures with ones of their own choosing 2 sites and methods we employed a data constrained integrated hydrologic model to provide recharge estimates for calibrating a groundwater model the sparsely inhabited study region poses significant challenges for modeling especially in terms of characterizing hydrogeology and soils groundwater and geologic data have not been systematically collected however scattered information can be found across multiple reports from resource reconnaissance mining operations and environmental impact analysis to assemble the model we needed to compile and integrate existing quantitative and qualitative knowledge as well as make some assumptions to be described in section 2 3 2 including a flat top for the one of the aquifer formations as described below given parameter uncertainties we ran an ensemble of simulations using a process based integrated hydrologic model paws clm section 2 3 1 recharge estimates were extracted from these simulations denoted by simulations 0 1 etc and were subsequently fed into modflow pest a parameter calibration package capable of estimating spatially distributed parameters the recharge values that could not adequately describe groundwater observations were rejected while those retained were used to make predictions fig 1 only the retained recharge and parameter sets were used to estimate the impacts of pumping in the following we first describe physiographic features of the basin and our field measurements then we describe how the model was assembled from raw information 2 1 basin physiographic properties we examine the chuckwalla basin fig 2 a 6712 km2 which is located west of the city of blythe near the colorado river in california generally within the mojave and sonoran deserts pumping activities have been proposed for new water users in this basin including solar energy projects and a pumped energy storage project table 1 the approved operations will collectively extract 2 3 106 m3year 1 from local aquifers on an ongoing basis additionally the eagle mountain pumped storage project emps is permitted to extract almost 1 107m3year 1 during the 4 year initial fill phase ferc 2012 we are interested in predicting the impacts of such pumping on the local aquifer the basin has a hot desert climate with average january and july temperatures of 4 c and 43 c respectively and an 18 year annual average rainfall of 95 mm there are no perennial water bodies within the basin about 30 of the basin is mountainous terrain rising abruptly from the valley floor generally the basin floor slopes gently downward from northwest to southeast physiographically there is an upper western and lower eastern portion of the chuckwalla valley proper with a subtle surface water divide between the palen western and ford dry lake eastern playas some groundwater underflow enters from the pinto valley basin in the northwest the orocopia valley basin to the southwest of the chuckwalla basin likely contributes small underflow because it is much smaller and receives a small amount of recharge godfrey et al 2012 the chuckwalla is otherwise a closed basin except along its eastern boundary with the palo verde valley and the colorado river metamorphic and igneous bedrock composing the surrounding mountains is assumed to be impervious worleyparsons 2009 the basin has complex soil configurations yet widely used soil surveys have poor coverage for this region ssurgo the most detailed soils survey available nationally contains only one soil type for most of the chuckwalla valley and mountains with no descriptions of soil thickness or water retention properties generally the mountains have considerable exposed bedrock with thin sandy soils and washes or alluvial drainages supplying sediment to the valley floor no data exist to describe the thickness of these soils but our field reconnaissance suggested an average of 30 cm in contrast the valley is mantled by much thicker soils and unconsolidated materials such as loamy sand alluvium with interlacing desert pavement fig 3 a coarse steep alluvial fans at the mountain feet where brush can grow fig 3 b and clay rich playas near the center usgs 1995 a satellite image of the upper basin with visible traits of the washes is provided in fig 3 c well logs indicate that the alluvium layer in the valley interbedded sands and gravels with discontinuous clay varies between 210 m and 366 m in thickness cadwr 1979 the water table can often be found in this layer depth to water table ranges from 150 m near desert center to 6 4 m near palen dry lake where groundwater may emerge and slowly evaporate with respect to the geology beneath the alluvium and above the bedrock the valley can be roughly divided into two separate zones these are the water producing bouse formation in the lower valley metzger et al 1973 and a fine grained lacustrine silt clay layer underlying the upper valley that acts as an aquitard the bouse formation is a pliocene marine and estuarine sequence composed of limestone clay silt and sand owen joyce et al 2000 well logs suggest its surface is flat stone 2006 worleyparsons 2009 however the location of the western boundary of bouse is not entirely clear it is not noted west of desert center gei 2010 a miocene fanglomerate aquifer unconformably underlies the bouse but their interface is indistinct shrubs and other specialized desert plants are most abundant on the valley floor associated with alluvial fans and washes fig 3 b shows a picture at the foot of an alluvial fan the productive aquifers are the unconfined alluvium in the upper basin and the bouse formation in the lower basin the use of this information in the model is described in section 2 3 2 2 2 in situ measurements besides the five regular meteorological stations in the basin two new stations have been installed recently with soil moisture probes these include two soil climate analysis network scan stations near desert center and ford dry lake fig 2 a soil moisture data have been collected at depths of 5 10 20 and 50 cm below ground surface bgs at the scan stations since late 2011 a monitoring well cwv1 was completed in 2012 to 300 m bgs near the groundwater outflow of the basin to collect groundwater and geophysical data in separate aquifer intervals including natural gamma electric resistivity and sonic logs everett 2013 using a linear sonic transit time formulation corrected by gamma log based clay fraction data rmc 1990 the porosity at different depths of the well well records from usgs groundwater watch california department of water resources cadwr and well logs in eia reports were compiled for calibrating the groundwater flow model some of these wells have estimates of transmissivity and conductivity derived from pumping tests which were also utilized 2 3 surface subsurface processes modeling 2 3 1 paws clm the process based adaptive watershed simulator coupled to the community land model paws clm is a comprehensive and computationally efficient model representing the whole land phase of the hydrologic cycle ji and shen 2018 niu et al 2017 2014 shen et al 2016 2014 2013 shen and phanikumar 2010 and reactive transport niu and phanikumar 2015 on a rectangular grid fig 4 a clm4 0 is a comprehensive community shared land surface process model describing water carbon nitrogen energy and other cycles oleson et al 2010 in our coupling clm predicts the surface energy vapor and carbon transfers between land and atmosphere it solves soil temperature snow freeze thaw condensation sublimation photosynthesis carbon allocation soil carbon decomposition and nitrogen cycling these biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes provide boundary conditions for the hydrologic calculations of the paws modules fig 4 b discussed in the next paragraph for this case we used clm4 0 but adopted a micro topographic surface ponding parameterization from clm4 5 as described later in this section the paws clm model provides recharge estimates that can be extracted and provided to the groundwater model calibration package modflow pest as discussed in section 2 4 modflow pest can then provide calibrated k fields back to paws clm however for this study this feedback was not employed hydrologic processes including soil water groundwater surface water and multi way exchanges are provided by paws the soil hydrology module in clm was replaced with its paws counterpart shen et al 2014 2013 and the clm soil water storage was deactivated paws solves 2d overland flow channel flow vertical soil water flow and quasi 3d saturated groundwater flow the overland flow is governed by the diffusive wave equation soil water in the unsaturated zone is governed by the 1d richards equation while groundwater is governed by the saturated confined or unconfined flow equation paws also describes dynamical multi way exchanges between surface water soil groundwater and channel compartments mass conservation is enforced paws has been verified by comparison with analytical solutions and other full 3d models maxwell et al 2014 in addition paws clm deployable globally has satisfactorily reproduced a wide variety of field observations including streamflow groundwater depths leaf area index evapotranspiration soil moisture and temperature and water storage ji et al 2015 pau et al 2016 riley and shen 2014 given that the model has been described in previous papers here we highlight the processes relevant to desert recharge and the specific questions posed we have accounted for three possible recharge sources from paws clm to be passed to modflow pest 1 run on infiltration also called leakance from the overland flow in the washes qog 2 direct soil column recharge r and 3 mountain front subsurface flow qmsub another theoretically possible recharge mechanism is the leakage from the colorado river but because of the groundwater boundary configuration section 2 4 1 and the position of the river in the most downstream part of the domain it has little influence on the simulated recharge in the valley to determine leakance surface water is divided into flow and ponding domains which are two conceptualized storage compartments in the same grid cell the ponding domain exchanges vertically with the soil column while the flow domain flows laterally between grid cells the ponding domain contributes runoff to the flow domain on the other hand if the flow domain has enough water depth water can propagate into the ponding domain and infiltrate through the soil matrix the flow direction and velocity of the flow domain are determined automatically as governed by the 2d diffusive wave equation the flow domain is conceptualized to concentrate in the lowest part of the grid cell in a fraction of the cell termed fw following a micro topographic parameterization in clm4 5 oleson et al 2013 fw is estimated as f w 1 2 1 e r f h f σ m 2 σ m β σ m a x 1 η η where hf is the flow domain water depth β is the slope σmax and η are parameters the flow domain may exchange with the groundwater using a darcy type leakance concept gunduz and aral 2005 i e q b k b h f d min 2 d when hf 0 where kb is the leakance conductivity and d is the depth to the water table in most of the chuckwalla valley because the groundwater table is very deep this formulation amounts to a vertical hydraulic gradient of one free drainage kb is tied to the saturated conductivity of the soil and thus the leakance is adjusted during the calibration at the same time evaporation of the flow domain water occurs at a potential rate estimated by the penman monteith equation scaled by fw evaporation takes place before leakance in the model thus if evaporation is strong enough there will be no leakance as noted earlier we take the 1d richards equation to model vertical soil water flow which extends from the ground surface to the bottom of the unconfined aquifer the saturated groundwater flow solver calculates lateral flow and supplies a source term to the soil layers shen and phanikumar 2010 in this basin with the exception of some dry lake beds the groundwater table is so deep that most of the soil water flow is similar to a free drainage boundary condition the many years required for recharge to reach the water table in this basin is a major practical obstacle therefore we recorded the flux that travels downward through the cell interface five meters bgs as the direct soil column recharge r that eventually reaches the water table while at local scales there may be discontinuous clay layers that impede vertical flow we are concerned with large scale long term average fluxes the mountain front subsurface recharge qmsub is added as a source term to the modflow model for the valley aquifer as discussed earlier on the mountains there is only a 30 cm soil layer as water infiltrates into the mountain soil and accumulates above the bedrock it can flow laterally in this layer in the model as governed by the 2d saturated groundwater flow equation as the water flows from the mountainous region into the valley it is treated as the mountain front subsurface recharge while lateral flow occurs the water is at the same time drawn to the surface due to capillary pressure and evaporation in general k estimated through the modflow pest calibration can be fed to paws clm in an iterative loop the dashed line in fig 4 b however in our case the groundwater is very deep in most regions so this coupling is weak using different k fields in paws clm makes little difference in the valley floor 2 3 2 configurations of the numerical models for domain discretization of the paws clm model we use an 800 800 m2 horizontal grid size for the area shown in fig 2 a forty vertical layers which are exponentially finer near the surface span the unsaturated zone between the ground surface and top of the confined aquifer we fitted a linear model to the sonic porosity data to set porosity θ s as a function of depth as described in shen et al 2014 we incorporated a 30 m resolution digital elevation model land use data and nationally maintained weather station data along with our in situ meteorological stations weather data from january 1 2002 to december 31 2016 were used to drive the paws clm model to spin up the model we first cycled it three times through the forcing data from 2002 to 2016 then we extracted simulated recharge from 2006 to 2016 to be used in modflow which was assumed to continue from the end of 2016 two layers of aquifers separated by an aquitard are represented in our model the alluvium is the upper unconfined layer and the bouse formation intermixed with fanglomerate is the underlying confined layer we pieced together multiple sources of information including borehole data well logs and gravity based surveys to obtain a consistent hydrostratigraphic framework for describing the valley subsurface fig 5 shows the depth to the basement rock i e the bottom of the confined aquifer layer resulting from this fusion of information as described below for the second layer a buried ridge drawn in fig 5 is set as the rough western boundary of the bouse formation this ridge separates the upper and lower chuckwalla valleys in the lower valley we assumed a constant top elevation for the confined layer bouse since as a marine estuarine formation the bouse is observed to have a flat surface in the lower valley the alluvium aquifer has a maximum thickness of 165 m and the bouse 950 m in the upper valley there is no clear divide between the alluvium and the lacustrine silt clay layer nor is there detailed data coverage therefore a constant thickness of 90 m was assumed for the top alluvium layer this value was obtained from geophysical surveys along a transect gei 2010 with respect to the bottom of the confined aquifer layer east of the divide we constructed the bottom of the bouse fanglomerate layer in the lower basin by combining gravity modeling gei 2010 using bouguer gravity data mariano et al 1986 and well depths reaching the bedrock appendix 1 in worleyparsons 2009 west of the buried ridge the bedrock map was reproduced from fig 6 of appendix c in gei 2010 which is estimated by bouguer gravity from geopentech these data show that there are several pockets in the central part of the valley where the bouse fanglomerate is very deep 1000 m forming bowl like contours however because water in the deep part of the bowls does not participate in regional groundwater flow we assumed a maximum depth of 1000 m later in this paper we report the recharge inside a water mass balance mask fig 2 b this is different from the watershed boundary in that some corner regions in the topographic basin are excluded from this mask although all the simulated recharge in the paws clm model domain was extracted and provided to modflow pest the recharge in excluded areas has little impact on the groundwater level in the valley and thus should not be considered when reporting water budgets some of these regions could have a small groundwater exchange with adjacent valleys we tracked the inflow from the pinto basin which was the only basin suspected to have significant input the agricultural region in the east and the pinto valley in the northwest are not included in the calibrated groundwater flow model because fixed head boundaries were used as noted earlier the underflow through the southwest boundary was estimated to be minor in the previous report godfrey et al 2012 and thus was not modeled for ordinary paws clm simulations the channel network can be extracted from a stream network dataset such as the national hydrography dataset shen et al 2014 or derived from the flow network niu et al 2017 then the overland flow and groundwater contribute to the streamflow however in the study basin the only river with a significant amount of flow time is the colorado river at the eastern boundary which has hydraulic connections to the local aquifers all other flow paths are ephemeral washes these washes are very small in width and no data can comprehensively describe them thus these flow paths were modeled as overland flow which is naturally driven by topographic convergence 2 3 3 soil parameter adjustment the van genuchten 1980 water retention formula is written as s θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n 1 n where s is relative saturation ψ is the pressure head θ is the moisture content θ r is the residual moisture content and θ s is the saturated moisture content porosity calibrated soil parameters are α n θ r and θ s the unsaturated vertical conductivity at the relative saturation s is calculated by kz s kss λ 1 1 s n n 1 n 1 n 2 where the saturated conductivity ks and the parameter λ are also calibrated we manually adjusted these parameters on a trial and error basis by matching the daily simulated soil moisture with climate forcing from nationally maintained weather stations as shown in fig 2 to the in situ measurements at two scan sites between nov 2011 and feb 2016 the parameters were estimated separately for the desert center site which represents the alluvial deposit soil and the ford dry lake which represents the dry lake playa the calibrated parameters are applied to the different zones in the paws clm simulation we tried to match not only the moisture peaks but also interpeak minima after suitable adjustment factors multipliers and additions were found we applied the parameters to their respective soil zones across different layers all parameters except residual moisture content were kept uniform 2 4 calibration of groundwater conductivity using modflow pest although paws clm already contains a groundwater model we utilized the modflow pest package doherty 2003 tonkin and doherty 2009 to calibrate the k field because it provides greater flexibility for representing a heterogeneous k field essentially this package allows users to insert scattered pilot points whose conductivity values are the parameters to be adjusted by the pest algorithm these pilot points provide the handles for enforcing parameter changes as well as spatial relationships the conductivity field in the rest of the domain is interpolated from the calibrated values at the pilot points based on the spatial relationship in terms of the spatial relationships both kriging and inverse distance weighting idw with different options e g ordinary or simple kriging different methods of idw can be specified as models representing geostatistical constraints these constraints are implemented in the form of regularization terms i e a penalty term to the k values so these values do not deviate significantly from what is inferred from the geostatistical model for kriging the empirical variogram needs to be specified a priori in contrast the parameters in idw can be estimated along with the k field since we have a very limited set of known k estimates which prevented us from building an a priori variogram we employed idw and allowed estimation of the appropriate idw parameters because of the limited number of parameters idw based calibration always converged normally for an integrated hydrologic model like paws clm the parameter sets are only adjusted by applying a multiplier that is the spatial heterogeneity is preserved and all conductivity values are multiplied by or added to a constant the newly proposed framework allows the calibration of a spatially distributed k field with imposed geostatistical constraints it should be possible with much additional work to implement pest directly within paws and completely avoid modflow however here we used a soft coupling approach that is more generic in that either paws or pest may be replaced by the modeler s choosing the present approach is also simpler and can be carried out by practitioners and researchers paws and clm are integrated at the source code level while recharge from paws clm was extracted from its outputs and provided as input files to the modflow model fig 4 a 2 layer modflow model of the chuckwalla basin was set up for the valley portion of the basin the modflow model had a horizontal grid spacing identical to paws clm modflow pest was used to calibrate the k fields to steady state water table levels in observation wells constraining the possible range of k is important for reducing overfitting which means k is adjusted unrealistically to fit the noise rather than the true signal for the top aquifer layer we added pumping test estimated k as known values and constrained k between 0 1 and 30 m day for the second layer understanding that pumping tests are rarer and most k estimates are within 1 5 4 m day we constrained the conductivity in the range of 0 1 6 m day it is possible that the groundwater k is spatially correlated with the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks however this correlation is not considered during our parameter adjustment because we employed a simple zone based method for applying ks incorporating this correlation into our procedure would add significant complexities into the overall scheme in addition as we will see later ks has a dampened influence compared to van genuchten parameters for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity 2 4 1 groundwater withdrawals and boundary conditions presently a prison and a resort pump about 7100 m3 day 2 6 mm3year 1 and 3684 m3 day 1 3 mm3year 1 from the bouse and the alluvium formation respectively worleyparsons 2010 fig 2 these sink terms have existed for over two decades and they have been included for calibrating the steady state model for future projections we added recently approved water users and the proposed emps project as shown in table 1 with water use data taken from their respective project eia reports the eastern boundary of the modflow model ends at the western perimeter of the palo verde mesa agricultural zone palo verde valley where usgs well data are available to build a fixed head boundary condition to avoid modeling irrigation and withdrawals fig 2 b mountain boundaries of the modflow model are set as no flow boundary conditions but as discussed earlier mountain front subsurface flow into the valley is added as recharge the pinto basin connects to the chuckwalla basin through a thin sedimentary neck fig 2 b no groundwater observations in the pinto valley were readily available so we used an average k value there in paws clm and excluded it from calibration to reduce the number of parameters and overfitting paws simulated inflow from the pinto basin which varied across different perturbed simulations was added as a source term to the chuckwalla basin just as the paws model the underflow to the orocopia valley was assumed to be negligible in the modflow model 2 5 ensemble simulations model rejection and the dual model integration our goal of assembling an ensemble of simulations was not to estimate the probability distribution of withdrawal impacts but to put bounds on such impacts given large parametric uncertainties we first identified several key uncertain soil parameters table 3 for which preliminary experiments showed strong impacts on recharge we also tested a parameter describing vegetation interception of runoff but it was not found to be a sensitive parameter likely because most of the recharge runs off from mountains where there is little surface cover then we perturbed the parameters simultaneously using global multipliers to generate recharge maps ranging from high to low fig 1 higher recharge values lower the impact of pumping the calibrated soil parameters served as the base case 6 in these simulations for each recharge estimate we calibrated the model five times by assuming different but spatially constant initial k values initial values from 3 to 7 m day were used to seed the calibrations four tests were used to reject k fields 1 a field is rejected if the calibrated head has a significant bias from observations despite the calibration assessed using a z test of the mean of the residuals simulated minus observed groundwater head the residuals should have a zero mean i e a bias of nearly zero when the amount of recharge is in an approximately admissible range this is typically the easiest objective to achieve during the calibration for a bias will always produce a large sum of squared error a large bias could only mean the algorithm has truly failed to find an appropriate k field that could lower the error even with a large number of degrees of freedom a z test examines if the bias is large enough so that the residuals could not have come from a zero mean gaussian distribution with a specified variance for this variance to be lenient i e to use more relaxed rules for model rejection we used four times the variance from the best calibrated case 2 we conducted a chi squared test on the residual variance which detects if the variance is too large also using four times the variance from the best calibrated case when the residual variance was too large the calibrated head could show too much or too little variation compared to the observations typically resulting from an incorrect spatial distribution of recharge 3 we ran a regression test between elevation and residuals if residuals are significantly correlated to elevation there is a regional pattern to errors implying errors are spatially auto correlated and the residual independence assumption is violated this correlation results from regionally biased recharge which leads to overfitting during calibration 4 when the pest calibration overfits to observations it tends to introduce unrealistically large spatial variation in the k field in a small neighborhood to detect this issue a bi quadratic surface was fitted to the k field in order to calculate the standard deviation for the k residual from the surface cases with large standard deviation in k were rejected however as we shall see below in results and discussion no recharge field was rejected due to this criterion five calibrations were conducted for each recharge case shown in table 3 using different initial guesses of k to project future transient groundwater table changes arising from pumping we ran transient modflow models using extracted recharge maps from different scenarios as a constant input while transient pumping was applied according to the schedules in table 1 assuming 2017 was the starting year the spatial resolution of these projection runs was kept the same as the calibration runs these projections assumed that the long term averaged recharge would not change substantially in the future even though pumping would another issue with making future projections of pumping impact is that we also needed the aquifer storage properties but steady state calibrations do not constrain storage parameters we thus ran an ensemble of transient 24 year long simulations continuing from 2017 using different sets of storage parameters to examine their impact on groundwater sustainability we considered the plausible ranges of the specific yield of the alluvium sy and the specific storage of the lower layer ss for sy we tested 0 05 0 10 0 15 dimensionless a small value of 0 05 was estimated for desert center worleyparsons 2009 however other estimates place the value around 0 15 for ss earlier studies of aquifers in this area have bounded the range from 5 10 6 to 1 10 4 m 1 so three values were tested in this study 1 10 6 5 10 6 5 10 5 m 1 3 results 3 1 soil moisture comparisons after the soil parameters table 3 were adjusted the richards equation based paws clm model was able to match the soil moisture time series at both stations fig 6 the correlation coefficients reported in fig 6 were higher than those obtained in a midwest basin riley and shen 2014 at the desert center site the simulated soil moisture matched very well with the observations at 5 cm and 10 cm depths at 5 cm there was a slight underestimation of peaks while the minimum soil moisture was slightly higher at this site the 20 cm probe appeared to have malfunctioned it recorded moisture rises that were much larger than those detected at the surface therefore it is not shown here at 50 cm depth while the timing of the moisture wave was not completely correct the amplitude of seasonal fluctuation was similar between observed and simulated the interannual climb of soil moisture from 2012 to 2013 was correctly described by the model showing that a slow cumulative infiltration over the period of a year could be captured at ford dry lake peaks were similarly well captured the 20 cm probe also captured the peaks but the simulated moisture lagged behind the observed in the 2014 rain event the calibrated ks values are around 0 1 m day at both sites table 2 which is lower than the expected range for sandy soils this value is in the low range of the values reported for mojave desert soils which were measured between 0 07 and 350 m day for old and young soils respectively young et al 2004 however despite some large rainfall events the observed moisture content seldom rose above 0 15 and spent the majority of the time below 0 05 fig 6 therefore the unsaturated conductivity which can be orders of magnitude lower than ks played a more important role in limiting infiltration than ks hence the van genuchten parameters were more influential than ks for estimating infiltration and recharge their adjustment could have compensated for uncertainties in ks 3 2 assessing and rejecting perturbed simulations five of the recharge fields which were near either the high or low end of recharge rates from the simulations were rejected as a result of their inability to fit the groundwater head table 4 and fig 7 the most frequent criterion that caused rejection of the cases was the bias a z test between the mean of the observed and calibrated groundwater heads this test rejected all the cases for recharge 1 5 and 12 moreover every calibration case from recharge 1 5 and 12 was also rejected by more than one condition recharge estimates from simulations 1 through 5 simply called recharge 1 5 similarly below were rejected by all tests as they overestimated the groundwater head fig 8 suggesting that their values were too large in contrast recharge 12 underestimated the groundwater head regardless of calibration suggesting that its value was too low as described in section 2 5 we implemented relaxed rejection criteria for three statistical tests using a confidence level of 2 and an assumed variance that is four times that of the best calibrated field var min from recharge 10 realization 2 simulation 11 case 5 was a borderline case it was the only retained case from simulation 11 and it would have been rejected if we had used 2 25 times var min as our rejection criteria therefore we labelled 11 as unlikely we tried increasing the soil conductivity on the mountains by a factor of 2 in simulation 7 but these simulations were also rejected fig 8 presents the observed and calibrated groundwater head for some examples of accepted and rejected simulations the elevation regression test rejected some cases for recharge 6 through 10 the k field variance test by itself did not reject any cases using recharge generated by the default parameter set simulation 6 we found that the spatially distributed hydraulic head compared well with the observations fig 8 with only a few meters of difference at the maximum for each data point however for recharge 4 the groundwater head was always overestimated regardless of the calibration effort and the initial guess for k recharge 5 overestimated the head in the lower basin where the observed head is about 80 m in fig 8 simulation 11 case 2 on the other hand apparently underestimated the groundwater head suggesting too little recharge overall the magnitude and variation of k conformed to our knowledge of the area with recharge 6 the simulated groundwater contours fig 9 a were in agreement with trends shown in earlier eia worleyparsons 2010 the water table followed the topographic trend and descended from the northwest to the southeast showing a smaller gradient than the topographic slope the groundwater table had a larger gradient in the upper chuckwalla valley than in the lower due to the inflow from the pinto basin the gradient was small in the wide valley floors due to little recharge in the valley floor but larger in the corridor that connects the upper and lower valleys fig 2 a shows only two groundwater wells in the corridor as a result this part of the model domain was not well constrained this pattern resulted from small calibrated k values at the corridor and larger k in the main valleys especially toward the eastern boundary the calibrated k field was mostly smooth fig 9 b except for a small high conductivity zone in the north central corner 3 3 water balance of the basin under uncertainty since most of the calibrations with recharge 11 were rejected and only one was narrowly retained we took the average recharge value of 10 and 11 as the lower bound estimate of total inflow recharge cross valley underflow which was 3 07 mm year 8 8 mm3year 1 the upper bound of our inflow estimate was 4 99 mm year 14 2 mm3year 1 taken from recharge 6 our estimates ranged from 3 4 to 5 6 of precipitation our lower bound value is close to the high range extrapolated estimates from the national park service while our upper bound estimate is similar to the maxey eakin based estimates from previous eia ferc 2012 godfrey et al 2012 in the literature recharge estimates in arid and semi arid basins in the southern mojave ranged from 3 7 of precipitation stonestrom et al 2007 reported values in nearby basins ranged from 2 8 5 2 whitt and jonker in cgb 2004 down to 1 1 nishikawa et al 2005 simulated recharge from the default case was focused in ephemeral washes and alluvial fans on mountain fringes fig 10 a note that the largest recharge occurred along washes in annotated regions a and b which agrees with the vegetation pattern seen from satellite images in fig 3 c at the mountain edges we note mostly positive recharge due to run on infiltration of overland flow running off the mountains then infiltrating through the soils of the alluvial fan either via flow domain leakance or infiltration of backfilled water through the soil matrix backfill occurs when water level in the conceptualized flow compartment is higher than that in the ponding compartment after large storms as runoff passes through the alluvial fans water could leak via the overland flow channel as qog or flood the ponding domain and infiltrate as soil column recharge section 2 3 1 the thick sediment underneath the alluvial fans provided more volume for storage and infiltration however there were also some negative values that resulted from groundwater return flow from the thin mountain soils there was also negative recharge near ford dry lake near the location of the fdl site in fig 2 a where groundwater emerges and evaporates away qmsub the lateral groundwater flow via the thin soils on the mountains took place exclusively at the feet of mountains fig 10 b the magnitude of qmsub appeared much smaller than the total recharge this flux turned out to play a minor role due to the limited thickness of the simulated mountain soils 3 4 projections of the impacts of pumping on groundwater sustainability recharge estimates from the retained simulations and their respective calibrated k fields were used to estimate drawdown in response to the pumping due to new solar plants at the emps site the largest drawdown occurred at the end of the initial fill period and had a range of 8 to 11 m when sy 0 05 figs 11 a and 12 without rejection of the overfitted simulated recharge rates this range would have been 7 15 3 m the reduction of uncertainty depended on the location at some water user sites emps and desert sunlight fig 11 a and b the possible range of drawdown has been significantly narrowed however at another site genesis figs 11 c the model rejection did not greatly reduce the uncertainty since there were fewer groundwater observations to constrain the model around this site at emps with sy 0 05 the water table declined by around 3 m within one year after the initial fill phase heavy pumping induced a large hydraulic gradient and a deep cone of depression once initial fill pumping ceased the large aquifer transmissivity allowed groundwater flow to rapidly fill the cone the water table then gradually declined during the project s refill phase after the pumping at the emps site was stopped the water table recovered 4 m in one year and after 20 years of simulation the water table recovered to 6 7 m below initial values according to this trajectory the system may appear to recover quickly from the assumed pumping but the large initial recovery speed does not imply that it can return to pristine conditions if there is a boom of new water users groundwater levels will not be sustainable fig 12 illustrates the effect of sy on groundwater drawdown as a result of pumping aquifer drawdown was more sensitive to the assumption of sy than the recharge employed fig 12 which highlights the importance of obtaining more accurate estimates of sy however the drawdown was not sensitive to specific storage ss in the range tested because the unconfined aquifer has much large storage hence the results from the ss sensitivity tests are not shown here to the west of desert center the first aquifer layer with a thickness of approximately 13 m dried after pumping recharge 6 was the highest accepted recharge rate while recharge 10 which resulted in a deeper cone of depression was the lowest accepted recharge if as in conventional methods we had assumed a uniformly distributed recharge before calibrating k errors would be introduced into different parts of the basin even with the same total recharge the uniform recharge tended to overestimate the groundwater head in the lower basin even for recharge 10 fig 13 a and b while the root mean square error was not very high the resulting k fields had a higher local variation using a uniform recharge had spatially heterogeneous impacts on drawdown the range of drawdown for retained simulations at emps was larger than using a spatially distributed recharge while the opposite was true at the genesis site fig 13 c f in addition at the genesis site using a uniform recharge led to an underestimation of pumping drawdown this difference results from the emps project being closer to the mountain front and wash recharge while genesis is located in the valley center far from the focus of recharge thus uniform recharge overestimated recharge near genesis a previous report utilized uniformly distributed recharge and pest to estimate k and the effects of pumping greer et al 2013 their calibration resulted in a very large variation in the k field and 30 m of drawdown fig 9 in their paper we believe such drawdowns were overestimated resulting from uniformly imposed recharge 4 discussion in the past it has been difficult to simultaneously incorporate both soil moisture and spatially distributed groundwater data within modeling recharge estimates cannot be directly constrained by groundwater head data because the spatial distribution of k can significantly influence the simulated groundwater head and we do not have an extensive prior estimate of k allowing the spatial calibration of k using pest increases the model s ability to adapt to recharge and compensate for some errors in recharge estimations nonetheless we can see that if recharge rates were too high or too low the resulting simulation would not be admissible even if calibration were allowed our method is therefore a more lenient way of reducing uncertainty which we adopted considering the challenges of modeling the desert the scarcity of available information and associated uncertainties our proposed dual model approach which should be applicable to other arid regions proves to be effective in identifying a plausible range of recharge values for mountainous desert regions if within a region there are recharge terms that are omitted or overestimated e g due to local clay impedance or leakance from a water conduit simulations with perturbed parameters can to some extent compensate for the error eventually only a recharge rate within a suitable range can pass the validation using groundwater observations the calibrated k field significantly influences possible drawdown and recovery which is also why the integration of groundwater observations is useful previous research on recharge in arid regions has heavily focused on infiltration beneath washes our study suggests that an overlooked area for potential recharge is the alluvial fans as immediate recipients of mountain runoff the fans and adjacent flat areas have the first chance to hold and infiltrate water while some chloride studies suggested little deep recharge under some fans stonestrom et al 2004 other field studies bull 1977 houston 2002 and modeling studies blainey and pelletier 2008 munévar and mariño 1999 found alluvial fans to be highly local but significant recharge areas our results suggest relevant data e g moisture or solute concentration under alluvial fans are needed to better verify modeling results water managers may find fast water table recovery to be reassuring and sometimes use it as a guideline to manage water however heavy pumping induces a steep cone of depression and thus a large hydraulic gradient that would be automatically followed by a rapid initial recovery after pumping cessation therefore the speed of recovery itself cannot guarantee sustainability because the water may not ultimately recover to pre pumping levels 5 conclusion we have proposed a novel dual model approach to provide a bounded estimate of the effects of groundwater pumping in a mountainous arid region an integrated surface subsurface hydrologic model can better approximate the locations and distribution of recharge while incorporation of groundwater head data is crucial for constraining the recharge rates our results indicate that conventional approaches assuming uniform recharge will distort the calibrated k field and yield very different projections given the estimated range of recharge groundwater levels will likely decrease across the chuckwalla basin over the life of new large scale water users once pumping ceases groundwater levels may initially recover quickly but ultimately not to pre pumping levels our results also highlight the importance of obtaining accurate estimates of aquifer storage parameters when evaluating the impacts of pumping 6 limitations this work should not be a replacement for detailed field measurements of recharge such as chemical and isotopic analysis of samples owing to the extensive amount of work needed to cover sporadic recharge completion of fieldwork can be challenging the present work provides one way of estimating recharge in this setting which is constrained by a model as well as groundwater observations and should be considered together with other estimates compared to the da approach the present approach does not provide a formal estimate of uncertainties da based approaches that enforce geostatistical constraints such as mps and variograms which have only recently been proposed could be

602,the quantification of recharge and trans valley underflow is needed in arid regions to estimate the impacts of new water withdrawals on the water table however for mountainous desert areas such estimates are highly challenging due to data scarcity heterogeneous soils and long residence times conventional assessment employs isolated groundwater models configured with simplified uniform estimates of recharge here we employed a data constrained surface subsurface process model to provide an ensemble of spatially distributed recharge and underflow estimates using perturbed parameters then the model independent parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification pest package was used to calibrate the aquifer hydraulic conductivity field in modflow for this ensemble and reject implausible recharge values this novel dual model approach broadly applicable to mountainous arid regions was designed to maximally exploit available data sources it can assimilate groundwater head observations reject unrealistic parameters and narrow the range of estimated drawdowns due to pumping we applied this approach to the chuckwalla basin in california usa to determine natural recharge simulated recharge concentrates along alluvial fans at the mountain fronts and ephemeral washes where run off water infiltrates if an evenly distributed recharge was employed as in conventional studies it would result in regional biases in estimated drawdown and larger uncertainty bounds we also note that the speed of groundwater recovery does not guarantee sustainability heavy pumping induces large hydraulic gradients that initially recover quickly when pumping is halted but the system may not ultimately recover to pre pumping levels 1 introduction for the allocation of groundwater resources in desert or semi desert areas the amount of groundwater recharge is an important quantity since it determines the amount of groundwater that can be renewably extracted estimating recharge in mountainous desert basins is especially challenging recharge there occurs through spatially sporadic infiltration flint et al 2004 of ephemeral runoff along many washes descending from those mountains cadwr 1979 and through associated alluvial fans wilson and guan 2004 to accurately measure this recharge requires dense long term collection of infiltration data in many ephemeral washes and playas for example infiltration was found underneath some washes in the mojave desert but not others izbicki et al 2000 such fieldwork and the measurements collected from it are highly valuable and should be strongly supported these measurements are however prohibitively expensive and often unavailable in our study area the chuckwalla basin of southwestern california to be described in section 2 there are no data that provide direct measurements of recharge conventionally groundwater systems have often been modeled with isolated groundwater models such as modflow harbaugh 2005 in that approach recharge needs to be estimated through independent means e g as a percentage of precipitation maxey and eakin 1949 or via precipitation runoff regression scanlon 2004 wilson and guan 2004 previous environmental impact assessments eias in the chuckwalla basin have used maxey eakin type recharge estimates assuming 2 10 of precipitation gei 2010 worleyparsons 2009 however this method has strong limitations because it does not consider the location and mechanism of recharge maurer and berger 2006 additionally using water balance methods even small errors in evapotranspiration estimates can result in large percentage errors in recharge large scale land surface models such as the community land model fan et al 2013 and pcr globwb sutanudjaja et al 2017 are also sometimes employed to estimate recharge but they typically do not have the detailed processes needed to describe desert mountain front recharge physically based integrated hydrologic models e g gsflow markstrom et al 2008 tian et al 2015 hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2006 parflow munévar and mariño 1999 and paws shen et al 2016 shen and phanikumar 2010 calculate recharge as an internal flux adapted properly for arid mountainous domains they can serve as practical tools for recharge estimation however the chosen model must provide physically based descriptions of the coupling between surface water run on infiltration and groundwater this is because hillslope infiltration and ephemeral channel percolation are coupled processes controlling the partition of water into soil infiltration channel percolation and streamflow yield schreiner mcgraw and vivoni 2018 note also that a joint estimation of recharge and the aquifer hydraulic conductivity field based on groundwater data is typically not a robust approach because it has been shown to require a large amount of groundwater head data knowling and werner 2016 or sufficient prior knowledge erdal and cirpka 2016 integrated hydrologic modeling also faces a range of challenges including data scarcity in less inhabited desert areas first pedotransfer functions ptf wösten et al 2001 are often used to parameterize soil hydrologic functioning in integrated large scale models e g maxwell et al 2015 and mirus 2015 but desert soil properties differ greatly from what can be inferred from typical ptfs for example in desert areas we find closely packed interlocking rock fragments called desert pavement mcfadden et al 1987 or widely occurring near surface calcium carbonate formations called caliche these soils are hydraulically distinct from soils elsewhere with similar sand clay compositions and can vary substantially depending on age mirus et al 2009 young et al 2004 therefore uncertainty analysis is necessary second recharge that does occur can take decades to reach the deep water table requiring expensive long term simulations on the order of decades or even longer finally aquifer conductivity data are often scarce to estimate pumping drawdowns we need estimates of the regional aquifer conductivity k or transmissivity the product of conductivity and thickness in many desert or semi desert basins there are scattered groundwater observations that could be utilized to constrain the highly uncertain k field there might also be some locations with known k values estimated from pumping tests or lithologic estimates in these data scarce regions we should use all available information and existing tools to calibrate the spatially heterogeneous k field e g using pest doherty 2003 tonkin and doherty 2009 pest is a model independent parameter estimation package that can work with highly parameterized models by exploring covariance structures it can be challenging to fully integrate varied sources of information e g groundwater head soil moisture and pumping test data to constrain integrated modeling while also considering the inherent uncertainties one potential approach is data assimilation da e g ensemble kalman filtering which updates model states and parameters based on estimating a covariance matrix using ensemble members da is a powerful approach that can assimilate multiple data sources but most applications so far have involved only a few parameters such as the conductivity value for a few different zones in a model e g rasmussen et al 2015 2016 and zhang et al 2015 2016 by default da does not impose geostatistical constraints such as spatial auto correlation more recent research has incorporated da with multi point geostatistics mpg to identify subsurface preferential flow structures zovi et al 2017 but found that the addition of mpg conditioning did not improve their results researchers have also employed da to retrieve the k field from synthetic simulations pasetto et al 2015 xu and gómez hernández 2016 but the spatial autocorrelation length was assumed and not adjusted in addition such specialized techniques have only been tested in idealized hypothetical scenarios while real world cases often possess unique boundary and forcing conditions that are challenging to implement in real world cases with scarce k data but some hydraulic head observations it is often not practical to establish usable semi variograms the key research question we pose is how can we make plausible estimations of recharge ranges in a mountainous desert basin given scattered observations of soil moisture groundwater head and limited or uncertain hydrogeology knowledge owing to limited observations we did not attempt to estimate a probability distribution of the recharge but rather to put a bound on the estimate furthermore given uncertain parameters we want to know how the conditioning of the models on available information influences the estimated pumping drawdown in this paper we demonstrate the usefulness of a dual model approach to best exploit multiple sources of data for the purpose of putting bounds on natural recharge in the basin and constraining future projections of pumping effects it is possible that further research in da will better incorporate different forms of geostatistical constraints however here we take the simpler approach of coupling a process based model with a widely used parameter estimation package that can impose geospatial autocorrelation importantly the straightforward nature of the framework makes it more accessible to practitioners who may also wish to replace the hydrologic model and calibration procedures with ones of their own choosing 2 sites and methods we employed a data constrained integrated hydrologic model to provide recharge estimates for calibrating a groundwater model the sparsely inhabited study region poses significant challenges for modeling especially in terms of characterizing hydrogeology and soils groundwater and geologic data have not been systematically collected however scattered information can be found across multiple reports from resource reconnaissance mining operations and environmental impact analysis to assemble the model we needed to compile and integrate existing quantitative and qualitative knowledge as well as make some assumptions to be described in section 2 3 2 including a flat top for the one of the aquifer formations as described below given parameter uncertainties we ran an ensemble of simulations using a process based integrated hydrologic model paws clm section 2 3 1 recharge estimates were extracted from these simulations denoted by simulations 0 1 etc and were subsequently fed into modflow pest a parameter calibration package capable of estimating spatially distributed parameters the recharge values that could not adequately describe groundwater observations were rejected while those retained were used to make predictions fig 1 only the retained recharge and parameter sets were used to estimate the impacts of pumping in the following we first describe physiographic features of the basin and our field measurements then we describe how the model was assembled from raw information 2 1 basin physiographic properties we examine the chuckwalla basin fig 2 a 6712 km2 which is located west of the city of blythe near the colorado river in california generally within the mojave and sonoran deserts pumping activities have been proposed for new water users in this basin including solar energy projects and a pumped energy storage project table 1 the approved operations will collectively extract 2 3 106 m3year 1 from local aquifers on an ongoing basis additionally the eagle mountain pumped storage project emps is permitted to extract almost 1 107m3year 1 during the 4 year initial fill phase ferc 2012 we are interested in predicting the impacts of such pumping on the local aquifer the basin has a hot desert climate with average january and july temperatures of 4 c and 43 c respectively and an 18 year annual average rainfall of 95 mm there are no perennial water bodies within the basin about 30 of the basin is mountainous terrain rising abruptly from the valley floor generally the basin floor slopes gently downward from northwest to southeast physiographically there is an upper western and lower eastern portion of the chuckwalla valley proper with a subtle surface water divide between the palen western and ford dry lake eastern playas some groundwater underflow enters from the pinto valley basin in the northwest the orocopia valley basin to the southwest of the chuckwalla basin likely contributes small underflow because it is much smaller and receives a small amount of recharge godfrey et al 2012 the chuckwalla is otherwise a closed basin except along its eastern boundary with the palo verde valley and the colorado river metamorphic and igneous bedrock composing the surrounding mountains is assumed to be impervious worleyparsons 2009 the basin has complex soil configurations yet widely used soil surveys have poor coverage for this region ssurgo the most detailed soils survey available nationally contains only one soil type for most of the chuckwalla valley and mountains with no descriptions of soil thickness or water retention properties generally the mountains have considerable exposed bedrock with thin sandy soils and washes or alluvial drainages supplying sediment to the valley floor no data exist to describe the thickness of these soils but our field reconnaissance suggested an average of 30 cm in contrast the valley is mantled by much thicker soils and unconsolidated materials such as loamy sand alluvium with interlacing desert pavement fig 3 a coarse steep alluvial fans at the mountain feet where brush can grow fig 3 b and clay rich playas near the center usgs 1995 a satellite image of the upper basin with visible traits of the washes is provided in fig 3 c well logs indicate that the alluvium layer in the valley interbedded sands and gravels with discontinuous clay varies between 210 m and 366 m in thickness cadwr 1979 the water table can often be found in this layer depth to water table ranges from 150 m near desert center to 6 4 m near palen dry lake where groundwater may emerge and slowly evaporate with respect to the geology beneath the alluvium and above the bedrock the valley can be roughly divided into two separate zones these are the water producing bouse formation in the lower valley metzger et al 1973 and a fine grained lacustrine silt clay layer underlying the upper valley that acts as an aquitard the bouse formation is a pliocene marine and estuarine sequence composed of limestone clay silt and sand owen joyce et al 2000 well logs suggest its surface is flat stone 2006 worleyparsons 2009 however the location of the western boundary of bouse is not entirely clear it is not noted west of desert center gei 2010 a miocene fanglomerate aquifer unconformably underlies the bouse but their interface is indistinct shrubs and other specialized desert plants are most abundant on the valley floor associated with alluvial fans and washes fig 3 b shows a picture at the foot of an alluvial fan the productive aquifers are the unconfined alluvium in the upper basin and the bouse formation in the lower basin the use of this information in the model is described in section 2 3 2 2 2 in situ measurements besides the five regular meteorological stations in the basin two new stations have been installed recently with soil moisture probes these include two soil climate analysis network scan stations near desert center and ford dry lake fig 2 a soil moisture data have been collected at depths of 5 10 20 and 50 cm below ground surface bgs at the scan stations since late 2011 a monitoring well cwv1 was completed in 2012 to 300 m bgs near the groundwater outflow of the basin to collect groundwater and geophysical data in separate aquifer intervals including natural gamma electric resistivity and sonic logs everett 2013 using a linear sonic transit time formulation corrected by gamma log based clay fraction data rmc 1990 the porosity at different depths of the well well records from usgs groundwater watch california department of water resources cadwr and well logs in eia reports were compiled for calibrating the groundwater flow model some of these wells have estimates of transmissivity and conductivity derived from pumping tests which were also utilized 2 3 surface subsurface processes modeling 2 3 1 paws clm the process based adaptive watershed simulator coupled to the community land model paws clm is a comprehensive and computationally efficient model representing the whole land phase of the hydrologic cycle ji and shen 2018 niu et al 2017 2014 shen et al 2016 2014 2013 shen and phanikumar 2010 and reactive transport niu and phanikumar 2015 on a rectangular grid fig 4 a clm4 0 is a comprehensive community shared land surface process model describing water carbon nitrogen energy and other cycles oleson et al 2010 in our coupling clm predicts the surface energy vapor and carbon transfers between land and atmosphere it solves soil temperature snow freeze thaw condensation sublimation photosynthesis carbon allocation soil carbon decomposition and nitrogen cycling these biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes provide boundary conditions for the hydrologic calculations of the paws modules fig 4 b discussed in the next paragraph for this case we used clm4 0 but adopted a micro topographic surface ponding parameterization from clm4 5 as described later in this section the paws clm model provides recharge estimates that can be extracted and provided to the groundwater model calibration package modflow pest as discussed in section 2 4 modflow pest can then provide calibrated k fields back to paws clm however for this study this feedback was not employed hydrologic processes including soil water groundwater surface water and multi way exchanges are provided by paws the soil hydrology module in clm was replaced with its paws counterpart shen et al 2014 2013 and the clm soil water storage was deactivated paws solves 2d overland flow channel flow vertical soil water flow and quasi 3d saturated groundwater flow the overland flow is governed by the diffusive wave equation soil water in the unsaturated zone is governed by the 1d richards equation while groundwater is governed by the saturated confined or unconfined flow equation paws also describes dynamical multi way exchanges between surface water soil groundwater and channel compartments mass conservation is enforced paws has been verified by comparison with analytical solutions and other full 3d models maxwell et al 2014 in addition paws clm deployable globally has satisfactorily reproduced a wide variety of field observations including streamflow groundwater depths leaf area index evapotranspiration soil moisture and temperature and water storage ji et al 2015 pau et al 2016 riley and shen 2014 given that the model has been described in previous papers here we highlight the processes relevant to desert recharge and the specific questions posed we have accounted for three possible recharge sources from paws clm to be passed to modflow pest 1 run on infiltration also called leakance from the overland flow in the washes qog 2 direct soil column recharge r and 3 mountain front subsurface flow qmsub another theoretically possible recharge mechanism is the leakage from the colorado river but because of the groundwater boundary configuration section 2 4 1 and the position of the river in the most downstream part of the domain it has little influence on the simulated recharge in the valley to determine leakance surface water is divided into flow and ponding domains which are two conceptualized storage compartments in the same grid cell the ponding domain exchanges vertically with the soil column while the flow domain flows laterally between grid cells the ponding domain contributes runoff to the flow domain on the other hand if the flow domain has enough water depth water can propagate into the ponding domain and infiltrate through the soil matrix the flow direction and velocity of the flow domain are determined automatically as governed by the 2d diffusive wave equation the flow domain is conceptualized to concentrate in the lowest part of the grid cell in a fraction of the cell termed fw following a micro topographic parameterization in clm4 5 oleson et al 2013 fw is estimated as f w 1 2 1 e r f h f σ m 2 σ m β σ m a x 1 η η where hf is the flow domain water depth β is the slope σmax and η are parameters the flow domain may exchange with the groundwater using a darcy type leakance concept gunduz and aral 2005 i e q b k b h f d min 2 d when hf 0 where kb is the leakance conductivity and d is the depth to the water table in most of the chuckwalla valley because the groundwater table is very deep this formulation amounts to a vertical hydraulic gradient of one free drainage kb is tied to the saturated conductivity of the soil and thus the leakance is adjusted during the calibration at the same time evaporation of the flow domain water occurs at a potential rate estimated by the penman monteith equation scaled by fw evaporation takes place before leakance in the model thus if evaporation is strong enough there will be no leakance as noted earlier we take the 1d richards equation to model vertical soil water flow which extends from the ground surface to the bottom of the unconfined aquifer the saturated groundwater flow solver calculates lateral flow and supplies a source term to the soil layers shen and phanikumar 2010 in this basin with the exception of some dry lake beds the groundwater table is so deep that most of the soil water flow is similar to a free drainage boundary condition the many years required for recharge to reach the water table in this basin is a major practical obstacle therefore we recorded the flux that travels downward through the cell interface five meters bgs as the direct soil column recharge r that eventually reaches the water table while at local scales there may be discontinuous clay layers that impede vertical flow we are concerned with large scale long term average fluxes the mountain front subsurface recharge qmsub is added as a source term to the modflow model for the valley aquifer as discussed earlier on the mountains there is only a 30 cm soil layer as water infiltrates into the mountain soil and accumulates above the bedrock it can flow laterally in this layer in the model as governed by the 2d saturated groundwater flow equation as the water flows from the mountainous region into the valley it is treated as the mountain front subsurface recharge while lateral flow occurs the water is at the same time drawn to the surface due to capillary pressure and evaporation in general k estimated through the modflow pest calibration can be fed to paws clm in an iterative loop the dashed line in fig 4 b however in our case the groundwater is very deep in most regions so this coupling is weak using different k fields in paws clm makes little difference in the valley floor 2 3 2 configurations of the numerical models for domain discretization of the paws clm model we use an 800 800 m2 horizontal grid size for the area shown in fig 2 a forty vertical layers which are exponentially finer near the surface span the unsaturated zone between the ground surface and top of the confined aquifer we fitted a linear model to the sonic porosity data to set porosity θ s as a function of depth as described in shen et al 2014 we incorporated a 30 m resolution digital elevation model land use data and nationally maintained weather station data along with our in situ meteorological stations weather data from january 1 2002 to december 31 2016 were used to drive the paws clm model to spin up the model we first cycled it three times through the forcing data from 2002 to 2016 then we extracted simulated recharge from 2006 to 2016 to be used in modflow which was assumed to continue from the end of 2016 two layers of aquifers separated by an aquitard are represented in our model the alluvium is the upper unconfined layer and the bouse formation intermixed with fanglomerate is the underlying confined layer we pieced together multiple sources of information including borehole data well logs and gravity based surveys to obtain a consistent hydrostratigraphic framework for describing the valley subsurface fig 5 shows the depth to the basement rock i e the bottom of the confined aquifer layer resulting from this fusion of information as described below for the second layer a buried ridge drawn in fig 5 is set as the rough western boundary of the bouse formation this ridge separates the upper and lower chuckwalla valleys in the lower valley we assumed a constant top elevation for the confined layer bouse since as a marine estuarine formation the bouse is observed to have a flat surface in the lower valley the alluvium aquifer has a maximum thickness of 165 m and the bouse 950 m in the upper valley there is no clear divide between the alluvium and the lacustrine silt clay layer nor is there detailed data coverage therefore a constant thickness of 90 m was assumed for the top alluvium layer this value was obtained from geophysical surveys along a transect gei 2010 with respect to the bottom of the confined aquifer layer east of the divide we constructed the bottom of the bouse fanglomerate layer in the lower basin by combining gravity modeling gei 2010 using bouguer gravity data mariano et al 1986 and well depths reaching the bedrock appendix 1 in worleyparsons 2009 west of the buried ridge the bedrock map was reproduced from fig 6 of appendix c in gei 2010 which is estimated by bouguer gravity from geopentech these data show that there are several pockets in the central part of the valley where the bouse fanglomerate is very deep 1000 m forming bowl like contours however because water in the deep part of the bowls does not participate in regional groundwater flow we assumed a maximum depth of 1000 m later in this paper we report the recharge inside a water mass balance mask fig 2 b this is different from the watershed boundary in that some corner regions in the topographic basin are excluded from this mask although all the simulated recharge in the paws clm model domain was extracted and provided to modflow pest the recharge in excluded areas has little impact on the groundwater level in the valley and thus should not be considered when reporting water budgets some of these regions could have a small groundwater exchange with adjacent valleys we tracked the inflow from the pinto basin which was the only basin suspected to have significant input the agricultural region in the east and the pinto valley in the northwest are not included in the calibrated groundwater flow model because fixed head boundaries were used as noted earlier the underflow through the southwest boundary was estimated to be minor in the previous report godfrey et al 2012 and thus was not modeled for ordinary paws clm simulations the channel network can be extracted from a stream network dataset such as the national hydrography dataset shen et al 2014 or derived from the flow network niu et al 2017 then the overland flow and groundwater contribute to the streamflow however in the study basin the only river with a significant amount of flow time is the colorado river at the eastern boundary which has hydraulic connections to the local aquifers all other flow paths are ephemeral washes these washes are very small in width and no data can comprehensively describe them thus these flow paths were modeled as overland flow which is naturally driven by topographic convergence 2 3 3 soil parameter adjustment the van genuchten 1980 water retention formula is written as s θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n 1 n where s is relative saturation ψ is the pressure head θ is the moisture content θ r is the residual moisture content and θ s is the saturated moisture content porosity calibrated soil parameters are α n θ r and θ s the unsaturated vertical conductivity at the relative saturation s is calculated by kz s kss λ 1 1 s n n 1 n 1 n 2 where the saturated conductivity ks and the parameter λ are also calibrated we manually adjusted these parameters on a trial and error basis by matching the daily simulated soil moisture with climate forcing from nationally maintained weather stations as shown in fig 2 to the in situ measurements at two scan sites between nov 2011 and feb 2016 the parameters were estimated separately for the desert center site which represents the alluvial deposit soil and the ford dry lake which represents the dry lake playa the calibrated parameters are applied to the different zones in the paws clm simulation we tried to match not only the moisture peaks but also interpeak minima after suitable adjustment factors multipliers and additions were found we applied the parameters to their respective soil zones across different layers all parameters except residual moisture content were kept uniform 2 4 calibration of groundwater conductivity using modflow pest although paws clm already contains a groundwater model we utilized the modflow pest package doherty 2003 tonkin and doherty 2009 to calibrate the k field because it provides greater flexibility for representing a heterogeneous k field essentially this package allows users to insert scattered pilot points whose conductivity values are the parameters to be adjusted by the pest algorithm these pilot points provide the handles for enforcing parameter changes as well as spatial relationships the conductivity field in the rest of the domain is interpolated from the calibrated values at the pilot points based on the spatial relationship in terms of the spatial relationships both kriging and inverse distance weighting idw with different options e g ordinary or simple kriging different methods of idw can be specified as models representing geostatistical constraints these constraints are implemented in the form of regularization terms i e a penalty term to the k values so these values do not deviate significantly from what is inferred from the geostatistical model for kriging the empirical variogram needs to be specified a priori in contrast the parameters in idw can be estimated along with the k field since we have a very limited set of known k estimates which prevented us from building an a priori variogram we employed idw and allowed estimation of the appropriate idw parameters because of the limited number of parameters idw based calibration always converged normally for an integrated hydrologic model like paws clm the parameter sets are only adjusted by applying a multiplier that is the spatial heterogeneity is preserved and all conductivity values are multiplied by or added to a constant the newly proposed framework allows the calibration of a spatially distributed k field with imposed geostatistical constraints it should be possible with much additional work to implement pest directly within paws and completely avoid modflow however here we used a soft coupling approach that is more generic in that either paws or pest may be replaced by the modeler s choosing the present approach is also simpler and can be carried out by practitioners and researchers paws and clm are integrated at the source code level while recharge from paws clm was extracted from its outputs and provided as input files to the modflow model fig 4 a 2 layer modflow model of the chuckwalla basin was set up for the valley portion of the basin the modflow model had a horizontal grid spacing identical to paws clm modflow pest was used to calibrate the k fields to steady state water table levels in observation wells constraining the possible range of k is important for reducing overfitting which means k is adjusted unrealistically to fit the noise rather than the true signal for the top aquifer layer we added pumping test estimated k as known values and constrained k between 0 1 and 30 m day for the second layer understanding that pumping tests are rarer and most k estimates are within 1 5 4 m day we constrained the conductivity in the range of 0 1 6 m day it is possible that the groundwater k is spatially correlated with the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks however this correlation is not considered during our parameter adjustment because we employed a simple zone based method for applying ks incorporating this correlation into our procedure would add significant complexities into the overall scheme in addition as we will see later ks has a dampened influence compared to van genuchten parameters for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity 2 4 1 groundwater withdrawals and boundary conditions presently a prison and a resort pump about 7100 m3 day 2 6 mm3year 1 and 3684 m3 day 1 3 mm3year 1 from the bouse and the alluvium formation respectively worleyparsons 2010 fig 2 these sink terms have existed for over two decades and they have been included for calibrating the steady state model for future projections we added recently approved water users and the proposed emps project as shown in table 1 with water use data taken from their respective project eia reports the eastern boundary of the modflow model ends at the western perimeter of the palo verde mesa agricultural zone palo verde valley where usgs well data are available to build a fixed head boundary condition to avoid modeling irrigation and withdrawals fig 2 b mountain boundaries of the modflow model are set as no flow boundary conditions but as discussed earlier mountain front subsurface flow into the valley is added as recharge the pinto basin connects to the chuckwalla basin through a thin sedimentary neck fig 2 b no groundwater observations in the pinto valley were readily available so we used an average k value there in paws clm and excluded it from calibration to reduce the number of parameters and overfitting paws simulated inflow from the pinto basin which varied across different perturbed simulations was added as a source term to the chuckwalla basin just as the paws model the underflow to the orocopia valley was assumed to be negligible in the modflow model 2 5 ensemble simulations model rejection and the dual model integration our goal of assembling an ensemble of simulations was not to estimate the probability distribution of withdrawal impacts but to put bounds on such impacts given large parametric uncertainties we first identified several key uncertain soil parameters table 3 for which preliminary experiments showed strong impacts on recharge we also tested a parameter describing vegetation interception of runoff but it was not found to be a sensitive parameter likely because most of the recharge runs off from mountains where there is little surface cover then we perturbed the parameters simultaneously using global multipliers to generate recharge maps ranging from high to low fig 1 higher recharge values lower the impact of pumping the calibrated soil parameters served as the base case 6 in these simulations for each recharge estimate we calibrated the model five times by assuming different but spatially constant initial k values initial values from 3 to 7 m day were used to seed the calibrations four tests were used to reject k fields 1 a field is rejected if the calibrated head has a significant bias from observations despite the calibration assessed using a z test of the mean of the residuals simulated minus observed groundwater head the residuals should have a zero mean i e a bias of nearly zero when the amount of recharge is in an approximately admissible range this is typically the easiest objective to achieve during the calibration for a bias will always produce a large sum of squared error a large bias could only mean the algorithm has truly failed to find an appropriate k field that could lower the error even with a large number of degrees of freedom a z test examines if the bias is large enough so that the residuals could not have come from a zero mean gaussian distribution with a specified variance for this variance to be lenient i e to use more relaxed rules for model rejection we used four times the variance from the best calibrated case 2 we conducted a chi squared test on the residual variance which detects if the variance is too large also using four times the variance from the best calibrated case when the residual variance was too large the calibrated head could show too much or too little variation compared to the observations typically resulting from an incorrect spatial distribution of recharge 3 we ran a regression test between elevation and residuals if residuals are significantly correlated to elevation there is a regional pattern to errors implying errors are spatially auto correlated and the residual independence assumption is violated this correlation results from regionally biased recharge which leads to overfitting during calibration 4 when the pest calibration overfits to observations it tends to introduce unrealistically large spatial variation in the k field in a small neighborhood to detect this issue a bi quadratic surface was fitted to the k field in order to calculate the standard deviation for the k residual from the surface cases with large standard deviation in k were rejected however as we shall see below in results and discussion no recharge field was rejected due to this criterion five calibrations were conducted for each recharge case shown in table 3 using different initial guesses of k to project future transient groundwater table changes arising from pumping we ran transient modflow models using extracted recharge maps from different scenarios as a constant input while transient pumping was applied according to the schedules in table 1 assuming 2017 was the starting year the spatial resolution of these projection runs was kept the same as the calibration runs these projections assumed that the long term averaged recharge would not change substantially in the future even though pumping would another issue with making future projections of pumping impact is that we also needed the aquifer storage properties but steady state calibrations do not constrain storage parameters we thus ran an ensemble of transient 24 year long simulations continuing from 2017 using different sets of storage parameters to examine their impact on groundwater sustainability we considered the plausible ranges of the specific yield of the alluvium sy and the specific storage of the lower layer ss for sy we tested 0 05 0 10 0 15 dimensionless a small value of 0 05 was estimated for desert center worleyparsons 2009 however other estimates place the value around 0 15 for ss earlier studies of aquifers in this area have bounded the range from 5 10 6 to 1 10 4 m 1 so three values were tested in this study 1 10 6 5 10 6 5 10 5 m 1 3 results 3 1 soil moisture comparisons after the soil parameters table 3 were adjusted the richards equation based paws clm model was able to match the soil moisture time series at both stations fig 6 the correlation coefficients reported in fig 6 were higher than those obtained in a midwest basin riley and shen 2014 at the desert center site the simulated soil moisture matched very well with the observations at 5 cm and 10 cm depths at 5 cm there was a slight underestimation of peaks while the minimum soil moisture was slightly higher at this site the 20 cm probe appeared to have malfunctioned it recorded moisture rises that were much larger than those detected at the surface therefore it is not shown here at 50 cm depth while the timing of the moisture wave was not completely correct the amplitude of seasonal fluctuation was similar between observed and simulated the interannual climb of soil moisture from 2012 to 2013 was correctly described by the model showing that a slow cumulative infiltration over the period of a year could be captured at ford dry lake peaks were similarly well captured the 20 cm probe also captured the peaks but the simulated moisture lagged behind the observed in the 2014 rain event the calibrated ks values are around 0 1 m day at both sites table 2 which is lower than the expected range for sandy soils this value is in the low range of the values reported for mojave desert soils which were measured between 0 07 and 350 m day for old and young soils respectively young et al 2004 however despite some large rainfall events the observed moisture content seldom rose above 0 15 and spent the majority of the time below 0 05 fig 6 therefore the unsaturated conductivity which can be orders of magnitude lower than ks played a more important role in limiting infiltration than ks hence the van genuchten parameters were more influential than ks for estimating infiltration and recharge their adjustment could have compensated for uncertainties in ks 3 2 assessing and rejecting perturbed simulations five of the recharge fields which were near either the high or low end of recharge rates from the simulations were rejected as a result of their inability to fit the groundwater head table 4 and fig 7 the most frequent criterion that caused rejection of the cases was the bias a z test between the mean of the observed and calibrated groundwater heads this test rejected all the cases for recharge 1 5 and 12 moreover every calibration case from recharge 1 5 and 12 was also rejected by more than one condition recharge estimates from simulations 1 through 5 simply called recharge 1 5 similarly below were rejected by all tests as they overestimated the groundwater head fig 8 suggesting that their values were too large in contrast recharge 12 underestimated the groundwater head regardless of calibration suggesting that its value was too low as described in section 2 5 we implemented relaxed rejection criteria for three statistical tests using a confidence level of 2 and an assumed variance that is four times that of the best calibrated field var min from recharge 10 realization 2 simulation 11 case 5 was a borderline case it was the only retained case from simulation 11 and it would have been rejected if we had used 2 25 times var min as our rejection criteria therefore we labelled 11 as unlikely we tried increasing the soil conductivity on the mountains by a factor of 2 in simulation 7 but these simulations were also rejected fig 8 presents the observed and calibrated groundwater head for some examples of accepted and rejected simulations the elevation regression test rejected some cases for recharge 6 through 10 the k field variance test by itself did not reject any cases using recharge generated by the default parameter set simulation 6 we found that the spatially distributed hydraulic head compared well with the observations fig 8 with only a few meters of difference at the maximum for each data point however for recharge 4 the groundwater head was always overestimated regardless of the calibration effort and the initial guess for k recharge 5 overestimated the head in the lower basin where the observed head is about 80 m in fig 8 simulation 11 case 2 on the other hand apparently underestimated the groundwater head suggesting too little recharge overall the magnitude and variation of k conformed to our knowledge of the area with recharge 6 the simulated groundwater contours fig 9 a were in agreement with trends shown in earlier eia worleyparsons 2010 the water table followed the topographic trend and descended from the northwest to the southeast showing a smaller gradient than the topographic slope the groundwater table had a larger gradient in the upper chuckwalla valley than in the lower due to the inflow from the pinto basin the gradient was small in the wide valley floors due to little recharge in the valley floor but larger in the corridor that connects the upper and lower valleys fig 2 a shows only two groundwater wells in the corridor as a result this part of the model domain was not well constrained this pattern resulted from small calibrated k values at the corridor and larger k in the main valleys especially toward the eastern boundary the calibrated k field was mostly smooth fig 9 b except for a small high conductivity zone in the north central corner 3 3 water balance of the basin under uncertainty since most of the calibrations with recharge 11 were rejected and only one was narrowly retained we took the average recharge value of 10 and 11 as the lower bound estimate of total inflow recharge cross valley underflow which was 3 07 mm year 8 8 mm3year 1 the upper bound of our inflow estimate was 4 99 mm year 14 2 mm3year 1 taken from recharge 6 our estimates ranged from 3 4 to 5 6 of precipitation our lower bound value is close to the high range extrapolated estimates from the national park service while our upper bound estimate is similar to the maxey eakin based estimates from previous eia ferc 2012 godfrey et al 2012 in the literature recharge estimates in arid and semi arid basins in the southern mojave ranged from 3 7 of precipitation stonestrom et al 2007 reported values in nearby basins ranged from 2 8 5 2 whitt and jonker in cgb 2004 down to 1 1 nishikawa et al 2005 simulated recharge from the default case was focused in ephemeral washes and alluvial fans on mountain fringes fig 10 a note that the largest recharge occurred along washes in annotated regions a and b which agrees with the vegetation pattern seen from satellite images in fig 3 c at the mountain edges we note mostly positive recharge due to run on infiltration of overland flow running off the mountains then infiltrating through the soils of the alluvial fan either via flow domain leakance or infiltration of backfilled water through the soil matrix backfill occurs when water level in the conceptualized flow compartment is higher than that in the ponding compartment after large storms as runoff passes through the alluvial fans water could leak via the overland flow channel as qog or flood the ponding domain and infiltrate as soil column recharge section 2 3 1 the thick sediment underneath the alluvial fans provided more volume for storage and infiltration however there were also some negative values that resulted from groundwater return flow from the thin mountain soils there was also negative recharge near ford dry lake near the location of the fdl site in fig 2 a where groundwater emerges and evaporates away qmsub the lateral groundwater flow via the thin soils on the mountains took place exclusively at the feet of mountains fig 10 b the magnitude of qmsub appeared much smaller than the total recharge this flux turned out to play a minor role due to the limited thickness of the simulated mountain soils 3 4 projections of the impacts of pumping on groundwater sustainability recharge estimates from the retained simulations and their respective calibrated k fields were used to estimate drawdown in response to the pumping due to new solar plants at the emps site the largest drawdown occurred at the end of the initial fill period and had a range of 8 to 11 m when sy 0 05 figs 11 a and 12 without rejection of the overfitted simulated recharge rates this range would have been 7 15 3 m the reduction of uncertainty depended on the location at some water user sites emps and desert sunlight fig 11 a and b the possible range of drawdown has been significantly narrowed however at another site genesis figs 11 c the model rejection did not greatly reduce the uncertainty since there were fewer groundwater observations to constrain the model around this site at emps with sy 0 05 the water table declined by around 3 m within one year after the initial fill phase heavy pumping induced a large hydraulic gradient and a deep cone of depression once initial fill pumping ceased the large aquifer transmissivity allowed groundwater flow to rapidly fill the cone the water table then gradually declined during the project s refill phase after the pumping at the emps site was stopped the water table recovered 4 m in one year and after 20 years of simulation the water table recovered to 6 7 m below initial values according to this trajectory the system may appear to recover quickly from the assumed pumping but the large initial recovery speed does not imply that it can return to pristine conditions if there is a boom of new water users groundwater levels will not be sustainable fig 12 illustrates the effect of sy on groundwater drawdown as a result of pumping aquifer drawdown was more sensitive to the assumption of sy than the recharge employed fig 12 which highlights the importance of obtaining more accurate estimates of sy however the drawdown was not sensitive to specific storage ss in the range tested because the unconfined aquifer has much large storage hence the results from the ss sensitivity tests are not shown here to the west of desert center the first aquifer layer with a thickness of approximately 13 m dried after pumping recharge 6 was the highest accepted recharge rate while recharge 10 which resulted in a deeper cone of depression was the lowest accepted recharge if as in conventional methods we had assumed a uniformly distributed recharge before calibrating k errors would be introduced into different parts of the basin even with the same total recharge the uniform recharge tended to overestimate the groundwater head in the lower basin even for recharge 10 fig 13 a and b while the root mean square error was not very high the resulting k fields had a higher local variation using a uniform recharge had spatially heterogeneous impacts on drawdown the range of drawdown for retained simulations at emps was larger than using a spatially distributed recharge while the opposite was true at the genesis site fig 13 c f in addition at the genesis site using a uniform recharge led to an underestimation of pumping drawdown this difference results from the emps project being closer to the mountain front and wash recharge while genesis is located in the valley center far from the focus of recharge thus uniform recharge overestimated recharge near genesis a previous report utilized uniformly distributed recharge and pest to estimate k and the effects of pumping greer et al 2013 their calibration resulted in a very large variation in the k field and 30 m of drawdown fig 9 in their paper we believe such drawdowns were overestimated resulting from uniformly imposed recharge 4 discussion in the past it has been difficult to simultaneously incorporate both soil moisture and spatially distributed groundwater data within modeling recharge estimates cannot be directly constrained by groundwater head data because the spatial distribution of k can significantly influence the simulated groundwater head and we do not have an extensive prior estimate of k allowing the spatial calibration of k using pest increases the model s ability to adapt to recharge and compensate for some errors in recharge estimations nonetheless we can see that if recharge rates were too high or too low the resulting simulation would not be admissible even if calibration were allowed our method is therefore a more lenient way of reducing uncertainty which we adopted considering the challenges of modeling the desert the scarcity of available information and associated uncertainties our proposed dual model approach which should be applicable to other arid regions proves to be effective in identifying a plausible range of recharge values for mountainous desert regions if within a region there are recharge terms that are omitted or overestimated e g due to local clay impedance or leakance from a water conduit simulations with perturbed parameters can to some extent compensate for the error eventually only a recharge rate within a suitable range can pass the validation using groundwater observations the calibrated k field significantly influences possible drawdown and recovery which is also why the integration of groundwater observations is useful previous research on recharge in arid regions has heavily focused on infiltration beneath washes our study suggests that an overlooked area for potential recharge is the alluvial fans as immediate recipients of mountain runoff the fans and adjacent flat areas have the first chance to hold and infiltrate water while some chloride studies suggested little deep recharge under some fans stonestrom et al 2004 other field studies bull 1977 houston 2002 and modeling studies blainey and pelletier 2008 munévar and mariño 1999 found alluvial fans to be highly local but significant recharge areas our results suggest relevant data e g moisture or solute concentration under alluvial fans are needed to better verify modeling results water managers may find fast water table recovery to be reassuring and sometimes use it as a guideline to manage water however heavy pumping induces a steep cone of depression and thus a large hydraulic gradient that would be automatically followed by a rapid initial recovery after pumping cessation therefore the speed of recovery itself cannot guarantee sustainability because the water may not ultimately recover to pre pumping levels 5 conclusion we have proposed a novel dual model approach to provide a bounded estimate of the effects of groundwater pumping in a mountainous arid region an integrated surface subsurface hydrologic model can better approximate the locations and distribution of recharge while incorporation of groundwater head data is crucial for constraining the recharge rates our results indicate that conventional approaches assuming uniform recharge will distort the calibrated k field and yield very different projections given the estimated range of recharge groundwater levels will likely decrease across the chuckwalla basin over the life of new large scale water users once pumping ceases groundwater levels may initially recover quickly but ultimately not to pre pumping levels our results also highlight the importance of obtaining accurate estimates of aquifer storage parameters when evaluating the impacts of pumping 6 limitations this work should not be a replacement for detailed field measurements of recharge such as chemical and isotopic analysis of samples owing to the extensive amount of work needed to cover sporadic recharge completion of fieldwork can be challenging the present work provides one way of estimating recharge in this setting which is constrained by a model as well as groundwater observations and should be considered together with other estimates compared to the da approach the present approach does not provide a formal estimate of uncertainties da based approaches that enforce geostatistical constraints such as mps and variograms which have only recently been proposed could be attempted in the future however in arid mountainous regions with scattered data sources there might be fresh new challenges such as nonconvergence issues acknowledgments we thank kristan culbert and

water saturated subsurface formations is of great importance to several scientists and environmental engineers the transport of colloids in water saturated formations is influenced by a number of factors including water velocity ionic strength ph solution chemistry formation type density and size of particles chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 scholl and harvey 1992 shellenberger and logan 2002 in case of biocolloids bacteria viruses additional factors such as growth chemotaxis and decay may also affect transport behavior ginn et al 2002 dense particles can be affected by gravity chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 flowers and hunt 2007 james and chrysikopoulos 2003 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2015 which may hinder or enhance their transport depending on the flow direction the flow direction in typical bench scale flow through experiments can be either upward to minimize air entrapment keller et al 2004 tan et al 1994 tong and johnson 2007 downward saiers et al 1994 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2015 xu et al 2006 or horizontal lee and chrysikopoulos 2002 syngouna et al 2017 which is representative of natural systems unfortunately the importance of flow direction in experimental studies is not always taken into account and some studies neglect to report it assuming that gravity and hydrodynamic effects are negligible basha and culligan 2010 however syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2016 reported that the attachment of viruses onto colloids was higher for downward flow rather than upward flow direction similarly basha and culligan 2010 observed that particle deposition was greater for upward flows rather than for downward flows suggesting that gravity clearly influences particle transport there are several models published in the literature that combine the classical advection dispersion equation with different types of kinetic attachment models most of these transport models assume that attachment follows either one site kinetics with forward and reverse terms or two site kinetics with reversible and irreversible attachment the forward rate of reversible attachment may represent deposition in secondary minimum fast deposition while the forward rate of irreversible attachment may represent deposition in primary minimum slow deposition tufenkji and elimelech 2005 the two site kinetics model has been employed in various studies basha and culligan 2010 compère et al 2001 harvey and garabedlan 1991 schijven et al 2002 tong and johnson 2006 yoon et al 2006 there are several one and three dimensional analytical or numerical models for colloid or biocolloid transport in literature anders and chrysikopoulos 2009 bradford et al 2011 harvey and garabedlan 1991 park et al 1992 sim and chrysikopoulos 1996 furthermore two site models which combine equilibrium and non equilibrium kinetic sorption cameron and klute 1977 with two region models van genuchten and wagenet 1989 that capture physical and chemichal non equilibrium processes have been published in the literature these models have been incorported in the software stanmod simunek et al 1999 van genuchten et al 2012 though there is a rather limited collection of mathematical models dealing with dense colloid transport flowers and hunt 2007 chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2015 and even a narrower collection of analytical models that account for attachment with two site kinetics basha and culligan 2010 the purpose of the current study is to present new analytical solutions to colloid transport models that account for attachment with two site kinetics instantaneous or broad pulse sources and non negligible gravity effects to our best of knowledge there are no analytical solutions available in the literature for mathematical two site models for dense colloids analytical models such as these may be a useful for the evaluation of conventional numerical models 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 colloid mathematical model with reversible attachment the transport of suspended colloid particles in one dimensional saturated homogeneous porous media with uniform flow accounting for combined nonequilibrium reversible and irreversible attachment onto the solid matrix along with gravity effects is governed by the following partial differential equation chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 1 c c t x t ρ b θ c c t x t d c

respect to the horizontal direction 90 β 90 see fig 1 the correction factor fs is expressed as follows wan et al 1995 4 f s b 0 67 b 0 93 ε where b b 1 is the average free settling segment length to the grain radius ratio and ε 0 ε 1 is an empirical correction factor that takes into account the effect of the grain surface note that granular porous media consisting of grains with smooth surfaces do not provide additional frictional resistance but only contribute to the tortuosity wan et al 1995 and the value of the fs coefficient can be set to fs 0 9 for simplicity purposes the average interstitial velocity u and the settling velocity us x can be replaced by their sum chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 5 u t o t u u s x the concentration of colloids attached onto the solid matrix cc is assumed to be a combination of reversibly c c r mc ms and irreversibly c c i mc ms attached colloids katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 6 c c c c r c c i consequently the accumulation term in eq 1 can be expressed as 7 ρ b θ c c t x t ρ b θ c c r t x t c c i t x t the reversible accumulation term is given by sim and chrysikopoulos 1998 1999 8 ρ b θ c c r t x t r c c r c c t x r c r c ρ b θ c c r t x where r c c r 1 t is the forward rate coefficient of colloid attachment onto the solid matrix and r c r c 1 t is the reverse rate coefficient of colloid detachment from the solid matrix the irreversible accumulation term is given by compère et al 2001 9 ρ b θ c c i t x t r c c i c c t x where r c c i is the forward rate coefficient of irreversible colloid attachment onto the solid matrix note that for both reversible and irreversible accumulation terms eqs 8 and 9 the rate of attachment is assumed to be linear blocking or ripening effects are neglected substituting eqs 5 and 7 9 in the colloid transport eq 1 yields the following partial differential equation 10 c c t x t d c 2 c c t x x 2 u t o t c c t x x r c c r r c c i c c t x r c r c ρ b θ c c r t x an expression for the

the condition 16 establishes that there is no initial concentration of colloids within the porous medium the downstream condition 17 preserves concentration continuity chrysikopoulos et al 1990b the upstream eqs 18 and 19 define the way colloids are introduced into the aquifer the condition 18 refers to a continuous source that provides constant concentration of colloids over a broad pulse which is a predefined time period tp sim and chrysikopoulos 1995 whereas eq 19 refers to instantaneous injection of colloids with total injected mass equal to min 3 analytical solutions 3 1 analytical

analytical solution for broad pulse source 23 and 24 was illustrated by fitting the experimental data collected by syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 who have conducted transport experiments with two clays kaolinite kga 1b and montmorillonite stx 1b in horizontal columns packed with glass beads under two different flow rates q 1 5 and 2 5 ml min the fitting of the experimental data was achieved with the autonomous multipurpose fitting software colloidfit katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2017 only the parameters dc r c c i and r c r c were fitted while the parameter value for r c c r was obtained from the literature vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 the fitted parameters along with the corresponding 95 confidence levels are listed in table 1 the experimental normalized breakthrough concentrations and the respective best fitted model simulations are presented in fig 2 for both flow rates considered here the analytical solution 23 and 24 successfully simulated the kga 1b and stx

colloid transport simulations were performed under vertical up vertical down and horizontal flow conditions for both instantaneous source 21 and broad pulse source 23 and 24 analytical solutions the colloids were assumed to be spherical with diameter dp 1 4 μm and density ρ p 2 2 10 3 kg cm3 additionally the restricted particle settling velocity of the dense colloids was estimated with eq 2 equal to us 6 68 10 3 cm min using μw 6 10 4 kg cm min ρ w 9 98 10 4 kg cm3 fs 0 9 wan et al 1995 and g 3 53 106 cm min2 all parameter values required for the simulations are listed in table 2 the simulated breakthrough curves are shown in fig 3 clearly vertical down flow leads to increased average velocity whereas vertical up flow leads to decreased average velocity compared to horizontal flow larger velocities allow faster exit of colloid particles from the porous medium the effects of gravity are more pronounced for the broad pulse source rather than the instantaneous source note that at later times t tp 6000 min colloid particle concentrations for the broad pulse source case are lower for down flow than up flow conditions to further illustrate the model sensitivity to the various model parameters numerous simulations were performed for several coefficient values for both broad pulse and instantaneous cases the simulations using the analytical solution for instantaneous source 21 are presented in fig 4 and for broad pulse source 23 and 24 are presented in fig 5 for each model parameter four simulations were conducted for a horizontal porous medium with length lx 30 cm the injected mass was min 1 mg for the instantaneous case whereas the source release time period for the broad pulse case was tp 6000 min all other required parameter values are listed in table 2 it is apparent from figs 4 and 5 that the simulations for both instantaneous and broad pulse source cases exhibit similar behavior colloid concentrations exhibit higher peaks as the values for parameters dc r c c r and r c c i decrease and higher peaks as the value of r c r c increases as expected lower values of the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient dc lead to reduced particle spreading which in turn leads to sharper concentration peaks slower breakthrough times and reduced late time concentrations see figs 4 a and 5 a similarly lower values of the rates r c c r and r c c i decrease colloid attachment on the solid matrix and consequently lead to higher concentration peaks see figs 4 b d 5 b and d finally higher values of the rate r c r c increase colloid detachment from the solid matrix and consequently cause higher colloid concentration peaks see figs 4 c and 5 c finally the analytical solutions developed in this study were compared against two software packages the first comparison was between the simplified one site reversible r c c i 0 1 min broad pulse model of this study for a horizontal column β 0ο utot 0 0333 cm min with the stanmod software package simunek et al 1999 van genuchten et al 2012 as illustrated in fig 6 a the second comparison was between the complete two site reversible and irreversible r c c i 0 0002 1 min broad pulse model of this study for a vertical column with flow in the vertical down direction β 90ο utot 0 04 cm min and the well known comsol multiphysics software package see fig 6 b the model parameters used for both comparisons are listed in table 2 clearly the results presented in fig 6 for both comparisons are excellent 5 summary and conclusions analytical solutions for dense colloid transport in one dimensional water saturated porous media were presented colloid particles were assumed to be either suspended in the aqueous phase or attached reversibly and or irreversibly onto the solid matrix the new analytical solutions presented

flow direction the new two site analytical solution for broad pulse source configuration reported here successfully fitted available experimental data sensitivity analysis showed that the analytical solutions for both instantaneous and broad pulse sources follow similar trends finally a simplified form of the analytical model developed in this study was successfully compared to other existing solutions that neglect the effects of gravity acknowledgements this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors

water saturated subsurface formations is of great importance to several scientists and environmental engineers the transport of colloids in water saturated formations is influenced by a number of factors including water velocity ionic strength ph solution chemistry formation type density and size of particles chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 scholl and harvey 1992 shellenberger and logan 2002 in case of biocolloids bacteria viruses additional factors such as growth chemotaxis and decay may also affect transport behavior ginn et al 2002 dense particles can be affected by gravity chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 flowers and hunt 2007 james and chrysikopoulos 2003 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2015 which may hinder or enhance their transport depending on the flow direction the flow direction in typical bench scale flow through experiments can be either upward to minimize air entrapment keller et al 2004 tan et al 1994 tong and johnson 2007 downward saiers et al 1994 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2015 xu et al 2006 or horizontal lee and chrysikopoulos 2002 syngouna et al 2017 which is representative of natural systems unfortunately the importance of flow direction in experimental studies is not always taken into account and some studies neglect to report it assuming that gravity and hydrodynamic effects are negligible basha and culligan 2010 however syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2016 reported that the attachment of viruses onto colloids was higher for downward flow rather than upward flow direction similarly basha and culligan 2010 observed that particle deposition was greater for upward flows rather than for downward flows suggesting that gravity clearly influences particle transport there are several models published in the literature that combine the classical advection dispersion equation with different types of kinetic attachment models most of these transport models assume that attachment follows either one site kinetics with forward and reverse terms or two site kinetics with reversible and irreversible attachment the forward rate of reversible attachment may represent deposition in secondary minimum fast deposition while the forward rate of irreversible attachment may represent deposition in primary minimum slow deposition tufenkji and elimelech 2005 the two site kinetics model has been employed in various studies basha and culligan 2010 compère et al 2001 harvey and garabedlan 1991 schijven et al 2002 tong and johnson 2006 yoon et al 2006 there are several one and three dimensional analytical or numerical models for colloid or biocolloid transport in literature anders and chrysikopoulos 2009 bradford et al 2011 harvey and garabedlan 1991 park et al 1992 sim and chrysikopoulos 1996 furthermore two site models which combine equilibrium and non equilibrium kinetic sorption cameron and klute 1977 with two region models van genuchten and wagenet 1989 that capture physical and chemichal non equilibrium processes have been published in the literature these models have been incorported in the software stanmod simunek et al 1999 van genuchten et al 2012 though there is a rather limited collection of mathematical models dealing with dense colloid transport flowers and hunt 2007 chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2015 and even a narrower collection of analytical models that account for attachment with two site kinetics basha and culligan 2010 the purpose of the current study is to present new analytical solutions to colloid transport models that account for attachment with two site kinetics instantaneous or broad pulse sources and non negligible gravity effects to our best of knowledge there are no analytical solutions available in the literature for mathematical two site models for dense colloids analytical models such as these may be a useful for the evaluation of conventional numerical models 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 colloid mathematical model with reversible attachment the transport of suspended colloid particles in one dimensional saturated homogeneous porous media with uniform flow accounting for combined nonequilibrium reversible and irreversible attachment onto the solid matrix along with gravity effects is governed by the following partial differential equation chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 1 c c t x t ρ b θ c c t x t d c 2 c c t x x 2 u c c t x x u s x c c t x x where cc mc l3 is the concentration of colloids where mc represents the mass of colloids cc mc ms where ms represents the mass of the solid matrix is the concentration of colloids attached onto the solid matrix t t is time x l is a cartesian coordinate in the longitudinal direction ρb ms l3 is the bulk density of the solid matrix θ is the porosity of the porous medium dc l2 t is the longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient of the suspended colloids u l t is the average interstitial velocity along the x direction us x l t is the x directional component of the restricted particle settling velocity us which is just a modification of the free particle settling velocity commonly used in static water columns russel et al 1989 applicable to granular porous media chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 2 u s x f s ρ p ρ w d p 2 18 μ w g x where fs is the correction factor accounting for particle settling in the presence of a solid matrix of granular porous media ρp m l3 is the density of the colloid particle ρw m l3 is the density of the suspending fluid water μw m l t is the dynamic viscosity of water dp l is the colloid particle diameter and gx l t2 is the x directional gravity component defined as 3 g x g sin β where g l t2 is the gravity acceleration β is the angle of the main flow direction x direction with respect to the horizontal direction 90 β 90 see fig 1 the correction factor fs is expressed as follows wan et al 1995 4 f s b 0 67 b 0 93 ε where b b 1 is the average free settling segment length to the grain radius ratio and ε 0 ε 1 is an empirical correction factor that takes into account the effect of the grain surface note that granular porous media consisting of grains with smooth surfaces do not provide additional frictional resistance but only contribute to the tortuosity wan et al 1995 and the value of the fs coefficient can be set to fs 0 9 for simplicity purposes the average interstitial velocity u and the settling velocity us x can be replaced by their sum chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 5 u t o t u u s x the concentration of colloids attached onto the solid matrix cc is assumed to be a combination of reversibly c c r mc ms and irreversibly c c i mc ms attached colloids katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 6 c c c c r c c i consequently the accumulation term in eq 1 can be expressed as 7 ρ b θ c c t x t ρ b θ c c r t x t c c i t x t the reversible accumulation term is given by sim and chrysikopoulos 1998 1999 8 ρ b θ c c r t x t r c c r c c t x r c r c ρ b θ c c r t x where r c c r 1 t is the forward rate coefficient of colloid attachment onto the solid matrix and r c r c 1 t is the reverse rate coefficient of colloid detachment from the solid matrix the irreversible accumulation term is given by compère et al 2001 9 ρ b θ c c i t x t r c c i c c t x where r c c i is the forward rate coefficient of irreversible colloid attachment onto the solid matrix note that for both reversible and irreversible accumulation terms eqs 8 and 9 the rate of attachment is assumed to be linear blocking or ripening effects are neglected substituting eqs 5 and 7 9 in the colloid transport eq 1 yields the following partial differential equation 10 c c t x t d c 2 c c t x x 2 u t o t c c t x x r c c r r c c i c c t x r c r c ρ b θ c c r t x an expression for the reversible attached colloid concentration c c r in terms of cc can be found from the solution of 8 subject to the initial condition of zero attached colloid concentration cc 0 x 0 as follows 11 c c r t x r c c r θ ρ b 0 t c c τ x exp r c r c t τ d τ where τ is a dummy integration variable substituting 11 into 10 yields the governing two site one dimensional colloid transport equation with combined reversible and irreversible attachment 12 c c t x t d c 2 c c t x x 2 u t o t c c t x x a c c t x b 0 t c c τ x exp h t τ d τ where the following definitions were used 13 a r c c r r c c i 14 b r c c r r c r c 15 h r c r c 2 2 initial and boundary conditions the initial condition and the appropriate boundary conditions for colloids written for one dimensional semi infinite porous medium are as follows sim and chrysikopoulos 1995 thomas and chrysikopoulos 2007 16 c c 0 x 0 17 c c t x 0 18 d c c c t 0 x u c c t 0 u c c 0 t t p 0 t t p 19 d c c c t 0 x u c c t 0 m δ δ t where m δ min acθ mc l2 is the mass injected instantaneously over the cross sectional area of the porous medium where min mc is the injected mass and ac l2 is the cross sectional area of the porous medium c c 0 mc l3 is the injected constant concentration of colloids tp t is a fixed period of time during which the source concentration remains constant and δ t 1 t is the dirac delta function 20 δ t 0 t 0 1 t 0 δ t d t 1 the condition 16 establishes that there is no initial concentration of colloids within the porous medium the downstream condition 17 preserves concentration continuity chrysikopoulos et al 1990b the upstream eqs 18 and 19 define the way colloids are introduced into the aquifer the condition 18 refers to a continuous source that provides constant concentration of colloids over a broad pulse which is a predefined time period tp sim and chrysikopoulos 1995 whereas eq 19 refers to instantaneous injection of colloids with total injected mass equal to min 3 analytical solutions 3 1 analytical solution for colloids with instantaneous source the analytical solution for the two site colloid transport eq 12 subject to initial and boundary conditions 16 17 and 19 was obtained using laplace transforms by following the work of chrysikopoulos et al 1990a and sim and chrysikopoulos 1998 1999 the resulting solution is 21 c c t x m δ d c 1 2 e x p u t o t x 2 d c h t 1 π t 1 2 e x p x 2 4 d c

analytical solution for broad pulse source 23 and 24 was illustrated by fitting the experimental data collected by syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 who have conducted transport experiments with two clays kaolinite kga 1b and montmorillonite stx 1b in horizontal columns packed with glass beads under two different flow rates q 1 5 and 2 5 ml min the fitting of the experimental data was achieved with the autonomous multipurpose fitting software colloidfit katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2017 only the parameters dc r c c i and r c r c were fitted while the parameter value for r c c r was obtained from the literature vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 the fitted parameters along with the corresponding 95 confidence levels are listed in table 1 the experimental normalized breakthrough concentrations and the respective best fitted model simulations are presented in fig 2 for both flow rates considered here the analytical solution 23 and 24 successfully simulated the kga 1b and stx 1b breakthrough data undoubtedly the two site model effectively described the transport of the available experimental data to illustrate how gravity effects associated with dense colloids can affect colloid transport simulations were performed under vertical up vertical down and horizontal flow conditions for both instantaneous source 21 and broad pulse source 23 and 24 analytical solutions the colloids were assumed to be spherical with diameter dp 1 4 μm and density ρ p 2 2 10 3 kg cm3 additionally the restricted particle settling velocity of the dense colloids was estimated with eq 2 equal to us 6 68 10 3 cm min using μw 6 10 4 kg cm min ρ w 9 98 10 4 kg cm3 fs 0 9 wan et al 1995 and g 3 53 106 cm min2 all parameter values required for the simulations are listed in table 2 the simulated breakthrough curves are shown in fig 3 clearly vertical down flow leads to increased average velocity whereas vertical up flow leads to decreased average velocity compared to horizontal flow larger velocities allow faster exit of colloid particles from the porous medium the effects of gravity are more pronounced for the broad pulse source rather than the instantaneous source note that at later times t tp 6000 min colloid particle concentrations for the broad pulse source case are lower for down flow than up flow conditions to further illustrate the model sensitivity to the various model parameters numerous simulations were performed for several coefficient values for both broad pulse and instantaneous cases the simulations using the analytical solution for instantaneous source 21 are presented in fig 4 and for broad pulse source 23 and 24 are presented in fig 5 for each model parameter four simulations were conducted for a horizontal porous medium with length lx 30 cm the injected mass was min 1 mg for the instantaneous case whereas the source release time period for the broad pulse case was tp 6000 min all other required parameter values are listed in table 2 it is apparent from figs 4 and 5 that the simulations for both instantaneous and broad pulse source cases exhibit similar behavior colloid concentrations exhibit higher peaks as the values for parameters dc r c c r and r c c i decrease and higher peaks as the value of r c r c increases as expected lower values of the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient dc lead to reduced particle spreading which in turn leads to sharper concentration peaks slower breakthrough times and reduced late time concentrations see figs 4 a and 5 a similarly lower values of the rates r c c r and r c c i decrease colloid attachment on the solid matrix and consequently lead to higher concentration peaks see figs 4 b d 5 b and d finally higher values of the rate r c r c increase colloid detachment from the solid matrix and consequently cause higher colloid concentration peaks see figs 4 c and 5 c finally the analytical solutions developed in this study were compared against two software packages the first comparison was between the simplified one site reversible r c c i 0 1 min broad pulse model of this study for a horizontal column β 0ο utot 0 0333 cm min with the stanmod software package simunek et al 1999 van genuchten et al 2012 as illustrated in fig 6 a the second comparison was between the complete two site reversible and irreversible r c c i 0 0002 1 min broad pulse model of this study for a vertical column with flow in the vertical down direction β 90ο utot 0 04 cm min and the well known comsol multiphysics software package see fig 6 b the model parameters used for both comparisons are listed in table 2 clearly the results presented in fig 6 for both comparisons are excellent 5 summary and conclusions analytical solutions for dense colloid transport in one dimensional water saturated porous media were presented colloid particles were assumed to be either suspended in the aqueous phase or attached reversibly and or irreversibly onto the solid matrix the new analytical solutions presented

604,despite massive flood protection efforts in china undertaken since the ancient times disastrous floods continue to plague the country in this paper we discuss changes in flood hazard and flood risk in china first we review published results including our own works on change detection in observed records of intense precipitation high river flow and flood damage in china we provide information on essential features of extreme floods in last decades floods on large rivers urban floods and flash floods next we review available projections for the future including our own results related to intense precipitation high river flow and flood damage in china we try to interpret the difference in flood hazard projections obtained in various publications since the spread of river flood hazard projections is large projections have to be interpreted with caution because of the impact on decisions related to climate change adaptation flood risk reduction and water resources management we review flood risk reduction strategies in china focusing on the present situation and division of responsibilities china has embarked upon an ambitious and vigorous task to improve flood preparedness by both structural hard defences such as dikes dams and flood control reservoirs and diversions as well as non structural soft measures spatial planning and zoning watershed management source control flood forecasting and warning systems and awareness raising the strategy of flood mitigation includes flood retention and urban water management to alleviate the burden of flash and urban flooding keywords flood risk flood hazard flood risk reduction flood defenses non structural measures 1 introduction disastrous floods have plagued china many times since the dawn of civilization despite massive flood protection efforts undertaken for four thousand years or so losses caused by floods in china are higher than damages due to other natural hazards actually flood losses in china constitute a significant part of global flood losses almost 10 in the period 1990 2017 according to ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2018 munich re 2018 hence understanding of flood hazard and flood risk in china their spatial and temporal variability and change is of considerable importance and interest in the present paper we examine spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation and river flow in china further we review detection of changes in observed records of variables related to floods intense precipitation high river flow and examine projections for the future then we review flood risk reduction efforts in the country the authorities have embarked upon an ambitious and vigorous task to improve flood preparedness by both structural hard and non structural soft measures in order to reduce flood risk 2 spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation and river flow in china humid south and south east the distribution of atmospheric precipitation over the vast territory of china is very uneven in space and time fig 1 it corresponds to the spatial differences in climates from humid and hot south and south east to dry continental west and north west with the most remote globally places from large water bodies there is a clear seasonality in precipitation over most of china precipitation is strongly influenced by the east asian monsoon during the dry winter half year from october to march the climate is mostly dry and cold while during the wet season usually extending from late spring to early autumn april to september precipitation may make up three quarters or more of the annual total in the summer the monsoon driven rain belt moves gradually from the south to the north precipitation variability both seasonal and inter seasonal as well as spatial is a major feature of the east asian summer monsoon climate if the east asian precipitation is weaker there is deficient moisture supply for precipitation in north china the asian summer monsoon may have indeed become weaker in last decades and this may have driven the decrease of summer precipitation over the lower reaches of the yellow river and the river huaihe in central and southern north china and the increase of the summer rainfall over the lower and middle reaches of the river yangtze with impact on flood hazard ding et al 2008 fig 1 shows that annual precipitation sum considerably increased in the dry tarim river basin and decreased in the haihe liaohe songhuajiang and yellow river basins this change resulted from climatic reasons but in some basins in the northeast e g the songhua the yellow the decrease of river discharge was relatively stronger than the decrease of precipitation due to large human withdrawals of water for irrigation floods frequently devastate riparian parts of the more humid east and southeast china but at times they also severely hit the drier north and northeast of china intense precipitation and floods can start in april but become more frequent in may and june in the southeastern coastal region central china is often flooded in june and july and northern and northeastern china in july and august china meteorological administration 2017 destructive abundance of water continues to play havoc on the riparian population of hundreds of millions of inhabitants of the country 3 observations related to flood risk change 3 1 history of large floods in china dates back to millennia ago since ancient times china has suffered frequent flood disasters among many tales and myths about great floods present in various cultures worldwide there is an impressive chinese deluge story reminding of emperor yu the great who nearly four thousand years ago succeeded in taming a long lasting and disastrous flood in the yellow river basin montgomery 2016 allegedly the flood resulted in famine and major population displacements people left their dwellings in the lowlands to live in higher places or to nest on the trees the hero yu managed to control and to abate the flood by dredging and channeling the rivers in order to drain the floodwaters so that the lowland fields could be cultivated this achievement earned yu the divine mandate to establish the first dynasty in chinese history the xia dynasty marking the beginning of chinese civilization the great flood myth is a narrative fundamental to chinese culture with ample references in classical chinese poetry recently wu et al 2016 reported on discovering and reconstructing a massive outburst paleo flood originating in jishi gorge on the edge of the tibetan plateau that provides scientific support illustrating that the ancient chinese textual accounts of the great flood may well be rooted in a real historic natural event using stratigraphic data and radiocarbon dating wu et al 2016 presented geological evidence for a gigantic earthquake induced landslide dam break and an outburst flood on the yellow river possibly among the worst anywhere in the world in the holocene that occurred about 1922 28 bce they found remains of a landslide dam dammed lake sediments upstream and outburst flood sediments downstream by mapping and dating lake sediments impounded behind the dam as well as distinctive sediments deposited downstream wu et al 2016 showed that an enormous flood surged down the river when the dam broke they succeeded in reconstructing the size of the event reconciling the historical and archaeological chronologies they presented evidence for a great flood event that coincided with the major cultural transition from the late neolithic age to the early bronze age concurrence of these major natural and sociopolitical events known through the geological historiographical and archaeological records can serve as a persuading illustration of a complex cultural response to an extreme flood of likely interest in the emerging area of hydro sociology socio hydrology according to the historical records see ross 1983 and information update there have been more than a thousand of larger floods since 206 bc an example of study of great historic floods is due to zhang 2012 who examined disastrous flooding in several river valleys in china in 1755 when the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river the yangtze river and the huaihe river basins experienced a prolonged rainy season with multiple torrential rain events that caused floods for instance in nanjing the annual rainfall of 1755 was 1378 mm the highest in the 18th century 3 2 destructive floods still occur in the last decades there were many individual years when the annual flood damage in china exceeded 10 billion us and the number of flood fatalities was greater than 1000 yet in the past the death toll had been much higher there were 13 large floods during 1900 1949 with a death toll in excess of 10 000 people each and there were 8500 flood related fatalities per year on average in the 1950s according to the munich re data kron and berz 2007 the 1998 flood on the rivers yangtze and the songhua and the 1996 flood on the yangtze the yellow river and the huaihe caused material damage of 31 billion us and 24 billion us respectively in nominal 1998 and 1996 dollars it is estimated that the dramatic 1998 flood events in china culminating in the south and east but also devastating the northeast killed about 5500 people left some 21 million homeless and inundated more than 23 million hectares there were 3650 fatalities in the yangtze river basin alone floods in china may considerably differ in areal coverage ranging from local regional up to basin wide events at large river basins e g of the yangtze or the yellow river floods are particularly dramatic if superposition of waves occurs e g when high water from the dongting and poyang lake basins meet with a flood wave on the mainstream yangtze and when the flood peaks from the upper and the middle and or lower reaches coincide causing a gigantic flood wave crest that propagates downstream floods have been commonplace in the basins of the largest river in china the yangtze and its tributaries floods on the yangtze are triggered by the monsoon rainfalls that differ in intensity duration areal extent and timing a regular feature in the yangtze basin that often drives the flood occurrence is the mei yu in chinese plum rain season during june july jiang et al 2008 coincident with the period when the fruit matures usually mei yu begins in mid june and ends approximately 20 days later typically it is caused by a quasi stationary rain belt over the middle lower yangtze basin resulting in abundant precipitation the onset and length of mei yu are likely to change due to changes in monsoon circulation for instance the mei yu period may commence earlier and last longer zhao et al 2010 the destructive floods on the yangtze and its tributaries as well as on the other rivers in china in 1998 illustrate the typical flood generating mechanism intense and long lasting precipitation spells started already in may then mei yu rainfalls in late june and early july led to the formation of high flood peaks and the subsequent heavy rainfall aggravated the situation causing a prolonged flood persisting for several months in the summer of 1998 a stable rain belt stayed for several weeks over the yangtze river basin on some days a 24 h precipitation exceeding 100 mm occurred over very large areas in excess of 50 thousand km2 from june to august 1998 there were 84 storm rain days with more than ten stations recording daily precipitation in excess of 50 mm each there were also 52 days with heavy rainstorm when at more than ten stations 24 h rainfall greater than 100 mm was recorded daily precipitation in excess of 300 mm d was noted at some stations in six days using data from chinese statistical yearbooks see ma 2018 one can note that the flood affected area in china has been subject to a growing trend during 1950 2017 fig 2 even if there are considerable departures from this trend in individual years with largest flood area recorded in 1991 in 2000s average annual economic damage caused by floods in china has been of the order of 0 64 of gdp i e five times less than 3 39 in the flood intense decade of the 1990s cheng and zhang 2011 flood losses in the interval 1990 2017 show increasing trend with the average value reaching 31 billion usd in 2015 prices fig 3 seven extraordinarily heavy floods have occurred on the yangtze and its tributaries since 1860 in 1860 1870 1931 1935 1954 1998 and 2010 leading to high death toll material damage and social losses in 1870 the highest yangtze discharge in the observation period was recorded at the yichang gauge estimated at 105 000 m3 s while the maximum 30 day river discharge volume reached a record level of 165 billion m3 this was likely the largest flood on the yangtze during the last millennium during the 20th century the most dramatic damages were caused by floods in 1931 and 1954 the 1954 yangtze flood has been considered as the most disastrous in modern history taking over 30 000 lives and inundating 3 17 million hectares of land a particular intensification of frequency flooding on the yangtze and in china has been observed since 1990 with an exceptional density of floods in the 1990s viz figs 2 and 3 with six large floods in 1991 1993 1995 1996 1998 and 1999 more recent disastrous floods landslides gully erosion and debris flows occurred in 2010 spanning a long time interval from may until late october with large areal coverage fig 2 in 2010 the all time highest nominal flood damage was recorded in china with the toll soaring to 69 billion us in 2015 prices fig 3 the monsoon rainfalls in 2010 lasted long and locally were very intense at one station in guangdong province a rainfall of 603 5 mm fell within six hours floods and landslides in 2010 affected 28 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities of china including dry climate areas such as the xinjiang province uygur autonomic region the human damage was very severe with some 3200 fatalities nationwide and a thousand missing the floods and landslides affected over 230 million people i e statistically every sixth citizen of china over 16 5 million hectares of farmland were affected and more than 2 million hectares were completely destroyed gansu mudslide of 8 august 2010 alone killed over 1500 people cheng and zhang 2011 in 2010 the three gorges dam on the river yangtze successfully passed a test of a 70 000 m3 s discharge i e higher than the discharge generated in the upper yangtze in 1998 out of which 40 000 m3 s was released and 30 000 m3 s was held back on 21 july 2012 the heaviest daily rainfall since 1951 affected beijing causing urban floods and resulting in 79 fatalities and 11 6 billion cn 1 85 billion us in 2012 exchange rate losses large floods were recorded in china in 2016 leading to more than 600 fatalities cumulative rainfall in the one month mei yu season exceeded 500 mm over a large area there were many intense local flood events including the flood in wuhan a large city located on the junction of the rivers yangtze and han subject to intensive urbanization and loss of water retention in last decades from 1 to 6 july 2016 precipitation in four districts of wuhan reached 930 1087 mm the three gorges dam lowered the peak flow coming from the upper reaches of the main yangtze by 40 kron 2017 in 2016 there were 102 million people affected by floods with 684 fatalities 207 missing and 14 6 million evacuees over 9 3 million hectares of farmland were affected and more than 1 5 million hectares were completely destroyed china meteorological administration 2017 for the period 2011 2017 averaged annual direct losses from floods in china amounted to about 27 billion us in 2015 prices fig 3 they constituted 53 of total losses from all hydrological and meteorological disasters during this period the highest flood loss was recorded in 2016 49 billion us i e almost double 2011 2017 average 3 3 intense precipitation and flash urban floods on the rise a part of explanation of increasing flood damage in china is due to changes in precipitation climatology with intense precipitation being typically on the rise in the warming climate decreasing trends in the annual number of rainfall days and increasing annual accumulated number of heavy rain station days were found in 1961 2017 fig 4 this figure also shows that the annual number of heavy rain days with daily precipitation 50 mm has been increasing in china there are many references documenting these statements and a sample of them are reviewed in the sequel gemmer et al 2011a reviewed changes in heavy precipitation in china reporting on positive trends in annual maximum precipitation in the yangtze river basin and increase in above normal mean intensity in east china chen et al 2011 analyzed variations of extreme precipitation for 1956 2008 corroborating earlier findings on complex changes increases of maximum daily precipitation were found in much of south china but some changes e g on the yangtze were not statistically significant at the 0 05 level both the annual and extreme precipitation above 95 percentile in recent decades have shown an increasing trend in the middle and lower yangtze reaches guan et al 2017 tian and yang 2017 the summer precipitation in the yangtze river basin has been subject to an upward trend during 1960 2004 especially in june and july jiang et al 2008 gemmer et al 2008 the upward precipitation trend in july covers the whole basin and in june it prevails in the middle and the lower region the increase of monthly precipitation in the mei yu season june and july is of much importance for flood hazard studies for the period 1961 2013 showed non significant increasing trends in june and july precipitation tian and yang 2017 also significant increases in precipitation extremes e g number of very heavy precipitation days were found su et al 2005 2006 guan et al 2017 spatially a tendency of passage to more humid climate was mainly found in the middle and the lower yangtze river basin where intensification of extreme precipitation events was noted guan et al 2017 wu et al 2013 investigated the trend of extreme flood events in the pearl river basin during 1951 2010 finding that extreme flood events increased significantly since 1980 out of 23 gauging stations examined there are 16 i e 70 of all stations with increasing trends in 1981 2010 most of these stations are located along the west river and the north river however 7 i e 30 of all stations situated in the east river and the southeast region of the west river basin show decreasing trends wang et al 2014 studied observed changes in flood exposure in china in 1984 2012 finding significant increase they estimated that the exposed population was approximately 126 persons km 2 taking the whole of china in terms of economy potential losses due to floods were estimated to be approximately 1 49 million cn km 2 240 thousand us km 2 in 2012 exchange rate km 2 and the crop area exposed to floods covered 1 53 million km2 the areas that showed higher exposure were mainly located along the east coast the population s vulnerability to floods showed a significantly increasing trend while the economic vulnerability showed a decreasing trend populations and economies in hunan anhui chongqing jiangxi and hubei provinces were the most vulnerable to floods changes in flood risk understood as a combination of hazard exposure and vulnerability depend on several factors such as climate via temperature rise and temperature related clausius clapeyron effect on saturated vapor capacity of the atmosphere as well as land use change leading to increase of the runoff coefficient and progressive surface sealing reduction of natural water retention capacity in the catchment and human advancing into flood plains accelerated urbanization often so called vertical urbanization with robust skyscrapers can be observed in many parts of china a particular example is the yangtze river delta region shanghai and parts of jiangsu and zhejiang provinces that covers only 1 of the area of china but houses 6 of the total population and produces 20 of the nation s gdp since the low lying and broad valley of the lower cross sections of the yangtze river basin is densely populated the region is exposed to flooding and eventual inundation would cause very high material damages in a global study jongman et al 2015 illustrated declining vulnerability to river floods in 1990 2010 and demonstrated the benefits of adaptation the vertical urbanization of china is considered as one of important vulnerability reduction measures cf kundzewicz et al 2014 yet as shown by wang et al 2014 one cannot issue a flat rate statement on declining vulnerability of universal and ubiquitous validity he et al 2018 analyzed spatio temporal characteristics of flash floods in china collecting an inventory of nearly 800 documented events and this can be considered as a first step towards development of an atlas of extreme flash flood occurrences in the country they found that the most extreme flash floods originate mainly from small catchments over complex terrains and result in predominantly small and medium sized flooding events in terms of spatial scale however these events that are abrupt and seasonally recurrent in nature account for a large and growing proportion of the overall flooding related disaster impacts especially disproportionately affecting elderly and youth populations lian et al 2017 presented a material flow assessment framework to evaluate the flash flood vulnerability of small catchments in china they selected typical villages and small catchments calculated exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity with sediment laden flow analysis and evaluated vulnerability with material flow indices they found that the inherent relationship between exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity characteristics might aggravate the vulnerability of catchments to flash floods 3 4 climate variability and flooding in china there is a vast body of literature indicating the existence of a rather complicated region and season specific link between climate variability indices and abundant humidity and floods in china the most commonly studied pattern of relations refers to the enso el niño southern oscillation being likely the most important phenomenon in the tropical air sea interaction worldwide it is a well established general finding that occurrence of an el niño event in the equatorial pacific changes the probability of occurrence of climate anomalies such as abundance of water in many areas of the world including china the asian monsoon system can be divided into the south asian or indian and the east asian monsoon systems which may interact with each other zhang et al 2007 found different phase relations between annual maximum streamflow of the yangtze river and the enso index in phase relations for the lower yangtze river basin and anti phase relations for the upper yangtze river basin were detected jiang et al 2006 the different phase relationships show the different influences of different variables of the atmospheric system the upper yangtze river is mainly influenced by the indian summer monsoon while the lower yangtze river is controlled by the east asian summer monsoon ding and chan 2005 and enso was found to exert strong impact on the east asian monsoon with more wet monsoon years during the periods of low pdo pacific decadal oscillation index chan and zhou 2005 wang et al 2008 huang et al 2004 noted that since the inter annual variability of the east asian summer monsoon easm is large there is also inter annual variability of summer monsoon rainfall in the valley of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and the huaihe river basin as well as in north china and south china however the tropical pacific sst sea surface temperature anomalies have different impacts on summer monsoon rainfall anomalies during different stages of the enso cycle huang et al 2004 stipulated that during a summer when el niño is in its developing stage flooding may be caused in the basins of the yangtze and huaihe rivers however during a summer when an el niño event is in its decaying stage severe floods may occur to the south of the river yangtze especially in the basins of lakes dongting and poyang several studies also investigated a link between the strong el niño phase of enso and the destructive floods in 1998 e g huang 1998 and 2016 e g wang and yuan 2018 huang 1998 explained how the transition of el niño event from the mature stage to the decaying stage in the enso cycle led to a predisposition to severe flood provoking rainfall in the yangtze basin in the summer of 1998 in turn wang and yuan 2018 postulated that extreme pluvial floods across the yangtze river basin in the summer of 2016 could have been connected with intense atmospheric moisture transport in a post el niño summer the enso index also can be taken as a suitable predictor for flood affected and flood destroyed crop areas across china zhang et al 2016 however the existing scientific literature indicates that considerable uncertainties still exist as to the possible teleconnections between pdo modulated enso and east asian summer monsoon or indian monsoon as well as the impact mechanisms of climate variability modes on flood hazard in china 4 projections for the future indicate increasing flood hazard one can identify a possible climate track in floods in china by analyzing observations and model based projections of precipitation intense precipitation and river discharge while taking into account the multi factor context climate projections show ubiquitous warming for all seasons and most models project increase in intense precipitation this also pertains to the principal summer flood season in china from june to august seneviratne et al 2012 presented regional projections of 20 year 24 h precipitation noting increases over virtually all regions of the globe including china there have been several global studies of model based projections of flood hazard starting from milly et al 2002 who covered selected basins worldwide and hirabayashi et al 2008 who covered all continents hirabayashi et al 2008 compared flood hazard projections worldwide in the future horizon 2071 2100 and the control period 1901 2000 what used to be a 100 year flood in china in the control period was found likely to occur much more frequently in the future under changed climate with a recurrence interval of 50 years and below it is worthwhile to compare the projection results reported in a few more recent papers published since 2013 by hirabayashi et al 2013 dankers et al 2014 arnell and gosling 2016 and giuntoli et al 2015 table 1 presents assumptions made in these global flood hazard projection endeavors the assumptions do considerably differ among studies and there are also slightly different reference periods hirabayashi et al 2013 project increase of flood hazard q100 in much of asia except for western asia and in particular eastwards of 80 e results of dankers et al 2014 referring to a different index q30 30 year 5 day peak flow are broadly similar to those by hirabayashi et al 2013 as to the direction of change over asia in turn giuntoli et al 2015 project more frequent days with high river flow conditions over much of the north from 50 n northwards however small changes are projected with absolute value less than 5 i e from 5 to 5 over most of the asian continent alfieri et al 2017 found that china is globally the country with largest absolute impact at 4 c global warming regarding population affected by floods and expected flood damage according to their findings the current estimates of 9 million people affected and 25 billion euro flood damage in china annually are projected to increase to 40 million and 110 billion euro at 4 c warming xu et al 2014 projected the spatial distribution of risk levels of flood disaster and the vulnerability to flood in china for three future horizons 2016 2035 2046 2065 and 2080 2099 under assumption of rcp8 5 scenario compared with the baseline period the regional flood risk levels were projected to increase towards the end of the 21st century the results show that regions with high flood hazard levels are mainly located in southeastern china while the vulnerability to flood hazards is high in eastern china under the rcp8 5 greenhouse gas emissions scenario high flood risk levels will mainly appear in the future in the eastern part of sichuan in major parts of east china and in the provinces of hebei beijing and tianjin also the major cities in northeast china some areas in shaanxi and shanxi as well as the coastal areas in southeastern china are projected to encounter high flood risks future changes of frequency of events that used to be a 30 year 50 year and 100 year flood in the reference control period 1981 2010 were determined by using 22 gcms and one distributed hydrological model for the period 2070 2099 under rcp4 5 in china fig 5 almost all regions over china were projected to suffer from the increasing frequency of occurrence of design floods of any return interval 30 50 100 year in the reference period in most parts of china frequency of 30 year flood events is likely to more than double i e the return period is likely to at least halve in 2070 2099 in comparison to the reference period for the reference 100 year flood increase in frequency will mainly occur in the southwest upper yangtze middle yellow and songhua river basins highest increase in frequency is projected in southwest and upper yangtze river basin for the 30 50 and 100 year floods almost all regions of china are projected to encounter higher flood risks for one or more return periods of concern especially for the basins of southwest upper and lower yangtze middle yellow and northeast river according to projections by willner et al 2018 china is projected to be subject to an increased high end flood risk above the protection level in reference interval 1971 2004 for a range from 24 million m to 55 m affected people all but shanghai show an increase in high end risk of at least 20 14 of 31 provinces will have more than a million people each under high end risk even the comparably strongly protected hubei 100 year protection as opposed to the average of 20 years over the whole of china will face a 10 fold increase from 0 3 m to 3 3 m people if the protection is not considerably strengthened the most affected regions in china are close to shanghai which itself is currently protected against 200 year floods guangdong the province surrounding hong kong is furthermore heavily affected and shows a massive increase from 0 7 m to 3 8 m people with a considerable adaptation need hong kong itself is not expected to show an increase in high end risk 5 flood risk reduction more than structural defences flood protection i e human adaptation to the variability of discharge has been developed in china for millennia the level of expenditure on flood protection in china has grown considerably in recent decades however complete flood control is not possible even with massive flood protection efforts disastrous floods continue to plague the country quite frequently hence flood risk management and flood risk reduction are of considerable importance in china even if there exist powerful embankments in china they do not provide satisfactory protection of the riparian population during large floods kundzewicz and xia 2004 increasingly large flood damage has been recently occurring on medium and small rivers after a suite of destructive floods in china increasing attention is being paid to further upgrading flood risk reduction measures however the country has embarked upon an ambitious and vigorous task to improve flood protection not only with the help of structural hard but also non structural soft measures the former refer to such defences as dikes dams and flood control reservoirs diversions etc the latter include implementing watershed management source control measures zoning flood forecasting warning systems and awareness raising hence diversification of strategies see kundzewicz et al 2018 is implemented after the 1998 floods and in accordance with an edict from the national government the so called 32 word policy a program of action was initiated by the ministry of water resources mwr the government devoted high funds to construction and improvement of flood risk reduction a national flood control plan was launched including investments in excess of 620 billion yuan us 90bn in 2006 values over the next 10 years in the 12th five year plan 2011 2015 the overall investment in water projects including flood control exceeded 2 trillion yuan us 315bn see kron and cheng 2019 a shift from flood control to integrated flood management was attempted embracing structural measures reinforcement of levees and dredging river channels and lakes as well as nonstructural measures such as return of polder lands to lake storage resettlement of people from high risk flood prone land reforestation of upland areas kobayashi and porter 2012 structural measures both dikes and dams of different sizes have a very long tradition in china and continue to play a vital role in flood prevention also today by the end of 2006 about 280 000 km of dykes were available providing protection for 550 million people kron and cheng 2019 more than 86 000 reservoirs exist in the country with a total storage capacity of over 0 5 1012 m3 accounting for over one fifth of the total estimated annual runoff from land areas guo et al 2004 most reservoirs serve multiple purposes flood control hydropower irrigation water supply navigation etc the total number of dams has largely increased since 1960 there were only five large dams taller than 100 m in 1960 but their number went up to 50 in 2000 xu et al 2010 the multi objective massive three gorges project tgp on the yangtze the world s greatest single civil engineering work has flood protection as the principal objective in addition to the traditional structural measures it is increasingly recognized in china that non structural measures deserve considerable interest essential advances in flood forecasting systems have been made possible by the integration of mathematical modeling advanced information technology telecommunication and remote sensing zhang et al 2002 chinese authorities have acquired advanced national weather radar networks and have been using radar data for real time flood forecasting in order to improve accuracy and extend the horizon of flood forecasting coupling of radar data with hydrological models has been carried out overcoming all the technical issues e g related to differences in spatial resolutions of the remotely sensed data and the hydrological models integrated approaches enable increasing flood warning lead time and consequently can reduce flood damage and save lives monitoring and early warning systems for over 2000 chinese counties which suffered from flash floods were developed in 2009 2015 kron and cheng 2019 jiang et al 2017 examined urban flooding in china that has become even more frequent pervasive and severe threatening china s development they reviewed china s ambitious policy initiative called sponge cities that generated considerable investment commitment yet they noted active constraints limited governance capacity and lack of knowledge and experience needed to pursue sustainable urban storm water management with rising sophistication and complexity hence it was noted that commitment to appropriate technical governance and financial measures to overcome implementation challenges is needed for the success of the approach liu et al 2018 reviewed flash flood early warning systems real time dynamic warning systems are applicable at four levels from the central to provincial to municipal to county levels liu et al 2018 found that although the number of flash floods with casualties has been dynamically increasing in china the relative index ratio of the number of flash floods with casualties to the number of all flash floods has been going down this may well illustrate the intuitively expected rule that advances in forecasting and warning system can save lives if flood can be forecast and endangered inhabitants can be warned they can escape and save life even if material damage is unavoidably high gemmer et al 2011b reviewed climate change adaptation in china including several high level endeavors such as the national climate change programme and the white paper china s policies and actions for addressing climate change flood risk reduction addressing extreme events that are likely to get more extreme is one of the principal climate change adaptation activities by 2009 all 31 provinces in china had produced a climate change plan the flood prevention law of 2007 laid out principles and responsibilities for flood prevention planning nation wide there exists a national standard gb50201 94 drafted by the ministry of water resources mwr and issued by the ministry of construction in 1994 dealing with flood return periods for different types of location gemmer et al 2011b in 2010 flood hazard mapping guidelines were published as a professional standard by the mwr based on experience collected by mapping exercises carried out in pilot studies in china many academic studies have been conducted indicating possible changes in flood risk due to climate change but the chinese approach to adaptation planning has not yet led to development of legal instruments that can translate these concerns into action as in many countries worldwide traditionally the tasks of development utilization protection and management of water resources in china were split and handled by many different government bodies this is sometimes called as ruling waters by nine dragons xia and chen 2001 also flood protection has been dealt with by several agencies the china meteorological administration cma collects observations of precipitation and other meteorological variables and prepares precipitation forecasts the national meteorological information center of cma provides meteorological and climatic data that were used in this paper the ministry of water resources mwr collects hydrological observations e g of river levels and discharges and is responsible for flood forecasting and dissemination of forecasts the hydrological bureau of mwr compiles and publishes hydrological yearbooks containing the data that were used in this paper special basin commissions were established as agencies of the mwr to coordinate water management in six major river basins yangtze yellow haihe huaihe pearl and songhua liaohe and one major lake basin of lake tai and management plans for each have been drawn up the yellow river commission is also in charge of rivers in the northwestern part of the country also the water conservancy units in charge of managing local and regional water resources at provincial municipal and county levels and other government agencies in such sectors as forestry energy land management etc play supporting and complementary roles for managing water resources across the nation xia and chen 2001 since a number of institutional players are involved effective cooperation and communication among national provincial and local institutions are essential this is inherently difficult but progress has been achieved in china in flood forecasting integration data sharing and collaborative problem solving 6 concluding remarks there is no doubt that flood risk has grown in many places in china and is likely to grow further in the future due to a combination of anthropogenic and climatic factors intense precipitation has been growing in the warming climate however reliable and detailed quantification of aggregate flood statistics is very difficult to obtain for the past to present and is virtually impossible to obtain for the future projections of flood hazard show that floods of a given return period in the historical reference interval will likely become more frequent in much of china however uncertainty in projections remains large since it is naïve to expect availability of reliable and trustworthy quantitative projections of flood hazard for the future in order to reduce flood risk one should focus attention on identification of risk and vulnerability hotspots and improve the situation in areas where such hotspots occur this general statement also holds for china among growing vulnerability hotspots are urban areas where flash floods pluvial floods are an increasingly frequent menace it is necessary to continue examination of the updated time series of meteorological hydrological and economic records trying to search for changes that influence flood hazard and flood risk in china in particular eventual changes in intense precipitation changes in monsoon tracks changes in land use and changes in exposure and vulnerability have to be detected and interpreted early detection and attribution of these changes would be of vast practical importance for flood risk reduction the number of flash floods has been on the rise because the precipitation intensity has been increasing with the warming and the runoff coefficient and impermeability of areas have been increasing with urbanization while natural storage capacity has been decreasing the role of climate variability in affecting floods is recognized as very important in china yet there are still considerable uncertainties in understanding possible teleconnections between enso and east asian summer monsoon or indian monsoon and impact mechanisms of climate variability on flood hazard flood risk depends on a combination of anthropogenic and natural factors such as climate land use as well as population density wealth and flood risk reduction activities in flood prone areas and in whole basins the total population of china has grown from 560 million in the 1950s to almost 1400 million in 2018 http data stats gov cn due to the growing population pressure activities like deforestation agricultural land expansion urbanization construction of roads reclamation of wetlands and lakes have been progressing this has reduced the available water storage capacity in river basins increased the value of the runoff coefficient and aggravated the flood hazard and flood risk flood damage potential has increased and is likely to increase further there is more to lose in this growing nation

604,despite massive flood protection efforts in china undertaken since the ancient times disastrous floods continue to plague the country in this paper we discuss changes in flood hazard and flood risk in china first we review published results including our own works on change detection in observed records of intense precipitation high river flow and flood damage in china we provide information on essential features of extreme floods in last decades floods on large rivers urban floods and flash floods next we review available projections for the future including our own results related to intense precipitation high river flow and flood damage in china we try to interpret the difference in flood hazard projections obtained in various publications since the spread of river flood hazard projections is large projections have to be interpreted with caution because of the impact on decisions related to climate change adaptation flood risk reduction and water resources management we review flood risk reduction strategies in china focusing on the present situation and division of responsibilities china has embarked upon an ambitious and vigorous task to improve flood preparedness by both structural hard defences such as dikes dams and flood control reservoirs and diversions as well as non structural soft measures spatial planning and zoning watershed management source control flood forecasting and warning systems and awareness raising the strategy of flood mitigation includes flood retention and urban water management to alleviate the burden of flash and urban flooding keywords flood risk flood hazard flood risk reduction flood defenses non structural measures 1 introduction disastrous floods have plagued china many times since the dawn of civilization despite massive flood protection efforts undertaken for four thousand years or so losses caused by floods in china are higher than damages due to other natural hazards actually flood losses in china constitute a significant part of global flood losses almost 10 in the period 1990 2017 according to ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2018 munich re 2018 hence understanding of flood hazard and flood risk in china their spatial and temporal variability and change is of considerable importance and interest in the present paper we examine spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation and river flow in china further we review detection of changes in observed records of variables related to floods intense precipitation high river flow and examine projections for the future then we review flood risk reduction efforts in the country the authorities have embarked upon an ambitious and vigorous task to improve flood preparedness by both structural hard and non structural soft measures in order to reduce flood risk 2 spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation and river flow in china humid south and south east the distribution of atmospheric precipitation over the vast territory of china is very uneven in space and time fig 1 it corresponds to the spatial differences in climates from humid and hot south and south east to dry continental west and north west with the most remote globally places from large water bodies there is a clear seasonality in precipitation over most of china precipitation is strongly influenced by the east asian monsoon during the dry winter half year from october to march the climate is mostly dry and cold while during the wet season usually extending from late spring to early autumn april to september precipitation may make up three quarters or more of the annual total in the summer the monsoon driven rain belt moves gradually from the south to the north precipitation variability both seasonal and inter seasonal as well as spatial is a major feature of the east asian summer monsoon climate if the east asian precipitation is weaker there is deficient moisture supply for precipitation in north china the asian summer monsoon may have indeed become weaker in last decades and this may have driven the decrease of summer precipitation over the lower reaches of the yellow river and the river huaihe in central and southern north china and the increase of the summer rainfall over the lower and middle reaches of the river yangtze with impact on flood hazard ding et al 2008 fig 1 shows that annual precipitation sum considerably increased in the dry tarim river basin and decreased in the haihe liaohe songhuajiang and yellow river basins this change resulted from climatic reasons but in some basins in the northeast e g the songhua the yellow the decrease of river discharge was relatively stronger than the decrease of precipitation due to large human withdrawals of water for irrigation floods frequently devastate riparian parts of the more humid east and southeast china but at times they also severely hit the drier north and northeast of china intense precipitation and floods can start in april but become more frequent in may and june in the southeastern coastal region central china is often flooded in june and july and northern and northeastern china in july and august china meteorological administration 2017 destructive abundance of water continues to play havoc on the riparian population of hundreds of millions of inhabitants of the country 3 observations related to flood risk change 3 1 history of large floods in china dates back to millennia ago since ancient times china has suffered frequent flood disasters among many tales and myths about great floods present in various cultures worldwide there is an impressive chinese deluge story reminding of emperor yu the great who nearly four thousand years ago succeeded in taming a long lasting and disastrous flood in the yellow river basin montgomery 2016 allegedly the flood resulted in famine and major population displacements people left their dwellings in the lowlands to live in higher places or to nest on the trees the hero yu managed to control and to abate the flood by dredging and channeling the rivers in order to drain the floodwaters so that the lowland fields could be cultivated this achievement earned yu the divine mandate to establish the first dynasty in chinese history the xia dynasty marking the beginning of chinese civilization the great flood myth is a narrative fundamental to chinese culture with ample references in classical chinese poetry recently wu et al 2016 reported on discovering and reconstructing a massive outburst paleo flood originating in jishi gorge on the edge of the tibetan plateau that provides scientific support illustrating that the ancient chinese textual accounts of the great flood may well be rooted in a real historic natural event using stratigraphic data and radiocarbon dating wu et al 2016 presented geological evidence for a gigantic earthquake induced landslide dam break and an outburst flood on the yellow river possibly among the worst anywhere in the world in the holocene that occurred about 1922 28 bce they found remains of a landslide dam dammed lake sediments upstream and outburst flood sediments downstream by mapping and dating lake sediments impounded behind the dam as well as distinctive sediments deposited downstream wu et al 2016 showed that an enormous flood surged down the river when the dam broke they succeeded in reconstructing the size of the event reconciling the historical and archaeological chronologies they presented evidence for a great flood event that coincided with the major cultural transition from the late neolithic age to the early bronze age concurrence of these major natural and sociopolitical events known through the geological historiographical and archaeological records can serve as a persuading illustration of a complex cultural response to an extreme flood of likely interest in the emerging area of hydro sociology socio hydrology according to the historical records see ross 1983 and information update there have been more than a thousand of larger floods since 206 bc an example of study of great historic floods is due to zhang 2012 who examined disastrous flooding in several river valleys in china in 1755 when the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river the yangtze river and the huaihe river basins experienced a prolonged rainy season with multiple torrential rain events that caused floods for instance in nanjing the annual rainfall of 1755 was 1378 mm the highest in the 18th century 3 2 destructive floods still occur in the last decades there were many individual years when the annual flood damage in china exceeded 10 billion us and the number of flood fatalities was greater than 1000 yet in the past the death toll had been much higher there were 13 large floods during 1900 1949 with a death toll in excess of 10 000 people each and there were 8500 flood related fatalities per year on average in the 1950s according to the munich re data kron and berz 2007 the 1998 flood on the rivers yangtze and the songhua and the 1996 flood on the yangtze the yellow river and the huaihe caused material damage of 31 billion us and 24 billion us respectively in nominal 1998 and 1996 dollars it is estimated that the dramatic 1998 flood events in china culminating in the south and east but also devastating the northeast killed about 5500 people left some 21 million homeless and inundated more than 23 million hectares there were 3650 fatalities in the yangtze river basin alone floods in china may considerably differ in areal coverage ranging from local regional up to basin wide events at large river basins e g of the yangtze or the yellow river floods are particularly dramatic if superposition of waves occurs e g when high water from the dongting and poyang lake basins meet with a flood wave on the mainstream yangtze and when the flood peaks from the upper and the middle and or lower reaches coincide causing a gigantic flood wave crest that propagates downstream floods have been commonplace in the basins of the largest river in china the yangtze and its tributaries floods on the yangtze are triggered by the monsoon rainfalls that differ in intensity duration areal extent and timing a regular feature in the yangtze basin that often drives the flood occurrence is the mei yu in chinese plum rain season during june july jiang et al 2008 coincident with the period when the fruit matures usually mei yu begins in mid june and ends approximately 20 days later typically it is caused by a quasi stationary rain belt over the middle lower yangtze basin resulting in abundant precipitation the onset and length of mei yu are likely to change due to changes in monsoon circulation for instance the mei yu period may commence earlier and last longer zhao et al 2010 the destructive floods on the yangtze and its tributaries as well as on the other rivers in china in 1998 illustrate the typical flood generating mechanism intense and long lasting precipitation spells started already in may then mei yu rainfalls in late june and early july led to the formation of high flood peaks and the subsequent heavy rainfall aggravated the situation causing a prolonged flood persisting for several months in the summer of 1998 a stable rain belt stayed for several weeks over the yangtze river basin on some days a 24 h precipitation exceeding 100 mm occurred over very large areas in excess of 50 thousand km2 from june to august 1998 there were 84 storm rain days with more than ten stations recording daily precipitation in excess of 50 mm each there were also 52 days with heavy rainstorm when at more than ten stations 24 h rainfall greater than 100 mm was recorded daily precipitation in excess of 300 mm d was noted at some stations in six days using data from chinese statistical yearbooks see ma 2018 one can note that the flood affected area in china has been subject to a growing trend during 1950 2017 fig 2 even if there are considerable departures from this trend in individual years with largest flood area recorded in 1991 in 2000s average annual economic damage caused by floods in china has been of the order of 0 64 of gdp i e five times less than 3 39 in the flood intense decade of the 1990s cheng and zhang 2011 flood losses in the interval 1990 2017 show increasing trend with the average value reaching 31 billion usd in 2015 prices fig 3 seven extraordinarily heavy floods have occurred on the yangtze and its tributaries since 1860 in 1860 1870 1931 1935 1954 1998 and 2010 leading to high death toll material damage and social losses in 1870 the highest yangtze discharge in the observation period was recorded at the yichang gauge estimated at 105 000 m3 s while the maximum 30 day river discharge volume reached a record level of 165 billion m3 this was likely the largest flood on the yangtze during the last millennium during the 20th century the most dramatic damages were caused by floods in 1931 and 1954 the 1954 yangtze flood has been considered as the most disastrous in modern history taking over 30 000 lives and inundating 3 17 million hectares of land a particular intensification of frequency flooding on the yangtze and in china has been observed since 1990 with an exceptional density of floods in the 1990s viz figs 2 and 3 with six large floods in 1991 1993 1995 1996 1998 and 1999 more recent disastrous floods landslides gully erosion and debris flows occurred in 2010 spanning a long time interval from may until late october with large areal coverage fig 2 in 2010 the all time highest nominal flood damage was recorded in china with the toll soaring to 69 billion us in 2015 prices fig 3 the monsoon rainfalls in 2010 lasted long and locally were very intense at one station in guangdong province a rainfall of 603 5 mm fell within six hours floods and landslides in 2010 affected 28 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities of china including dry climate areas such as the xinjiang province uygur autonomic region the human damage was very severe with some 3200 fatalities nationwide and a thousand missing the floods and landslides affected over 230 million people i e statistically every sixth citizen of china over 16 5 million hectares of farmland were affected and more than 2 million hectares were completely destroyed gansu mudslide of 8 august 2010 alone killed over 1500 people cheng and zhang 2011 in 2010 the three gorges dam on the river yangtze successfully passed a test of a 70 000 m3 s discharge i e higher than the discharge generated in the upper yangtze in 1998 out of which 40 000 m3 s was released and 30 000 m3 s was held back on 21 july 2012 the heaviest daily rainfall since 1951 affected beijing causing urban floods and resulting in 79 fatalities and 11 6 billion cn 1 85 billion us in 2012 exchange rate losses large floods were recorded in china in 2016 leading to more than 600 fatalities cumulative rainfall in the one month mei yu season exceeded 500 mm over a large area there were many intense local flood events including the flood in wuhan a large city located on the junction of the rivers yangtze and han subject to intensive urbanization and loss of water retention in last decades from 1 to 6 july 2016 precipitation in four districts of wuhan reached 930 1087 mm the three gorges dam lowered the peak flow coming from the upper reaches of the main yangtze by 40 kron 2017 in 2016 there were 102 million people affected by floods with 684 fatalities 207 missing and 14 6 million evacuees over 9 3 million hectares of farmland were affected and more than 1 5 million hectares were completely destroyed china meteorological administration 2017 for the period 2011 2017 averaged annual direct losses from floods in china amounted to about 27 billion us in 2015 prices fig 3 they constituted 53 of total losses from all hydrological and meteorological disasters during this period the highest flood loss was recorded in 2016 49 billion us i e almost double 2011 2017 average 3 3 intense precipitation and flash urban floods on the rise a part of explanation of increasing flood damage in china is due to changes in precipitation climatology with intense precipitation being typically on the rise in the warming climate decreasing trends in the annual number of rainfall days and increasing annual accumulated number of heavy rain station days were found in 1961 2017 fig 4 this figure also shows that the annual number of heavy rain days with daily precipitation 50 mm has been increasing in china there are many references documenting these statements and a sample of them are reviewed in the sequel gemmer et al 2011a reviewed changes in heavy precipitation in china reporting on positive trends in annual maximum precipitation in the yangtze river basin and increase in above normal mean intensity in east china chen et al 2011 analyzed variations of extreme precipitation for 1956 2008 corroborating earlier findings on complex changes increases of maximum daily precipitation were found in much of south china but some changes e g on the yangtze were not statistically significant at the 0 05 level both the annual and extreme precipitation above 95 percentile in recent decades have shown an increasing trend in the middle and lower yangtze reaches guan et al 2017 tian and yang 2017 the summer precipitation in the yangtze river basin has been subject to an upward trend during 1960 2004 especially in june and july jiang et al 2008 gemmer et al 2008 the upward precipitation trend in july covers the whole basin and in june it prevails in the middle and the lower region the increase of monthly precipitation in the mei yu season june and july is of much importance for flood hazard studies for the period 1961 2013 showed non significant increasing trends in june and july precipitation tian and yang 2017 also significant increases in precipitation extremes e g number of very heavy precipitation days were found su et al 2005 2006 guan et al 2017 spatially a tendency of passage to more humid climate was mainly found in the middle and the lower yangtze river basin where intensification of extreme precipitation events was noted guan et al 2017 wu et al 2013 investigated the trend of extreme flood events in the pearl river basin during 1951 2010 finding that extreme flood events increased significantly since 1980 out of 23 gauging stations examined there are 16 i e 70 of all stations with increasing trends in 1981 2010 most of these stations are located along the west river and the north river however 7 i e 30 of all stations situated in the east river and the southeast region of the west river basin show decreasing trends wang et al 2014 studied observed changes in flood exposure in china in 1984 2012 finding significant increase they estimated that the exposed population was approximately 126 persons km 2 taking the whole of china in terms of economy potential losses due to floods were estimated to be approximately 1 49 million cn km 2 240 thousand us km 2 in 2012 exchange rate km 2 and the crop area exposed to floods covered 1 53 million km2 the areas that showed higher exposure were mainly located along the east coast the population s vulnerability to floods showed a significantly increasing trend while the economic vulnerability showed a decreasing trend populations and economies in hunan anhui chongqing jiangxi and hubei provinces were the most vulnerable to floods changes in flood risk understood as a combination of hazard exposure and vulnerability depend on several factors such as climate via temperature rise and temperature related clausius clapeyron effect on saturated vapor capacity of the atmosphere as well as land use change leading to increase of the runoff coefficient and progressive surface sealing reduction of natural water retention capacity in the catchment and human advancing into flood plains accelerated urbanization often so called vertical urbanization with robust skyscrapers can be observed in many parts of china a particular example is the yangtze river delta region shanghai and parts of jiangsu and zhejiang provinces that covers only 1 of the area of china but houses 6 of the total population and produces 20 of the nation s gdp since the low lying and broad valley of the lower cross sections of the yangtze river basin is densely populated the region is exposed to flooding and eventual inundation would cause very high material damages in a global study jongman et al 2015 illustrated declining vulnerability to river floods in 1990 2010 and demonstrated the benefits of adaptation the vertical urbanization of china is considered as one of important vulnerability reduction measures cf kundzewicz et al 2014 yet as shown by wang et al 2014 one cannot issue a flat rate statement on declining vulnerability of universal and ubiquitous validity he et al 2018 analyzed spatio temporal characteristics of flash floods in china collecting an inventory of nearly 800 documented events and this can be considered as a first step towards development of an atlas of extreme flash flood occurrences in the country they found that the most extreme flash floods originate mainly from small catchments over complex terrains and result in predominantly small and medium sized flooding events in terms of spatial scale however these events that are abrupt and seasonally recurrent in nature account for a large and growing proportion of the overall flooding related disaster impacts especially disproportionately affecting elderly and youth populations lian et al 2017 presented a material flow assessment framework to evaluate the flash flood vulnerability of small catchments in china they selected typical villages and small catchments calculated exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity with sediment laden flow analysis and evaluated vulnerability with material flow indices they found that the inherent relationship between exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity characteristics might aggravate the vulnerability of catchments to flash floods 3 4 climate variability and flooding in china there is a vast body of literature indicating the existence of a rather complicated region and season specific link between climate variability indices and abundant humidity and floods in china the most commonly studied pattern of relations refers to the enso el niño southern oscillation being likely the most important phenomenon in the tropical air sea interaction worldwide it is a well established general finding that occurrence of an el niño event in the equatorial pacific changes the probability of occurrence of climate anomalies such as abundance of water in many areas of the world including china the asian monsoon system can be divided into the south asian or indian and the east asian monsoon systems which may interact with each other zhang et al 2007 found different phase relations between annual maximum streamflow of the yangtze river and the enso index in phase relations for the lower yangtze river basin and anti phase relations for the upper yangtze river basin were detected jiang et al 2006 the different phase relationships show the different influences of different variables of the atmospheric system the upper yangtze river is mainly influenced by the indian summer monsoon while the lower yangtze river is controlled by the east asian summer monsoon ding and chan 2005 and enso was found to exert strong impact on the east asian monsoon with more wet monsoon years during the periods of low pdo pacific decadal oscillation index chan and zhou 2005 wang et al 2008 huang et al 2004 noted that since the inter annual variability of the east asian summer monsoon easm is large there is also inter annual variability of summer monsoon rainfall in the valley of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and the huaihe river basin as well as in north china and south china however the tropical pacific sst sea surface temperature anomalies have different impacts on summer monsoon rainfall anomalies during different stages of the enso cycle huang et al 2004 stipulated that during a summer when el niño is in its developing stage flooding may be caused in the basins of the yangtze and huaihe rivers however during a summer when an el niño event is in its decaying stage severe floods may occur to the south of the river yangtze especially in the basins of lakes dongting and poyang several studies also investigated a link between the strong el niño phase of enso and the destructive floods in 1998 e g huang 1998 and 2016 e g wang and yuan 2018 huang 1998 explained how the transition of el niño event from the mature stage to the decaying stage in the enso cycle led to a predisposition to severe flood provoking rainfall in the yangtze basin in the summer of 1998 in turn wang and yuan 2018 postulated that extreme pluvial floods across the yangtze river basin in the summer of 2016 could have been connected with intense atmospheric moisture transport in a post el niño summer the enso index also can be taken as a suitable predictor for flood affected and flood destroyed crop areas across china zhang et al 2016 however the existing scientific literature indicates that considerable uncertainties still exist as to the possible teleconnections between pdo modulated enso and east asian summer monsoon or indian monsoon as well as the impact mechanisms of climate variability modes on flood hazard in china 4 projections for the future indicate increasing flood hazard one can identify a possible climate track in floods in china by analyzing observations and model based projections of precipitation intense precipitation and river discharge while taking into account the multi factor context climate projections show ubiquitous warming for all seasons and most models project increase in intense precipitation this also pertains to the principal summer flood season in china from june to august seneviratne et al 2012 presented regional projections of 20 year 24 h precipitation noting increases over virtually all regions of the globe including china there have been several global studies of model based projections of flood hazard starting from milly et al 2002 who covered selected basins worldwide and hirabayashi et al 2008 who covered all continents hirabayashi et al 2008 compared flood hazard projections worldwide in the future horizon 2071 2100 and the control period 1901 2000 what used to be a 100 year flood in china in the control period was found likely to occur much more frequently in the future under changed climate with a recurrence interval of 50 years and below it is worthwhile to compare the projection results reported in a few more recent papers published since 2013 by hirabayashi et al 2013 dankers et al 2014 arnell and gosling 2016 and giuntoli et al 2015 table 1 presents assumptions made in these global flood hazard projection endeavors the assumptions do considerably differ among studies and there are also slightly different reference periods hirabayashi et al 2013 project increase of flood hazard q100 in much of asia except for western asia and in particular eastwards of 80 e results of dankers et al 2014 referring to a different index q30 30 year 5 day peak flow are broadly similar to those by hirabayashi et al 2013 as to the direction of change over asia in turn giuntoli et al 2015 project more frequent days with high river flow conditions over much of the north from 50 n northwards however small changes are projected with absolute value less than 5 i e from 5 to 5 over most of the asian continent alfieri et al 2017 found that china is globally the country with largest absolute impact at 4 c global warming regarding population affected by floods and expected flood damage according to their findings the current estimates of 9 million people affected and 25 billion euro flood damage in china annually are projected to increase to 40 million and 110 billion euro at 4 c warming xu et al 2014 projected the spatial distribution of risk levels of flood disaster and the vulnerability to flood in china for three future horizons 2016 2035 2046 2065 and 2080 2099 under assumption of rcp8 5 scenario compared with the baseline period the regional flood risk levels were projected to increase towards the end of the 21st century the results show that regions with high flood hazard levels are mainly located in southeastern china while the vulnerability to flood hazards is high in eastern china under the rcp8 5 greenhouse gas emissions scenario high flood risk levels will mainly appear in the future in the eastern part of sichuan in major parts of east china and in the provinces of hebei beijing and tianjin also the major cities in northeast china some areas in shaanxi and shanxi as well as the coastal areas in southeastern china are projected to encounter high flood risks future changes of frequency of events that used to be a 30 year 50 year and 100 year flood in the reference control period 1981 2010 were determined by using 22 gcms and one distributed hydrological model for the period 2070 2099 under rcp4 5 in china fig 5 almost all regions over china were projected to suffer from the increasing frequency of occurrence of design floods of any return interval 30 50 100 year in the reference period in most parts of china frequency of 30 year flood events is likely to more than double i e the return period is likely to at least halve in 2070 2099 in comparison to the reference period for the reference 100 year flood increase in frequency will mainly occur in the southwest upper yangtze middle yellow and songhua river basins highest increase in frequency is projected in southwest and upper yangtze river basin for the 30 50 and 100 year floods almost all regions of china are projected to encounter higher flood risks for one or more return periods of concern especially for the basins of southwest upper and lower yangtze middle yellow and northeast river according to projections by willner et al 2018 china is projected to be subject to an increased high end flood risk above the protection level in reference interval 1971 2004 for a range from 24 million m to 55 m affected people all but shanghai show an increase in high end risk of at least 20 14 of 31 provinces will have more than a million people each under high end risk even the comparably strongly protected hubei 100 year protection as opposed to the average of 20 years over the whole of china will face a 10 fold increase from 0 3 m to 3 3 m people if the protection is not considerably strengthened the most affected regions in china are close to shanghai which itself is currently protected against 200 year floods guangdong the province surrounding hong kong is furthermore heavily affected and shows a massive increase from 0 7 m to 3 8 m people with a considerable adaptation need hong kong itself is not expected to show an increase in high end risk 5 flood risk reduction more than structural defences flood protection i e human adaptation to the variability of discharge has been developed in china for millennia the level of expenditure on flood protection in china has grown considerably in recent decades however complete flood control is not possible even with massive flood protection efforts disastrous floods continue to plague the country quite frequently hence flood risk management and flood risk reduction are of considerable importance in china even if there exist powerful embankments in china they do not provide satisfactory protection of the riparian population during large floods kundzewicz and xia 2004 increasingly large flood damage has been recently occurring on medium and small rivers after a suite of destructive floods in china increasing attention is being paid to further upgrading flood risk reduction measures however the country has embarked upon an ambitious and vigorous task to improve flood protection not only with the help of structural hard but also non structural soft measures the former refer to such defences as dikes dams and flood control reservoirs diversions etc the latter include implementing watershed management source control measures zoning flood forecasting warning systems and awareness raising hence diversification of strategies see kundzewicz et al 2018 is implemented after the 1998 floods and in accordance with an edict from the national government the so called 32 word policy a program of action was initiated by the ministry of water resources mwr the government devoted high funds to construction and improvement of flood risk reduction a national flood control plan was launched including investments in excess of 620 billion yuan us 90bn in 2006 values over the next 10 years in the 12th five year plan 2011 2015 the overall investment in water projects including flood control exceeded 2 trillion yuan us 315bn see kron and cheng 2019 a shift from flood control to integrated flood management was attempted embracing structural measures reinforcement of levees and dredging river channels and lakes as well as nonstructural measures such as return of polder lands to lake storage resettlement of people from high risk flood prone land reforestation of upland areas kobayashi and porter 2012 structural measures both dikes and dams of different sizes have a very long tradition in china and continue to play a vital role in flood prevention also today by the end of 2006 about 280 000 km of dykes were available providing protection for 550 million people kron and cheng 2019 more than 86 000 reservoirs exist in the country with a total storage capacity of over 0 5 1012 m3 accounting for over one fifth of the total estimated annual runoff from land areas guo et al 2004 most reservoirs serve multiple purposes flood control hydropower irrigation water supply navigation etc the total number of dams has largely increased since 1960 there were only five large dams taller than 100 m in 1960 but their number went up to 50 in 2000 xu et al 2010 the multi objective massive three gorges project tgp on the yangtze the world s greatest single civil engineering work has flood protection as the principal objective in addition to the traditional structural measures it is increasingly recognized in china that non structural measures deserve considerable interest essential advances in flood forecasting systems have been made possible by the integration of mathematical modeling advanced information technology telecommunication and remote sensing zhang et al 2002 chinese authorities have acquired advanced national weather radar networks and have been using radar data for real time flood forecasting in order to improve accuracy and extend the horizon of flood forecasting coupling of radar data with hydrological models has been carried out overcoming all the technical issues e g related to differences in spatial resolutions of the remotely sensed data and the hydrological models integrated approaches enable increasing flood warning lead time and consequently can reduce flood damage and save lives monitoring and early warning systems for over 2000 chinese counties which suffered from flash floods were developed in 2009 2015 kron and cheng 2019 jiang et al 2017 examined urban flooding in china that has become even more frequent pervasive and severe threatening china s development they reviewed china s ambitious policy initiative called sponge cities that generated considerable investment commitment yet they noted active constraints limited governance capacity and lack of knowledge and experience needed to pursue sustainable urban storm water management with rising sophistication and complexity hence it was noted that commitment to appropriate technical governance and financial measures to overcome implementation challenges is needed for the success of the approach liu et al 2018 reviewed flash flood early warning systems real time dynamic warning systems are applicable at four levels from the central to provincial to municipal to county levels liu et al 2018 found that although the number of flash floods with casualties has been dynamically increasing in china the relative index ratio of the number of flash floods with casualties to the number of all flash floods has been going down this may well illustrate the intuitively expected rule that advances in forecasting and warning system can save lives if flood can be forecast and endangered inhabitants can be warned they can escape and save life even if material damage is unavoidably high gemmer et al 2011b reviewed climate change adaptation in china including several high level endeavors such as the national climate change programme and the white paper china s policies and actions for addressing climate change flood risk reduction addressing extreme events that are likely to get more extreme is one of the principal climate change adaptation activities by 2009 all 31 provinces in china had produced a climate change plan the flood prevention law of 2007 laid out principles and responsibilities for flood prevention planning nation wide there exists a national standard gb50201 94 drafted by the ministry of water resources mwr and issued by the ministry of construction in 1994 dealing with flood return periods for different types of location gemmer et al 2011b in 2010 flood hazard mapping guidelines were published as a professional standard by the mwr based on experience collected by mapping exercises carried out in pilot studies in china many academic studies have been conducted indicating possible changes in flood risk due to climate change but the chinese approach to adaptation planning has not yet led to development of legal instruments that can translate these concerns into action as in many countries worldwide traditionally the tasks of development utilization protection and management of water resources in china were split and handled by many different government bodies this is sometimes called as ruling waters by nine dragons xia and chen 2001 also flood protection has been dealt with by several agencies the china meteorological administration cma collects observations of precipitation and other meteorological variables and prepares precipitation forecasts the national meteorological information center of cma provides meteorological and climatic data that were used in this paper the ministry of water resources mwr collects hydrological observations e g of river levels and discharges and is responsible for flood forecasting and dissemination of forecasts the hydrological bureau of mwr compiles and publishes hydrological yearbooks containing the data that were used in this paper special basin commissions were established as agencies of the mwr to coordinate water management in six major river basins yangtze yellow haihe huaihe pearl and songhua liaohe and one major lake basin of lake tai and management plans for each have been drawn up the yellow river commission is also in charge of rivers in the northwestern part of the country also the water conservancy units in charge of managing local and regional water resources at provincial municipal and county levels and other government agencies in such sectors as forestry energy land management etc play supporting and complementary roles for managing water resources across the nation xia and chen 2001 since a number of institutional players are involved effective cooperation and communication among national provincial and local institutions are essential this is inherently difficult but progress has been achieved in china in flood forecasting integration data sharing and collaborative problem solving 6 concluding remarks there is no doubt that flood risk has grown in many places in china and is likely to grow further in the future due to a combination of anthropogenic and climatic factors intense precipitation has been growing in the warming climate however reliable and detailed quantification of aggregate flood statistics is very difficult to obtain for the past to present and is virtually impossible to obtain for the future projections of flood hazard show that floods of a given return period in the historical reference interval will likely become more frequent in much of china however uncertainty in projections remains large since it is naïve to expect availability of reliable and trustworthy quantitative projections of flood hazard for the future in order to reduce flood risk one should focus attention on identification of risk and vulnerability hotspots and improve the situation in areas where such hotspots occur this general statement also holds for china among growing vulnerability hotspots are urban areas where flash floods pluvial floods are an increasingly frequent menace it is necessary to continue examination of the updated time series of meteorological hydrological and economic records trying to search for changes that influence flood hazard and flood risk in china in particular eventual changes in intense precipitation changes in monsoon tracks changes in land use and changes in exposure and vulnerability have to be detected and interpreted early detection and attribution of these changes would be of vast practical importance for flood risk reduction the number of flash floods has been on the rise because the precipitation intensity has been increasing with the warming and the runoff coefficient and impermeability of areas have been increasing with urbanization while natural storage capacity has been decreasing the role of climate variability in affecting floods is recognized as very important in china yet there are still considerable uncertainties in understanding possible teleconnections between enso and east asian summer monsoon or indian monsoon and impact mechanisms of climate variability on flood hazard flood risk depends on a combination of anthropogenic and natural factors such as climate land use as well as population density wealth and flood risk reduction activities in flood prone areas and in whole basins the total population of china has grown from 560 million in the 1950s to almost 1400 million in 2018 http data stats gov cn due to the growing population pressure activities like deforestation agricultural land expansion urbanization construction of roads reclamation of wetlands and lakes have been progressing this has reduced the available water storage capacity in river basins increased the value of the runoff coefficient and aggravated the flood hazard and flood risk flood damage potential has increased and is likely to increase further there is more to lose in this growing nation
