13385,this study evaluated a novel shortcut biological nitrogen removal bnr method using activated sludge biofilm coupled with microalgae in a photo sequencing batch biofilm reactor psbbr for treating high ammonia nitrogen nh4 n wastewater results showed that the symbiotic microalgae supplied oxygen and an additional organic carbon source for bacteria the consortium achieved high nitrogen removal efficiency 90 and had the potential to lower the operating cost when used for treating biogas slurry bs it saved more than 50 of the external carbon source and reduced about 78 of oxygen demand compared with the conventional bnr process nitrogen was removed mainly through shortcut nitrification denitrification scnd 80 and biological assimilation 6 8 in the psbbr the algal bacterial symbiosis improved the species richness but reduced the microbial diversity of the biofilm nitrosomonas with an abundance of 19 81 was the dominant ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob in the biofilm while thauera with an abundance of 45 03 played a leading role in denitrification this study concurrently indicated that algae and activated sludge coupling increased the nitrous oxide n2o emission in the shortcut nitrogen removal process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords high nh4 n wastewater biological nitrogen removal activated sludge microalgae shortcut nitrification denitrification 1 introduction nearly 90 of livestock manure in china is treated by anaerobic digestion which produces plenty of biogas slurry bs and has posed a severe threat to the surrounding environment 1 as the organic substrates in the livestock wastewater are almost used for producing methane gas bs turns to be typical wastewater with a high nh4 n concentration and low c n ratio this results in the high oxygen demand and external carbon source requirement for the nitrification and denitrification of bs in the conventional biological nitrogen removal bnr process 2 new bnr methods such as shortcut nitrification denitrification scnd 3 and partial nitritation anammox pna 4 have been developed and widely studied considering that the residual organics would suppress the activity of anammox bacteria and the current bnr treatment methods of bs are mostly aerobic processes scnd may be a better alternative scnd shortened the bnr pathway with nh4 n being oxidized to nitrite no2 n by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and directly reduced to nitrogenous gas 5 previous studies have shown that scnd has apparent advantages in bnr of wastewater such as anaerobic digestate and landfill leachate 2 3 compared with the conventional bnr process scnd can save aeration consumption and carbon source demand 6 furthermore scnd based bnr processes also reduce carbon dioxide emissions alkalinity requirements and sludge production 7 the key to implement scnd is to control the nitrification in the ammonia oxidation stage without no2 n conversion to no3 n as the oxidation of no2 n is conducted by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob it is vital to suppress nob and maximize the aob activity simultaneously in a properly running scnd system research has found that nob are more sensitive than aob to parameters such as ph temperature dissolved oxygen do and inhibitors 7 based on these parameters successful scnd can be achieved through several effective control strategies including do limitation free ammonia fa inhibition or free nitrous acid fna inhibition aob have a higher oxygen affinity than nob making them more competitive under low do conditions 1 0 mg l 1 7 fna is an effective metabolic inhibitor especially for nob as reported in the literature fna could completely inhibit the biosynthesis of nob at a concentration of 0 023 mg l 1 while it did not affect aob at 0 10 mg l 1 8 the inhibition of fa or fna on nob may help realize high no2 n accumulation and successful scnd however it would be an extreme challenge using fa or fna alone to maintain consistent suppression of nob due to their adaptation properties many studies have shown that a single suppression factor e g limited do fa or fna often induces the adaptation of nob and results in the failure of nitritation 9 11 therefore novel and efficient strategies are in great request to achieve sustainable nob suppression in recent years wastewater treatment by the symbiosis of algae and bacteria has received more and more interest previous studies have confirmed the effectiveness of algal bacterial symbiosis abs in improving organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency and reducing energy costs in wastewater treatment 2 12 in the abs treatment system algae produce oxygen and organic matter for bacteria while bacteria supply carbon dioxide co2 vitamins and auxins for algae growth 13 the close contact makes the oxygen transfer from algae to bacteria easier in abs it is found that algae can provide a considerable part of oxygen in abs and save the mechanical aeration cost 2 14 some abs systems even realize oxygen self sufficiency and achieve excellent nutrient removal efficiency without external aeration 15 16 the organics supplied by the algae for bacteria mainly include fixed organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon which can be used as a carbon source for denitrification 13 although microalgae provide oxygen and carbon sources they also compete with some bacteria such as nob recent research shows that algae can inhibit the growth of nob and make no2 n unable to be effectively oxidized to no3 n thus promoting the shortcut nitrification process 17 but up to now the mechanism of action of algae on nob is not yet crystal clear the symbiosis of microalgae provides a possibility to reduce energy consumption and improve the efficiency of the scnd wastewater treatment process so far there are still many deficiencies in the knowledge of scnd in the algal bacterial consortium especially on the microbial community structure and the nitrogen removal pathway in this study activated sludge as was acclimated for shortcut nitrification and coupled with algae through biofilm colonization in a psbbr effects of impact factors such as hrt aeration rate and external carbon source on the nitrogen removal efficiency were studied the microbial community and denitrification products were analyzed and the nitrogen metabolism pathway in the psbbr was revealed at last this research aims to propose a novel symbiotic algae based scnd technology as a strategy for reducing the cost of high nh4 n wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater seed sludge and algae bs was collected from a pilot scale anaerobic reactor 114 407 e 30 512 n china whose fermentation materials were pig manure and kitchen waste it was centrifuged filtered and stored in an icebox before experiments the synthetic biogas slurry sbs was synthesized using ch3coona nh4cl and kh2po4 as carbon nitrogen and phosphorus sources respectively besides 1 ml of trace elements solution was added into 1 l sbs to provide a nutrient balance for microbial growth 18 the main characteristics of the wastewaters were shown in table 1 nahco3 1 mol l 1 and hcl 1 mol l 1 were used to keep the ph values at 7 5 8 5 during the reaction period the as with a mixed liquor suspended solids concentration mlss of 4200 mg l 1 and a mixed liquor volatile suspended solids concentration mlvss of 3500 mg l 1 was obtained from tangxunhu wastewater treatment plant wuhan china the algae used in this study was provided by the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences and belonged to chlorella pyrenoidosa it was expanded in bg11 medium components were shown in table s1 and domesticated in the sbs the culture medium was sampled regularly to detect chemical oxygen demand codcr concentration 2 2 activated sludge acclimation and biofilm cultivation the as acclimation included two stages in stage 1 an equal amount of as was put into three identical lab scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs designated as r1 r2 and r3 l w h 50 10 20 cm3 made of transparent acrylic plastic with an effective working volume of 8 l fig 1 the sbrs were operated at ambient temperature with a 12 h cycle model following 4 l water inflow for each cycle 15 min feeding 10 h aerobic aeration 1 h settling 15 min decanting and 30 min idling the do concentrations of r1 and r2 were set as 0 5 1 0 mg l 1 while r3 was 2 0 2 5 mg l 1 to avoid scnd in stage 2 polypropylene fiber fillers were put into the sbrs to cultivate biofilm after the fillers were covered with dense biofilm chlorella was inoculated in r1 to obtain algal bacterial symbiosis the mature biofilm from r1 r2 and r3 was designated as shortcut nitrification denitrification sludge algae biofilm scndab shortcut nitrification denitrification sludge biofilm scndb and activated sludge biofilm asb respectively 2 3 reaction conditions optimization and bs treatment the cultured biofilms were divided equally into several simulated sbrs 2 l beakers which operated with a 12 h cycle model following 15 min feeding 6 h aerobic aeration 4 h anaerobic stirring 1 h settling 15 min decanting and 30 min idling single factor experiments were conducted to determine the optimum reaction conditions such as carbon source dosage do concentration and hrt to explore the optimal carbon source dosage different amounts of sodium acetate were put into the beakers for optimal do concentration the aeration rate was set as 0 5 1 0 2 0 4 0 and 6 0 l min 1 respectively while the carbon source dosage was fixed as the obtained amount finally the hrt was set as 12 24 36 48 60 and 72 h respectively while the carbon source dosage and do concentration were set as the optimal amounts the investigation of each impact factor would last for more than 20 days until the effluent quality became stable afterward the treatment of the bs was carried out in r1 based on the optimum reaction conditions the concentrations of cod nh4 n tn and total phosphorus tp in the effluent were determined every two days 2 4 microbial community the relative quantity change of aob and nob during the acclimation was analyzed using the fluorescence in situ hybridization fish method mentioned by wang et al 19 the probes of nso190 specific to β proteobacteria were used to identify aob chartreuse green while nob were identified by nit3 orange probe sequences of nso190 and nit3 were cgatcccctgcttttctcc and cctgtgctccatgctccg respectively moreover the high throughput sequencing procedure was applied to investigate the microbial community variation the microbial dna was extracted from as asb scndb and scndab and the 16s rdna genes were amplified by pcr following the previous method 20 the obtained pcr products were sequenced using illumina hiseq by major biotech shanghai china co ltd the resulting sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with the 97 similarity threshold using uparse and usearch algorithm 21 2 5 analytical methods mlss mlvss nh4 n no3 n no2 n and po4 3 p levels were assayed according to standard methods 22 the values of ph do and light intensity were measured using a ph sensor ct 6023 lei ci china a dissolved oxygen meter jpsj 605 lei ci china and a lumeter zds 10 w gao zhi china respectively the eps of the biofilm samples was extracted using the cation exchange method 23 n2o production was analyzed by gas chromatography 7890a agilent usa based on the well established headspace method 24 lc ms 1100 lc msd trap agilent usa and three dimensional fluorescence 3d eem fp 6500 jasco japan were applied to analyze the organic components the biofilm components were investigated through ft ir nicolet is50r thermo scientific usa and elemental analyzer ea3000 euro vector italy 2 6 calculations the no2 n accumulation ratio nar fa concentration and fna concentration were calculated using the following equations 25 1 nar no 2 n no 2 n no 3 n 100 2 fa mg l 1 17 14 nh 4 n 10 ph exp 6334 273 t 10 ph 3 fna mg l 1 46 14 no 2 n exp 2300 273 t 10 ph 3 results and discussion 3 1 activated sludge acclimation as depicted in fig 2 when the influent nh4 n concentration was below 100 mg l 1 the effluent showed low nh4 n and no2 n but a high no3 n concentration the accumulation rate and effluent concentration of no2 n went up with the increase of influent nh4 n concentration as the influent nh4 n concentration increased to 600 mg l 1 the no2 n and no3 n concentrations in the effluent were 402 5 mg l 1 and 20 2 mg l 1 respectively the activated sludge achieved excellent shortcut nitrification ability with a nar of 95 the average concentrations of fa and fna were 4 68 mg l 1 and 0 062 mg l 1 respectively the high removal efficiency 75 2 of nh4 n and high concentration of no2 n indicated that aob activity was largely unaffected by fa and fna however nob was remarkably inhibited and the no3 n concentration in the effluent was very low fish results also demonstrated that the number of aob increased while nob were detected with less frequency and in less abundance during the acclimation fig s3 commonly nob was more sensitive to fa or fna than aob the reported fa inhibition thresholds are 10 150 mg l 1 for aob and 0 1 1 0 mg l 1 for nob 26 fna can inhibit the anabolic process of nob at a concentration of 0 011 mg l 1 and completely inhibit their biosynthesis when the concentration reaches 0 023 mg l 1 however aob will not be affected at all except that the fna concentration increases to 0 10 mg l 1 8 the real time water quality monitoring fig s2 implied that the high fa concentration decreased gradually while fna concentration increased during each sbr cycle it has been reported that the alternate treatment approach suppressed the nob more effectively than fna or fa treatment alone and could tackle the adaptation challenges of nob 9 adaptation of nob to the inhibitory factors is mainly due to the physiological changes or the less susceptible nob emerging however the key nob communities e g nitrospira nitrobacter failed to adapt the alternate treatment between fa and fna and could unlikely develop resistance to this strategy providing a possibility for the stable suppression of nob and long term operation of shortcut nitrification 9 in addition the low do concentration 0 5 1 0 mg l 1 also contributed to the enrichment of aob since they have a higher oxygen affinity and are more advantageous for oxygen competition at low do conditions than nob 7 as a result the combo strategy delivered stable shortcut nitrification 3 2 effect of reaction conditions on nitrogen removal 3 2 1 carbon source dosage carbon source is one of the most critical control parameters for the bnr process scnd is put forward as an attractive alternative to complete nitrification since it saves the unnecessary step of no2 n oxidation 5 as shown in fig 3 a and b the removal efficiency of both nh4 n and tn improved when the external carbon source was supplied the increased carbon source can provide more electron donors for denitrifying bacteria dnb and promote denitrification excessive carbon source is generally considered to be adverse to nitrifying bacteria and negative to the nh4 n removal however an appropriate amount of external carbon source will improve the stability of the autotrophic ecosystem and enhance nitrification ability 27 heterotrophic bacteria always act as a protective layer for nitrifying bacteria in the biofilm 27 moreover the external carbon source favored the growth of heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria a special denitrifier that can grow and nitrify n based compounds using organic carbon sources when the ch3coona dosage exceeded 1200 mg l 1 the nh4 n removal efficiency of scndab and scndb decreased mainly because the excessive organics stimulated the growth of heterotrophic bacteria and inhibited the nitrifying bacteria without external carbon source supplying scndab and scndb showed a better tn removal performance than asb proving that scnd was more advantageous for nitrogen removal from wastewater with a low c n ratio than conventional bnr fig 3a showed that when the effluent tn concentration was about 80 mg l 1 the additional carbon source amounts required by scndab scndb and asb were 800 c n 1 5 1000 c n 1 75 and 1800 c n 2 75 mg l 1 respectively table s4 the conventional bnr typically needs a c n ratio of 2 4 to achieve complete denitrification 28 based on stoichiometric eq 4 reducing 1 0 g no3 to n2 requires about 3 6 g ch3coona close to that by asb about 3 5 g ch3coona therefore scndb saved about 44 of carbon sources than the conventional bnr process while scndab saved more than 50 4 5ch 3 coona 8no 3 10 co 2 h 2 o 4 n 2 5naoh 8oh there are many explanations for the carbon source demand reduction in the algal bacterial consortium 13 researchers believe that the symbiotic algae can directly provide a carbon source for dnb 29 additionally algae can also consume a part of nitrogen by assimilation further analysis of the carbon source provided by algae was discussed later in section 3 4 3 2 2 aeration rate as depicted in fig 3c and d both aob and nob were inhibited due to terminal electron acceptor deficiency under a low aeration rate of 0 5 l min 1 do 0 15 mg l 1 the nh4 n oxidation efficiency dramatically improved as the aeration rate increased to 2 l min 1 do 0 52 0 18 mg l 1 the nh4 n removal efficiency of scndab increased slightly as the aeration rate increased to 6 l min 1 do 1 29 0 31 mg l 1 while the tn removal efficiency decreased obviously indicating that a high do concentration was detrimental to the denitrification in the scnd system generally low do concentration is beneficial for the shortcut nitrification start up since the oxygen half saturation constant ko of aob 0 2 0 5 mg o2 l 1 is much lower than that of nob 0 7 2 0 mg o2 l 1 7 30 therefore aob are more advantageous than nob when competing for do however it is reported that shortcut nitrification can be achieved in a wide do concentration range 0 2 3 0 mg l 1 under different operational conditions 31 in this study scndab showed good scnd ability at a low do concentration of 0 28 0 52 mg l 1 the high concentration of do would revive nob and thus disrupt shortcut nitrification when the do concentration exceeded 0 52 mg l 1 the stability of shortcut nitrification would be broken and the tn removal efficiency decreased moreover the sufficient do was favorable to the aerobic bacteria and accelerated carbon source consumption leading to insufficient electron donors for denitrification both scndab and scndb showed higher nitrogen removal efficiency than asb at a low aeration rate of 1 0 l min 1 do 0 28 mg l 1 indicating that scnd reduced the oxygen consumption in the bnr process nitrifying bacteria are not the dominant species in asb they are usually in an inferior position in the competition of oxygen with other heterotrophic bacteria leading to the poor nitrogen removal performance of asb under low do concentration 7 when a satisfactory nh4 n removal efficiency 90 was obtained the do requirements of scndab scndb and asb were 0 28 0 52 and 1 29 mg l 1 respectively meaning that the algal bacterial consortium saved 46 and 78 of oxygen demand respectively compared with scnd without algae and conventional bnr process according to the literature oxygen supplied by algae o algae could meet about 70 of the total oxygen demand for the scnd process in the algal bacterial consortium 2 the influent nh4 n concentration 600 mg l 1 in this study was much higher than in the previous study 300 mg l 1 so more do was needed for ammoxidation however oxygen released through photosynthesis would not increase much resulting in the low proportion of the o algae in the total oxygen demand as the aeration rate increased from 2 0 l min 1 to 6 l min 1 do 1 29 0 31 mg l 1 the nars of scndb and scndab decreased a similar consequence also occurred in the tn removal efficiency this phenomenon might be explained by the fact that high do concentration revived nob and impelled more nh4 n to be oxidized to no3 n 5 as mentioned above high do concentration would impair the dnb and inhibit denitrification making the tn removal efficiency decreased 3 2 3 hrt an appropriate hrt is conducive to maintain the dynamic nutrient balance in the reactor and improve the pollutants removal efficiency fig 3e showed that the removal efficiency of nh4 n and tn was enhanced when the hrt increased from 12 h to 48 h due to the extension of contact time between microorganisms and pollutants the removal efficiency of nh4 n changed little but tn decreased with continually increasing the hrt from 48 h to 72 h a short hrt would result in nitrosation inadequately and an electron acceptor deficiency for denitrification 32 moreover dnb which mainly exist in the anaerobic zone inside the biofilm always need a longer mass transfer time and cannot get adequate nutrients at a short hrt 33 however if hrt is too long do would penetrate into the inner layer of the biofilm destroy the balance of the anaerobic zone and affect the denitrification efficiency 7 furthermore a long hrt would decrease the organic loading rate olr and aggravate the endogenous respiration of the organisms thus reducing the pollutant removal efficiency scndab got an nh4 n removal efficiency of 92 6 which was 6 2 higher than scndb at an hrt of 24 h but both of the two biofilms needed an hrt of 48 h to achieve an optimum tn removal efficiency the real time monitoring results fig 3f of nitrogen concentrations in r1 hrt 48 h showed that the nh4 n concentration declined and no2 n concentration increased during the aeration stage 0 6 h the nh4 n concentration decreased rapidly to 38 3 mg l 1 in r1 within 4 h while it decreased to 45 4 mg l 1 after 6 h in r2 indicating that algal bacterial symbiosis accelerated the shortcut nitrification process 3 3 treatment of biogas slurry fig 4 revealed that scndab showed excellent shortcut nitrification ability with an nh4 n removal efficiency of 92 in bs while the tn removal efficiency was only 75 when sbs was used as an influent in stage i the removal efficiency of nitrogen and cod was stable and practical as the sbs was gradually replaced by bs in stage ii the effluent quality began to deteriorate since bs is typical wastewater with a low c n ratio carbon source will be a limiting factor for denitrification therefore an appropriate dosage of 400 mg l 1 ch3coona was added into the influent in stage iii it was noticeable that the addition of external carbon sources significantly enhanced the denitrification process the concentration of no2 n in the effluent decreased from 48 6 mg l 1 to 0 3 mg l 1 while tn removal efficiency increased from 78 3 to 89 1 an external carbon source also reduced the effluent cod concentration from 554 to 575 mg l 1 to 402 439 mg l 1 suggesting that the refractory organics in the bs could be co metabolized with ch3coona algae separation and collection from the aqueous suspension are tough due to the small cell size and cell densities similar to water 34 few studies have reported the algae removal approach in algal bacterial wastewater treatment 15 35 in this study a bio filter fig 1 was used to collect the suspended algae from the psbbr effluent results showed that nearly 80 of suspended algae were removed by bio filter the chlorophyll a chl a concentration in bio filter effluent decreased to 35 6 57 9 μg l 1 which was far lower than that in psbbr effluent with an average amount of 208 μg l 1 psbbr obtained stable effluent quality after 60 days of operation the main water quality indicators of the effluent met the discharge standard of pollutants for the livestock and poultry industry in china cod 400 nh4 n 80 and tp 8 0 mg l 1 indicating that scndab could serve as a potential technology for the bs treatment 3 4 symbiotic mechanism of algae and bacteria in scndab 3 4 1 release of organic metabolites fig 5 a showed that the cod concentration of the bg11 medium increased during the culturing lc ms results indicated that the major organic matters in the medium after culturing included soluble polysaccharides esters amines and organic acid table s3 in the logarithmic phase chlorella thrived and cod concentration increased rapidly research has established that the extracellular organic matter eom released by microalgae can act as a carbon source for microbial growth 36 as shown in the 3d eem fluorescence spectrum results there were two weak peaks identified as tryptophan analogs related substances peak a em335 ex280 and humic acid ha organic substances peak b em440 ex360 in chlorella culture solution fig 5b scndab eps showed stronger peaks at em350 ex290 and em440 ex360 than scndb eps fig 5c d and these two peaks represent dissolved microbial metabolites and ha respectively moreover the scndab eps showed peaks in em380 ex320 and em500 ex370 representing dissolved microbial metabolites and ha respectively these results demonstrated the type and content increase of ha in eps by algal bacterial symbiosis ha contains numerous redox active molecules and conduces to improve the as activity 37 moreover dissolved ha can be used as an indirect external energy and carbon source for bacteria 38 3 4 2 constituent analysis as illustrated in table 2 the contents of c h and n elements in scndab were higher than those in scndb suggesting that the symbiosis of algae promoted the nutrients utilization of sludge biofilm the aged and falling off biofilm produced by scndab in wastewater treatment accumulated biomass with higher biofuel characteristics than that produced by asb or scndb ft ir also indicated that the characteristic functional groups corresponding to proteins polysaccharides and lipids in scndab eps had stronger absorption band intensity than those in scndb eps fig s4 the constituent analysis demonstrated that scndab was a good feedstock for animal feed preparation or biofuel production due to its high protein and lipid content 3 4 3 microbial community the high throughput genome sequencing htgs of as and biofilms was analyzed to reveal the effect of algal bacterial symbiosis on microbial community structure as shown in fig 6 and table 3 the dominant bacterial populations of the four samples differenced obviously at both phylum and class levels in terms of the phylum level about 14 phyla were found and shown in fig 6a compared with as and asb the abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes in scndb and scndab increased significantly while actinobacteria declined it is acknowledged that nob are widely distributed in nitrobacter nitrococcus nitrospina and nitrospira the abundance of nitrospira a typical nob was high in as 2 19 and asb 7 22 however it decreased to 0 08 and 0 05 respectively in scndb and scndab indicating that nob had been eliminated during the acclimation and were inhibited throughout in the scnd biofilms it is reported that high light intensities affect the synthesis of polypeptides and cytochrome c in nob and consequently decrease the nitrifying activity 17 aob have evolved corresponding coping mechanisms to the cellular membrane damage and growth inhibition induced by ultraviolet a while nob have not 39 in addition to the effect of light nob are also disadvantageous in competition with aob or algae for nutrients uptake due to its low growth rate the inhibitory effects of irradiation and algae growth might contribute to the low abundance of nob in the algal bacterial consortium however it was clear that fa and fna was the main contributor to the inhibition of nob since scndb which was not affected by light and algae also had a similarly low abundance value of nob thirty nine classes were detected in the samples and the top 20 classes were shown in fig 6b actinobacteria and alphaproteobacteria were the two predominant classes in asb accounting for 28 44 and 13 08 respectively but their abundance declined in scndb and scndab while gammaproteobacteria and bacteroidia increased generally gammaproteobacteria was positively correlated with no2 n and had a critical effect on denitrification 40 the top 50 most abundant genera in all samples were analyzed further as shown in the heatmap fig 6c the non overlapping red area between different systems indicated that the disparate dominant species appeared in the four samples asb showed more species than as since biofilm could provide a stable living environment for long generation cycle microorganisms 41 candidatus microthrix was the predominant genus with a relative abundance of 18 60 in the as but it almost disappeared in the biofilm the abundance of nitrosomonas the main functional bacteria of shortcut nitrification was low in as 0 26 and asb 0 45 but increased a lot in scndb 17 04 and scndab 19 81 both the species richness and community diversity of scndb and scndab decreased significantly compared with as and asb fa and fna would affect the microbial community during the long term acclimation 42 the symbiotic algae also have a particular effect on microbial variation the oxygen and carbon sources supplied by the symbiotic algae would promote microbial growth and increase the microbial quantity on the other hand algae may also inhibit bacterial growth and reproduction researchers have found that the metabolites secreted by algae are harmful to some specific bacteria and decrease them in microbial species 43 as a result scndab showed lower community diversity but higher species richness than scndb 3 5 nitrogen metabolism in the psbbr the psbbr system achieved efficient nitrogen removal through the synergism of algae and bacteria including the scnd process of activated sludge and the assimilation of algae the nitrogen metabolic pathway in psbbr during the stable operation period 15 37 d was dissected based on the mass conservation equation eq 5 as illustrated in fig 7 more than 80 of nitrogen was removed through scnd and about 6 8 was removed by biological assimilation one thing to note was that the algal bacterial consortium increased the emission of n2o a potent greenhouse gas and ozone depleting pollutant 24 5 n in n output n d n s uptake n a uptake n v n eff where nin is the total amount of nitrogen in the influent noutput is the nitrogen output amount including the amounts of shortcut nitrification consumption nd the assimilation by sludge biofilm ns uptake and algae na uptake the volatilization nv and the effluent discharge neff according to the composition analysis of denitrifying gaseous products the n2o emission of r1 was 2 higher than that of r2 n2o release occurs in both nitrification and denitrification processes 44 aob stimulate the n2o production through the biotic and abiotic transformations of metabolic intermediates and they are generally considered the primary producers of n2o 45 studies have indicated that aob reduce no2 n to n2o through incomplete hydroxylamine nh2oh oxidation or nitrifier denitrification in the presence of isomeric nitrite reductase nir 46 the interaction of hno2 and nh2oh during the nitrification is considered to be another production pathway of n nitrosation hybrid n2o 44 additionally some heterotrophic microorganisms such as alcaligenes faecalis can nitrify n based compounds and produce n2o in the nh4 n oxidation process 47 scndab showed a higher abundance of aob than scndb which might cause more n2o to be generated there are two causes for n2o production in the denitrification process firstly nitrous oxide reductase nos activity is inhibited which would prevent n2o from being further reduced to n2 secondly some dnb lack nos and n2o is the final denitrification product the dominant bacteria in scndab were thauera with a relative abundance of 45 03 thauera are generally considered active dnb whose nos are easy to be inhibited by high no2 n concentration and some of them even have no nos 48 these reasons make it easy for thauera to accumulate and release n2o during the scnd process especially for the treatment of wastewater with high no2 n concentration additionally the higher abundance of aob in the scndb was conducive to nh4 n oxidation and no2 n accumulation aggravating the nos inhibition and inducing more n2o production 49 moreover studies have shown that some microalgae such as chlorella can synthesize and release n2o during their growth 24 50 microalgae can also affect the ratio between bacterial genes involved in n2o reduction and denitrification thus affecting n2o production 51 heretofore the elucidation of specific sources of n2o in the sludge algae biofilm is still an ongoing challenge for the scndab treatment process more studies such as using other algae species adding different carbon sources or regulating the microbial community structure are required to diminish the n2o emission 4 conclusions a novel shortcut bnr strategy was conducted to treat biogas slurry using activated sludge biofilm coupled with symbiotic algae the optimum reaction conditions of the algal bacterial symbiosis for nitrogen removal were c n ratio of 1 5 do 0 52 0 18 mg l 1 and hrt 48 h nob was stably inhibited by alternate treatment between fa and fna the consortium removed more than 90 of nh4 n from biogas slurry mainly relying on the shortcut nitrification denitrification process and biological assimilation it saved about 50 of external carbon source and reduced about 78 of oxygen demand compared with the conventional bnr process the symbiotic microalgae could supply 46 of the oxygen demand for nitrogen removal aob abundance increased the nitrification process accelerated and the n2o emission amount increased by 2 in the algal bacterial consortium scnd enhanced by microalgae can be developed into a sustainable and low cost technology for high nh4 n wastewater treatment however more attention should be paid to the high n2o release produced by the consortium declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

with an abundance of 45 03 played a leading role in denitrification this study concurrently indicated that algae and activated sludge coupling increased the nitrous oxide n2o emission in the shortcut nitrogen removal process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords high nh4 n wastewater biological nitrogen removal activated sludge microalgae shortcut nitrification denitrification 1 introduction nearly 90 of livestock manure in china is treated by anaerobic digestion which produces plenty of biogas slurry bs and has posed a severe threat to the surrounding environment 1 as the organic substrates in the livestock wastewater are almost used for producing methane gas bs turns to be typical wastewater with a high nh4 n concentration and low c n ratio this results in the high oxygen demand and external carbon source requirement for the nitrification and denitrification of bs in the conventional biological nitrogen removal bnr process 2 new bnr methods such as shortcut nitrification denitrification scnd 3 and partial nitritation anammox pna 4 have been developed and widely studied considering that the residual organics would suppress the activity of anammox bacteria and the current bnr treatment methods of bs are mostly aerobic processes scnd may be a better alternative scnd shortened the bnr pathway with nh4 n being oxidized to nitrite no2 n by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and directly reduced to nitrogenous gas 5 previous studies have shown that scnd has apparent advantages in bnr of wastewater such as anaerobic digestate and landfill leachate 2 3 compared with the conventional bnr process scnd can save aeration consumption and carbon source demand 6 furthermore scnd based bnr processes also reduce carbon dioxide emissions alkalinity requirements and sludge production 7 the key to implement scnd is to control the nitrification in the ammonia oxidation stage without no2 n conversion to no3 n as the oxidation of no2 n is conducted by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob it is vital to suppress nob and maximize the aob activity simultaneously in a properly running scnd system research has found that nob are more sensitive than aob to parameters such as ph temperature dissolved oxygen do and inhibitors 7 based on these parameters successful scnd can be achieved through several effective control strategies including do limitation free ammonia fa inhibition or free nitrous acid fna inhibition aob have a higher oxygen affinity than nob making them more competitive under low do conditions 1 0 mg l 1 7 fna is an effective metabolic inhibitor especially for nob as reported in the literature fna could completely inhibit the biosynthesis of nob at a concentration of 0 023 mg l 1 while it did not affect aob at 0 10 mg l 1 8 the inhibition of fa or fna on nob may help realize high no2 n accumulation and successful scnd however it would be an extreme challenge using fa or fna alone to maintain consistent suppression of nob due to their adaptation properties many studies have shown that a single suppression factor e g limited do fa or fna often induces the adaptation of nob and results in the failure of nitritation 9 11 therefore novel and efficient strategies are in great request to achieve sustainable nob suppression in recent years wastewater treatment by the symbiosis of algae and bacteria has received more and more interest previous studies have confirmed the effectiveness of algal bacterial symbiosis abs in improving organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency and reducing energy costs in wastewater treatment 2 12 in the abs treatment system algae produce oxygen and organic matter for bacteria while bacteria supply carbon dioxide co2 vitamins and auxins for algae growth 13 the close contact makes the oxygen transfer from algae to bacteria easier in abs it is found that algae can provide a considerable part of oxygen in abs and save the mechanical aeration cost 2 14 some abs systems even realize oxygen self sufficiency and achieve excellent nutrient removal efficiency without external aeration 15 16 the organics supplied by the algae for bacteria mainly include fixed organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon which can be used as a carbon source for denitrification 13 although microalgae provide oxygen and carbon sources they also compete with some bacteria such as nob recent research shows that algae can inhibit the growth of nob and make no2 n unable to be effectively oxidized to no3 n thus promoting the shortcut nitrification process 17 but up to now the mechanism of action of algae on nob is not yet crystal clear the symbiosis of microalgae provides a possibility to reduce energy consumption and improve the efficiency of the scnd wastewater treatment process so far there are still many deficiencies in the knowledge of scnd in the algal bacterial consortium especially on the microbial community structure and the nitrogen removal pathway in this study activated sludge as was acclimated for shortcut nitrification and coupled with algae through biofilm colonization in a psbbr effects of impact factors such as hrt aeration rate and external carbon source on the nitrogen removal efficiency were studied the microbial community and denitrification products were analyzed and the nitrogen metabolism pathway in the psbbr was revealed at last this research aims to propose a novel symbiotic algae based scnd technology as a strategy for reducing the cost of high nh4 n wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater seed sludge and algae bs was collected from a pilot scale anaerobic reactor 114 407 e 30 512 n china whose fermentation materials were pig manure and kitchen waste it was centrifuged filtered and stored in an icebox before experiments the synthetic biogas slurry sbs was synthesized using ch3coona nh4cl and kh2po4 as carbon nitrogen and phosphorus sources respectively besides 1 ml of trace elements solution was added into 1 l sbs to provide a nutrient balance for microbial growth 18 the main characteristics of the wastewaters were shown in table 1 nahco3 1 mol l 1 and hcl 1 mol l 1 were used to keep the ph values at 7 5 8 5 during the reaction period the as with a mixed liquor suspended solids concentration mlss of 4200 mg l 1 and a mixed liquor volatile suspended solids concentration mlvss of 3500 mg l 1 was obtained from tangxunhu wastewater treatment plant wuhan china the algae used in this study was provided by the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences and belonged to chlorella pyrenoidosa it was expanded in bg11 medium components were shown in table s1 and domesticated in the sbs the culture medium was sampled regularly to detect chemical oxygen demand codcr concentration 2 2 activated sludge acclimation and biofilm cultivation the as acclimation included two stages in stage 1 an equal amount of as was put into three identical lab scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs designated as r1 r2 and r3 l w h 50 10 20 cm3 made of transparent acrylic plastic with an effective working volume of 8 l fig 1 the sbrs were operated at ambient temperature with a 12 h cycle model following 4 l water inflow for each cycle 15 min feeding 10 h aerobic aeration 1 h settling 15 min decanting and 30 min idling the do concentrations of r1 and r2 were set as 0 5 1 0 mg l 1 while r3 was 2 0 2 5 mg l 1 to avoid scnd in stage 2 polypropylene fiber fillers were put into the sbrs to cultivate biofilm after the fillers were covered with dense biofilm chlorella was inoculated in r1 to obtain algal bacterial symbiosis the mature biofilm from r1 r2 and r3 was designated as shortcut nitrification denitrification sludge algae biofilm scndab shortcut nitrification denitrification sludge biofilm scndb and activated sludge biofilm asb respectively 2 3 reaction conditions optimization and bs treatment the cultured biofilms were divided equally into several simulated sbrs 2 l beakers which operated with a 12 h cycle model following 15 min feeding 6 h aerobic aeration 4 h anaerobic stirring 1 h settling 15 min decanting and 30 min idling single factor experiments were conducted to determine the optimum reaction conditions such as carbon source dosage do concentration and hrt to explore the optimal carbon source dosage different amounts of sodium acetate were put into the beakers for optimal do concentration the aeration rate was set as 0 5 1 0 2 0 4 0 and 6 0 l min 1 respectively while the carbon source dosage was fixed as the obtained amount finally the hrt was set as 12 24 36 48 60 and 72 h respectively while the carbon source dosage and do concentration were set as the optimal amounts the investigation of each impact factor would last for more than 20 days until the effluent quality became stable afterward the treatment of the bs was carried out in r1 based on the optimum reaction conditions the concentrations of cod nh4 n tn and total phosphorus tp in the effluent were determined every two days 2 4 microbial community the relative quantity change of aob and nob during the acclimation was analyzed using the fluorescence in situ hybridization fish method mentioned by wang et al 19 the probes of nso190 specific to β proteobacteria were used to identify aob chartreuse green while nob were identified by nit3 orange probe sequences of nso190 and nit3 were cgatcccctgcttttctcc and cctgtgctccatgctccg respectively moreover the high throughput sequencing procedure was applied to investigate the microbial community variation the microbial dna was extracted from as asb scndb and scndab and the 16s rdna genes were amplified by pcr following the previous method 20 the obtained pcr products were sequenced using illumina hiseq by major biotech shanghai china co ltd the resulting sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with the 97 similarity threshold using uparse and usearch algorithm 21 2 5 analytical methods mlss mlvss nh4 n no3 n no2 n and po4 3 p levels were assayed according to standard methods 22 the values of ph do and light intensity were measured using a ph sensor ct 6023 lei ci china a dissolved oxygen meter jpsj 605 lei ci china and a lumeter zds 10 w gao zhi china respectively the eps of the biofilm samples was extracted using the cation exchange method 23 n2o production was analyzed by gas chromatography 7890a agilent usa based on the well established headspace method 24 lc ms 1100 lc msd trap agilent usa and three dimensional fluorescence 3d eem fp 6500 jasco japan were applied to analyze the organic components the biofilm components were investigated through ft ir nicolet is50r thermo scientific usa and elemental analyzer ea3000 euro vector italy 2 6 calculations the no2 n accumulation ratio nar fa concentration and fna concentration were calculated using the following equations 25 1 nar no 2 n no 2 n no 3 n 100 2 fa mg l 1 17 14 nh 4 n 10 ph exp 6334 273 t 10 ph 3 fna mg l 1 46 14 no 2 n exp 2300 273 t 10 ph 3 results and discussion 3 1 activated sludge acclimation as depicted in fig 2 when the influent nh4 n concentration was below 100 mg l 1 the effluent showed low nh4 n and no2 n but a high no3 n concentration the accumulation rate and effluent concentration of no2 n went up with the increase of influent nh4 n concentration as the influent nh4 n concentration increased to 600 mg l 1 the no2 n and no3 n concentrations in the effluent were 402 5 mg l 1 and 20 2 mg l 1 respectively the activated sludge achieved excellent shortcut nitrification ability with a nar of 95 the average concentrations of fa and fna were 4 68 mg l 1 and 0 062 mg l 1 respectively the high removal efficiency 75 2 of nh4 n and high concentration of no2 n indicated that aob activity was largely unaffected by fa and fna however nob was remarkably inhibited and the no3 n concentration in the effluent was very low fish results also demonstrated that the number of aob increased while nob were detected with less frequency and in less abundance during the acclimation fig s3 commonly nob was more sensitive to fa or fna than aob the reported fa inhibition thresholds are 10 150 mg l 1 for aob and 0 1 1 0 mg l 1 for nob 26 fna can inhibit the anabolic process of nob at a concentration of 0 011 mg l 1 and completely inhibit their biosynthesis when the concentration reaches 0 023 mg l 1 however aob will not be affected at all except that the fna concentration increases to 0 10 mg l 1 8 the real time water quality monitoring fig s2 implied that the high fa concentration decreased gradually while fna concentration increased during each sbr cycle it has been reported that the alternate treatment approach suppressed the nob more effectively than fna or fa treatment alone and could tackle the adaptation challenges of nob 9 adaptation of nob to the inhibitory factors is mainly due to the physiological changes or the less susceptible nob emerging however the key nob communities e g nitrospira nitrobacter failed to adapt the alternate treatment between fa and fna and could unlikely develop resistance to this strategy providing a possibility for the stable suppression of nob and long term operation of shortcut nitrification 9 in addition the low do concentration 0 5 1 0 mg l 1 also contributed to the enrichment of aob since they have a higher oxygen affinity and are more advantageous for oxygen competition at low do conditions than nob 7 as a result the combo strategy delivered stable shortcut nitrification 3 2 effect of reaction conditions on nitrogen removal 3 2 1 carbon source dosage carbon source is one of the most critical control parameters for the bnr process scnd is put forward as an attractive alternative to complete nitrification since it saves the unnecessary step of no2 n oxidation 5 as shown in fig 3 a and b the removal efficiency of both nh4 n and tn improved when the external carbon source was supplied the increased carbon source can provide more electron donors for denitrifying bacteria dnb and promote denitrification excessive carbon source is generally considered to be adverse to nitrifying bacteria and negative to the nh4 n removal however an appropriate amount of external carbon source will improve the stability of the autotrophic ecosystem and enhance nitrification ability 27 heterotrophic bacteria always act as a protective layer for nitrifying bacteria in the biofilm 27 moreover the external carbon source favored the growth of heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria a special denitrifier that can grow and nitrify n based compounds using organic carbon sources when the ch3coona dosage exceeded 1200 mg l 1 the nh4 n removal efficiency of scndab and scndb decreased mainly because the excessive organics stimulated the growth of heterotrophic bacteria and inhibited the nitrifying bacteria without external carbon source supplying scndab and scndb showed a better tn removal performance than asb proving that scnd was more advantageous for nitrogen removal from wastewater with a low c n ratio than conventional bnr fig 3a showed that when the effluent tn concentration was about 80 mg l 1 the additional carbon source amounts required by scndab scndb and asb were 800 c n 1 5 1000 c n 1 75 and 1800 c n 2 75 mg l 1 respectively table s4 the conventional bnr typically needs a c n ratio of 2 4 to achieve complete denitrification 28 based on stoichiometric eq 4 reducing 1 0 g no3 to n2 requires about 3 6 g ch3coona close to that by asb about 3 5 g ch3coona therefore scndb saved about 44 of carbon sources than the conventional bnr process while scndab saved more than 50 4 5ch 3 coona 8no 3 10 co 2 h 2 o 4 n 2 5naoh 8oh there are many explanations for the carbon source demand reduction in the algal bacterial consortium 13 researchers believe that the symbiotic algae can directly provide a carbon source for dnb 29 additionally algae can also consume a part of nitrogen by assimilation further analysis of the carbon source provided by algae was discussed later in section 3 4 3 2 2 aeration rate as depicted in fig 3c and d both aob and nob were inhibited due to terminal electron acceptor deficiency under a low aeration rate of 0 5 l min 1 do 0 15 mg l 1 the nh4 n oxidation efficiency dramatically improved as the aeration rate increased to 2 l min 1 do 0 52 0 18 mg l 1 the nh4 n removal efficiency of scndab increased slightly as the aeration rate increased to 6 l min 1 do 1 29 0 31 mg l 1 while the tn removal efficiency decreased obviously indicating that a high do concentration was detrimental to the denitrification in the scnd system generally low do concentration is beneficial for the shortcut nitrification start up since the oxygen half saturation constant ko of aob 0 2 0 5 mg o2 l 1 is much lower than that of nob 0 7 2 0 mg o2 l 1 7 30 therefore aob are more advantageous than nob when competing for do however it is reported that shortcut nitrification can be achieved in a wide do concentration range 0 2 3 0 mg l 1 under different operational conditions 31 in this study scndab showed good scnd ability at a low do concentration of 0 28 0 52 mg l 1 the high concentration of do would revive nob and thus disrupt shortcut nitrification when the do concentration exceeded 0 52 mg l 1 the stability of shortcut nitrification would be broken and the tn removal efficiency decreased moreover the sufficient do was favorable to the aerobic bacteria and accelerated carbon source consumption leading to insufficient electron donors for denitrification both scndab and scndb showed higher nitrogen removal efficiency than asb at a low aeration rate of 1 0 l min 1 do 0 28 mg l 1 indicating that scnd reduced the oxygen consumption in the bnr process nitrifying bacteria are not the dominant species in asb they are usually in an inferior position in the competition of oxygen with other heterotrophic bacteria leading to the poor nitrogen removal performance of asb under low do concentration 7 when a satisfactory nh4 n removal efficiency 90 was obtained the do requirements of scndab scndb and asb were 0 28 0 52 and 1 29 mg l 1 respectively meaning that the algal bacterial consortium saved 46 and 78 of oxygen demand respectively compared with scnd without algae and conventional bnr process according to the literature oxygen supplied by algae o algae could meet about 70 of the total oxygen demand for the scnd process in the algal bacterial consortium 2 the influent nh4 n concentration 600 mg l 1 in this study was much higher than in the previous study 300 mg l 1 so more do was needed for ammoxidation however oxygen released through photosynthesis would not increase much resulting in the low proportion of the o algae in the total oxygen demand as the aeration rate increased from 2 0 l min 1 to 6 l min 1 do 1 29 0 31 mg l 1 the nars of scndb and scndab decreased a similar consequence also occurred in the tn removal efficiency this phenomenon might be explained by the fact that high do concentration revived nob and impelled more nh4 n to be oxidized to no3 n 5 as mentioned above high do concentration would impair the dnb and inhibit denitrification making the tn removal efficiency decreased 3 2 3 hrt an appropriate hrt is conducive to maintain the dynamic nutrient balance in the reactor and improve the pollutants removal efficiency fig 3e showed that the removal efficiency of nh4 n and tn was enhanced when the hrt increased from 12 h to 48 h due to the extension of contact time between microorganisms and pollutants the removal efficiency of nh4 n changed little but tn decreased with continually increasing the hrt from 48 h to 72 h a short hrt would result in nitrosation inadequately and an electron acceptor deficiency for denitrification 32 moreover dnb which mainly exist in the anaerobic zone inside the biofilm always need a longer mass transfer time and cannot get adequate nutrients at a short hrt 33 however if hrt is too long do would penetrate into the inner layer of the biofilm destroy the balance of the anaerobic zone and affect the denitrification efficiency 7 furthermore a long hrt would decrease the organic loading rate olr and aggravate the endogenous respiration of the organisms thus reducing the pollutant removal efficiency scndab got an nh4 n removal efficiency of 92 6 which was 6 2 higher than scndb at an hrt of 24 h but both of the two biofilms needed an hrt of 48 h to achieve an optimum tn removal efficiency the real time monitoring results fig 3f of nitrogen concentrations in r1 hrt 48 h showed that the nh4 n concentration declined and no2 n concentration increased during the aeration stage 0 6 h the nh4 n concentration decreased rapidly to 38 3 mg l 1 in r1 within 4 h while it decreased to 45 4 mg l 1 after 6 h in r2 indicating that algal bacterial symbiosis accelerated the shortcut nitrification process 3 3 treatment of biogas slurry fig 4 revealed that scndab showed excellent shortcut nitrification ability with an nh4 n removal efficiency of 92 in bs while the tn removal efficiency was only 75 when sbs was used as an influent in stage i the removal efficiency of nitrogen and cod was stable and practical as the sbs was gradually replaced by bs in stage ii the effluent quality began to deteriorate since bs is typical wastewater with a low c n ratio carbon source will be a limiting factor for denitrification therefore an appropriate dosage of 400 mg l 1 ch3coona was added into the influent in stage iii it was noticeable that the addition of external carbon sources significantly enhanced the denitrification process the concentration of no2 n in the effluent decreased from 48 6 mg l 1 to 0 3 mg l 1 while tn removal efficiency increased from 78 3 to 89 1 an external carbon source also reduced the effluent cod concentration from 554 to 575 mg l 1 to 402 439 mg l 1 suggesting that the refractory organics in the bs could be co metabolized with ch3coona algae separation and collection from the aqueous suspension are tough due to the small cell size and cell densities similar to water 34 few studies have reported the algae removal approach in algal bacterial wastewater treatment 15 35 in this study a bio filter fig 1 was used to collect the suspended algae from the psbbr effluent results showed that nearly 80 of suspended algae were removed by bio filter the chlorophyll a chl a concentration in bio filter effluent decreased to 35 6 57 9 μg l 1 which was far lower than that in psbbr effluent with an average amount of 208 μg l 1 psbbr obtained stable effluent quality after 60 days of operation the main water quality indicators of the effluent met the discharge standard of pollutants for the livestock and poultry industry in china cod 400 nh4 n 80 and tp 8 0 mg l 1 indicating that scndab could serve as a potential technology for the bs treatment 3 4 symbiotic mechanism of algae and bacteria in scndab 3 4 1 release of organic metabolites fig 5 a showed that the cod concentration of the bg11 medium increased during the culturing lc ms results indicated that the major organic matters in the medium after culturing included soluble polysaccharides esters amines and organic acid table s3 in the logarithmic phase chlorella thrived and cod concentration increased rapidly research has established that the extracellular organic matter eom released by microalgae can act as a carbon source for microbial growth 36 as shown in the 3d eem fluorescence spectrum results there were two weak peaks identified as tryptophan analogs related substances peak a em335 ex280 and humic acid ha organic substances peak b em440 ex360 in chlorella culture solution fig 5b scndab eps showed stronger peaks at em350 ex290 and em440 ex360 than scndb eps fig 5c d and these two peaks represent dissolved microbial metabolites and ha respectively moreover the scndab eps showed peaks in em380 ex320 and em500 ex370 representing dissolved microbial metabolites and ha respectively these results demonstrated the type and content increase of ha in eps by algal bacterial symbiosis ha contains numerous redox active molecules and conduces to improve the as activity 37 moreover dissolved ha can be used as an indirect external energy and carbon source for bacteria 38 3 4 2 constituent analysis as illustrated in table 2 the contents of c h and n elements in scndab were higher than those in scndb suggesting that the symbiosis of algae promoted the nutrients utilization of sludge biofilm the aged and falling off biofilm produced by scndab in wastewater treatment accumulated biomass with higher biofuel characteristics than that produced by asb or scndb ft ir also indicated that the characteristic functional groups corresponding to proteins polysaccharides and lipids in scndab eps had stronger absorption band intensity than those in scndb eps fig s4 the constituent analysis demonstrated that scndab was a good feedstock for animal feed preparation or biofuel production due to its high protein and lipid content 3 4 3 microbial community the high throughput genome sequencing htgs of as and biofilms was analyzed to reveal the effect of algal bacterial symbiosis on microbial community structure as shown in fig 6 and table 3 the dominant bacterial populations of the four samples differenced obviously at both phylum and class levels in terms of the phylum level about 14 phyla were found and shown in fig 6a compared with as and asb the abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes in scndb and scndab increased significantly while actinobacteria declined it is acknowledged that nob are widely distributed in nitrobacter nitrococcus nitrospina and nitrospira the abundance of nitrospira a typical nob was high in as 2 19 and asb 7 22 however it decreased to 0 08 and 0 05 respectively in scndb and scndab indicating that nob had been eliminated during the acclimation and were inhibited throughout in the scnd biofilms it is reported that high light intensities affect the synthesis of polypeptides and cytochrome c in nob and consequently decrease the nitrifying activity 17 aob have evolved corresponding coping mechanisms to the cellular membrane damage and growth inhibition induced by ultraviolet a while nob have not 39 in addition to the effect of light nob are also disadvantageous in competition with aob or algae for nutrients uptake due to its low growth rate the inhibitory effects of irradiation and algae growth might contribute to the low abundance of nob in the algal bacterial consortium however it was clear that fa and fna was the main contributor to the inhibition of nob since scndb which was not affected by light and algae also had a similarly low abundance value of nob thirty nine classes were detected in the samples and the top 20 classes were shown in fig 6b actinobacteria and alphaproteobacteria were the two predominant classes in asb accounting for 28 44 and 13 08 respectively but their abundance declined in scndb and scndab while gammaproteobacteria and bacteroidia increased generally gammaproteobacteria was positively correlated with no2 n and had a critical effect on denitrification 40 the top 50 most abundant genera in all samples were analyzed further as shown in the heatmap fig 6c the non overlapping red area between different systems indicated that the disparate dominant species appeared in the four samples asb showed more species than as since biofilm could provide a stable living environment for long generation cycle microorganisms 41 candidatus microthrix was the predominant genus with a relative abundance of 18 60 in the as but it almost disappeared in the biofilm the abundance of nitrosomonas the main functional bacteria of shortcut nitrification was low in as 0 26 and asb 0 45 but increased a lot in scndb 17 04 and scndab 19 81 both the species richness and community diversity of scndb and scndab decreased significantly compared with as and asb fa and fna would affect the microbial community during the long term acclimation 42 the symbiotic algae also have a particular effect on microbial variation the oxygen and carbon sources supplied by the symbiotic algae would promote microbial growth and increase the microbial quantity on the other hand algae may also inhibit bacterial growth and reproduction researchers have found that the metabolites secreted by algae are harmful to some specific bacteria and decrease them in microbial species 43 as a result scndab showed lower community diversity but higher species richness than scndb 3 5 nitrogen metabolism in the psbbr the psbbr system achieved efficient nitrogen removal through the synergism of algae and bacteria including the scnd process of activated sludge and the assimilation of algae the nitrogen metabolic pathway in psbbr during the stable operation period 15 37 d was dissected based on the mass conservation equation eq 5 as illustrated in fig 7 more than 80 of nitrogen was removed through scnd and about 6 8 was removed by biological assimilation one thing to note was that the algal bacterial consortium increased the emission of n2o a potent greenhouse gas and ozone depleting pollutant 24 5 n in n output n d n s uptake n a uptake n v n eff where nin is the total amount of nitrogen in the influent noutput is the nitrogen output amount including the amounts of shortcut nitrification consumption nd the assimilation by sludge biofilm ns uptake and algae na uptake the volatilization nv and the effluent discharge neff according to the composition analysis of denitrifying gaseous products the n2o emission of r1 was 2 higher than that of r2 n2o release occurs in both nitrification and denitrification processes 44 aob stimulate the n2o production through the biotic and abiotic transformations of metabolic intermediates and they are generally considered the primary producers of n2o 45 studies have indicated that aob reduce no2 n to n2o through incomplete hydroxylamine nh2oh oxidation or nitrifier denitrification in the presence of isomeric nitrite reductase nir 46 the interaction of hno2 and nh2oh during the nitrification is considered to be another production pathway of n nitrosation hybrid n2o 44 additionally some heterotrophic microorganisms such as alcaligenes faecalis can nitrify n based compounds and produce n2o in the nh4 n oxidation process 47 scndab showed a higher abundance of aob than scndb which might cause more n2o to be generated there are two causes for n2o production in the denitrification process firstly nitrous oxide reductase nos activity is inhibited which would prevent n2o from being further reduced to n2 secondly some dnb lack nos and n2o is the final denitrification product the dominant bacteria in scndab were thauera with a relative abundance of 45 03 thauera are generally considered active dnb whose nos are easy to be inhibited by high no2 n concentration and some of them even have no nos 48 these reasons make it easy for thauera to accumulate and release n2o during the scnd process especially for the treatment of wastewater with high no2 n concentration additionally the higher abundance of aob in the scndb was conducive to nh4 n oxidation and no2 n accumulation aggravating the nos inhibition and inducing more n2o production 49 moreover studies have shown that some microalgae such as chlorella can synthesize and release n2o during their growth 24 50 microalgae can also affect the ratio between bacterial genes involved in n2o reduction and denitrification thus affecting n2o production 51 heretofore the elucidation of specific sources of n2o in the sludge algae biofilm is still an ongoing challenge for the scndab treatment process more studies such as using other algae species adding different carbon sources or regulating the microbial community structure are required to diminish the n2o emission 4 conclusions a novel shortcut bnr strategy was conducted to treat biogas slurry using activated sludge biofilm coupled with symbiotic algae the optimum reaction conditions of the algal bacterial symbiosis for nitrogen removal were c n ratio of 1 5 do 0 52 0 18 mg l 1 and hrt 48 h nob was stably inhibited by alternate treatment between fa and fna the consortium removed more than 90 of nh4 n from biogas slurry mainly relying on the shortcut nitrification denitrification process and biological assimilation it saved about 50 of external carbon source and reduced about 78 of oxygen demand compared with the conventional bnr process the symbiotic microalgae could supply 46 of the oxygen demand for nitrogen removal aob abundance increased the nitrification process accelerated and the n2o emission amount increased by 2 in the algal bacterial consortium scnd enhanced by microalgae can be developed into a sustainable and low cost technology for high nh4 n wastewater treatment however more attention should be paid to the high n2o release produced by the consortium declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

response surface methodology isotherm and kinetics 1 introduction water pollution has become a serious environmental problem and has attracted global concern in recent years 1 2 pollutants that are of primary concern include metals dyes biodegradable waste phosphates and nitrates hazardous and toxic chemicals radioactive pollutants pharmaceuticals and personal care products 3 4 dyes are a big part of these hazardous materials most of the textile dyes are worrisome as they are often resistant to light and persistent to biodegradation the colored aqueous wastes drained out into adjoining water bodies by industrial units engaged in manufacture production of textile are not only responsible for environmental degradation but are potentially harmful to aquatic biota mainly because of reduced photosynthetic rate depleting dissolved oxygen levels and hindered co2 assimilation thereby affecting plant growth and development and damage to the microbial populations 5 the textile effluents often contain high concentration of dyes 6 which pose human health risks causing various ailments depending upon exposure time and residual dyes concentration the exposure to textile dyes is mainly through oral ingestion or inhalation of dust the synthetic azo dyes most widely used synthetic textile colorant 70 80 and their degraded aromatic amine products are environmentally more toxic with carcinogenic and mutagenic potentials it is known that some dyes are responsible for human bladder cancer splenic sarcoma hepatocarcinoma in animals and the chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells 7 another category of recalcitrant dyes metal complex dyes may cause harmful impact on human organs 8 and oxidative stress exposure to reactive dyes may develop contact dermatitis rhinitis allergic conjunctivitis occupational asthma and other allergic reactions 9 anthraquinone dyes reported to be mutagen mitotic poison and clastogen which may probably promote tumor growth in some fish species 10 and carcinogenic to mice and other rodents 11 12 human exposure presents a substantial impact on immune and reproductive system and demonstrate carcinogenic and genotoxic effects celestine blue b cb a basic oxazine group dye has damaging consequences for human health and can induce severe morbidity if ingested may cause gastrointestinal tract disconcertment which may produce nausea and vomiting the dye and or its metabolites possesses the ability to bind to hemoglobin inhibiting the oxygen uptake capability of blood 13 leading to methemoglobinemia which causes oxygen deficiency euphoria cyanosis ataxia drowsiness lethargy and stupor dyspnea respiratory depression tachycardia or bradycardia and convulsions are some common manifestations of elevated levels of methemoglobin which in acute case may be fatal direct contact with eyes may result in conjunctival redness long term exposure may cause lung pneumoconiosis in order to address growing public health safety concerns and environmental sustainability the dye wastewater needs to be efficaciously treated therefore numerous techniques have been developed over the last few decades for residual dye reduction in aqueous discharges including chemical precipitation ozonation coagulation electro coagulation membrane filtration oxidation processes photo catalysis and biological treatments 14 16 however these techniques are often considered to be of low efficiency economically unfeasible time consuming and are related to excess sludge generation release of toxic by products and operational difficulty 17 conventional separation techniques like sedimentation and flocculation lead to secondary pollution and reduced recyclability among multitude of wastewater decontamination approaches adsorption is considered as the most preferential technique to attenuate different types of contaminants being highly efficient technologically simple and convenient availability of wide range of renewable adsorbent materials high quality of treated water economically and technologically feasible at the industrial scale ease of adsorbent design and synthesis and reusability of the adsorbent 18 19 commercial activated carbons cac due their large internal surface and porous structure have been most widely employed in adsorptive removal of diverse type of pollutants from liquid wastes but are expensive and being microporous in nature they often suffer from low adsorption affinity towards relatively large contaminants moreover the regeneration of saturated carbon often involves loss of adsorbent mass recently the seeds of various trees plants such as aamla jambul tamarind soapnut 20 avocado 21 litsea glutinosa 22 black sapote 23 peganum harmala 24 and brown linseed deoiled cake 25 have attracted great interest as cheap precursors for production of acs for removing various pollutants from wastewater however the custard apple seeds a sustainable agro waste material are still not utilized as a precursor for the preparation of ac the annual production of custard apples in india is estimated to be 228 37 million tons yielding 15 23 g seeds per fruit 26 nanostructured metal oxides have been envisaged as efficient adsorbing materials for environmental pollution remediation owing mainly to their chemical stability higher surface sites and tunable shape and size 27 recently mixed metal oxide nanomaterials are being progressively used as nano sorbents for appropriating pollutants from aqueous phase mostly after their stabilization because of their large specific surface area good adsorption efficiency and mechanical strength 28 31 over the recent years nanocomposites based on metal oxides and activated carbon ac derived from biomass residues have evinced a great interest for water pollutants remediation 32 probably because of their efficient ability to extract various pollutants from solution together with convenient liquid solid separation due to magnetic nature the immobilization of metal oxides onto the powdered activated carbons derived from lignocellulosic waste precursors usually exhibiting heterogeneous surface with meso and micro porous structures 33 and varied surface functional groups results in boosting their adsorption capacity probably because of surface modifications thereby enticing pollutants significantly literature survey points out that only a few studies have been reported on the use of mixed metal oxide ac nanocomposites for dyes removal which include ac nife2o4 magnetic nanocomposite for methyl orange fepbo ac for rhodamine b ac cofe2o4 composite for malachite green and cufe2o4 ac composite for acid orange ii 34 37 in the present article a green approach of microwave assisted preparation of ac from hitherto unused precursor custard apple annona squamosa seeds and bio inspired synthesis of femoo4 nps using lemon citrus limon l fruit extract has been adopted hence reducing the chemical use and energy expenditure in the process unlike surface heating in the conventional furnaces the microwave energy involves volumetric and internal heating during physical activation which ensures a quicker and efficient activation of acs with well developed internal pore structures the hybrid nanocomposite was prepared by growing femoo4 nps onto the cas ac surface using facile co precipitation method metal molybdates a technologically important class of inorganic material find its applications as anodes in li ion batteries and supercapacitors in catalysis 38 and photoluminescence 39 previous studies have reported the use of femoo4 as a catalyst for methanol oxidation dye degradation biosensor and electrode material 40 42 in recent years the green fabrication of nanostructured metal oxides has gained special attention 43 but there is hardly any literature report dealing with bio synthesis of femoo4 nanoparticles the aim of the present work is to examine the adsorption potential of cas ac femoo4 nc in removing a hazardous celestine blue b dye from wastewater and to evaluate various isotherms kinetics and thermodynamic parameters which may prove to be helpful in the design process in the present work a novel adsorbent based on custard apple seeds activated carbon and femoo4 nps is synthesized through energy efficient and environmentally benign route and its adsorptive capability for the sequestration of cb from aqueous solution is investigated the optimization of process parameters is strategized using response surface methodology rsm based on central composite design ccd a

compatible green synthetic approach fresh lemon fruits collected from the local market was thoroughly washed with distilled water to remove any dust and impurities cut into small pieces and ground to obtain a paste about 20 g of the paste was heated on a water bath in 100 ml double distilled water at 333 k for 2 h and then filtered using whatman filter paper aqueous extract 70 ml was added into

distilled water to obtain the test solutions of desired concentrations 30 80 mg l the calibration curve for determining the remaining dye concentrations in solution post adsorption was obtained by plotting the absorbance versus different cb concentrations 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 mg l in solution fig s1 2 4 zero point charge measurement of cas ac femoo4 nanocomposite to determine the ph zpc of cas

intersection of the ph f versus phi curves defined the ph zpc of the nc 2 5 adsorption studies adsorption process was devised using central composite design ccd which groups design points into 3 types i two level factorial or fractional factorial design points which account for all possible combinations of highest and the lowest level of factors ii axial points also referred to as star points α 0 α 0 0 α 0 α the value of α was chosen to be 1 which is referred to as face centered central composite design this is advantageous as it leads to a three level design system thereby ensuring that the axial points are not beyond the factorial portion and iii center points 0 0 which are the points that correspond to the mid point of each factor range ccd was employed to develop a regression equation to analyze the effect of contact time x 1 ph x 2 nanocomposite dose x 3 initial cb concentration x 4 and temperature x 5 on adsorption capacity q e table 1 represents the values assigned to 1 0 and 1 levels of the factors the involved factors were varied between high low and central levels to fit a polynomial equation of the form eq 1 1 y ȃ 0 i 1 k ȃ i χ i i 1 k ȃ ii χ i 2 i 1 k j 1 k ȃ ij χ i χ j i j where y represents the chosen response total number of process variables involved is represented by k ȃ 0 is the constant coefficient ȃi ȃii and ȃij represent the coefficient of linear quadratic and interaction effects respectively χ i and χ j are attributed as the coded independent variables and is the error 46 all 50 runs suggested by the design expert software were performed as given in table 2 during adsorption experiments the agglomeration tendency of the adsorbent particles was minimized by agitating the mixture in a water bath shaker at 200 rpm the corresponding q e values were determined using the relationship eq 2 2 q e c i c e v m where c i and c e mg l are initial and equilibrium cb concentrations in the liquid phase respectively q e is the adsorption capacity mg g v is the volume of cb solution l and m is the adsorbent mass gm equation in terms of coded and actual factors were generated and the validity of the model was verified using the statistical analysis of variance anova 3d response surface plots were utilized for describing the relation of q e with individual factors and their interdependence numerical optimization was carried out to obtain the equilibrium conditions for cb sequestration the adsorption isotherm studies were performed at 298 303 and 308 k by agitating 20 mg of adsorbent with 25 ml of cb solution of different initial concentrations 30 80 mg l in 50 ml conical flasks for equilibrium time at ph 7 for kinetic studies experiments were conducted in a similar manner by agitating cb solution 25 ml at three different initial cb concentrations 60 70 80 mg l with 20 mg of cas ac femoo4 nc in 50 ml erlenmeyer flasks for 10 60 min the supernatant was analyzed spectrophotometrically for residual concentration at 10 min intervals 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of femoo4 and cas ac femoo4 nanocomposite the adsorbent was tested for any leaching effects which could lead to a biased analyses post adsorption for this purpose a small amount of the adsorbent 0 05 g was dispersed in water and allowed to stay for 24 h a clear supernatant indicated negligible leaching effect successful preparation of femoo4 nps was confirmed by xrd analysis x ray diffractogram fig 1 shows the highest intensity peak 100 at 2θ 26 followed by several other peaks of lower intensity the reflection peaks could be indexed to jcpds no 89 2367 with peaks at 23 16 31 10 33 12 38 14 44 16 46 14 52 10 53 14 and 58 12 40 a slight decrease in the intensity of peak at 2θ 26 in the xrd pattern of cas ac femoo4 nc clearly indicates the successful amalgamation of magnetic femoo4 nps and cas ac the specific surface area s bet pore volume and pore diameter of cas ac femoo4 nc is found to be 12 7 m2 g 0 06 cm3 g and 12 13 nm respectively the pore diameter lying between 2 and 50 nm and type 4 n2 adsorption desorption isotherm as per iupac isotherm classifications fig s3 points out its mesoporous nature 47 49 although the surface area of nc may tend to decrease after nps loading but there are several studies that show an improvement in the surface area of the acs after nps loading 50 the femoo4 nps exhibits sbet 9 03 m2 g pore volume 0 03 cm3 g and pore diameter 2 19 nm the cas ac femoo4 nc however demonstrates an improved sbet 12 68 m2 g pore volume 0 055 cm3 g and pore diameter 12 13 nm similar results have been reported for ac ceria 51 and fe3o4 ac nanocomposites 52 however the mesoporous cas ac femoo4 nc possesses comparatively low sbet similar low surface areas for many nanocomposites such as fe3o4 c 13 0 m2 g 53 snmo bimetallic oxide porous carbon 14 85 m2 g 54 zno a comosus waste composite 10 56 m2 g 55 magnetic cellulose fe3o4 ac composite 11 9 m2 g 56 etc have been reported by several authors the higher surface area of adsorbents is generally related to high adsorption capacity but many adsorbents with low surface areas such as lanthanum and nano magnetite composite incorporated palm shell waste based activated carbon 32 7 m2 g 57 gac mnfe2o4 composite 43 4 m2 g 58 show high adsorption capacities for arsenate 227 60 mg g and arsenite 1253 00 mg g respectively in contrast mesoporous silica sba 15 with high sbet of 809 m2 g has the prednisolone drug loading efficiency of 32 7 49 morphologies of the pristine femoo4 nps native and cb loaded nanocomposite along with their elemental compositions were studied using sem eds and tem analyses sem micrograph of cas ac femoo4 fig 2b shows that the nanocomposite possesses irregular morphology containing rough and porous surfaces of different shapes and sizes ensuring potential adsorption sites with visible femoo4 brighter particles adhering onto the cas ac surface the additional irregular cavities in sem micrographs and peaks of c o and p in eds spectrum of cas ac femoo4 nc fig 2b as compared to those of femoo4 nps fig 2a imply the successful incorporation of femoo4 in the cas activated carbon matrix a relatively smoother surface of cas ac femoo4 cb along with the corresponding eds spectrum consisting of additional peaks for n fig 2c confirms the adsorption of cb onto the adsorbent surface tem micrograph fig 3a reveals a random distribution of femoo4 nps into the ac matrix average size of nanocomposite particles determined from the particle distribution curve fig 3b is 37 nm the ftir spectrum of pristine femoo4 nps fig 4 a displays a narrow vibrational band at 829 cm 1 with a shoulder at 932 cm 1 characteristic of moomo 59 and feomo stretching vibrations 60 respectively additional bands appearing at 1370 and 1462 cm 1 may be attributed to carboxylate carbonate structures present due to incomplete decomposition of organic acid used at low temperature heat treatment and or adsorbed co2 or co molecules 61 bands at 1632 and 3062 cm 1 appear due hydroxyl bending and stretching modes of adsorbed water molecules a change in intensity of the characteristic bands of femoo4 829 and 932 cm 1 in cas ac femoo4 fig 4b is observed after composite formation the peaks lying at 1497 and 1600 cm 1 can be assigned to bending modes of ch groups and stretching modes of aromatic rings present in ac respectively 62 a small peak at 1071 cm 1 may be ascribed to pop symmetrical vibrations or acid phosphate esters 63 fig 4c shows the ir spectrum of cb loaded cas ac femoo4 nc the observed decrease in the intensity of moomo band at 829 cm 1 and subsequent disappearance of feomo stretching frequency band confirmed the successful adsorption of the dye molecules the bands at 1647 and 3454 cm 1 is attributed to the amide groups of adsorbed cb molecules a broad band centered at 1485 cm 1 indicates the existence of carbonyl group involved in h bonding with cb molecules masked by ch2 bands in ac as well as cb 3 2 model fitting and statistical analysis of adsorption studies based on the statistical analysis of the observed q e values 2fi model is found to be the best fit the following empirical relation eq 3 for q e in terms of coded factors is thus obtained 3 q e 48 59 1 57 a 0 50 b 14 69 c 15 92 d 2 13 e 0 51 ab 2 34 ac 1 14 ad 2 54 ae 0 093 bc 7 03 1e 003 bd 0 28 be 3 84 cd 1 83 ce 1 07 de within the anova test parameters a high f value of 26 99 implies that the contribution of the model to mean squares is larger than that of error mean square thus ensuring that the regression equation obtained is capable of successfully explaining most of the variation in the observed response there is only a 0 01 chance that an f value this large could occur due to noise the significance of the model is further validated by the value of prob f or the p values which are lower than 0 0001 table 3 summarizes the anova results for 2fi response surface model and table 4 shows the model summary statistics a high r squared value of 0 9225 is indicative of the fact that the chosen model can successfully explain almost 92 of the response variation additionally a difference of less than 0 2 between predicted r squared and adjusted r squared establishes the reliability of the model based on relative standard deviation cv having a value of 13 43 it may be concluded that the chosen model is practically reproducible adequate precision of 20 192 depicts a high signal to noise ratio implying that the model could be utilized to navigate the design space the nature of regression coefficients is helpful in assessing the effect of model terms on the values of q e the negative coefficient values for nanocomposite dose show its antagonistic effect which is a decrease in q e however the positive coefficients of initial solution ph initial cb concentration contact time and temperature advocate an increase in q e in the factorial range further the f values of the model terms have been used as a tool to analyze the relative effect of the terms on q e the values of prob f less than 0 0500 indicate that c d ae cd are the significant model terms higher f values for dose 172 16 and concentration 202 33 depict their greater effect on q e as compared to the other terms moreover the higher values of sum of the squared deviations from the mean for dose concentration and temperature confirm their higher comparative effect on variation of q e the normal probability plot fig 5 a satisfies the normal distribution as the plot nearly followed a straight line affirming that the residuals follow normal distribution while predicted versus actual q e plot fig 5 b assert the significant prediction capability of the model 64 67 3 3 optimization of process variables 3d response surface curves presented in fig 6 corroborates the simultaneous effect of dose and concentration on q e the adsorbent dosage has been observed to affect the q e antagonistically which can be attributed to a decrease in the number of active sites on adsorbent surface due to aggregation phenomenon that leads to an overall decrease in the available surface area the near doubling of q e with an increase in concentration of cb solution in the factorial range demonstrates the shifting of equilibrium to a high adsorption region due to concentration gradient 68 the presence of necessary driving force continues to increase the q e till the optimal level of dye concentration fig 7 shows the statistical interactive effect of ph and time on q e a gradual increase in adsorption with increasing ph in the given time range has been observed however the increase in contact time displays a profound effect on q e values which increases from 84 7 to 90 7 mg g the increased time augment the adsorption process by providing the opportunity for dye molecules to saturate the adsorbent surface it is evident from fig 7 that the alteration in the initial solution ph did not affect the q e much and a considerably constant qe value is observed throughout the ph range the phzpc of cas ac femoo4 nc is 7 2 which means that the adsorbent possesses a positive surface charge below phzpc and negatively charged surface above this value this may lead to electrostatic repulsion and attraction between cb and cas ac femoo4 nc surface thereby affecting the cb uptake however from the experimental results it can be seen that the uptake is hardly affected by alteration in solution ph thus ruling out electrostatic interaction as the dominant mechanism this further supports the fact that the mechanism of adsorption primarily involves hydrogen bonding and π π interactions 69 the interactive effect of time and temperature on q e is depicted in fig 8 at low contact time q e increases from 69 to 84 mg g with increase in temperature from 298 k to 308 k this observation points towards the endothermic nature of adsorption process and enhancement of pore size and adsorbate mobility however the adsorption capacity with temperature decreases with increase in time at high contact time the saturation of active sites even at lower temperature may be responsible for lower increment in q e the synergistic impact of time and temperature favors continuous q e amplification until optimal level is achieved 3 4 optimization of cb removal by desirability calculations the determination of optimal values of the involved process parameters and the corresponding cb adsorption was done by employing desirability function df the preferred conditions included minimum dose and maximum dye concentration and maximized q e the conditions for optimum dye sequestration are found to be 0 8 g l dose 60 min contact time 80 mg l initial cb concentration and ph 2 at 308 k fig s4 represents the optimization ramps the obtained optimized conditions were used in further studies however as q e almost shows a steady rate with ph increment therefore rest of the investigations were carried out at ph 7 as the ph of most water bodies is around 6 8 3 5 isotherm analyses of adsorption of cb onto cas ac femoo4 nanocomposite analyses of adsorption isotherms provide a qualitative and quantitative explanation of interaction of pollutant species with the adsorbent material at a fixed temperature the parameters deduced from different isotherm models provide valuable information about the surface properties affinities of the adsorbent and the adsorption mechanisms in addition the isotherms help determine the nature of adsorption and are used to calculate the adsorption capacity in present study langmuir freundlich temkin and d r isotherms have been used to study the experimental data langmuir model represented by eq 4 70 hypothesizes monolayer adsorption on adsorbent surface with finite number of energetically indistinguishable sites additionally it ignores the possibility of interaction between neighboring adsorbed molecules 4 q e q m b c e 1 b c e 5 r l 1 1 b c o where q m is the monolayer adsorption capacity and b is the langmuir constant l mg which describes the affinity of adsorbent sites towards the adsorbate particles the values of both these parameters can be calculated from q e versus c e plot another important parameter calculated from langmuir model is the dimensionless separation factor r l eq 5 whose values help in identifying the nature favorable linear or irreversible of the adsorption process freundlich isotherm model is not confined to assumption of monolayer adsorption it describes the simultaneous uptake of two or more adsorbent particles by a single adsorbent site it hypothesizes the favorable occupation of stronger binding sites accompanied by a decrease in adsorption intensity with increasing site occupation non linearized freundlich model is represented by eq 6 71 6 q e k f c e 1 n f where freundlich constant k f and heterogeneity factor n f are constants which are indicative of adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity respectively 1 n f is referred to as freundlich exponent its value between 0 and 1 validates favorable adsorption while1 n f 1 and 1 n f 0 depict unfavorable and reversible adsorption respectively temkin isotherm model eq 7 is useful for analyzing adsorption onto heterogeneous surface it takes into account adsorbate adsorbate interaction as well and proposes a linear decrease in the heat of adsorption with increasing coverage due to such interactions 7 q e β t ln k t c e where β t rt b t and b t is the heat of adsorption kj mol and k t is the equilibrium binding constant related to binding energy 72 d r isotherm eq 7 is functional in determining the nature of adsorption based on calculated energy values being similar to langmuir it differs only in its assumption of a porous surface instead of a homogeneous one 73 8 q e q d exp k d ln 1 1 c e 2 9 k d b d r 2 t 2 10 e 1 2 b d where k d calculated using eq 9 is the activity coefficient and e kj mol eq 10 is the molar adsorption energy which is the decisive factor for nature of adsorption table 5 contains all parameters calculated from the various isotherms model the value of e lower than 8 kj mol is indicative of physical and 8 16 kj mol of chemical adsorption respectively 74 the e values 1 14 1 59 kj mol below 8 kj mol is suggestive of physical adsorption of cb the freundlich isotherm model has the highest regression coefficient values at all the three temperatures followed by langmuir fig s5a temkin fig s5b and d r fig s5c models high r 2 values 0 980 0 981 and low see values 3 07 3 21 for freundlich model implies that it is the most appropriate model to explain the nature of adsorption therefore adsorption of cb onto cas ac femoo4 nc can be described as multilayer adsorption on energetically distinguishable sites fig 9 a shows the freundlich isotherm plots for cb adsorption onto cas ac femoo4 nc evidently the observed q e are higher than that of cb adsorption onto femoo4 nps fig 9 b additionally 1 n f values between 0 43 and 0 50 advocate a favorable adsorption process at all test temperatures which is further confirmed by the r l values 0 04 0 06 similar results have been previously reported by hussain et al 30 langmuir adsorption capacity q m 112 84 121 25 mg g and b values 0 21 0 54 l mg confirm significant adsorption capacity heat of adsorption b t values l g calculated from temkin isotherm are suggestive of physical nature of adsorption further a considerable increase in temkin binding constant k t with temperature indicates an endothermic adsorption process which is confirmed by the positive energy of adsorption e kj mol calculated from d r isotherm model a comparative account of adsorption performance of various adsorbents in terms of q m values for basic dyes uptake from aqueous solution is reported in table 6 the prepared adsorbent displays a relatively higher affinity towards cb removal 3 6 kinetic analyses of adsorption of cb onto cas ac femoo4 nanocomposite the kinetic studies are important to understand the adsorbate uptake rate which determines the retention time needed for completion of adsorption and the adsorption mechanism the kinetic parameters are useful in the design of prospective adsorption system on a pilot scale 87 the kinetic data has been analyzed using non linear forms of pseudo first and pseudo second order models represented by eqs 11 and 12 respectively the pseudo first order model presumes the adsorption of one adsorbate species onto single unoccupied active site whereas pseudo second order model assumes that one molecule is adsorbed onto a pair of vacant surface sites 88 89 11 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 12 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where q e and q t are the adsorption capacity at equilibrium and at time t k 1 and k 2 are pseudo first order 1 min and pseudo second order g mg min rate constants respectively plot of q t versus t fig 10 helps determine the k 2 and q e values while k 1 was calculated from q t versus t fig s6 all the calculated parameters are tabulated in table 7 the best fitting of pseudo second order was established on the basis of high r 2 values 0 905 0 960 in comparison to that of pseudo first order model 0 606 0 786 which confirms that the adsorption of cb onto cas ac femoo4 nc is influenced by the number of binding sites rather than the concentration of cb 3 7 diffusion model analysis of adsorption of cb onto cas ac femoo4 nanocomposite in order to account for the mechanistic step s involved in rate controlling process of adsorption the data is required to be analyzed by the diffusion models the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model and boyd kinetic model are used to analyze the kinetic data eq 13 states the intraparticle diffusion model 90 where q t mg g is the adsorption capacity at t time k i is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant mg g min0 5 and c i is the intercept the magnitude of k i and c i may be obtained from the linear plot of q t versus t 0 5 13 q t k i t 0 5 c i eq 14 states the boyd kinetic model or liquid film diffusion model 91 as 14 ln 1 f k l t where k l 1 min is liquid film diffusion rate constant and f is calculated as q e q t three identified steps involved in adsorption mechanism are i instantaneous or external surface adsorption ii diffusion to inner active sites and iii equilibrium stage or saturation intraparticle diffusion model is valid if a straight line plot un deviated from the origin is obtained for q t versus t 0 5 thus making the above three steps indistinguishable 92 however in the present study a multi linear plot fig 11 a over the entire adsorption process was obtained where each segment corresponds to a single controlling mechanism or several controlling mechanisms simultaneously intraparticle diffusion is the controlling mechanism in the second stage and further its effect is reduced in the third or the saturation step multi linearity and positive slope imply that intraparticle diffusion is not the sole rate controlling mechanism in the adsorption process similarly in the case of boyd kinetic model a linear plot fig 11b with positive slope consequently rules out the possibility of it being the sole controller of adsorption mechanism such observations indicate that both the models control the overall adsorption process the values of various diffusion parameters are summarized in table 8 3 8 thermodynamic analysis of cb adsorption onto cas ac femoo4 nanocomposite the thermodynamic parameters provide useful information with regard to the adsorption process the free energy change δg must always be negative which signifies spontaneity and feasibility of the adsorption phenomena the log k a q e c e versus 1 t plot van t hoff plot is used to estimate the enthalpy change δh r slope and entropy change δs r intercept when δh 0 the adsorption is endothermic whereas when δh 0 the adsorption is exothermic similarly entropy change δs 0 indicates an increased randomness while δs 0 suggests a decrease in randomness at solid solution interface the thermodynamic studies of the adsorption of cb onto cas ac femoo4 nc were performed at 298 303 and 308 k thermodynamic parameters such as free energy change δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs were calculated using the gibbs equation eq 15 and van t hoff equation eq 16 15 g o h o t s o 16 log k a s o 2 303 r h o 2 303 rt where k a q e c e r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is the absolute temperature in k the δh and s values were obtained from the slope and intercept of linear van t hoff plot fig s7 according to eq 16 the calculated thermodynamic parameters are tabulated in table 9 the negative values of δg 5 76 7 55 kj mol validates the spontaneity and feasibility of the adsorption of cb onto cas ac femoo4 nc whereas the positive value of s 0 18 kj mol k can be attributed to the increase in randomness at the adsorbent dye solution interface the increment in δg with rise in temperature indicates that cb is favorably adsorbed onto the nc at high temperature the endothermic nature of adsorption is confirmed by the positive value of δh 47 72 kj mol the δh value falls close to 10 40 kj mol range 93 prescribed for physical adsorption 3 9 proposed mechanism of adsorption process fig 12 provides a schematic representation of the most probable mechanism of cb adsorption onto cas ac femoo4 nc the physical nature of adsorption process as suggested by temkin isotherm model the trend in q e values with alteration in ph implied the adsorption mechanism s independence from electrostatic interactions the involvement of hydrogen bonding between the carboxylic hydroxyl groups on the adsorbent surface and nh or oh groups of the cb molecules are evidenced by lowering of carbonyl group bending frequencies 1497 to 1485 cm 1 and amide group co and nh stretching frequency 1690 to 1647 cm 1 and 3500 to 3454 cm 1 respectively in the ftir spectrum of dye loaded cas ac femoo4 nc additionally the presence of aromatic rings on the adsorbent surface as well as in the dye molecules ensure the possibility of adsorption of dye via π π stacking

1 g adsorbs a decent amount of cb 76 mg g from the wastewater sample after 60 min fig 13 but its q e is expectedly lower than that observed in aqueous solution due to interference of other contaminants present in it the study reveals that the nc can be used to effectively treat cb laden real effluent 4 conclusions a novel cas ac femoo4 nanocomposite is synthesized by green and energy

response surface methodology isotherm and kinetics 1 introduction water pollution has become a serious environmental problem and has attracted global concern in recent years 1 2 pollutants that are of primary concern include metals dyes biodegradable waste phosphates and nitrates hazardous and toxic chemicals radioactive pollutants pharmaceuticals and personal care products 3 4 dyes are a big part of these hazardous materials most of the textile dyes are worrisome as they are often resistant to light and persistent to biodegradation the colored aqueous wastes drained out into adjoining water bodies by industrial units engaged in manufacture production of textile are not only responsible for environmental degradation but are potentially harmful to aquatic biota mainly because of reduced photosynthetic rate depleting dissolved oxygen levels and hindered co2 assimilation thereby affecting plant growth and development and damage to the microbial populations 5 the textile effluents often contain high concentration of dyes 6 which pose human health risks causing various ailments depending upon exposure time and residual dyes concentration the exposure to textile dyes is mainly through oral ingestion or inhalation of dust the synthetic azo dyes most widely used synthetic textile colorant 70 80 and their degraded aromatic amine products are environmentally more toxic with carcinogenic and mutagenic potentials it is known that some dyes are responsible for human bladder cancer splenic sarcoma hepatocarcinoma in animals and the chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells 7 another category of recalcitrant dyes metal complex dyes may cause harmful impact on human organs 8 and oxidative stress exposure to reactive dyes may develop contact dermatitis rhinitis allergic conjunctivitis occupational asthma and other allergic reactions 9 anthraquinone dyes reported to be mutagen mitotic poison and clastogen which may probably promote tumor growth in some fish species 10 and carcinogenic to mice and other rodents 11 12 human exposure presents a substantial impact on immune and reproductive system and demonstrate carcinogenic and genotoxic effects celestine blue b cb a basic oxazine group dye has damaging consequences for human health and can induce severe morbidity if ingested may cause gastrointestinal tract disconcertment which may produce nausea and vomiting the dye and or its metabolites possesses the ability to bind to hemoglobin inhibiting the oxygen uptake capability of blood 13 leading to methemoglobinemia which causes oxygen deficiency euphoria cyanosis ataxia drowsiness lethargy and stupor dyspnea respiratory depression tachycardia or bradycardia and convulsions are some common manifestations of elevated levels of methemoglobin which in acute case may be fatal direct contact with eyes may result in conjunctival redness long term exposure may cause lung pneumoconiosis in order to address growing public health safety concerns and environmental sustainability the dye wastewater needs to be efficaciously treated therefore numerous techniques have been developed over the last few decades for residual dye reduction in aqueous discharges including chemical precipitation ozonation coagulation electro coagulation membrane filtration oxidation processes photo catalysis and biological treatments 14 16 however these techniques are often considered to be of low efficiency economically unfeasible time consuming and are related to excess sludge generation release of toxic by products and operational difficulty 17 conventional separation techniques like sedimentation and flocculation lead to secondary pollution and reduced recyclability among multitude of wastewater decontamination approaches adsorption is considered as the most preferential technique to attenuate different types of contaminants being highly efficient technologically simple and convenient availability of wide range of renewable adsorbent materials high quality of treated water economically and technologically feasible at the industrial scale ease of adsorbent design and synthesis and reusability of the adsorbent 18 19 commercial activated carbons cac due their large internal surface and porous structure have been most widely employed in adsorptive removal of diverse type of pollutants from liquid wastes but are expensive and being microporous in nature they often suffer from low adsorption affinity towards relatively large contaminants moreover the regeneration of saturated carbon often involves loss of adsorbent mass recently the seeds of various trees plants such as aamla jambul tamarind soapnut 20 avocado 21 litsea glutinosa 22 black sapote 23 peganum harmala 24 and brown linseed deoiled cake 25 have attracted great interest as cheap precursors for production of acs for removing various pollutants from wastewater however the custard apple seeds a sustainable agro waste material are still not utilized as a precursor for the preparation of ac the annual production of custard apples in india is estimated to be 228 37 million tons yielding 15 23 g seeds per fruit 26 nanostructured metal oxides have been envisaged as efficient adsorbing materials for environmental pollution remediation owing mainly to their chemical stability higher surface sites and tunable shape and size 27 recently mixed metal oxide nanomaterials are being progressively used as nano sorbents for appropriating pollutants from aqueous phase mostly after their stabilization because of their large specific surface area good adsorption efficiency and mechanical strength 28 31 over the recent years nanocomposites based on metal oxides and activated carbon ac derived from biomass residues have evinced a great interest for water pollutants remediation 32 probably because of their efficient ability to extract various pollutants from solution together with convenient liquid solid separation due to magnetic nature the immobilization of metal oxides onto the powdered activated carbons derived from lignocellulosic waste precursors usually exhibiting heterogeneous surface with meso and micro porous structures 33 and varied surface functional groups results in boosting their adsorption capacity probably because of surface modifications thereby enticing pollutants significantly literature survey points out that only a few studies have been reported on the use of mixed metal oxide ac nanocomposites for dyes removal which include ac nife2o4 magnetic nanocomposite for methyl orange fepbo ac for rhodamine b ac cofe2o4 composite for malachite green and cufe2o4 ac composite for acid orange ii 34 37 in the present article a green approach of microwave assisted preparation of ac from hitherto unused precursor custard apple annona squamosa seeds and bio inspired synthesis of femoo4 nps using lemon citrus limon l fruit extract has been adopted hence reducing the chemical use and energy expenditure in the process unlike surface heating in the conventional furnaces the microwave energy involves volumetric and internal heating during physical activation which ensures a quicker and efficient activation of acs with well developed internal pore structures the hybrid nanocomposite was prepared by growing femoo4 nps onto the cas ac surface using facile co precipitation method metal molybdates a technologically important class of inorganic material find its applications as anodes in li ion batteries and supercapacitors in catalysis 38 and photoluminescence 39 previous studies have reported the use of femoo4 as a catalyst for methanol oxidation dye degradation biosensor and electrode material 40 42 in recent years the green fabrication of nanostructured metal oxides has gained special attention 43 but there is hardly any literature report dealing with bio synthesis of femoo4 nanoparticles the aim of the present work is to examine the adsorption potential of cas ac femoo4 nc in removing a hazardous celestine blue b dye from wastewater and to evaluate various isotherms kinetics and thermodynamic parameters which may prove to be helpful in the design process in the present work a novel adsorbent based on custard apple seeds activated carbon and femoo4 nps is synthesized through energy efficient and environmentally benign route and its adsorptive capability for the sequestration of cb from aqueous solution is investigated the optimization of process parameters is strategized using response surface methodology rsm based on central composite design ccd a statistical experimental design technique that helps in simultaneous analysis of the relative effects of contributing factors 44 it is functional in reducing the number of experiments materials required and the time consumed in contrast to conventional batch methodology 45 the maximum saturation capacity and removal rate constants have been appraised in terms of various equilibrium isotherms

compatible green synthetic approach fresh lemon fruits collected from the local market was thoroughly washed with distilled water to remove any dust and impurities cut into small pieces and ground to obtain a paste about 20 g of the paste was heated on a water bath in 100 ml double distilled water at 333 k for 2 h and then filtered using whatman filter paper aqueous extract 70 ml was added into 200 ml of nh4 6mo7o24 solution 0 5 mol l with stirring to it was added 100 ml of fe no3 3 solution 0 5 mol l gradually under vigorous stirring the yellow suspension of femoo4 nps was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min oven dried at 363 373 k overnight and calcined at 673 k under microwave heating for 15 min for the preparation of cas ac femoo4 nc 1 5 g of cas ac was added to the yellow suspension

distilled water to obtain the test solutions of desired concentrations 30 80 mg l the calibration curve for determining the remaining dye concentrations in solution post adsorption was obtained by plotting the absorbance versus different cb concentrations 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 mg l in solution fig s1 2 4 zero point charge measurement of cas ac femoo4 nanocomposite to determine the ph zpc of cas ac femoo4 nc nacl solutions 0 01 mol l 50 ml were taken into nine separate 250 ml stoppered conical flasks and their initial phs ph i were maintained at 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 using hcl or naoh 0 1

intersection of the ph f versus phi curves defined the ph zpc of the nc 2 5 adsorption studies adsorption process was devised using central composite design ccd which groups design points into 3 types i two level factorial or fractional factorial design points which account for all possible combinations of highest and the lowest level of factors ii axial points also referred to as star points α 0 α 0 0 α 0 α the value of α was chosen to be 1 which is referred to as face centered central composite design this is advantageous as it leads to a three level design system thereby ensuring that the axial points are not beyond the factorial portion and iii center points 0 0 which are the points that correspond to the mid point of each factor range ccd was employed to develop a regression equation to analyze the effect of contact time x 1 ph x 2 nanocomposite dose x 3 initial cb concentration x 4 and temperature x 5 on adsorption capacity q e table 1 represents the values assigned to 1 0 and 1 levels of the factors the involved factors were varied between high low and central levels to fit a polynomial equation of the form eq 1 1 y ȃ 0 i 1 k ȃ i χ i i 1 k ȃ ii χ i 2 i 1 k j 1 k ȃ ij χ i χ j i j where y represents the chosen response total number of process variables involved is represented by k ȃ 0 is the constant coefficient ȃi ȃii and ȃij represent the coefficient of linear quadratic and interaction effects respectively χ i and χ j are attributed as the coded independent variables and is the error 46 all 50 runs suggested by the design expert software were performed as given in table 2 during adsorption experiments the agglomeration tendency of the adsorbent particles was minimized by agitating the mixture in a water bath shaker at 200 rpm the corresponding q e values were determined using the relationship eq 2 2 q e c i c e v m where c i and c e mg l are initial and equilibrium cb concentrations in the liquid phase respectively q e is the adsorption capacity mg g v is the volume of cb solution l and m is the adsorbent mass gm equation in terms of coded and actual factors were generated and the validity of the model was verified using the statistical analysis of variance anova 3d response surface plots were utilized for describing the relation of q e with individual factors and their interdependence numerical optimization was carried out to obtain the equilibrium conditions for cb sequestration the adsorption isotherm studies were performed at 298 303 and 308 k by agitating 20 mg of adsorbent with 25 ml of cb solution of different initial concentrations 30 80 mg l in 50 ml conical flasks for equilibrium time at ph 7 for kinetic studies experiments were conducted in a similar manner by agitating cb solution 25 ml at three different initial cb concentrations 60 70 80 mg l with 20 mg of cas ac femoo4 nc in 50 ml erlenmeyer flasks for 10 60 min the supernatant was analyzed spectrophotometrically for residual concentration at 10 min intervals 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of femoo4 and cas ac femoo4 nanocomposite the adsorbent was tested for any leaching effects which could lead to a biased analyses post adsorption for this purpose a small amount of the adsorbent 0 05 g was dispersed in water and allowed to stay for 24 h a clear supernatant indicated negligible leaching effect successful preparation of femoo4 nps was confirmed by xrd analysis x ray diffractogram fig 1 shows the highest intensity peak 100 at 2θ 26 followed by several other peaks of lower intensity the reflection peaks could be indexed to jcpds no 89 2367 with peaks at 23 16 31 10 33 12 38 14 44 16 46 14 52 10 53 14 and 58 12 40 a slight decrease in the intensity of peak at 2θ 26 in the xrd pattern of cas ac femoo4 nc clearly indicates the successful amalgamation of magnetic femoo4 nps and cas ac the specific surface area s bet pore volume and pore diameter of cas ac femoo4 nc is found to be 12 7 m2 g 0 06 cm3 g and 12 13 nm respectively the pore diameter lying between 2 and 50 nm and type 4 n2 adsorption desorption isotherm as per iupac isotherm classifications fig s3 points out its mesoporous nature 47 49 although the surface area of nc may tend to decrease after nps loading but there are several studies that show an improvement in the surface area of the acs after nps loading 50 the femoo4 nps exhibits sbet 9 03 m2 g pore volume 0 03 cm3 g and pore diameter 2 19 nm the cas ac femoo4 nc however demonstrates an improved sbet 12 68 m2 g pore volume 0 055 cm3 g and pore diameter 12 13 nm similar results have been reported for ac ceria 51 and fe3o4 ac nanocomposites 52 however the mesoporous cas ac femoo4 nc possesses comparatively low sbet similar low surface areas for many nanocomposites such as fe3o4 c 13 0 m2 g 53 snmo bimetallic oxide porous carbon 14 85 m2 g 54 zno a comosus waste composite 10 56 m2 g 55 magnetic cellulose fe3o4 ac composite 11 9 m2 g 56 etc have been reported by several authors the higher surface area of adsorbents is generally related to high adsorption capacity but many adsorbents with low surface areas such as lanthanum and nano magnetite composite incorporated palm shell waste based activated carbon 32 7 m2 g 57 gac mnfe2o4 composite 43 4 m2 g 58 show high adsorption capacities for arsenate 227 60 mg g and arsenite 1253 00 mg g respectively in contrast mesoporous silica sba 15 with high sbet of 809 m2 g has the prednisolone drug loading efficiency of 32 7 49 morphologies of the pristine femoo4 nps native and cb loaded nanocomposite along with their elemental compositions were studied using sem eds and tem analyses sem micrograph of cas ac femoo4 fig 2b shows that the nanocomposite possesses irregular morphology containing rough and porous surfaces of different shapes and sizes ensuring potential adsorption sites with visible femoo4 brighter particles adhering onto the cas ac surface the additional irregular cavities in sem micrographs and peaks of c o and p in eds spectrum of cas ac femoo4 nc fig 2b as compared to those of femoo4 nps fig 2a imply the successful incorporation of femoo4 in the cas activated carbon matrix a relatively smoother surface of cas ac femoo4 cb along with the corresponding eds spectrum consisting of additional peaks for n fig 2c confirms the adsorption of cb onto the adsorbent surface tem micrograph fig 3a reveals a random distribution of femoo4 nps into the ac matrix average size of nanocomposite particles determined from the particle distribution curve fig 3b is 37 nm the ftir spectrum of pristine femoo4 nps fig 4 a displays a narrow vibrational band at 829 cm 1 with a shoulder at 932 cm 1 characteristic of moomo 59 and feomo stretching vibrations 60 respectively additional bands appearing at 1370 and 1462 cm 1 may be attributed to carboxylate carbonate structures present due to incomplete decomposition of organic acid used at low temperature heat treatment and or adsorbed co2 or co molecules 61 bands at 1632 and 3062 cm 1 appear due hydroxyl bending and stretching modes of adsorbed water molecules a change in intensity of the characteristic bands of femoo4 829 and 932 cm 1 in cas ac femoo4 fig 4b is observed after composite formation the peaks lying at 1497 and 1600 cm 1 can be assigned to bending modes of ch groups and stretching modes of aromatic rings present in ac respectively 62 a small peak at 1071 cm 1 may be ascribed to pop symmetrical vibrations or acid phosphate esters 63 fig 4c shows the ir spectrum of cb loaded cas ac femoo4 nc the observed decrease in the intensity of moomo band at 829 cm 1 and subsequent disappearance of feomo stretching frequency band confirmed the successful adsorption of the dye molecules the bands at 1647 and 3454 cm 1 is attributed to the amide groups of adsorbed cb molecules a broad band centered at 1485 cm 1 indicates the existence of carbonyl group involved in h bonding with cb molecules masked by ch2 bands in ac as well as cb 3 2 model fitting and statistical analysis of adsorption studies based on the statistical analysis of the observed q e values 2fi model is found to be the best fit the following empirical relation eq 3 for q e in terms of coded factors is thus obtained 3 q e 48 59 1 57 a 0 50 b 14 69 c 15 92 d 2 13 e 0 51 ab 2 34 ac 1 14 ad 2 54 ae 0 093 bc 7 03 1e 003 bd 0 28 be 3 84 cd 1 83 ce 1 07 de within the anova test parameters a high f value of 26 99 implies that the contribution of the model to mean squares is larger than that of error mean square thus ensuring that the regression equation obtained is capable of successfully explaining most of the variation in the observed response there is only a 0 01 chance that an f value this large could occur due to noise the significance of the model is further validated by the value of prob f or the p values which are lower than 0 0001 table 3 summarizes the anova results for 2fi response surface model and table 4 shows the model summary statistics a high r squared value of 0 9225 is indicative of the fact that the chosen model can successfully explain almost 92 of the response variation additionally a difference of less than 0 2 between predicted r squared and adjusted r squared establishes the reliability of the model based on relative standard deviation cv having a value of 13 43 it may be concluded that the chosen model is practically reproducible adequate precision of 20 192 depicts a high signal to noise ratio implying that the model could be utilized to navigate the design space the nature of regression coefficients is helpful in assessing the effect of model terms on the values of q e the negative coefficient values for nanocomposite dose show its antagonistic effect which is a decrease in q e however the positive coefficients of initial solution ph initial cb concentration contact time and temperature advocate an increase in q e in the factorial range further the f values of the model terms have been used as a tool to analyze the relative effect of the terms on q e the values of prob f less than 0 0500 indicate that c d ae cd are the significant model terms higher f values for dose 172 16 and concentration 202 33 depict their greater effect on q e as compared to the other terms moreover the higher values of sum of the squared deviations from the mean for dose concentration and temperature confirm their higher comparative effect on variation of q e the normal probability plot fig 5 a satisfies the normal distribution as the plot nearly followed a straight line affirming that the residuals follow normal distribution while predicted versus actual q e plot fig 5 b assert the significant prediction capability of the model 64 67 3 3 optimization of process variables 3d response surface curves presented in fig 6 corroborates the simultaneous effect of dose and concentration on q e the adsorbent dosage has been observed to affect the q e antagonistically which can be attributed to a decrease in the number of active sites on adsorbent surface due to aggregation phenomenon that leads to an overall decrease in the available surface area the near doubling of q e with an increase in concentration of cb solution in the factorial range demonstrates the shifting of equilibrium to a high adsorption region due to concentration gradient 68 the presence of necessary driving force continues to increase the q e till the optimal level of dye concentration fig 7 shows the statistical interactive effect of ph and time on q e a gradual increase in adsorption with increasing ph in the given time range has been observed however the increase in contact time displays a profound effect on q e values which increases from 84 7 to 90 7 mg g the increased time augment the adsorption process by providing the opportunity for dye molecules to saturate the adsorbent surface it is evident from fig 7 that the alteration in the initial solution ph did not affect the q e much and a considerably constant qe value is observed throughout the ph range the phzpc of cas ac femoo4 nc is 7 2 which means that the adsorbent possesses a positive surface charge below phzpc and negatively charged surface above this value this may lead to electrostatic repulsion and attraction between cb and cas ac femoo4 nc surface thereby affecting the cb uptake however from the experimental results it can be seen that the uptake is hardly affected by alteration in solution ph thus ruling out electrostatic interaction as the dominant mechanism this further supports the fact that the mechanism of adsorption primarily involves hydrogen bonding and π π interactions 69 the interactive effect of time and temperature on q e is depicted in fig 8 at low contact time q e increases from 69 to 84 mg g with increase in temperature from 298 k to 308 k this observation points towards the endothermic nature of adsorption process and enhancement of pore size and adsorbate mobility however the adsorption capacity with temperature decreases with increase in time at high contact time the saturation of active sites even at lower temperature may be responsible for lower increment in q e the synergistic impact of time and temperature favors continuous q e amplification until optimal level is achieved 3 4 optimization of cb removal by desirability calculations the determination of optimal values of the involved process parameters and the corresponding cb adsorption was done by employing desirability function df the preferred conditions included minimum dose and maximum dye concentration and maximized q e the conditions for optimum dye sequestration are found to be 0 8 g l dose 60 min contact time 80 mg l initial cb concentration and ph 2 at 308 k fig s4 represents the optimization ramps the obtained optimized conditions were used in further studies however as q e almost shows a steady rate with ph increment therefore rest of the investigations were carried out at ph 7 as the ph of most water bodies is around 6 8 3 5 isotherm analyses of adsorption of cb onto cas ac femoo4 nanocomposite analyses of adsorption isotherms provide a qualitative and quantitative explanation of interaction of pollutant species with the adsorbent material at a fixed temperature the parameters deduced from different isotherm models provide valuable information about the surface properties affinities of the adsorbent and the adsorption mechanisms in addition the isotherms help determine the nature of adsorption and are used to calculate the adsorption capacity in present study langmuir freundlich temkin and d r isotherms have been used to study the experimental data langmuir model represented by eq 4 70 hypothesizes monolayer adsorption on adsorbent surface with finite number of energetically indistinguishable sites additionally it ignores the possibility of interaction between neighboring adsorbed molecules 4 q e q m b c e 1 b c e 5 r l 1 1 b c o where q m is the monolayer adsorption capacity and b is the langmuir constant l mg which describes the affinity of adsorbent sites towards the adsorbate particles the values of both these parameters can be calculated from q e versus c e plot another important parameter calculated from langmuir model is the dimensionless separation factor r l eq 5 whose values help in identifying the nature favorable linear or irreversible of the adsorption process freundlich isotherm model is not confined to assumption of monolayer adsorption it describes the simultaneous uptake of two or more adsorbent particles by a single adsorbent site it hypothesizes the favorable occupation of stronger binding sites accompanied by a decrease in adsorption intensity with increasing site occupation non linearized freundlich model is represented by eq 6 71 6 q e k f c e 1 n f where freundlich constant k f and heterogeneity factor n f are constants which are indicative of adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity respectively 1 n f is referred to as freundlich exponent its value between 0 and 1 validates favorable adsorption while1 n f 1 and 1 n f 0 depict unfavorable and reversible adsorption respectively temkin isotherm model eq 7 is useful for analyzing adsorption onto heterogeneous surface it takes into account adsorbate adsorbate interaction as well and proposes a linear decrease in the heat of adsorption with increasing coverage due to such interactions 7 q e β t ln k t c e where β t rt b t and b t is the heat of adsorption kj mol and k t is the equilibrium binding constant related to binding energy 72 d r isotherm eq 7 is functional in determining the nature of adsorption based on calculated energy values being similar to langmuir it differs only in its assumption of a porous surface instead of a homogeneous one 73 8 q e q d exp k d ln 1 1 c e 2 9 k d b d r 2 t 2 10 e 1 2 b d where k d calculated using eq 9 is the activity coefficient and e kj mol eq 10 is the molar adsorption energy which is the decisive factor for nature of adsorption table 5 contains all parameters calculated from the various isotherms model the value of e lower than 8 kj mol is indicative of physical and 8 16 kj mol of chemical adsorption respectively 74 the e values 1 14 1 59 kj mol below 8 kj mol is suggestive of physical adsorption of cb the freundlich isotherm model has the highest regression coefficient values at all the three temperatures followed by langmuir fig s5a temkin fig s5b and d r fig s5c models high r 2 values 0 980 0 981 and low see values 3 07 3 21 for freundlich model implies that it is the most appropriate model to explain the nature of adsorption therefore adsorption of cb onto cas ac femoo4 nc can be described as multilayer adsorption on energetically distinguishable sites fig 9 a shows the freundlich isotherm plots for cb adsorption onto cas ac femoo4 nc evidently the observed q e are higher than that of cb adsorption onto femoo4 nps fig 9 b additionally 1 n f values between 0 43 and 0 50 advocate a favorable adsorption process at all test temperatures which is further confirmed by the r l values 0 04 0 06 similar results have been previously reported by hussain et al 30 langmuir adsorption capacity q m 112 84 121 25 mg g and b values 0 21 0 54 l mg confirm significant adsorption capacity heat of adsorption b t values l g calculated from temkin isotherm are suggestive of physical nature of adsorption further a considerable increase in temkin binding constant k t with temperature indicates an endothermic adsorption process which is confirmed by the positive energy of adsorption e kj mol calculated from d r isotherm model a comparative account of adsorption performance of various adsorbents in terms of q m values for basic dyes uptake from aqueous solution is reported in table 6 the prepared adsorbent displays a relatively higher affinity towards cb removal 3 6 kinetic analyses of adsorption of cb onto cas ac femoo4 nanocomposite the kinetic studies are important to understand the adsorbate uptake rate which determines the retention time needed for completion of adsorption and the adsorption mechanism the kinetic parameters are useful in the design of prospective adsorption system on a pilot scale 87 the kinetic data has been analyzed using non linear forms of pseudo first and pseudo second order models represented by eqs 11 and 12 respectively the pseudo first order model presumes the adsorption of one adsorbate species onto single unoccupied active site whereas pseudo second order model assumes that one molecule is adsorbed onto a pair of vacant surface sites 88 89 11 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 12 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where q e and q t are the adsorption capacity at equilibrium and at time t k 1 and k 2 are pseudo first order 1 min and pseudo second order g mg min rate constants respectively plot of q t versus t fig 10 helps determine the k 2 and q e values while k 1 was calculated from q t versus t fig s6 all the calculated parameters are tabulated in table 7 the best fitting of pseudo second order was established on the basis of high r 2 values 0 905 0 960 in comparison to that of pseudo first order model 0 606 0 786 which confirms that the adsorption of cb onto cas ac femoo4 nc is influenced by the number of binding sites rather than the concentration of cb 3 7 diffusion model analysis of adsorption of cb onto cas ac femoo4 nanocomposite in order to account for the mechanistic step s involved in rate controlling process of adsorption the data is required to be analyzed by the diffusion models the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model and boyd kinetic model are used to analyze the kinetic data eq 13 states the intraparticle diffusion model 90 where q t mg g is the adsorption capacity at t time k i is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant mg g min0 5 and c i is the intercept the magnitude of k i and c i may be obtained from the linear plot of q t versus t 0 5 13 q t k i t 0 5 c i eq 14 states the boyd kinetic model or liquid film diffusion model 91 as 14 ln 1 f k l t where k l 1 min is liquid film diffusion rate constant and f is calculated as q e q t three identified steps involved in adsorption mechanism are i instantaneous or external surface adsorption ii diffusion to inner active sites and iii equilibrium stage or saturation intraparticle diffusion model is valid if a straight line plot un deviated from the origin is obtained for q t versus t 0 5 thus making the above three steps indistinguishable 92 however in the present study a multi linear plot fig 11 a over the entire adsorption process was obtained where each segment corresponds to a single controlling mechanism or several controlling mechanisms simultaneously intraparticle diffusion is the controlling mechanism in the second stage and further its effect is reduced in the third or the saturation step multi linearity and positive slope imply that intraparticle diffusion is not the sole rate controlling mechanism in the adsorption process similarly in the case of boyd kinetic model a linear plot fig 11b with positive slope consequently rules out the possibility of it being the sole controller of adsorption mechanism such observations indicate that both the models control the overall adsorption process the values of various diffusion parameters are summarized in table 8 3 8 thermodynamic analysis of cb adsorption onto cas ac femoo4 nanocomposite the thermodynamic parameters provide useful information with regard to the adsorption process the free energy change δg must always be negative which signifies spontaneity and feasibility of the adsorption phenomena the log k a q e c e versus 1 t plot van t hoff plot is used to estimate the enthalpy change δh r slope and entropy change δs r intercept when δh 0 the adsorption is endothermic whereas when δh 0 the adsorption is exothermic similarly entropy change δs 0 indicates an increased randomness while δs 0 suggests a decrease in randomness at solid solution interface the thermodynamic studies of the adsorption of cb onto cas ac femoo4 nc were performed at 298 303 and 308 k thermodynamic parameters such as free energy change δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs were calculated using the gibbs equation eq 15 and van t hoff equation eq 16 15 g o h o t s o 16 log k a s o 2 303 r h o 2 303 rt where k a q e c e r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is the absolute temperature in k the δh and s values were obtained from the slope and intercept of linear van t hoff plot fig s7 according to eq 16 the calculated thermodynamic parameters are tabulated in table 9 the negative values of δg 5 76 7 55 kj mol validates the spontaneity and feasibility of the adsorption of cb onto cas ac femoo4 nc whereas the positive value of s 0 18 kj mol k can be attributed to the increase in randomness at the adsorbent dye solution interface the increment in δg with rise in temperature indicates that cb is favorably adsorbed onto the nc at high temperature the endothermic nature of adsorption is confirmed by the positive value of δh 47 72 kj mol the δh value falls close to 10 40 kj mol range 93 prescribed for physical adsorption 3 9 proposed mechanism of adsorption process fig 12 provides a schematic representation of the most probable mechanism of cb adsorption onto cas ac femoo4 nc the physical nature of adsorption process as suggested by temkin isotherm model the trend in q e values with alteration in ph implied the adsorption mechanism s independence from electrostatic interactions the involvement of hydrogen bonding between the carboxylic hydroxyl groups on the adsorbent surface and nh or oh groups of the cb molecules are evidenced by lowering of carbonyl group bending frequencies 1497 to 1485 cm 1 and amide group co and nh stretching frequency 1690 to 1647 cm 1 and 3500 to 3454 cm 1 respectively in the ftir spectrum of dye loaded cas ac femoo4 nc additionally the presence of aromatic rings on the adsorbent surface as well as in the dye molecules ensure the possibility of adsorption of dye via π π stacking phenomenon 32 3 10 reusability of cas ac femoo4 nc reusability is an important aspect to justify the economic viability of an adsorbent consecutive adsorption desorption cycles were carried out to determine the extent of reusability of spent cas ac femoo4 nc fig s8 a known amount 50 mg of the nanocomposite was saturated with 25 ml 80 mg l of cb solution for 60 min the regeneration was performed with 25 ml of 0 1 m hcl the following eq 17 was employed for the calculation of desorption efficiency 17 desorption c e d v d c a c e a v a 100 where c a cea and va are the initial concentration equilibrium concentration and volume of the adsorption solution respectively ced and vd are the equilibrium concentration and volume of desorption solution respectively 94 the spent adsorbent was rinsed thoroughly with double distilled water prior to the next cycle in order to maintain its neutrality the cas ac femoo4 nc shows a good reusability adsorbing 86 25 of cb and desorption of 81 in the fourth cycle 3 11 adsorption of cb from real wastewater spiked with cb a real wastewater sample spiked with cb was analyzed to adjudge the adsorption efficacy of cas ac femoo4 nc for the removal of cb in presence of multiple pollutants the real effluent 1 5 ml obtained from a local dyeing unit was diluted to 100 ml with distilled water and spiked with cb solution 20 mg l the cas ac femoo4 nc 1 g adsorbs a decent amount of cb 76 mg g from the wastewater sample after 60 min fig 13 but its q e is expectedly lower than that observed in aqueous solution due to interference of other contaminants present in it the study reveals that the nc can be used to effectively treat cb laden real effluent 4 conclusions a novel cas ac femoo4 nanocomposite is synthesized by green and energy efficient route and has been utilized for celestine blue b sequestration from aqueous solution adsorption process optimization was done via response surface methodology using initial cb concentration

heterogeneous adsorbent surface langmuir saturation capacity was 121 mg g the values of δh 47 72 kj mol and δg 7 55 kj mol confirm an endothermic and feasible adsorption process the kinetics of the adsorption process is well explained by pseudo second order model and the adsorption is controlled by both intraparticle and liquid film diffusion the hydrogen bonding and π π interactions are the underlying interaction between the adsorbent and dye molecules the adsorbent can be reused for four adsorption desorption cycles maintaining good efficiency the cas ac femoo4 nc is an effective and

13387,this study compared the effect of the homogeneous and the heterogeneous electro fenton ef processes on the degradation of metronidazole mtz graphene oxide go fepo4 synthesized for use in the heterogeneous electro fenton process was characterized using ftir fe sem eds and xrd analysis the analyses showed that the amorphous composite structure formed as a result of fepo4 structures dispersed between the go layers has an average particle size distribution of 141 nm the activity of the go fepo4 catalyst was more effective at ph 3 than ph 5 which is the own ph value of metronidazole in the heterogeneous ef process the mineralization percentage was determined as 66 at ph 3 0 5 g l 1 catalyst dosage after 5 h no difference was observed in the structure of go fepo4 which can be used repeatedly with high performance even after 4 cycles in the homogeneous ef process 0 2 mm fe2 ion and fe iii oxalate complex containing the same amount of fe ions were used for comparison under the same conditions when fe2 ion and fe iii oxalate complex were used at ph 3 57 and 70 mineralization percentages were achieved respectively in 5 h however the mineralization efficiencies of the fe iii oxalate complex decreased to 47 at ph 5 and 41 at ph 7 the pseudo first order model to kinetically describe the removal mechanism of mtz showed the best fit with the experimental kinetic data in all ef processes finally active oxygen species were determined as hydroperoxyl radicals for the heterogeneous ef method and as hydroxyl radicals for the homogeneous ef method graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords metronidazole electro fenton graphene oxide fepo4 1 introduction nowadays water pollution caused by organic pollutants has reached serious levels and has become an important problem for all living things on earth antibiotics are one of the most important of these organic pollutants in particular the widespread and broad spectrum use of antibiotics makes them the most important group of contaminants in environmental waters metronidazole mtz is one of the commonly used antibiotics is used to treat a wide variety of infections caused by some bacteria and parasites mtz is identified in several wastewater effluents like urban hospital fish farms and meat production facilities which produce large amounts of wastewaters 1 in the united states mtz was 119th most commonly prescribed medication in 2018 2 it is also on the world health organization s list of essential medicines 3 on the other hand as a result of the studies metronidazole was reported to be carcinogenic 4 metronidazole has high mobility in the soil because of its koc soil adsorption coefficient value 5 and it has been reported to be low biodegradable in the environment 6 8 due to the lack of effective treatment in effluent treatment plants high concentrations of such pollutants are released into the environment for instance mtz levels as high as 34 mg l 1 have been determined in the sample of the waste water treatment plant of a pharmaceutical manufacturing company in nigeria 9 10 therefore effective studies to be carried out on the degradation of mtz in wastewater will help to solve an important problem electrochemical advanced oxidation techniques eaops have attracted great attention in consequence of their environmental friendliness moderate application condition compatibility versatility high efficiency limited operative costs and suitability for automation 11 14 eaops can be used to effectively degrade persistent organic pollutants 15 electro fenton ef method is also a prominent member of eaops in the fenton method the ferrous ion and h2o2 which are named fenton reagents react to produce hydroxyl radical in the bulk solution eq 1 1 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh k 53 m 1 s 1 however in the ef method it is possible to be electro generated h2o2 at a suitable cathode fed with o2 air eq 2 or produce fe2 ions using a sacrificial iron anode it can also be applied by adding catalytic amounts of iron ions fe2 or fe3 into the reaction medium in ef process regeneration of fe3 fe2 performs by direct reduction on the cathode eq 3 16 2 o 2 g 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 e 0 0 695 v nhe 3 fe 3 e fe 2 e 0 0 771 v nhe also coupling electro fenton processes which are also environmentally friendly with biological treatment techniques allows the use of environmentally friendly high efficiency new methods by improving existing biological treatment processes aboudalle et al performed the mineralization of metronidazole using combined the fenton process with biological treatment processes 17 18 they showed that when electro fenton was applied before biological treatment the rate of metronidazole removal doubled compared to using two different bacterial strains alone for 120 h as a result by combining the two processes they achieved a mineralization efficiency of 97 with a significant reduction in 16 day processing time compared to previous traditional biological treatment methods 17 some chemicals such as pesticides accumulate in the soil and may get mixed with groundwater after irrigation or rains contreras et al proposed an ef pre treatment to improve the biodegradability of polluted soil washing effluent with clopyralid also showed that the groundwater can be used as a natural electrolyte instead of adding synthetic electrolytes 19 traditionally homogeneous fenton applications have some limitations such as the application of acidic ph ph 3 20 and the inability to recover fe2 ions also reproducing the fe2 ion which is depleted as a result of the fenton reaction eq 1 limits the fenton process it has been reported that adding low molecular weight organic acids to the solution in a homogeneous photo fenton process increases the amount of degradation for this purpose oxalic acid acetic acid citric acid malic acid and tartaric acid were tested 21 24 these acids form a soluble strong complex with the fe iii ion 25 the optimum molar ratio was reported as 1 3 for the fe iii oxalate complex and it was determined as 1 1 for the others too 26 28 the reasons for increasing the degradation efficiency of the fe iii oxalate complex i facilitating the fe iii fe ii cycle in the photo fenton process 29 32 ii reacting faster with hydrogen peroxide than the free fe3 ion fe iii aqua complexes and iii providing degradation in a wide ph range 21 recently studies conducted with the heterogeneous ef method showed that ph values can be changed from acidic to neutral and the iron source can be reused generally fe2 or fe3 fe iii ligand complexes is used in homogeneous fenton applications but in recent studies the surface of heterogeneous structures containing iron such as goethite α feooh 33 34 wustite feo 33 magnetite fe3o4 33 35 36 hematite α fe2o3 33 iron molybdophosphate femopo 37 iron loaded alginate beads 38 zero valent iron zvi 36 pyrite fes2 39 41 laterite 42 znfe2o4 nanoparticles 43 and fe cu allophane 44 acts as the active site for heterogeneous electro fenton applications moreover it is possible to use heterogeneous catalysts obtained by loading iron sources on various support groups such as sepiolite 45 zeolite 46 carbon 47 organic polymers 48 and resin 49 one of these support materials is graphene oxide go go has oxygenated functional groups in its two dimensional lamellar structure which allows the obtaining of composite materials with various compositions 50 51 graphene graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide composite materials such as go fe3o4 go feiifeiii feiifeii carbon felt graphene feo dispersed onto ni foam graphene carbon nanotube based carbon aerogel fe3o4 iron graphene based particle γ feooh graphene polyacrylamide carbonized aerogel can be used as a cathode material or catalyst in the electro fenton process 52 62 in these structures the p orbitals of graphene based support materials overlap with the d orbitals of the transition metal atoms to form composite structures with appropriate geometry composite materials significantly increase catalytic activity and stability through synergistic interaction 62 in addition electrostatic interactions may occur between oxygenated functional groups in the go structure and metal oxide structures 63 65 consequently we can summarize some of the most important advantages of these synergetic interactions as follows i metal oxides are dispersed in the high surface area of the go active areas ii agglomeration is prevented 65 iii leakage of metal ions is reduced and finally catalyst stability is increased 66 in fenton reactions one of the iron sources used in graphene based composite materials is fepo4 67 68 guo et al 67 investigated the effect of go fepo4 composite on the degradation of rhodamine b by the photo fenton process and achieved 100 removal with the use of 100 mm h2o2 and 1 g l 1 catalyst zhou et al 2018 also performed photo fenton degradation of methylene blue under simulated sunlight irradiation using go fepo4 composite go 10 w w and showed that this catalyst would be used 3 times without losing its photocatalytic activity and stability 68 this work aimed to synthesize and characterize go fepo4 and to investigate the removal of metronidazole from aqueous solutions by the heterogeneous electro fenton process the effects of catalyst amount ph and electrolysis time on degradation and mineralization were investigated in addition the reusability of go fepo4 catalyst and fe ion release into solution were investigated to compare the performance of go fepo4 in the heterogeneous fenton reactions fe ii ions and fe iii oxalate compounds were selected as homogeneous catalysts finally degradation products of mtz were

millipore milli q advantage a10 was used in all experimental stages 2 2 preparation go fepo4 graphene oxide was synthesized to the modified hummers method as detailed in the previous article 55 for the go fepo4 10 w w fepo4 synthesis go was added in ultrapure water 100 ml and placed in an ultrasonic bath for 1 h the 25 ml of nh4h2po4 0 80 m and fe no3 3 0 80 m solutions were added sequentially into the go solution the ph was adjusted to 1 5 using 0 1 m hno3 solutions and the obtained mixture was continuously stirred at 400 rpm at 70 c for 1 h 67 the mixture was then filtered and the resulting precipitate washed several times with ethanol and ultrapure water respectively the precipitated composite was dried at 70 c overnight 2 3 characterization go fepo4 field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy fe sem eds was performed to determine the morphologies and structures of samples the x ray diffraction with cu kα radiation xrd and fourier transform infrared atr attenuated total reflectance spectrophotometers were used to analyze the composite structure the particle size distribution of go fepo4 was determined using a malvern 2000 zetasizer nano zs instrument 2 4 electro fenton experiments electro fenton experiments were carried out in a 300 ml borosil glass beaker a 200 ml of the solution containing 80 mg l 1 mtz 50 mm na2so4 and a certain amount of go fepo4 was kept in the ultrasonic bath for 1 min to homogeneously distribute the composite catalyst while the three dimensional carbon felt cathode 150 mm 50 mm 10 mm carbone lorraine france was placed to surround the cell walls from inside the platinum gauze anode 10 cm2 sigma aldrich was placed at a distance of 2 cm from the cathode before the current is applied the solution was saturated with oxygen gas for 15 min and continued throughout the ef process then the constant current was applied using a dc power supply mhc china samples taken at certain times were filtered with a 0 22 μm hydrophilic ptfe l syringe filter chromxpert before being analyzed the optimum value of fe2 catalyst amount was determined as 0 1 0 2 mm in the use of carbon felt cathode 11 therefore in the homogeneous electro fenton experiments 0 2 mm fe2 feso4 or fe iii oxalate complex 0 2 0 6 in molar ratio were added to the solution 2 5 analytical procedures the change in mtz concentration was monitored out by hplc with zorbax ecilpse plus c18 agilent 100 mm 4 6 mm id with a particle size of 3 5 μm column and photodiode array detector 320 nm a mixture of acetonitrile water 40 60 v v at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 was used as the mobile phase in addition the concentration of oxalic acid was followed using grace prevail organic acid column 250 mm 4 65 mm 5 μm at 210 nm as a mobile phase 25 mm kh2po4 solution adjusted to ph 2 5 with h3po4 was used which has 0 5 ml min 1 of flow rate the aromatic intermediates were identified in an agilent 6460 triple quadrupole lc ms ms mass spectrometer system which has phenomenex luna c18 column 5 μm 150 mm 4 60 mm the mobile phase was acetonitrile water solution containing 0 1 ch3coonh4 in a proportion of 70 30 v v the flow rate was 0 5 ml min 1 and the column temperature was maintained at 25 c mineralization data of mtz solutions were performed using toc cell kits merck mineralization percentage was calculated as follows eq 4 4 mineralization to c 0 to c t to c 0 toc 0 and toc t values refer to total organic carbon values at start and t times the analyses of fe2 and fe3 ions that can pass into solution from the used catalyst during the electro fenton process were carried out using the modified spectrophotometric method developed by yang and yao 69 calibration curves were created for ferrous and ferric ions in the concentration range 1 50 mg l 1 and 1 10 mg l 1 at 510 nm and 525 nm respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of go fepo4 as seen in fig 1a the go fepo4 catalyst showed a uniform particle size distribution with a maximum of 141 3 nm while c o fe and n elements were seen in the eds spectrum belonging to the go fepo4 structure no result for phosphorus was obtained however the reason for the absence of phosphorus may be its low amount the fepo4 structure constitutes only 10 of the composite by mass or overlapping with the spectra of the elements pt and pd used in the coating fig 1b in fig 2 the sem images at different magnifications before and after the use of the go fepo4 catalyst in the electro fenton process show that the go fepo4 catalyst has an amorphous structure and there is no significant change in its structure after use similar atomic percentages were obtained in the eds spectrum results not given here xrd spectra for go and go fepo4 structures are shown in fig 3 as the intensity of the characteristic diffraction peak of go at 2θ 10 9 001 with 0 86 d spacing decreases after fepo4 is loaded this peak also shifted to 11 61 with 0 76 d spacing in the xrd spectrum however characteristic peaks of the fepo4 structure could not be observed therefore the go fepo4 composite structure was calcined at 700 c to prove the presence of fepo4 and specific peaks at 20 44 100 25 93 012 38 17 104 48 62 023 and 65 60 124 belonging to the hexagonal iron phosphate structure with lattice parameters a 5 015 nm b 5 015 nm and c 11 216 nm were obtained while the xrd pattern obtained as a result of the calcination process supports the presence of phosphorus in the structure it also supports the amorphous fepo4 structure in the composite structure 67 the ftir spectra of go bare go fepo4 and used go fepo4 structures are given in fig 4 hydroxyl groups or adsorbed water molecules observed at 3300 cm 1 are located in the graphite layers or between them the cc vibrations of the aromatic benzene ring were observed at 1620 cm 1 the characteristic peaks of the co at 1734 cm 1 coo at 1410 cm 1 coc at 1226 cm 1 and co at 1056 cm 1 are proving the presence of oxygenated functional groups in the graphene oxide structure fig 4a after fepo4 was loaded into the go structure shifts were observed in the peaks of oxygenated functional groups in the go fepo4 spectra 1050 cm 1 and 900 cm 1 have been assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration of the feop bond respectively 70 71 the absorption peak of the feo in the fepo4 was observed at 580 cm 1 72 also there was no noticeable change in the go fepo4 structures before and after use in the ef process fig 4b 3 2 the effect of go fepo4 in heterogeneous electro fenton process for mtz degradation in the electro fenton experiments the go fepo4 composite was used as the iron ion source and the amounts of the go fepo4 catalyst were chosen between 0 10 and 0 50 g l 1 without changing the ph of the mtz solution fig 5a similar degradation efficiencies were observed when the catalyst concentration was 0 10 g l 1 and 0 25 g l 1 whereas increasing the amount of catalyst to 0 50 g l 1 accelerated the degradation at ph 5 after the ph value of the solution was adjusted to ph 3 which is valid for ef application the use of 0 50 g l 1 of the go fepo4 catalyst was much more effective fig 5a in all conditions mtz degradation occurred close to 100 at 15 min in general the degradation kinetics of the hydroxyl radicals with an organic contaminant can be regarded as pseudo first order 5 mtz t k abs mtz oh considering that the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals do not accumulate in the solution the concentration of hydroxyl radicals is considered constant throughout the process eq 5 is rearranged to obtain eq 6 73 6 mtz t k app mtz where k abs and k app are absolute and apparent rate constants respectively in fig 5b the pseudo first order reaction kinetics between the hydroxyl radical and the mtz compound in the electro fenton process were examined by the plot of ln c c0 versus electrolysis time the kinetic parameters such as the rate constant and correlation coefficient are given in table 1 increasing the amount of the catalyst from 0 10 g l 1 to 0 50 g l 1 resulted in a 1 5 fold increase in the reaction rate the effect of the prepared go fepo4 catalyst on the mineralization of mtz solution by the electro fenton method can be seen in fig 6a the effects of three different catalyst dosages on mineralization at the ph value of the mtz solution were investigated in addition the obtained results were compared with the mineralization efficiency of the solution adjusted to ph 3 by selecting the most effective catalyst dosage similar to the mtz degradation efficiency the increase in the amount of catalyst increased the mineralization rate in fig 6a at ph 5 when the amounts of heterogeneous catalyst used were 0 10 and 0 25 for 1 h reaction time the toc removal percentages were obtained as 8 1 and 9 2 which are too low due to the limited catalyst active sites at low catalyst amounts sufficient hydroxyl radical formation cannot be achieved as a result of the increase in the amount of catalyst to 0 50 g l 1 the catalyst active sites increased and due to the formation of more hydroxyl radicals 24 8 mineralization was achieved in the equal reaction time if the catalyst amount was 0 50 g l 1 the mineralization removal for the first 3 h remained almost constant but it increased to 44 9 at the end of the 5 h electrolysis time at ph 5 in the case of the lower catalyst dosage the conversion of the cathodically produced hydrogen peroxide to hydroxyl radicals by the iron source has been limited so the degradation of mtz was insufficient and a small number of intermediates formed however as a result of the increase in the amount of catalyst both the degradation of mtz and the formation of intermediate products occurred faster during 3 h in the continuation of the electrolysis period all these intermediate products were fully mineralized when 0 50 g l 1 go fepo4 is used in a solution adjusted to ph 3 which is considered optimum for ef it is seen that the mineralization increases in fig 6a similar to the previous results close toc removal was observed in 1 and 3 h while 65 5 of mineralization was achieved at the end of 5 h during the application of the heterogeneous ef method the amount of iron that passed into the solution medium was also examined if 0 50 g l 1 go fepo4 is used the maximum amount of iron ions that can pass into the solution will be 18 6 mg l 1 0 33 mm but no fe ii fe iii ions were found in the samples taken for 5 h in the analysis performed using the spectrophotometric method which can determine at 1 mg l 1 fe ii and fe iii ions loq 0 5 mg l 1 however free ions passing into solution below the limits of determination may have contributed to mineralization by homogeneous ef depending on the phpzc value 7 0 of the go fepo4 composite structure its surface is positively charged at ph 5 and ph 3 since mtz compound has a more neutral structure at ph 3 than its pka value 2 57 and π π interactions with the go structure will be stronger 74 this facilitates their interactions with hydroxyl radicals occurring on the surface increasing ph to 5 may have increased electrostatic repulsion between the oxygenated functional groups on the go surface and mtz moreover in the electro fenton method hydroxyl radicals are produced by the interaction of the hydrogen peroxide produced on the cathode and the fe ion source herein the distribution of go fepo4 catalyst in solution was achieved by briefly holding in the ultrasonic bath and then mechanical mixing was continued when the electrodes were placed depending on the phpzc value it has the go fepo4 catalyst will interact more with the cathode surface since it will be positively charged at ph 3 the large surface area provided by the carbon felt 38 75 used increased the contact of heterogeneous catalysts thus facilitating the production of hydroxyl radicals due to the following reactions 76 77 7 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 ho 2 h 8 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh hydroperoxyl radical which is formed as a result of a fenton like reaction eq 7 involving fe3 ion has a lower oxidation capacity e0 1 65 v she than the hydroxyl radical e0 2 80 v she 27 76 the presence of the superoxide anion which is the conjugate base structure of the hydroperoxyl radical ho2 h o2 pka 4 8 depends on the ph value of the medium to determine the dominant reactive oxygen species in the oxidation of metronidazole by heterogeneous ef method isopropanol and chloroform were used as oh radical and ho2 o2 radical scavenger respectively isopropanol has been described as a hydroxyl radical scavenger thanks to its high rate constant k 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 of the reaction with the hydroxyl radical 78 chloroform on the other hand reacts with the ho2 o2 radical at a higher rate constant k 3 1010 m 1 s 1 compared to its reaction with the hydroxyl radical k 7 4 106 m 1 s 1 42 as shown in fig 6b chloroform significantly inhibited the degradation of mtz especially at ph 5 it was determined that the inhibition was higher according to these results it can be said that in the heterogeneous ef process with go fepo4 mtz degradation occurs via the hydroperoxyl radical on the other hand while the inhibition effect of isopropanol is lower than that of chloroform it is higher at ph 3 than ph 5 this is indicating that the effect of hydroxyl radical on degradation has been lost its importance with increasing ph finally the reusability of the go fepo4 catalyst was tested in mtz removal for 4 cycles after each experiment go fepo4 was filtered using a 0 2 μm pore ptfe filter washed and dried at 60 c fig 7 shows that there is no significant loss in the activity of the go fepo4 catalyst as discussed in the previous sections the results of ftir sem and eds analysis showed that there wasn t any significant change in the structure after the use of the go fepo4 catalyst guo et al examined the effect of go fepo4 catalyst on the degradation of rhodamine b by the photo fenton method similarly found the iron release to be negligible and reported that they provided effective removal in the ph range of 2 18 10 40 however as seen in this study 100 degradation is achieved at ph 3 and 5 albeit at different times while the mineralization efficiency decreases significantly above ph 3 67 3 3 the effect of fe iii oxalate complex in the homogeneous electro fenton process for mtz degradation in the electro fenton process fe2 ion is oxidized to fe3 ion after the fenton reaction eq 1 and then fe3 is reduced again at the cathode eq 2 and used continuously therefore it has been emphasized in many studies that 0 1 0 2 mm fe2 or fe3 ion is sufficient in case of use of carbon felt cathode 79 80 in our current study fe iii oxalate complex and fe2 ion were used as the iron source in the homogeneous electro fenton experiments fe iii oxalate complex was used at a molar ratio of 0 2 0 6 and fe2 ion was used 0 2 mm the mineralization of mtz solution was investigated at three different ph values using the fe iii oxalate complex the decay of mtz concentration in the ef process with feiii oxalate complex is by following the pseudo first order kinetics as shown in the inset of fig 8a in these experiments rate constants at ph 3 ph 5 and ph 7 were obtained as 0 3657 0 2319 and 0 1931 min 1 respectively as seen in fig 8b in the electro fenton experiments performed using iron ions at ph 3 57 mineralization was obtained after 5 h however when the fe iii oxalate complex containing the same amount of fe ii ion was used at ph 3 the mineralization values reached 58 and 70 at 3 and 5 h respectively despite the increased toc content due to the complex a significant increase in mineralization efficiency was observed in cases the ph of the solution was 5 and 7 after 5 h of electrolysis the mineralization efficiencies were obtained as 47 and 41 respectively at high oxalate concentration the dominant species in fe iii oxalate complex structures are feiii c2o4 2 and feiii c2o4 3 3 around ph 4 81 the fe iii oxalate complex has been used mostly in photo fenton applications in the literature and it has been reported that the fe ii fe iii cycle is facilitated by uv irradiation and accordingly photodegradation is increased 21 29 32 in the ef the standard electrode potential of the cathodic reduction of fe3 ion to fe2 is 0 771 v eq 3 however the conversion of fe iii species to fe ii species is thermodynamically preferable thanks to the standard electrode potential of oxalic acid due to eq 9 82 herein the cathodic reduction has facilitated this cycle by taking on the role of uv light in addition the reaction of the superoxide anion radical with the fe iii oxalate complex also supports the fe iii fe ii cycle eq 10 the fe ii oxalate complex reacts with hydrogen peroxide at a higher rate constant eq 11 compared to the classical fenton reaction eq 1 and forms the hydroxyl radical 9 2 co 2 g 2 h 2 e h 2 c 2 o 4 e 0 0 49 v nhe 10 fe iii c 2 o 4 n 3 2 n o 2 o 2 fe ii c 2 o 4 n 2 2n k 1 10 5 m 1 s 1 11 fe ii c 2 o 4 2 2 h 2 o 2 fe iii c 2 o 4 2 oh oh k 3 1 10 4 m 1 s 1 while the concentration of fe iii oxalate species is highest at ph 4 0 it decreases with increasing ph becoming the dominant species fe oh 2 81 isopropyl alcohol and chloroform were added as inhibitors for hydroxyl radical and hydroperoxyl superoxide anion radical respectively to determine the active oxygen species effective in mtz oxidation with fe iii oxalate complex at ph 3 it is seen in fig 8c that mtz degradation is more active due to the hydroxyl radical but the hydroperoxyl radical plays a role in the degradation the change of oxalic acid concentration at ph 3 in the homogeneous fenton experiments was monitored by hplc analysis the results showed that the oxalic acid concentration increased to approximately 0 65 mm in the first 20 min and then remained almost constant for 3 h the short linear carboxylic acid structures formed in the electro fenton method form complexes with fe3 ions and the mineralization rate slows down as these complex structures are more resistant to hydroxyl radicals 76 the addition of fe iii oxalate complex to the medium prevented the complex formation attempts of these acid structures and improved their mineralization to co2 and h2o the fact that the oxalic acid concentration remained constant in this study supports this phenomenon contreras et al reported that decomposition products such as carboxylic acid especially oxalic acid formed in oxidation by the electro fenton method considerably increase the biodegradability 19 finally some degradation products identified by lc ms ms analysis as mtz degradation products are given in table 2 due to the degradation of mtz begins with the electrophilic attack of oh radicals it is not difficult to predict that it will proceed similarly as we described in our previous work 55 the results shown in table 2 have confirmed this assumption the aromatic molecules identified as intermediate products are respectively 3 2 hydroxy ethyl 2 methyl 3h imidazol 4 ol ii 2 methyl 5 nitro imidazol 1 yl acetic acid iii 5 hydroxy 2 methyl imidazol 1 yl acetic acid iv 2 methyl 5 nitro 1h imidazole v 2 methyl 3h imidazol 4 ol vi and 5 amino 1 2 hydroxyethyl 2 methyl 1h imidazol 4 ol vii detection of possible intermediates in degradation studies is an important analysis that should be done to prevent more toxic products that may form 4 conclusions the degradation of mtz antibiotic solution was compared using heterogeneous and homogeneous ef processes in the work go fepo4 catalyst was used as a heterogeneous catalyst fe2 ion and fe iii oxalate complex were used as homogeneous catalysts the characterization of the go fepo4 structure was performed by xrd fe sem eds and ft ir analysis it was determined that the go fepo4 composite was more effective at ph 3 in the heterogeneous ef process and the maximum mineralization percentages was determined as 65 5 at the end of 5 h there was no iron ion leachate into the solution during the heterogeneous fenton process also the effectiveness of the heterogeneous catalyst which was collected from the treated solution with an external magnet was not significantly reduced after 4 repetitions in the homogeneous ef process it was found that at ph 3 57 mineralization efficiency obtained with fe2 ions was increased to 70 with the addition of fe iii oxalate complex containing the same amount of iron ions also for the heterogeneous ef process and homogeneous ef process it was determined that the dominant radical species responsible for the degradation of mtz were hydroperoxyl radical and hydroxyl radical respectively for future investigations we have proven that the go fepo4 composite can be an alternative to homogeneous catalysts as a heterogeneous catalyst for organic pollutants due to its performance on the removal of mtz both the reusability of go fepo4 and the variability of the amount of fepo4 it contains will encourage future studies in addition it is stated in the literature that more effective removal methods can be developed with fenton techniques which will be applied before biological treatment processes with this aspect of our study it is seen that fenton systems can be used to develop and adapt them to

13387,this study compared the effect of the homogeneous and the heterogeneous electro fenton ef processes on the degradation of metronidazole mtz graphene oxide go fepo4 synthesized for use in the heterogeneous electro fenton process was characterized using ftir fe sem eds and xrd analysis the analyses showed that the amorphous composite structure formed as a result of fepo4 structures dispersed between the go layers has an average particle size distribution of 141 nm the activity of the go fepo4 catalyst was more effective at ph 3 than ph 5 which is the own ph value of metronidazole in the heterogeneous ef process the mineralization percentage was determined as 66 at ph 3 0 5 g l 1 catalyst dosage after 5 h no difference was observed in the structure of go fepo4 which can be used repeatedly with high performance even after 4 cycles in the homogeneous ef process 0 2 mm fe2 ion and fe iii oxalate complex containing the same amount of fe ions were used for comparison under the same conditions when fe2 ion and fe iii oxalate complex were used at ph 3 57 and 70 mineralization percentages were achieved respectively in 5 h however the mineralization efficiencies of the fe iii oxalate complex decreased to 47 at ph 5 and 41 at ph 7 the pseudo first order model to kinetically describe the removal mechanism of mtz showed the best fit with the experimental kinetic data in all ef processes finally active oxygen species were determined as hydroperoxyl radicals for the heterogeneous ef method and as hydroxyl radicals for the homogeneous ef method graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords metronidazole electro fenton graphene oxide fepo4 1 introduction nowadays water pollution caused by organic pollutants has reached serious levels and has become an important problem for all living things on earth antibiotics are one of the most important of these organic pollutants in particular the widespread and broad spectrum use of antibiotics makes them the most important group of contaminants in environmental waters metronidazole mtz is one of the commonly used antibiotics is used to treat a wide variety of infections caused by some bacteria and parasites mtz is identified in several wastewater effluents like urban hospital fish farms and meat production facilities which produce large amounts of wastewaters 1 in the united states mtz was 119th most commonly prescribed medication in 2018 2 it is also on the world health organization s list of essential medicines 3 on the other hand as a result of the studies metronidazole was reported to be carcinogenic 4 metronidazole has high mobility in the soil because of its koc soil adsorption coefficient value 5 and it has been reported to be low biodegradable in the environment 6 8 due to the lack of effective treatment in effluent treatment plants high concentrations of such pollutants are released into the environment for instance mtz levels as high as 34 mg l 1 have been determined in the sample of the waste water treatment plant of a pharmaceutical manufacturing company in nigeria 9 10 therefore effective studies to be carried out on the degradation of mtz in wastewater will help to solve an important problem electrochemical advanced oxidation techniques eaops have attracted great attention in consequence of their environmental friendliness moderate application condition compatibility versatility high efficiency limited operative costs and suitability for automation 11 14 eaops can be used to effectively degrade persistent organic pollutants 15 electro fenton ef method is also a prominent member of eaops in the fenton method the ferrous ion and h2o2 which are named fenton reagents react to produce hydroxyl radical in the bulk solution eq 1 1 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh k 53 m 1 s 1 however in the ef method it is possible to be electro generated h2o2 at a suitable cathode fed with o2 air eq 2 or produce fe2 ions using a sacrificial iron anode it can also be applied by adding catalytic amounts of iron ions fe2 or fe3 into the reaction medium in ef process regeneration of fe3 fe2 performs by direct reduction on the cathode eq 3 16 2 o 2 g 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 e 0 0 695 v nhe 3 fe 3 e fe 2 e 0 0 771 v nhe also coupling electro fenton processes which are also environmentally friendly with biological treatment techniques allows the use of environmentally friendly high efficiency new methods by improving existing biological treatment processes aboudalle et al performed the mineralization of metronidazole using combined the fenton process with biological treatment processes 17 18 they showed that when electro fenton was applied before biological treatment the rate of metronidazole removal doubled compared to using two different bacterial strains alone for 120 h as a result by combining the two processes they achieved a mineralization efficiency of 97 with a significant reduction in 16 day processing time compared to previous traditional biological treatment methods 17 some chemicals such as pesticides accumulate in the soil and may get mixed with groundwater after irrigation or rains contreras et al proposed an ef pre treatment to improve the biodegradability of polluted soil washing effluent with clopyralid also showed that the groundwater can be used as a natural electrolyte instead of adding synthetic electrolytes 19 traditionally homogeneous fenton applications have some limitations such as the application of acidic ph ph 3 20 and the inability to recover fe2 ions also reproducing the fe2 ion which is depleted as a result of the fenton reaction eq 1 limits the fenton process it has been reported that adding low molecular weight organic acids to the solution in a homogeneous photo fenton process increases the amount of degradation for this purpose oxalic acid acetic acid citric acid malic acid and tartaric acid were tested 21 24 these acids form a soluble strong complex with the fe iii ion 25 the optimum molar ratio was reported as 1 3 for the fe iii oxalate complex and it was determined as 1 1 for the others too 26 28 the reasons for increasing the degradation efficiency of the fe iii oxalate complex i facilitating the fe iii fe ii cycle in the photo fenton process 29 32 ii reacting faster with hydrogen peroxide than the free fe3 ion fe iii aqua complexes and iii providing degradation in a wide ph range 21 recently studies conducted with the heterogeneous ef method showed that ph values can be changed from acidic to neutral and the iron source can be reused generally fe2 or fe3 fe iii ligand complexes is used in homogeneous fenton applications but in recent studies the surface of heterogeneous structures containing iron such as goethite α feooh 33 34 wustite feo 33 magnetite fe3o4 33 35 36 hematite α fe2o3 33 iron molybdophosphate femopo 37 iron loaded alginate beads 38 zero valent iron zvi 36 pyrite fes2 39 41 laterite 42 znfe2o4 nanoparticles 43 and fe cu allophane 44 acts as the active site for heterogeneous electro fenton applications moreover it is possible to use heterogeneous catalysts obtained by loading iron sources on various support groups such as sepiolite 45 zeolite 46 carbon 47 organic polymers 48 and resin 49 one of these support materials is graphene oxide go go has oxygenated functional groups in its two dimensional lamellar structure which allows the obtaining of composite materials with various compositions 50 51 graphene graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide composite materials such as go fe3o4 go feiifeiii feiifeii carbon felt graphene feo dispersed onto ni foam graphene carbon nanotube based carbon aerogel fe3o4 iron graphene based particle γ feooh graphene polyacrylamide carbonized aerogel can be used as a cathode material or catalyst in the electro fenton process 52 62 in these structures the p orbitals of graphene based support materials overlap with the d orbitals of the transition metal atoms to form composite structures with appropriate geometry composite materials significantly increase catalytic activity and stability through synergistic interaction 62 in addition electrostatic interactions may occur between oxygenated functional groups in the go structure and metal oxide structures 63 65 consequently we can summarize some of the most important advantages of these synergetic interactions as follows i metal oxides are dispersed in the high surface area of the go active areas ii agglomeration is prevented 65 iii leakage of metal ions is reduced and finally catalyst stability is increased 66 in fenton reactions one of the iron sources used in graphene based composite materials is fepo4 67 68 guo et al 67 investigated the effect of go fepo4 composite on the degradation of rhodamine b by the photo fenton process and achieved 100 removal with the use of 100 mm h2o2 and 1 g l 1 catalyst zhou et al 2018 also performed photo fenton degradation of methylene blue under simulated sunlight irradiation using go fepo4 composite go 10 w w and showed that this catalyst would be used 3 times without losing its photocatalytic activity and stability 68 this work aimed to synthesize and characterize go fepo4 and to investigate the removal of metronidazole from aqueous solutions by the heterogeneous electro fenton process the effects of catalyst amount ph and electrolysis time on degradation and mineralization were investigated in addition the reusability of go fepo4 catalyst and fe ion release into solution were investigated to compare the performance of go fepo4 in the heterogeneous fenton reactions fe ii ions and fe iii oxalate compounds were selected as homogeneous catalysts finally degradation products of mtz were

millipore milli q advantage a10 was used in all experimental stages 2 2 preparation go fepo4 graphene oxide was synthesized to the modified hummers method as detailed in the previous article 55 for the go fepo4 10 w w fepo4 synthesis go was added in ultrapure water 100 ml and placed in an ultrasonic bath for 1 h the 25 ml of nh4h2po4 0 80 m and fe no3 3 0 80 m solutions were added sequentially into the go solution the ph was adjusted to 1 5 using 0 1 m hno3 solutions and the obtained mixture was continuously stirred at 400 rpm at 70 c for 1 h 67 the mixture was then filtered and the resulting precipitate washed several times with ethanol and ultrapure water respectively the precipitated composite was dried at 70 c overnight 2 3 characterization go fepo4 field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy fe sem eds was performed to determine the morphologies and structures of samples the x ray diffraction with cu kα radiation xrd and fourier transform infrared atr attenuated total reflectance spectrophotometers were used to analyze the composite structure the particle size distribution of go fepo4 was determined using a malvern 2000 zetasizer nano zs instrument 2 4 electro fenton experiments electro fenton experiments were carried out in a 300 ml borosil glass beaker a 200 ml of the solution containing 80 mg l 1 mtz 50 mm na2so4 and a certain amount of go fepo4 was kept in the ultrasonic bath for 1 min to homogeneously distribute the composite catalyst while the three dimensional carbon felt cathode 150 mm 50 mm 10 mm carbone lorraine france was placed to surround the cell walls from inside the platinum gauze anode 10 cm2 sigma aldrich was placed at a distance of 2 cm from the cathode before the current is applied the solution was saturated with oxygen gas for 15 min and continued throughout the ef process then the constant current was applied using a dc power supply mhc china samples taken at certain times were filtered with a 0 22 μm hydrophilic ptfe l syringe filter chromxpert before being analyzed the optimum value of fe2 catalyst amount was determined as 0 1 0 2 mm in the use of carbon felt cathode 11 therefore in the homogeneous electro fenton experiments 0 2 mm fe2 feso4 or fe iii oxalate complex 0 2 0 6 in molar ratio were added to the solution 2 5 analytical procedures the change in mtz concentration was monitored out by hplc with zorbax ecilpse plus c18 agilent 100 mm 4 6 mm id with a particle size of 3 5 μm column and photodiode array detector 320 nm a mixture of acetonitrile water 40 60 v v at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 was used as the mobile phase in addition the concentration of oxalic acid was followed using grace prevail organic acid column 250 mm 4 65 mm 5 μm at 210 nm as a mobile phase 25 mm kh2po4 solution adjusted to ph 2 5 with h3po4 was used which has 0 5 ml min 1 of flow rate the aromatic intermediates were identified in an agilent 6460 triple quadrupole lc ms ms mass spectrometer system which has phenomenex luna c18 column 5 μm 150 mm 4 60 mm the mobile phase was acetonitrile water solution containing 0 1 ch3coonh4 in a proportion of 70 30 v v the flow rate was 0 5 ml min 1 and the column temperature was maintained at 25 c mineralization data of mtz solutions were performed using toc cell kits merck mineralization percentage was calculated as follows eq 4 4 mineralization to c 0 to c t to c 0 toc 0 and toc t values refer to total organic carbon values at start and t times the analyses of fe2 and fe3 ions that can pass into solution from the used catalyst during the electro fenton process were carried out using the modified spectrophotometric method developed by yang and yao 69 calibration curves were created for ferrous and ferric ions in the concentration range 1 50 mg l 1 and 1 10 mg l 1 at 510 nm and 525 nm respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of go fepo4 as seen in fig 1a the go fepo4 catalyst showed a uniform particle size distribution with a maximum of 141 3 nm while c o fe and n elements were seen in the eds spectrum belonging to the go fepo4 structure no result for phosphorus was obtained however the reason for the absence of phosphorus may be its low amount the fepo4 structure constitutes only 10 of the composite by mass or overlapping with the spectra of the elements pt and pd used in the coating fig 1b in fig 2 the sem images at different magnifications before and after the use of the go fepo4 catalyst in the electro fenton process show that the go fepo4 catalyst has an amorphous structure and there is no significant change in its structure after use similar atomic percentages were obtained in the eds spectrum results not given here xrd spectra for go and go fepo4 structures are shown in fig 3 as the intensity of the characteristic diffraction peak of go at 2θ 10 9 001 with 0 86 d spacing decreases after fepo4 is loaded this peak also shifted to 11 61 with 0 76 d spacing in the xrd spectrum however characteristic peaks of the fepo4 structure could not be observed therefore the go fepo4 composite structure was calcined at 700 c to prove the presence of fepo4 and specific peaks at 20 44 100 25 93 012 38 17 104 48 62 023 and 65 60 124 belonging to the hexagonal iron phosphate structure with lattice parameters a 5 015 nm b 5 015 nm and c 11 216 nm were obtained while the xrd pattern obtained as a result of the calcination process supports the presence of phosphorus in the structure it also supports the amorphous fepo4 structure in the composite structure 67 the ftir spectra of go bare go fepo4 and used go fepo4 structures are given in fig 4 hydroxyl groups or adsorbed water molecules observed at 3300 cm 1 are located in the graphite layers or between them the cc vibrations of the aromatic benzene ring were observed at 1620 cm 1 the characteristic peaks of the co at 1734 cm 1 coo at 1410 cm 1 coc at 1226 cm 1 and co at 1056 cm 1 are proving the presence of oxygenated functional groups in the graphene oxide structure fig 4a after fepo4 was loaded into the go structure shifts were observed in the peaks of oxygenated functional groups in the go fepo4 spectra 1050 cm 1 and 900 cm 1 have been assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration of the feop bond respectively 70 71 the absorption peak of the feo in the fepo4 was observed at 580 cm 1 72 also there was no noticeable change in the go fepo4 structures before and after use in the ef process fig 4b 3 2 the effect of go fepo4 in heterogeneous electro fenton process for mtz degradation in the electro fenton experiments the go fepo4 composite was used as the iron ion source and the amounts of the go fepo4 catalyst were chosen between 0 10 and 0 50 g l 1 without changing the ph of the mtz solution fig 5a similar degradation efficiencies were observed when the catalyst concentration was 0 10 g l 1 and 0 25 g l 1 whereas increasing the amount of catalyst to 0 50 g l 1 accelerated the degradation at ph 5 after the ph value of the solution was adjusted to ph 3 which is valid for ef application the use of 0 50 g l 1 of the go fepo4 catalyst was much more effective fig 5a in all conditions mtz degradation occurred close to 100 at 15 min in general the degradation kinetics of the hydroxyl radicals with an organic contaminant can be regarded as pseudo first order 5 mtz t k abs mtz oh considering that the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals do not accumulate in the solution the concentration of hydroxyl radicals is considered constant throughout the process eq 5 is rearranged to obtain eq 6 73 6 mtz t k app mtz where k abs and k app are absolute and apparent rate constants respectively in fig 5b the pseudo first order reaction kinetics between the hydroxyl radical and the mtz compound in the electro fenton process were examined by the plot of ln c c0 versus electrolysis time the kinetic parameters such as the rate constant and correlation coefficient are given in table 1 increasing the amount of the catalyst from 0 10 g l 1 to 0 50 g l 1 resulted in a 1 5 fold increase in the reaction rate the effect of the prepared go fepo4 catalyst on the mineralization of mtz solution by the electro fenton method can be seen in fig 6a the effects of three different catalyst dosages on mineralization at the ph value of the mtz solution were investigated in addition the obtained results were compared with the mineralization efficiency of the solution adjusted to ph 3 by selecting the most effective catalyst dosage similar to the mtz degradation efficiency the increase in the amount of catalyst increased the mineralization rate in fig 6a at ph 5 when the amounts of heterogeneous catalyst used were 0 10 and 0 25 for 1 h reaction time the toc removal percentages were obtained as 8 1 and 9 2 which are too low due to the limited catalyst active sites at low catalyst amounts sufficient hydroxyl radical formation cannot be achieved as a result of the increase in the amount of catalyst to 0 50 g l 1 the catalyst active sites increased and due to the formation of more hydroxyl radicals 24 8 mineralization was achieved in the equal reaction time if the catalyst amount was 0 50 g l 1 the mineralization removal for the first 3 h remained almost constant but it increased to 44 9 at the end of the 5 h electrolysis time at ph 5 in the case of the lower catalyst dosage the conversion of the cathodically produced hydrogen peroxide to hydroxyl radicals by the iron source has been limited so the degradation of mtz was insufficient and a small number of intermediates formed however as a result of the increase in the amount of catalyst both the degradation of mtz and the formation of intermediate products occurred faster during 3 h in the continuation of the electrolysis period all these intermediate products were fully mineralized when 0 50 g l 1 go fepo4 is used in a solution adjusted to ph 3 which is considered optimum for ef it is seen that the mineralization increases in fig 6a similar to the previous results close toc removal was observed in 1 and 3 h while 65 5 of mineralization was achieved at the end of 5 h during the application of the heterogeneous ef method the amount of iron that passed into the solution medium was also examined if 0 50 g l 1 go fepo4 is used the maximum amount of iron ions that can pass into the solution will be 18 6 mg l 1 0 33 mm but no fe ii fe iii ions were found in the samples taken for 5 h in the analysis performed using the spectrophotometric method which can determine at 1 mg l 1 fe ii and fe iii ions loq 0 5 mg l 1 however free ions passing into solution below the limits of determination may have contributed to mineralization by homogeneous ef depending on the phpzc value 7 0 of the go fepo4 composite structure its surface is positively charged at ph 5 and ph 3 since mtz compound has a more neutral structure at ph 3 than its pka value 2 57 and π π interactions with the go structure will be stronger 74 this facilitates their interactions with hydroxyl radicals occurring on the surface increasing ph to 5 may have increased electrostatic repulsion between the oxygenated functional groups on the go surface and mtz moreover in the electro fenton method hydroxyl radicals are produced by the interaction of the hydrogen peroxide produced on the cathode and the fe ion source herein the distribution of go fepo4 catalyst in solution was achieved by briefly holding in the ultrasonic bath and then mechanical mixing was continued when the electrodes were placed depending on the phpzc value it has the go fepo4 catalyst will interact more with the cathode surface since it will be positively charged at ph 3 the large surface area provided by the carbon felt 38 75 used increased the contact of heterogeneous catalysts thus facilitating the production of hydroxyl radicals due to the following reactions 76 77 7 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 ho 2 h 8 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh hydroperoxyl radical which is formed as a result of a fenton like reaction eq 7 involving fe3 ion has a lower oxidation capacity e0 1 65 v she than the hydroxyl radical e0 2 80 v she 27 76 the presence of the superoxide anion which is the conjugate base structure of the hydroperoxyl radical ho2 h o2 pka 4 8 depends on the ph value of the medium to determine the dominant reactive oxygen species in the oxidation of metronidazole by heterogeneous ef method isopropanol and chloroform were used as oh radical and ho2 o2 radical scavenger respectively isopropanol has been described as a hydroxyl radical scavenger thanks to its high rate constant k 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 of the reaction with the hydroxyl radical 78 chloroform on the other hand reacts with the ho2 o2 radical at a higher rate constant k 3 1010 m 1 s 1 compared to its reaction with the hydroxyl radical k 7 4 106 m 1 s 1 42 as shown in fig 6b chloroform significantly inhibited the degradation of mtz especially at ph 5 it was determined that the inhibition was higher according to these results it can be said that in the heterogeneous ef process with go fepo4 mtz degradation occurs via the hydroperoxyl radical on the other hand while the inhibition effect of isopropanol is lower than that of chloroform it is higher at ph 3 than ph 5 this is indicating that the effect of hydroxyl radical on degradation has been lost its importance with increasing ph finally the reusability of the go fepo4 catalyst was tested in mtz removal for 4 cycles after each experiment go fepo4 was filtered using a 0 2 μm pore ptfe filter washed and dried at 60 c fig 7 shows that there is no significant loss in the activity of the go fepo4 catalyst as discussed in the previous sections the results of ftir sem and eds analysis showed that there wasn t any significant change in the structure after the use of the go fepo4 catalyst guo et al examined the effect of go fepo4 catalyst on the degradation of rhodamine b by the photo fenton method similarly found the iron release to be negligible and reported that they provided effective removal in the ph range of 2 18 10 40 however as seen in this study 100 degradation is achieved at ph 3 and 5 albeit at different times while the mineralization efficiency decreases significantly above ph 3 67 3 3 the effect of fe iii oxalate complex in the homogeneous electro fenton process for mtz degradation in the electro fenton process fe2 ion is oxidized to fe3 ion after the fenton reaction eq 1 and then fe3 is reduced again at the cathode eq 2 and used continuously therefore it has been emphasized in many studies that 0 1 0 2 mm fe2 or fe3 ion is sufficient in case of use of carbon felt cathode 79 80 in our current study fe iii oxalate complex and fe2 ion were used as the iron source in the homogeneous electro fenton experiments fe iii oxalate complex was used at a molar ratio of 0 2 0 6 and fe2 ion was used 0 2 mm the mineralization of mtz solution was investigated at three different ph values using the fe iii oxalate complex the decay of mtz concentration in the ef process with feiii oxalate complex is by following the pseudo first order kinetics as shown in the inset of fig 8a in these experiments rate constants at ph 3 ph 5 and ph 7 were obtained as 0 3657 0 2319 and 0 1931 min 1 respectively as seen in fig 8b in the electro fenton experiments performed using iron ions at ph 3 57 mineralization was obtained after 5 h however when the fe iii oxalate complex containing the same amount of fe ii ion was used at ph 3 the mineralization values reached 58 and 70 at 3 and 5 h respectively despite the increased toc content due to the complex a significant increase in mineralization efficiency was observed in cases the ph of the solution was 5 and 7 after 5 h of electrolysis the mineralization efficiencies were obtained as 47 and 41 respectively at high oxalate concentration the dominant species in fe iii oxalate complex structures are feiii c2o4 2 and feiii c2o4 3 3 around ph 4 81 the fe iii oxalate complex has been used mostly in photo fenton applications in the literature and it has been reported that the fe ii fe iii cycle is facilitated by uv irradiation and accordingly photodegradation is increased 21 29 32 in the ef the standard electrode potential of the cathodic reduction of fe3 ion to fe2 is 0 771 v eq 3 however the conversion of fe iii species to fe ii species is thermodynamically preferable thanks to the standard electrode potential of oxalic acid due to eq 9 82 herein the cathodic reduction has facilitated this cycle by taking on the role of uv light in addition the reaction of the superoxide anion radical with the fe iii oxalate complex also supports the fe iii fe ii cycle eq 10 the fe ii oxalate complex reacts with hydrogen peroxide at a higher rate constant eq 11 compared to the classical fenton reaction eq 1 and forms the hydroxyl radical 9 2 co 2 g 2 h 2 e h 2 c 2 o 4

species is highest at ph 4 0 it decreases with increasing ph becoming the dominant species fe oh 2 81 isopropyl alcohol and chloroform were added as inhibitors for hydroxyl radical and hydroperoxyl superoxide anion radical respectively to determine the active oxygen species effective in mtz oxidation with fe iii oxalate complex at ph 3 it is seen in fig 8c that mtz degradation is more active due to the hydroxyl radical but the hydroperoxyl radical plays a role in the degradation the change of oxalic acid concentration at ph 3 in the homogeneous fenton experiments was monitored by hplc analysis the results showed that the oxalic acid concentration increased to approximately 0 65 mm in the first 20 min and then remained almost constant for 3 h the short linear carboxylic acid structures formed in the electro fenton method form complexes with fe3 ions and the mineralization rate slows down as these complex structures are more resistant to hydroxyl radicals 76 the addition of fe iii oxalate complex to the medium prevented the complex formation attempts of these acid structures and improved their mineralization to co2 and h2o the fact that the oxalic acid concentration remained constant in this study supports this phenomenon contreras et al reported that decomposition products such as carboxylic acid especially oxalic acid formed in oxidation by the electro fenton method considerably increase the biodegradability 19 finally some degradation products identified by lc ms ms analysis as mtz degradation products are given in table 2 due to the degradation of mtz begins with the electrophilic attack of oh radicals it is not difficult to predict that it will proceed similarly as we described in our previous work 55 the results shown in table 2 have confirmed this assumption the aromatic molecules identified as intermediate products are respectively 3 2 hydroxy ethyl 2 methyl 3h imidazol 4 ol ii 2 methyl 5 nitro imidazol 1 yl acetic acid iii 5 hydroxy 2 methyl imidazol 1 yl acetic acid iv 2 methyl 5 nitro 1h imidazole v 2 methyl 3h imidazol 4 ol vi and 5 amino 1 2 hydroxyethyl 2 methyl 1h imidazol 4 ol vii detection of possible intermediates in degradation studies is an important analysis that should be done to prevent more toxic products that may form 4 conclusions the degradation of mtz antibiotic solution was compared using heterogeneous and homogeneous ef processes in the work go fepo4 catalyst was used as a heterogeneous catalyst fe2 ion and fe iii oxalate complex were used as homogeneous catalysts the characterization of the go fepo4 structure was performed by xrd fe sem eds and ft ir analysis it was determined that the go fepo4 composite was more effective at ph 3 in the heterogeneous ef process and the maximum mineralization percentages was determined as 65 5 at the end of 5 h there was no iron ion leachate into the solution during the heterogeneous fenton process also the effectiveness of the heterogeneous catalyst which was collected from the treated solution with an external magnet was not significantly reduced after 4 repetitions in the homogeneous ef process it was found that at ph 3 57 mineralization efficiency obtained with fe2 ions was increased to 70 with the addition of fe iii oxalate complex containing the same amount of iron ions also for the heterogeneous ef process and homogeneous ef process it was determined that the dominant radical species responsible for the degradation of mtz were hydroperoxyl radical and hydroxyl radical respectively for future investigations we have proven that the go fepo4 composite can be an alternative to homogeneous catalysts as a heterogeneous catalyst for organic pollutants due to its performance on the removal of mtz both the reusability of go fepo4 and the variability of the amount of fepo4 it contains will encourage future studies in addition it is stated in the literature that more effective removal methods can be developed with fenton techniques which will be applied before biological treatment processes with this aspect of our study it is seen that fenton systems can be used to develop and adapt them to

13388,the study explored the experimental conditions to enable co metabolism of olive mill wastewater omw pretreated by fenton based oxidation when combined with a compatible waste in a sequencing batch reactor sbr for this purpose peptone mixture was used as the synthetic substrate well tested for its similar biodegradation character with sewage emphasis was placed upon the degree of dilution that could be afforded without upsetting the performance of biological process the sbr operation involved four cycles a day at a sludge age of 8 0 days the cod level of the peptone mixture feeding was kept constant as 400 mg l to simulate a relatively weak sewage after acclimation of biomass to the synthetic substrate sbr operation continued for 105 days with gradually increasing omw additions in four consecutive phases with cod increments between 40 and 100 mg l and no omw addition in the last phase co metabolism with complete removal of biodegradable cod in omw could be sustained under cyclic steady state conditions of each phase biodegradation characteristics of omw could be defined in terms of cod fractionation and process kinetics they were used in model simulation of in cycle cod profiles at the end of each cycle the study advocated co metabolism as a novel and sustainable approach of wastewater management of olive mill wastewater when properly diluted in sewage or a compatible wastewater and jointly subjected to biological treatment a pre requisite for omw it is believed that the proposed approach embodies all scientific and practical attributes to provide the long awaited solution for this industry graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords olive mill wastewater fenton oxidation co metabolism sequencing batch reactor process kinetics 1 introduction extensive research effort has been devoted to explore the olive mill wastewater omw involving its characterization together with a wide spectrum of different processes tested and proposed for its treatment yet the available information still falls short of providing an acceptable answer for a sustainable treatment strategy which would secure safe disposal of the treated effluent to the environment 1 3 it is now well known that omw is a complex and strong wastewater with a chemical oxygen demand cod content often exceeding 100 g l along with significant levels of recalcitrant and toxic chemicals such as polyphenols tannins long chain fatty acids etc 4 5 in conventional characterization filtration through 450 nm is the only size implication differentiating particulate pollutant fractions from the soluble ones unlike domestic sewage where the particulate cod accounts for the majority of the total cod 6 7 the remaining cod of the omw after initial storage in a lagoon is mainly soluble olmez hanci et al 8 reported the soluble fraction as approximately 85 of a total cod level of 47 000 52 000 mg l the experimental data of dogruel et al 9 observed the magnitude of the soluble fractions as 72 for cod and 77 for total phenols recently the assessment of the particle size distribution psd of cod has offered quite a useful size perspective to wastewater characterization especially in terms of better understanding of fractions with different biodegradation properties the method developed and proposed by dulekgurgen et al 10 involving sequential filtration and ultrafiltration enabled to locate fractions of cod and other selected parameters within nine different size intervals between and beyond 1600 nm all the way down to 2 nm so far this method has been widely applied to sewage as well as different industrial wastewaters 11 12 the psd analysis was also carried out for omw and placed 27 000 mg l of cod below the size range of 2 nm accounting for 26 of the total cod and 60 of the soluble cod in raw wastewater 13 for an omw initially stored in a lagoon the cod concentration below 2 nm was found as 19 250 mg l still a very sizable level corresponding to 49 of the total cod in the settled wastewater 9 the performance of different processes tested for omw treatment were found to only provide partial treatment chemical treatment followed by ultrafiltration with a membrane pore size of 10 kda could only reduce the cod of the raw wastewater from 106 000 mg l down to 33 000 mg l in total agreement with the psd analysis which yielded cumulative cod levels of 38 300 mg l 36 000 mg l and 33 000 mg l with ultrafiltration at 30 10 and 3 kda respectively 13 in a recent study carried on omw stored in a lagoon ultrasonically enhanced fenton based oxidation following chemical settling was evaluated to reduce cod to the range below 20 000 mg l with high fenol removal 14 the studies focused on total phenol and toxicity reduction in omw were established the efficiency of fenton based oxidation advanced oxidation processes especially as a pretreatment step prior of biological treatment 2 15 these results clearly underlined two significant indications i biological treatment has to be the indispensable final treatment stage due to the magnitude of soluble cod accumulated in the far end of the soluble size range ii a first stage of pretreatment conditioning has to precede the final biological treatment step mainly to alleviate the recalcitrant and toxic nature of the wastewater first the need for biological treatment was explored by means of integrated systems involving a sequence of different biological process a typical example is work by hamdi et al 16 where a three stage process involving an aerobic detoxification unit based on the growth of aspergillus niger followed by an anaerobic step with methane generation and a final aerobic treatment was tested with omw the system did not prove satisfactory in term of polyphenol removal which imparted a black color to the effluent then the emphasis was placed on treatment by different activated sludge configurations using significantly diluted omw dhaouadi et al 17 tested an mbr system for an omw with a cod and total phenol tph contents of 117 g l and 6 3 g l respectively kinetic analyses were conducted in batch reactors with 1 40 diluted wastewater the mbr system was operated with omw diluted down to 1500 mg l and 5300 mg l while tph removal was satisfactory cod removal dropped to 37 when the influent cod was increased to 5300 mg l jaouad et al 18 compared performance of laboratory scale mbr and conventional activated sludge systems on heavily diluted omw around 1 100 using biomass acclimated to a glucose based synthetic substrate and reported 80 90 removals for both cod and tph farabegoli et al 19 started their study with an interesting question dilution or pretreatment when treating an omw with a cod of 63 5 g l and tph of 1 9 g l in an sbr process operated with a cycle time of 1 0 d and a sludge retention time of 30 d after experiments with raw wastewater diluted to cod levels of 1300 mg l and 2600 mg l and pretreated wastewater with granular activated carbon they recommended dilution option and co treatment with different waste streams interesting studies were also reported on direct disposal of omw in mixture with other solid wastes mainly to recover its organic matter content as energy kraiem et al 20 investigated disposal of omw through impregnation on sawdust and exhausted olive oil solid waste followed by thermal degradation of the composite materials the results indicated increased energy recovery and lower gaseous emissions at the expense of higher ash generation in a similar study conducted by haddad et al 21 the pyrolysis of omw impregnated onto raw cypress sawdust yielded bio fertilizer containing important nutrients increasing the plant growth the direct disposal approaches tested in these studies could be evaluated as a promising issue for the valorization of the organic content of omw in specific cases review of major work on biological treatment summarized above clearly show that they bear no relevance and involve no information value mainly because they do not reveal any acceptable clue how the substantial level of dilution they advocated will be practically provided appropriate course of action should properly account for serious concerns expressed on the subject i the magnitude of cod in the low size fraction as well as inhibitors and toxicants is too high for direct application of activated sludge configurations ii seasonal production mostly in late autumn and early winter is not compatible with biological treatment which requires continuous operation iii olive oil production usually involve small plants scatted in rural areas in view of these concerns a recent study presented a sustainable alternative with experimental support suggesting that the pretreated omw be diluted when combined with sewage of an adjacent community in a continuously operated municipal treatment facility 22 despite the rural character of the olive oil production the proposed alternative is quite a viable option it is customary to hold the omw in local lagoons mainly for natural evaporation but essentially serving as primary settlers it is quite feasible to haul the supernatant the pre settled omw in the lagoon into an equalization tank where it may be mixed to secure appropriate dilution with sewage for co treatment in the municipal biological treatment system in this context the objective of the study was to provide experimental support for this management strategy exploring the biological treatability of pretreated omw by fenton based oxidation when combined with a synthetic substrate well tested for its similar biodegradation character with sewage emphasis in the experimental study was placed upon the degree of dilution that could be afforded without upsetting the performance of an sbr system utilized for this purpose 2 materials and methods 2 1 study rationale the experimental study was designed to provide experimental evidence for suggesting co metabolism of omw when properly mixed and diluted into a major waste stream preferably domestic sewage in a continuously operated biological treatment facility this approach appears to be the essential component of a sustainable treatment scheme with due consideration of two significant issues i the major portion of the high cod content of omw remains accumulated in the far end of the particle size distribution despite a variety of pretreatment technologies ii pretreatment is still required to remove recalcitrant and toxic components in omw such as polyphenols to ensure its compatibility to biological treatment iii co treatment is the only viable option due the seasonal and intermittent nature of omw generation not well suited for biological treatment a recent study advocated pretreatment by means of fenton based advanced oxidation with ferric ion fe3 which insured high removal levels of total phenol and toxicity for better biodegradation 14 in this context the experiments were carried out with omw samples pretreated by fenton based fe3 oxidation and diluted in a synthetic wastewater stream which closely exhibits the same character with sewage in gradually increasing dozes the results were evaluated to mainly assess successful co metabolism of the mixture in a sequencing batch reactor sbr type of an activated sludge configuration and to determine the degree of dilution that can be afforded to ensure a satisfactory level of biodegradation without any inhibitory effect 2 2 sbr operation the sbr process has inherent positive attributes for serving as a perfect instrument for biodegradation studies 23 it offers distinct advantages compared to activated sludge configurations with continuous flow while the latter only yields a single value in the reactor effluent for each parameter at steady state sbr reflects within in each cycle transient responses of selected parameters which can be readily interpreted by means of modeling moreover it generated identical cyclic responses at steady state defined by the culture history sludge age an indispensable factor in biological treatment among significant examples the work by orhon et al 24 may be cited where sbr operation revealed the fundamentals on the formation of soluble residual microbial products and the study by karahan et al 25 may be remembered for suggesting a new model structure on simultaneous growth and biochemical storage although studies have been carried out to include sbr in the treatment scheme of different industrial wastewaters 26 28 this study will be the first account for the co metabolism of omw when diluted in a compatible wastewater stream laboratory scale sbr experiments were conducted with a fully mixed aerobic reactor with a working volume of 4 5 l the initial biomass seed was obtained from the hurma advanced biological wastewater treatment plant in antalya turkey the system operation involved four cycles a day each with a total cycle time tc of 6 0 h as schematically displayed in fig 1 each cycle started with a fully mixed idle time ti of 10 min followed by a process time tp of 290 min where the initial 15 min was devoted to influent feeding after the process phase the cycle was completed with a settling period ts of 30 min and a decant period td of 30 min the biological mechanism in the sbr were controlled by a sludge retention time srt of 8 0 d a usually selected value of the activated sludge treatment of domestic sewage the srt was maintained by waste sludge withdrawal tw during the last 2 min of the process phase the nominal hydraulic retention time was adjusted to 18 h the total volume of the reactor had a stationary volume v0 of 3 l holding settled biomass and a fill volume vf of 1 5 l detailed information on the relationships between different operating parameters is available in the report by artan and orhon 29 2 3 characteristics of substrate mixture a peptone meat extract mixture called peptone mixture for simplicity served as the main substrate in the experiments the peptone mixture pm is quite compatible with the objective of the study for a number of reasons i it is recommended as the standard synthetic substrate in iso 8192 30 ii respirometric assessments indicated that it exhibited a cod fractionation with readily biodegradable dual hydrolysable cod fractions and a corresponding biodegradation profile quite similar with domestic sewage 31 iii it was used as the organic carbon source in many significant studies for removal of toxic substance such as antibiotics 32 33 and amide pharmaceuticals 34 furthermore the use of pm as the main synthetic wastewater has another significant merit in the sense that its characteristics may be kept the same throughout the entire experimental period whereas changing properties of domestic sewage during the same period would run the risk of masking the possible impact of omw addition experiments on co metabolism of the peptone mixture with omw was tested by gradually increasing levels omw in different stages of the sbr operation the cod concentration of the pm was kept constant as 400 mg l to simulate a relatively weak sewage and omw additions were adjusted to provide cod increments of 40 10 80 20 and 100 mg l 25 so that the sbr operation involved three consecutive runs with substrate mixtures of 440 mg l 480 mg l and 500 mg l cod in the reactor influent stream as explained and justified above omw was subjected to a pretreatment step before being mixed up and diluted with the mainstream substrate for sbr treatment the pretreatment consisted of fenton based advanced oxidation involving ferric ion fe3 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 additions based on selected molar ratios of 2 15 for h2o2 cod and 35 for h2o2 fe3 14 fenton based enhanced oxidation was applied in 500 ml samples to a total of 20 l of omw for pretreatment with fenton based oxidation after the addition of h2o2 and fe3 to provide the molar ratios of 2 15 for h2o2 cod and 35 for h2o2 fe3 the ph was adjusted to 3 5 0 01 using 1 m and 6 m sulfuric acid to initiate oxidation reaction at the end of the experiments the ph was immediately adjusted to ph 12 using 1 m and 6 m sodium hydroxide to stop the oxidation reaction samples were allowed to settle down for a 1 h and they were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 15 min after collection of settled 20 l of omw final cod and tph levels were measured as 12 400 mg l and 45 6 mg l respectively the pretreated omw was stored in a tank at 4 c for the following co metabolism step after ph adjustment to ph 8 0 by means of 6 n h2so4 dosage 2 4 analytical methods the total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solid vss concentrations were measured according to standard methods 35 cod concentrations were measured as described in the iso 6060 method 36 the tph concentrations were determined by lc 345 test kit hach lange according to 4 nitroaniline method 37 3 experimental results the laboratory scale sbr was operated with a cycle time of 6 h in a temperature controlled room 20 2 c by using the peptone mixture pm as the synthetic substrate at a cod concentration of 400 mg l fig 2 shows the profiles of the tss and vss concentrations in the mixed liquor as well as the trends versus time of the cod concentrations in the effluent over an acclimatization period of one month during the first weeks of the acclimation period the vss and tss contents within the reactor increased gradually from 2350 and 2800 mg l to 2650 and 3300 mg l respectively whereas the effluent cod exhibited a continuous decrease from 83 to 52 mg l in this phase once steady state conditions were achieved in the sbr after 15 days of operation the sludge retention time srt was maintained at 8 d by regular sludge wastage at the end of the acclimation stage the tss concentration stabilized at 3280 20 mg l accompanied with a relatively constant effluent cod of 51 3 mg l table 1 summarizes a compilation of literature data on the performance of the sbr system under different operational conditions the biodegradation efficiencies were investigated over three srts in the range of 8 10 d while the experimental runs were performed at cycle lengths of 12 and 24 h corresponding to 2 and 1 cycle s per day respectively the data presented in table 1 indicated that more than 85 cod reduction was achieved in the reactor with influent cod concentrations varying between 300 and 1300 mg l regardless of the cycle time and srt applied the cod removal rate of 87 observed in this study fell within the range reported in the literature though it was closer to the lower end by increasing omw additions in four consecutive phases with cod increments in the range of 40 100 mg l 10 25 and adding no omw in the last phase the co treatment of omw and synthetic wastewater in the sbr system was investigated to ascertain whether a possible inhibition effect could be noticed as demonstrated in fig 3 a the first run involving 400 mg cod l of peptone mixture pm with an incremental dose of omw diluted to 40 mg cod l 10 revealed a drastic increase in effluent cod and tph contents steady state conditions were assumed to be achieved after approximately two srts i e 15 days since less than 10 variation was observed in the most recent measurements of effluent quality parameters from the fig 3 it was evident that the cod concentration was stabilized at the level of 59 3 mg l corresponding to an elimination rate of 87 the effluent tph value reached a plateau at 0 55 0 06 mg l at the end of the first phase the performance of the second run conducted with pm and an additional omw dose of 80 mg cod l 20 is illustrated in fig 3b as shown in the figure the effluent cod content of the sbr remained constant at 70 2 mg l with a removal efficiency of 85 when the steady state was reached after two weeks of operation at steady state operating conditions the amount of tph became stationary at a concentration of 0 72 0 08 mg l the effluent cod and tph profiles obtained in the third run carried out at an omw dose of 100 mg cod l 25 together with the pm is visualized in fig 4 a following an acclimation period of 15 days a noticeable decrease in the cod concentration was observed during steady state operation of the sbr reaching a stable value of 73 3 mg l whereas the tph content averaged at 1 12 0 20 mg l in the fourth and final run omw feeding was stopped to evaluate whether the performance of the sbr system could restore to a favorable level rapidly after a short adjustment phase of only two weeks as can be seen in fig 4b the effluent concentrations of cod and tph were stabilized at 50 2 mg l and 0 51 0 10 mg l respectively when the feeding pattern was switched to the pm alone comparative evaluation of the experimental results revealed that the co treatment of omw and pm in sbr up to a feeding ratio of 1 4 based on cod mass did not result in a deterioration of the effluent quality the cyclic cod profiles were determined for the initial acclimation period with peptone mixture pm alone and third run pm with an omw increment of 100 mg cod l to evaluate the performance of the sbr system during one cycle of operation at steady state fig 5 a clearly indicated that as expected peptone was almost consumed completely yielding an effluent cod content of only 50 mg l as displayed in fig 5b the cod concentration in the supernatant of the sbr could be reduced to 68 mg l at the end of the reaction time when a 25 increase in the cod level of peptone mixture was created 4 discussion 4 1 model interpretation major processes defining metabolic activities of the microbial culture in activated sludge configurations can now be evaluated by means of multi component biokinetic models 42 this approach equally relies on selection of an appropriate model structure and experimental assessment of model coefficients providing a fingerprint of wastewaters in the study it should be noted that the recognition of dissolved oxygen as a major model component should be regarded as a milestone that paved the way for respirometric measurements 43 44 today model calibration of the oxygen uptake rate our profile generation by an acclimated microbial culture allows complete kinetic description of the substrate wastewater in terms of numerical values of the model coefficients as well as cod fractionation 32 45 this study involved the peptone mixture and the pm omw mixture as the source of organic carbon in sbr operation therefore the selected model structure included different cod fractions associated with the peptone mixture namely readily biodegradable cod ssp dual hydrolysis with readily hydrolysable sh1 and slowly hydrolysable sh2 fractions all totally soluble and with no inert components similarly omw was defined in terms of readily biodegradable cod sso single hydrolysis with hydrolysable cod sho and inert cod sio fractions accordingly the adopted model essentially involved asm1 template 42 modified for endogenous metabolism 46 with active heterotrophic biomass concentration xh and dissolved oxygen concentration so and decay associated generation of residual soluble and particulate metabolic products sp and xp 47 the matrix representation of the selected model is given in table 2 a recent study explored the kinetic aspects concerning the co metabolism of omw with a compatible waste also peptone mixture on the basis on model calibration of our profiles associated with different wastewater components 22 the results displayed in table 3 reveal significant issues as summarized below i model simulation of the in cycle cod profiles implemented with the process kinetics defined in the table provided a perfect match with the experimental observations as shown in fig 5 both for the peptone mixture alone and when mixed with 25 omw this way modeling confirmed the co metabolism of the omw in the mixture to the extent that all its biodegradable cod is utilized and removed in the sbr operation ii the information derived from respirometric analysis indicated the impact of omw addition on the biodegradation kinetics of the mixture a retardation effect on the utilization readily biodegradable substrate as evidenced by a slightly lower maximum growth rate μh value and a higher half saturation constant ksp level for readily biodegradable cod with no significant bearing on substrate utilization at a sludge age level of 8 days selected for sbr operation an increase in the endogenous decay coefficient bh from 0 15 d to 30 d which means higher generation of residual metabolic products i e intracellular waste materials requiring a maintenance energy increase for their transport outside the cells iii the respirometric evaluation also provided novel information on the cod fractionation of the omw in the substrate mixture aside from a soluble inert cod fraction sio of 10 reported by farabegoli et al 19 the total cod of omw included 12 readily biodegradable cod sso and 78 slowly biodegradable cod sho this way the incremental cod of around 18 mg l between the sbr performance when treating pm alone and mixed with 25 omw as shown in fig 5 can be attributed to inert cod fraction sio and the generated soluble residual metabolic products spo confirming total co metabolism of the omw in the mixture iv the kinetic information defined for the peptone mixture in table 3 also confirmed its similarity with domestic wastewater when compared with the process kinetics reported for sewage 7 as the main difference the peptone mixture involves no inert cod fraction and includes a soluble slowly biodegradable cod fraction sh2 which may escape the reactor due to partial removal instead of being entrapped in the biomass 4 2 practical implications this study tested co metabolism of omw up to an upper threshold of 100 mg cod l which created a 25 increase in the cod level of peptone mixture acting as the main wastewater stream this threshold although empirically selected in the study is quite significant because further increase on the one hand will augment the treatment requirement of the omw increment but on the other hand it runs the risk of jeopardizing the performance of the common biological treatment plant under higher organic loadings thus the proposed mixing level should be justified in situ experiments for each case it is obvious that omws require pretreatment mainly to reduce the cod and total phenol contents to levels acceptable for the proposed co metabolism with sewage or other compatible waste streams this study tested fenton oxidation as an effective pretreatment step other pretreatment approaches may also be envisaged as sustainable alternatives in a recent study bargaoui et al 48 proposed alternative pretreatment schemes involving impregnation filtration of omw onto raw cypress sawdust and electrocoagulation in two different sequences which provided a cod removal range of 65 to 76 with efficient energy consumption fenton oxidation was also recommended as the final polishing step the proposed co treatment scheme is quite sustainable for practical applications since exclusive biological treatment is not possible due to seasonal generation of omw with a very high level of organic matter cod content testing the feasibility of joint treatment may be carried out for an arbitrarily selected small adjacent community with a sewage flow of 5000 m3 d and the same cod content of 400 mg l a weak sewage as in this study treated in a local municipal treatment facility a locally generated omw pretreated by fenton oxidation would still contain more than 12 000 mg cod l observed in the sample used in this study therefore the above sewage stream would only accept around 45 m3 d omw mixing which would raise the cod level to 500 mg l without appreciably changing the hydraulic regime of the treatment plant it should be noted that this mixing scheme offers a sustainable solution because it would allow proper disposal and treatment of more than 16 000 m3 year of omw stored in equalization facilities after pretreatment distance would not be a problem for mixing with sewage at the nearest location since it would only involve tanker hauling and or pumping of only 45 m3 d of omw throughout the year this amount could be increased for a stronger sewage stream pending suitable capacity of the common treatment facility it should be noted that the economical aspects while beyond the scope of the study would closely depend on the magnitude of the omw flow to be treated and the selected pretreatment scheme 5 conclusion the results of this study provided conclusive experimental proof on complete biodegradation of olive mill wastewater in a sequencing batch reactor a widely implemented activated sludge configuration when properly dosed into the peptone mixture stream a synthetic substrate exhibiting a similar character with sewage in terms of cod fractionation and process kinetics successful co metabolism was observed for different mixing ratios of omw which were gradually increased to 25 of the cod level in the peptone mixture this mixing threshold should be checked and confirmed for each case in accordance with the characteristics of the available biological treatment facility full biodegradation of the olive mill wastewater was secured by fenton oxidation applied as a pretreatment step after initial holding in lagoons which removed total phenols and other recalcitrant chemicals prior to biological treatment cod fractionation and process kinetics disclosed suggested for olive mill wastewater served as modeling ingredients to justify the in cycle cod profiles observed in sbr operation biological treatment is a prerequisite for olive mill wastewater due to very high level of soluble cod accumulation at the low end of the particle size even after an effective pretreatment step however it is not applicable on site because of seasonal production and wastewater generation and rural nature of the industry the study advocated co metabolism as a novel and sustainable approach of wastewater management of olive mill wastewater when properly diluted in sewage or a compatible wastewater it is strongly believed that the proposed

soluble olmez hanci et al 8 reported the soluble fraction as approximately 85 of a total cod level of 47 000 52 000 mg l the experimental data of dogruel et al 9 observed the magnitude of the soluble fractions as 72 for cod and 77 for total phenols recently the assessment of the particle size distribution psd of cod has offered quite a useful size perspective to wastewater characterization especially in terms of better understanding of fractions with different biodegradation properties the method developed and proposed by dulekgurgen et al 10 involving sequential filtration and ultrafiltration enabled to locate fractions of cod and other selected parameters within nine different size intervals between and beyond 1600 nm all the way down to 2 nm so far this method has been widely applied to sewage as well as different industrial wastewaters 11 12 the psd analysis was also carried out for omw and placed 27 000 mg l of cod below the size range of 2 nm accounting for 26 of the total cod and 60 of the soluble cod in raw wastewater 13 for an omw initially stored in a lagoon the cod concentration below 2 nm was found as 19 250 mg l still a very sizable level corresponding to 49 of the total cod in the settled wastewater 9 the performance of different processes tested for omw treatment were found to only provide partial treatment chemical treatment followed by ultrafiltration with a membrane pore size of 10 kda could only reduce the cod of the raw wastewater from 106 000 mg l down to 33 000 mg l in total agreement with the psd analysis which yielded cumulative cod levels of 38 300 mg l 36 000 mg l and 33 000 mg l with ultrafiltration at 30 10 and 3 kda respectively 13 in a recent study carried on omw stored in a lagoon ultrasonically enhanced fenton based oxidation following chemical settling was evaluated to reduce cod to the range below 20 000 mg l with high fenol removal 14 the studies focused on total phenol and toxicity reduction in omw were established the efficiency of fenton based oxidation advanced oxidation processes especially as a pretreatment step prior of biological treatment 2 15 these results clearly underlined two significant indications i biological treatment has to be the indispensable final treatment stage due to the magnitude of soluble cod accumulated in the far end of the soluble size range ii a first stage of pretreatment conditioning has to precede the final biological treatment step mainly to alleviate the recalcitrant and toxic nature of the wastewater first the need for biological treatment was explored by means of integrated systems involving a sequence of different biological process a typical example is work by hamdi et al 16 where a three stage process involving an aerobic detoxification unit based on the growth of aspergillus niger followed by an anaerobic step with methane generation and a final aerobic treatment was tested with omw the system did not prove satisfactory in term of polyphenol removal which imparted a black color to the effluent then the emphasis was placed on treatment by different activated sludge configurations using significantly diluted omw dhaouadi et al 17 tested an mbr system for an omw with a cod and total phenol tph contents of 117 g l and 6 3 g l respectively kinetic analyses were conducted in batch reactors with 1 40 diluted wastewater the mbr system was operated with omw diluted down to 1500 mg l and 5300 mg l while tph removal was satisfactory cod removal dropped to 37 when the influent cod was increased to 5300 mg l jaouad et al 18 compared performance of laboratory scale mbr and conventional activated sludge systems on heavily diluted omw around 1 100 using biomass acclimated to a glucose based synthetic substrate and reported 80 90 removals for both cod and tph farabegoli et al 19 started their study with an interesting question dilution or pretreatment when treating an omw with a cod of 63 5 g l and tph of 1 9 g l in an sbr process operated with a cycle time of 1 0 d and a sludge retention time of 30 d after experiments with raw wastewater diluted to cod levels of 1300 mg l and 2600 mg l and pretreated wastewater with granular activated carbon they recommended dilution option and co treatment with different waste streams interesting studies were also reported on direct disposal of omw in mixture with other solid wastes mainly to recover its organic matter content as energy kraiem et al 20 investigated disposal of omw through impregnation on sawdust and exhausted olive oil solid waste followed by thermal degradation of the composite materials the results indicated increased energy recovery and lower gaseous emissions at the expense of higher ash generation in a similar study conducted by haddad et al 21 the pyrolysis of omw impregnated onto raw cypress sawdust yielded bio fertilizer containing important nutrients increasing the plant growth the direct disposal approaches tested in these studies could be evaluated as a promising issue for the valorization of the organic content of omw in specific cases review of major work on biological treatment summarized above clearly show that they bear no relevance and involve no information value mainly because they do not reveal any acceptable clue how the substantial level of dilution they advocated will be practically provided appropriate course of action should properly account for serious concerns expressed on the subject i the magnitude of cod in the low size fraction as well as inhibitors and toxicants is too high for direct application of activated sludge configurations ii seasonal production mostly in late autumn and early winter is not compatible with biological treatment which requires continuous operation iii olive oil production usually involve small plants scatted in rural areas in view of these concerns a recent study presented a sustainable alternative with experimental support suggesting that the pretreated omw be diluted when combined with sewage of an adjacent community in a continuously operated municipal treatment facility 22 despite the rural character of the olive oil production the proposed alternative is quite a viable option it is customary to hold the omw in local lagoons mainly for natural evaporation but essentially serving as primary settlers it is quite feasible to haul the supernatant the pre settled omw in the lagoon into an equalization tank where it may be mixed to secure appropriate dilution with sewage for co treatment in the municipal biological treatment system in this context the objective of the study was to provide experimental support for this management strategy exploring the biological treatability of pretreated omw by fenton based oxidation when combined with a synthetic substrate well tested for its similar biodegradation character with sewage emphasis in the experimental study was placed upon the degree of dilution that could be afforded without upsetting the performance of an sbr system utilized for this purpose 2 materials and methods 2 1 study rationale the experimental study was designed to provide experimental evidence for suggesting co metabolism of omw when properly mixed and diluted into a major waste stream preferably domestic sewage in a continuously operated biological treatment facility this approach appears to be the essential component of a sustainable treatment scheme with due consideration of two significant issues i the major portion of the high cod content of omw remains accumulated in the far end of the particle size distribution despite a variety of pretreatment technologies ii pretreatment is still required to remove recalcitrant and toxic components in omw such as polyphenols to ensure its compatibility to biological treatment iii co treatment is the only viable option due the seasonal and intermittent nature of omw generation not well suited for biological treatment a recent study advocated pretreatment by means of fenton based advanced oxidation with ferric ion fe3 which insured high removal levels of total phenol and toxicity for better biodegradation 14 in this context the experiments were carried out with omw samples pretreated by fenton based fe3 oxidation and diluted in a synthetic wastewater stream which closely exhibits the same character with sewage in gradually increasing dozes the results were evaluated to mainly assess successful co metabolism of the mixture in a sequencing batch reactor sbr type of an activated sludge configuration and to determine the degree of dilution that can be afforded to ensure a satisfactory level of biodegradation without any inhibitory effect 2 2 sbr operation the sbr process has inherent positive attributes for serving as a perfect instrument for biodegradation studies 23 it offers distinct advantages compared to activated sludge configurations with continuous flow while the latter only yields a single value in the reactor effluent for each parameter at steady state sbr reflects within in each cycle transient responses of selected parameters which can be readily interpreted by means of modeling moreover it generated identical cyclic responses at steady state defined by the culture history sludge age an indispensable factor in biological treatment among significant examples the work by orhon et al 24 may be cited where sbr operation revealed the fundamentals on the formation of soluble residual microbial products and the study by karahan et al 25 may be remembered for suggesting a new model structure on simultaneous growth and biochemical storage although studies have been carried out to include sbr in the treatment scheme of different industrial wastewaters 26 28 this study will be the first account for the co metabolism of omw when diluted in a compatible wastewater stream laboratory scale sbr experiments were conducted with a fully mixed aerobic reactor with a working volume of 4 5 l the initial biomass seed was obtained from the hurma advanced biological wastewater treatment plant in antalya turkey the system operation involved four cycles a day each with a total cycle time tc of 6 0 h as schematically displayed in fig 1 each cycle started with a fully mixed idle time ti of 10 min followed by a process time tp of 290 min where the initial 15 min was devoted to influent feeding after the process phase the cycle was completed with a settling period ts of 30 min and a decant period td of 30 min the biological mechanism in the sbr were controlled by a sludge retention time srt of 8 0 d a usually selected value of the activated sludge treatment of domestic sewage the srt was maintained by waste sludge withdrawal tw during the last 2 min of the process phase the nominal hydraulic retention time was adjusted to 18 h the total volume of the reactor had a stationary volume v0 of 3 l holding settled biomass and a fill volume vf of 1 5 l detailed information on the relationships between different operating parameters is available in the report by artan and orhon 29 2 3 characteristics of substrate mixture a peptone meat extract mixture called peptone mixture for simplicity served as the main substrate in the experiments the peptone mixture pm is quite compatible with the objective of the study for a number of reasons i it is recommended as the standard synthetic substrate in iso 8192 30 ii respirometric assessments indicated that it exhibited a cod fractionation with readily biodegradable dual hydrolysable cod fractions and a corresponding biodegradation profile quite similar with domestic sewage 31 iii it was used as the organic carbon source in many significant studies for removal of toxic substance such as antibiotics 32 33 and amide pharmaceuticals 34 furthermore the use of pm as the main synthetic wastewater has another significant merit in the sense that its characteristics may be kept the same throughout the entire experimental period whereas changing properties of domestic sewage during the same period would run the risk of masking the possible impact of omw addition experiments on co metabolism of the peptone mixture with omw was tested by gradually increasing levels omw in different stages of the sbr operation the cod concentration of the pm was kept constant as 400 mg l to simulate a relatively weak sewage and omw additions were adjusted to provide cod increments of 40 10 80 20 and 100 mg l 25 so that the sbr operation involved three consecutive runs with substrate mixtures of 440 mg l 480 mg l and 500 mg l cod in the reactor influent stream as explained and justified above omw was subjected to a pretreatment step before being mixed up and diluted with the mainstream substrate for sbr treatment the pretreatment consisted of fenton based advanced oxidation involving ferric ion fe3 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 additions based on selected molar ratios of 2 15 for h2o2 cod and 35 for h2o2 fe3 14 fenton based enhanced oxidation was applied in 500 ml samples to a total of 20 l of omw for pretreatment with fenton based oxidation after the addition of h2o2 and fe3 to provide the molar ratios of 2 15 for h2o2 cod and 35 for h2o2 fe3 the ph was adjusted to 3 5 0 01 using 1 m and 6 m sulfuric acid to initiate oxidation reaction at the end of the experiments the ph was immediately adjusted to ph 12 using 1 m and 6 m sodium hydroxide to stop the oxidation reaction samples were allowed to settle down for a 1 h and they were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 15 min after collection of settled 20 l of omw final cod and tph levels were measured as 12 400 mg l and 45 6 mg l respectively the pretreated omw was stored in a tank at 4 c for the following co metabolism step after ph adjustment to ph 8 0 by means of 6 n h2so4 dosage 2 4 analytical methods the total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solid vss concentrations were measured according to standard methods 35 cod concentrations were measured as described in the iso 6060 method 36 the tph concentrations were determined by lc 345 test kit hach lange according to 4 nitroaniline method 37 3 experimental results the laboratory scale sbr was operated with a cycle time of 6 h in a temperature controlled room 20 2 c by using the peptone mixture pm as the synthetic substrate at a cod concentration of 400 mg l fig 2 shows the profiles of the tss and vss concentrations in the mixed liquor as well as the trends versus time of the cod concentrations in the effluent over an acclimatization period of one month during the first weeks of the acclimation period the vss and tss contents within the reactor increased gradually from 2350 and 2800 mg l to 2650 and 3300 mg l respectively whereas the effluent cod exhibited a continuous decrease from 83 to 52 mg l in this phase once steady state conditions were achieved in the sbr after 15 days of operation the sludge retention time srt was maintained at 8 d by regular sludge wastage at the end of the acclimation stage the tss concentration stabilized at 3280 20 mg l accompanied with a relatively constant effluent cod of 51 3 mg l table 1 summarizes a compilation of literature data on the performance of the sbr system under different operational conditions the biodegradation efficiencies were investigated over three srts in the range of 8 10 d while the experimental runs were performed at cycle lengths of 12 and 24 h corresponding to 2 and 1 cycle s per day respectively the data presented in table 1 indicated that more than 85 cod reduction was achieved in the reactor with influent cod concentrations varying between 300 and 1300 mg l regardless of the cycle time and srt applied the cod removal rate of 87 observed in this study fell within the range reported in the literature though it was closer to the lower end by increasing omw additions in four consecutive phases with cod increments in the range of 40 100 mg l 10 25 and adding no omw in the last phase the co treatment of omw and synthetic wastewater in the sbr system was investigated to ascertain whether a possible inhibition effect could be noticed as demonstrated in fig 3 a the first run involving 400 mg cod l of peptone mixture pm with an incremental dose of omw diluted to 40 mg cod l 10 revealed a drastic increase in effluent cod and tph contents steady state conditions were assumed to be achieved after approximately two srts i e 15 days since less than 10 variation was observed in the most recent measurements of effluent quality parameters from the fig 3 it was evident that the cod concentration was stabilized at the level of 59 3 mg l corresponding to an elimination rate of 87 the effluent tph value reached a plateau at 0 55 0 06 mg l at the end of the first phase the performance of the second run conducted with pm and an additional omw dose of 80 mg cod l 20 is illustrated in fig 3b as shown in the figure the effluent cod content of the sbr remained constant at 70 2 mg l with a removal efficiency of 85 when the steady state was reached after two weeks of operation at steady state operating conditions the amount of tph became stationary at a concentration of 0 72 0 08 mg l the effluent cod and tph profiles obtained in the third run carried out at an omw dose of 100 mg cod l 25 together with the pm is visualized in fig 4 a following an acclimation period of 15 days a noticeable decrease in the cod concentration was observed during steady state operation of the sbr reaching a stable value of 73 3 mg l whereas the tph content averaged at 1 12 0 20 mg l in the fourth and final run omw feeding was stopped to evaluate whether the performance of the sbr system could restore to a favorable level rapidly after a short adjustment phase of only two weeks as can be seen in fig 4b the effluent concentrations of cod and tph were stabilized at 50 2 mg l and 0 51 0 10 mg l respectively when the feeding pattern was switched to the pm alone comparative evaluation of the experimental results revealed that the co treatment of omw and pm in sbr up to a feeding ratio of 1 4 based on cod mass did not result in a deterioration of the effluent quality the cyclic cod profiles were determined for the initial acclimation period with peptone mixture pm alone and third run pm with an omw increment of 100 mg cod l to evaluate the performance of the sbr system during one cycle of operation at steady state fig 5 a clearly indicated that as expected peptone was almost consumed completely yielding an effluent cod content of only 50 mg l as displayed in fig 5b the cod concentration in the supernatant of the sbr could be reduced to 68 mg l at the end of the reaction time when a 25 increase in the cod level of peptone mixture was created 4 discussion 4 1 model interpretation major processes defining metabolic activities of the microbial culture in activated sludge configurations can now be evaluated by means of multi component biokinetic models 42 this approach equally relies on selection of an appropriate model structure and experimental assessment of model coefficients providing a fingerprint of wastewaters in the study it should be noted that the recognition of dissolved oxygen as a major model component should be regarded as a milestone that paved the way for respirometric measurements 43 44 today model calibration of the oxygen uptake rate our profile generation by an acclimated microbial culture allows complete kinetic description of the substrate wastewater in terms of numerical values of the model coefficients as well as cod fractionation 32 45 this study involved the peptone mixture and the pm omw mixture as the source of organic carbon in sbr operation therefore the selected model structure included different cod fractions associated with the peptone mixture namely readily biodegradable cod ssp dual hydrolysis with readily hydrolysable sh1 and slowly hydrolysable sh2 fractions all totally soluble and with no inert components similarly omw was defined in terms of readily biodegradable cod sso single hydrolysis with hydrolysable cod sho and inert cod sio fractions accordingly the adopted model essentially involved asm1 template 42 modified for endogenous metabolism 46 with active heterotrophic biomass concentration xh and dissolved oxygen concentration so and decay associated generation of residual soluble and particulate metabolic products sp and xp 47 the matrix representation of the selected model is given in table 2 a recent study explored the kinetic aspects concerning the co metabolism of omw with a compatible waste also peptone mixture on the basis on model calibration of our profiles associated with different wastewater components 22 the results displayed in table 3 reveal significant issues as summarized below i model simulation of the in cycle cod profiles implemented with the process kinetics defined in the table provided a perfect match with the experimental observations as shown in fig 5 both for the peptone mixture alone and when mixed with 25 omw this way modeling confirmed the co metabolism of the omw in the mixture to the extent that all its biodegradable cod is utilized and removed in the sbr operation ii the information derived from respirometric analysis indicated the impact of omw addition on the biodegradation kinetics of the mixture a retardation effect on the utilization readily biodegradable substrate as evidenced by a slightly lower maximum growth rate μh value and a higher half saturation constant ksp level for readily biodegradable cod with no significant bearing on substrate utilization at a sludge age level of 8 days selected for sbr operation an increase in the endogenous decay coefficient bh from 0 15 d to 30 d which means higher generation of residual metabolic products i e intracellular waste materials requiring a maintenance energy increase for their transport outside the cells iii the respirometric evaluation also provided novel information on the cod fractionation of the omw in the substrate mixture aside from a soluble inert cod fraction sio of 10 reported by farabegoli et al 19 the total cod of omw included 12 readily biodegradable cod sso and 78 slowly biodegradable cod sho this way the incremental cod of around 18 mg l between the sbr performance when treating pm alone and mixed with 25 omw as shown in fig 5 can be attributed to inert cod fraction sio and the generated soluble residual metabolic products spo confirming total co metabolism of the omw in the mixture iv the kinetic information defined for the peptone mixture in table 3 also confirmed its similarity with domestic wastewater when compared with the process kinetics reported for sewage 7 as the main difference the peptone mixture involves no inert cod fraction and includes a soluble slowly biodegradable cod fraction sh2 which may escape the reactor due to partial removal instead of being entrapped in the biomass 4 2 practical implications this study tested co metabolism of omw up to an upper threshold of 100 mg cod l which created a 25 increase in the cod level of peptone mixture acting as the main wastewater stream this threshold although empirically selected in the study is quite significant because further increase on the one hand will augment the treatment requirement of the omw increment but on the other hand it runs the risk of jeopardizing the performance of the common biological treatment plant under higher organic loadings thus the proposed mixing level should be justified in situ experiments for each case it is obvious that omws require pretreatment mainly to reduce the cod and total phenol contents to levels acceptable for the proposed co metabolism with sewage or other compatible waste streams this study tested fenton oxidation as an effective pretreatment step other pretreatment approaches may also be envisaged as sustainable alternatives in a recent study bargaoui et al 48 proposed alternative pretreatment schemes involving impregnation filtration of omw onto raw cypress sawdust and electrocoagulation in two different sequences which provided a cod removal range of 65 to 76 with efficient energy consumption fenton oxidation was also recommended as the final polishing step the proposed co treatment scheme is quite sustainable for practical applications since exclusive biological treatment is not possible due to seasonal generation of omw with a very high level of organic matter cod content testing the feasibility of joint treatment may be carried out for an arbitrarily selected small adjacent community with a sewage flow of 5000 m3 d and the same cod content of 400 mg l a weak sewage as in this study treated in a local municipal treatment facility a locally generated omw pretreated by fenton oxidation would still contain more than 12 000 mg cod l observed in the sample used in this study therefore the above sewage stream would only accept around 45 m3 d omw mixing which would raise the cod level to 500 mg l without appreciably changing the hydraulic regime of the treatment plant it should be noted that this mixing scheme offers a sustainable solution because it would allow proper disposal and treatment of more than 16 000 m3 year of omw stored in equalization facilities after pretreatment distance would not be a problem for mixing with sewage at the nearest location since it would only involve tanker hauling and or pumping of only 45 m3 d of omw throughout the year this amount could be increased for a stronger sewage stream pending suitable capacity of the common treatment facility it should be noted that the economical aspects while beyond the scope of the study would closely depend on the magnitude of the omw flow to be treated and the selected pretreatment scheme 5 conclusion the results of this study provided conclusive experimental proof on complete biodegradation of olive mill wastewater in a sequencing batch reactor a widely implemented activated sludge configuration when properly dosed into the peptone mixture stream a synthetic substrate exhibiting a similar character with sewage in terms of cod fractionation and process kinetics successful co metabolism was observed for different mixing ratios of omw which were gradually increased to 25 of the cod level in the peptone mixture this mixing threshold should be checked and confirmed for each case in accordance with the characteristics of the available biological treatment facility full biodegradation of the olive mill wastewater was secured by fenton oxidation applied as a pretreatment step after initial holding in lagoons which removed total phenols and other recalcitrant chemicals prior to biological treatment cod fractionation and process kinetics disclosed suggested for olive mill wastewater served as modeling ingredients to justify the in cycle cod profiles observed in sbr operation biological treatment is a prerequisite for olive mill wastewater due to very high level of soluble cod accumulation at the low end of the particle size even after an effective pretreatment step however it is not applicable on site because of seasonal production and wastewater generation and rural nature of the industry the study advocated co metabolism as a novel and sustainable approach of wastewater management of olive mill wastewater when properly diluted in sewage or a compatible wastewater it is strongly believed that the proposed approach embodies all scientific and practical attributes to put an end to the long awaited solution for this industry declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

13389,safe drinking water is the necessity of life the present study reveals use of natural resources such as plant extracts and natural oils for water disinfection differences between oil and water soluble additives were highlighted for plant extracts and insoluble natural oils a hybrid hydrodynamic cavitation process was quite effective in both the cases and high rates of disinfection were achieved studies were reported using oils ginger turmeric lavender tulsi and rhizome derived plant extracts such as ginger turmeric and mango ginger as additives in process intensification 0 1 v v a vortex based cavitation device vortex diode nominal capacity 1 m3 h was used with pressure drop of 1 bar a high disinfection of 96 and 88 was obtained in 15 min for ginger oil and mango ginger extract respectively as compared to 44 using cavitation alone acoustic cavitation gave 94 and 30 disinfection with and without additive mango ginger extract the ftir analyses before and after cavitation with ginger additive showed no by products formation and indicated gingerol as active component in disinfection the per pass disinfection values were also higher up to 5 times than cavitation alone hybrid hydrodynamic cavitation using natural plant derived materials can offer a promising technology alternative in water disinfection graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cavitation disinfection natural oil plant extract water treatment 1 introduction availability of safe drinking water is an important issue in today s context disinfection of water is essential for removing pathogenic microorganisms that are responsible for causing a number of water borne diseases as 88 of diseases in the developing world are largely due to unsafe drinking water about 842 000 people die every year from diarrhea especially children due to unsafe drinking water improper sanitization and hand hygiene 1 water scarcity in various parts of the world also demands preserving drinking water sources by recycle and reuse of water consequently demanding effective treatment methodologies according to various norms total coliform should be absent in drinking water 2 over the years many different physical and chemical treatment methods are being used for disinfection of water and the most common is chlorination the physical techniques for water disinfection are typically heating filtration microwave uv irradiation and plasma which generally have long treatment times limited capacity and high cost the chemical treatment method involves mainly chlorination and is widely used worldwide as the most preferred method for disinfection of water due to its effectiveness ease of operation and low cost however formation of disinfection by products dbp which are highly carcinogenic make chlorination process as not so environment and human friendly and in recent times is considered negatively especially in many developed countries the other possible technological alternatives are mainly adsorption photocatalysis membranes reverse osmosis etc newer types of adsorbents in the form of bionanocomposites especially that using antimicrobial properties of biomaterial and magnetic properties for easy separation can be promising from practical application point of view 3 4 similarly photocatalytic disinfection using catalysts such as tio2 coupled with processes such as uv radiation can effect disinfection in short time 5 many of these are cost intensive especially for higher volumes of operation and have fouling problems it is therefore instructive to further evaluate and develop more techno economically feasible alternative technologies for disinfection of water that would not have the disadvantages of chlorination and at the same time are cost effective hydrodynamic cavitation is reported as an effective technology for disinfection that does not generate any secondary disinfection byproducts hybrid technologies based on hydrodynamic cavitation such as by combining it with natural oils can be highly promising 6 7 the fundamental aspects of cavitation process are relatively well known 8 though its implementation and different applications are not so straightforward the process involves formation growth and collapse of cavities using suitable cavitation devices the collapse of cavities concentrates energy up to 1 1018 kw m3 which apart from playing direct role in disinfection also assist in homolytic cleavage of water with generation of hydroxyl radicals and consequent oxidation damage to microorganisms effecting water disinfection thus disinfection using cavitation typically includes combination of mechanical thermal and chemical effects mechanical effects in the form of shock waves intense shear stress with high pressures 5000 atm thermal effects in the form of extreme temperatures 10 000 k and chemical effects in the form of oxidation due to in situ generation of hydroxyl radicals oh and such oxidizing species the various forms of cavitation process are therefore exploited in different applications such as cleaning water disinfection wastewater treatment specifically for the removal of organic pollutants removal of ammoniacal nitrogen and also recently in desulfurization of fuels for the removal of refractory sulfur compounds 6 7 9 13 from practical and technological view point today acoustic cavitation ac and hydrodynamic cavitation hc appear most promising for disinfection of water the effects of ac or ultrasound on pathogenic bacteria were investigated by many especially as small scale operations gogate and coworkers found that intensity of cavitation decreased with increased distance from horn negligible effect above 2 5 cm from tip 14 in view of high cost unsatisfactory thermal efficiency and limitations in scale up hydrodynamic cavitation is being considered as a more robust technology in this regard hc offers ease of operation and different reactor designs variety of devices with without moving elements it can provide many a times simple design construction easy to scale up and low cost solutions compared to acoustic cavitation reactor in hydrodynamic cavitation reactors hcr using rotational mechanism shear shockwaves and heating are the main causes of disinfection milly et al reported 15 16 a shockwave power reactor converting electrical energy into thermal energy and increased temperature from 20 to 65 6 or 115 c for complete pasteurization and sterilization of various fluids foods such as calcium fortified apple juice tomato juice and skim milk rotor driven by a simple milling cutter showed decreased ability of division of 75 for e coli cells in 3 min 17 other advanced rotational hcr such as rotor and stator type device by jyoti and pandit 18 cerecedo et al 19 sun et al 20 and rotational generator by sarc et al 21 were effective for various bacteria with high levels of disinfection however super cavitation and high thermal effects in these rotational hcr may lead to serious erosion problems and coupled with low durability and higher costs practical applications of these can be limited thus it is imperative that newer forms of process intensifications for disinfection be explored using hydrodynamic cavitation employing cavitating devices without moving elements simple in design having ease of operation mild process operating conditions and at the same time accomplish equal or improved disinfection efficiencies for real life operations in hcr without moving elements cavitation is induced when static pressure falls below saturated vapor pressure either due to geometrical constriction in linear flow or due to vortex flow there are different types of cavitating devices that are reported mainly using linear flow based devices orifice venturi etc and vortex rotational flow based devices vortex diode the pressure energy requirement in linear flow devices is rather high loraine et al reported pump pressure of 345 kpa and 554 passes to achieve 99 999 of disinfection using a venturi reactor of 1 8 l water capacity 22 hybrid cavitation approaches using chemical process intensification are reported to enhance the performance of conventional cavitation devices such as venturi by addition of additional oxidizing agents such as h2o2 for increasing disinfection efficiency 21 23 27 the disinfection efficiencies were not satisfactory in general ranging from 24 to more than 90 for inactivation of e coli satisfactory disinfection of 100 was reported with excessively high operating pressures of the order of 12 mpa in 30 min by using orifice plate with high operational cost 28 recently vortex flow based cavitating device vortex diode has been reported for water and wastewater treatment pollution control 10 11 desulfurization 12 13 jain et al reported inactivation of gram negative and gram positive bacteria e coli and s aureus by vortex diode with substantially higher disinfection than conventional cavitation devices such as orifice and requiring lower operating pressure 9 mane et al developed a hybrid hydrodynamic cavitation process using natural oils having antimicrobial properties and could obtain practically complete disinfection within 10 min for different microorganisms 6 7 the optimized conditions were pressure drop of 1 bar and additive natural oils in 0 1 by volume the approach was shown to be effective from common to antimicrobial resistant amr bacteria and opportunistic difficult pathogen p aeruginosa with costs comparable to chlorination the use of plant extract coupled with cavitation technology for disinfection of water has not been discussed in the literature so far the present study extends the philosophy of hybrid hydrodynamic cavitation technology beyond natural oils to other natural plant derived materials such as plant extracts identify the differences in disinfection when the extract goes in water as a homogeneous mixture compared to heterogeneous oil water system reported earlier and evaluate the disinfection efficiencies for different oils and plant extracts in view of the earlier reports in this regard studies were carried out using comparable process conditions vortex diode δp of 1 bar 0 1 of plant extract the objective is to obtain insight into disinfection process to confirm no formation of disinfection by products or intermediates and finally evaluate possible use of the natural plant materials for not just making water safe for drinking but also for additionally securing possible health benefits a hybrid cavitation process that can be said to be safe water and

tenuiflorum tulsi oil curcuma longa turmeric oil and azadirachta indica neem oil these were procured locally from pune maharashtra india the detailed characteristics of different natural oils and extracts are given in table 1 3 experimental the experimental set up of hydrodynamic cavitation and experimental procedure was explained in detail in our earlier work 6 7 and hence only essential details are included here to avoid repetition the experimental set up comprises a holding tank having 50 l capacity a multistage vertical centrifugal pump model cnp make cdlf2 26 ss316 1 2 m3 h at 228 mwc rating 3 kw 4 hp 2900 rpm discharge pressure 0 15 bar vortex diode as a cavitation device and measurements and controls for flow pressure and temperature a 20 l volume of contaminated water with 104 cfu ml of initial concentration of bacteria was used for disinfection study bio additives oil plant extract were used with optimized concentration of 0 1 in the hybrid process the samples were withdrawn from holding tank at periodic intervals of time and were analyzed by plate count method for analysis 100 μl of bacterial sample was spread over sterile n agar petri dish after incubation for

source analysis the samples before and after cavitation were analyzed for detailed morphological changes of bacterial cells to prove process efficacy the functional groups of the natural oils and plant extracts prior to cavitation and after cavitation were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy perkin elmer s spectrum one ftir spectrometer 4 results and discussion 4 1 cavitation using miscible plant extracts plant extracts derived from different parts of natural plants can provide useful alternative to the use of natural oils and can offer similar benefits along with good disinfection efficiency in the hybrid cavitation process described earlier for natural oils a proof of concept is established here in this regard for the first time using different plants extracts from rhizomes such as turmeric extract ginger extract and mango ginger extract for ease of comparison with similar natural oils use of similar concentration 0 1 was made to evaluate disinfection efficiencies in selection of the natural plant resources medicinal properties of rhizomes of ginger turmeric and mango ginger are well thought out apart from their wide use in day to day life in order to establish the proof of concept experiments were initially carried out using acoustic cavitation fig 1 shows the results of acoustic cavitation using mango ginger extract it was observed that even simple process of acoustic cavitation can yield more than 90 disinfection in 15 min having established the disinfection efficacy of plant extract using acoustic cavitation further experiments were carried out using hydrodynamic cavitation due to its commercial potential in terms of ease of operation and energy effectiveness the results are presented in fig 2 it can be seen that the disinfection efficiency for the mango ginger plant extract is high of the order of 90 in 15 min for the other two extracts namely turmeric and ginger extract the extent of disinfection was lower than that using cavitation alone similar to that observed with many natural oils it is possible that the extraction efficiency for turmeric and ginger could be lower reflecting lowered content of the active ingredients as compared to mango ginger the roots of ginger turmeric and mango ginger contain essential oils and other active ingredients such as curcuminoids hanif et al 40 reported the essential oil yield of different plant extract by co2 supercritical fluid extraction and their antimicrobial properties indicating oil yield for rhizomes of curcuma amada as 6 38 roots of ginger as 5 59 and for curcuma longa as 3 56 it reveals higher antimicrobial activity for mango ginger than ginger and turmeric extract the aqueous plant extract with cavitation gives higher disinfection for mango ginger up to 95 disinfection in 60 min this can be attributed to presence of higher curcuminoids and higher of oil in mango ginger than for ginger extract and for turmeric extract the curcuminoids are lipophilic in nature and can reacts with phospholipids of the cell membrane and easily destroy the permeability of microorganisms policegoudra et al reported previously ignored component difurocumenonol as active ingredient responsible for antimicrobial activity and nonpolar extracts of mango ginger by chloroform demonstrated higher inhibition zone for different gram negative bacteria such as m luteus s aureus b cereus b subtilis l monocytogenes as compared to extraction obtained using hexane ethyl acetate acetone and methanol where negligible disinfection was obtained for e coli 41 the higher disinfection efficiency with mango ginger extract may also be attributed to the presence of oil content in the extract and lipophilic curcuminoids and difurocumenonol the results with the plant extracts of this study in cavitation clearly demonstrate their potential application in water disinfection 4 2 synergistic effect when working with hybrid methodology of cavitation it would be prudent to evaluate synergistic effect of plant extract in hybrid cavitation method extraction of active ingredients from mango ginger rhizomes without addition of any solvent gave good disinfection efficiency of 80 without cavitation the experiments using hybrid cavitation methodology with mango ginger extract exhibited higher rates of disinfection than cavitation and mango ginger individual effect fig 2 proof of concept is established by carrying out experiments using acoustic cavitation with same small quantity of mango ginger extract 0 1 it was observed that acoustic cavitation with mango ginger exhibited 95 disinfection which is higher than acoustic cavitation alone of 30 the synergistic effect for plant extract is evaluated using the following eq 1 1 f k hc oil extract k hc k oil extract where k is for rate constant in s 1 hc and hc oil extract indicated for hydrodynamic cavitation and hydrodynamic cavitation along with natural essential oil extract the value of f for mango ginger extract are 1 85 and 1 22 clearly indicating synergistic effect in hybrid process due to hydrodynamic cavitation along with mango ginger extract and acoustic cavitation along with mango ginger extract respectively similarly for other extract such as ginger extract synergistic index is found less than 1 and therefore no synergistic effect found 4 3 cavitation using immiscible oils the use of immiscible natural oils as bio additives in cavitation represents a complex heterogeneous system where oil phase is in addition to the conventional aqueous phase subsequently getting transformed into two phase gas e g water vapor air liquid water system during cavitation the cavitation processes are known to generate emulsion and the type of cavitation nature of cavitation device and such parameters dictate the extent of emulsion or micro mixing in general volatile organic compounds are the main components of essential oil that are expected to contribute in the process of disinfection and enhance the rates of disinfection as well the present work describes the effect of various immiscible oils namely ginger oil tulsi oil turmeric oil lavender oil and neem oil not reported so far in this regard fig 3 shows the disinfection efficiency using these natural oils in the hybrid cavitation process using vortex diode as a cavitating device and using the same process parameters as discussed in previous section for plant extracts it is seen that ginger oil and lavendor oil show significant increased efficiency of disinfection while the remaining oils perform negatively with decreased efficiency ginger is typically considered as a safe natural product to treat respiratory and gastrointestinal disease for many decades it belongs to zingiberaceae family perennial herb and because of its characteristic spicy aroma and taste it is traditionally used as a spice in foods and beverages in addition it is an excellent source of many bioactive phenols such as gingerols shogaols and zingerones it is reported that the antimicrobial activity of ginger essential oil geo has higher inhibition zone for various bacteria staphylococcus aureus and listeria monocytogenes followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa while some bacteria such as salmonella typhimurium shigella flexneri and escherichia coli were reported to be resistant to ginger essential oil 42 also s aureus has higher sensitivity for geo than e coli as these bacteria commonly used for disinfection study 43 minimum inhibitory concentration of geo for s aureus b subtilis e coli and penicillium spp exhibited the value of 8 69 86 92 173 84 and 869 2 mg ml respectively 44 e coli required much higher inhibitory concentration of geo compared with other microorganisms in the light of the reported literature it is evident from the present work that a small quantity of ginger oil along hydrodynamic cavitation exhibited excellent disinfection efficiency for e coli fig 3 a more scrutiny to elucidate the disinfection effects reveals the role of bio active components of ginger oil which include hydrophobic gingerol and hydrophilic polysaccharides the lipophilic gingerols have many pharmacological activities such as anti oxidant anti inflammatory antimicrobial anticancer anti emetic anti metabolic syndrome and neuroprotection 45 owing to lipophilic nature they are easily penetrable through cell membranes of microorganisms which may affect both the inner cellular components of cytoplasm and the external cell envelope consequently these contribute to enhanced bacterial cell membrane permeability subsequently leading to loss of ions and leakage of cellular components in some cases presence of active ingredient of natural oils such as thymol menthol and linalyl acetate leads to higher antimicrobial activity 46 the results of this work are also consistent with the reports of kumari et al 47 on antioxidant activity of essential oil and aqueous extract of ginger where essential oil was shown to exhibit higher antioxidant property due to the presence of high phenolic content or major contents of monoterpenoids than the aqueous extract of ginger contains lower content of sesquiterpenoids also similar to the findings of baris et al 48 hydrodynamic cavitation with ginger extract showed lower disinfection due to the presence of polar phenolics components with low activity it does not easily penetrate through cell membrane of microorganisms and may require higher dosage to obtain similar disinfection efficiency as that for cavitation with ginger oil a high disinfection of 98 in 60 min with oil 0 1 can be obtained using hybrid cavitation methodology it is possible that higher viscosity and surface tension of oils have adverse impact on cavitation the hybrid process using neem oil and tulsi oil showed lower rates of disinfection probably due to higher viscosity of these oils the neem oil has viscosity of 37 cp 49 tulsi oil has viscosity 26 75 cp and surface tension 84 29 n m 34 the ginger oil has low viscosity of 5 cp and surface tension of 30 9 dyn cm higher values of viscosity and surface tension adversely affect the growth stage of bubbles and increased the time of collapse 50 there could be reduced collapse of bubbles delay in collapse of bubble or implosions of low intensity producing less energy all contributing to reduced disinfection efficiency in the hybrid process the antimicrobial activity of ginger oil is mainly due to the high percentage of eugenol 50 94 as an active ingredient 36 considering easy availability of these medicinal plants and inherent health benefits associated with different plants applying this traditional knowledge mainly from ayurveda and advance oxidation technologies such as hydrodynamic cavitation can offer practical alternative to disinfection of water with possible health benefits of plant extracts followings revealing observations can be made from figs 2 and 3 corresponding to hybrid cavitation technology operation of 15 min 1 the rate of disinfection with ginger oil are higher an order of magnitude 2 times than cavitation alone and 3 times than cavitation with ginger extract 2 ginger oil showed higher degree of disinfection than ginger extract for the reasons explained above 3 the lavender oil exhibited higher rate of disinfection of the order of 1 5 times higher than cavitation alone 4 the turmeric oil and turmeric extract both showed nearly similar and lower extent of disinfection performance than cavitation alone 5 the neem oil and tulsi oil showed lower efficiency similar to turmeric oil 6 the rate of disinfection for mango ginger extract for both hybrid hydrodynamic cavitation and acoustic cavitation were significantly higher than cavitation alone for hydrodynamic cavitation the rates were 2 times higher and for acoustic cavitation 3 times higher rate of disinfection could be obtained the synergistic coefficient for ginger oil is greater than 1 again confirming superiority of combined effects of natural oil along with cavitation the results also indicate natural oils are more effective compared to plant extract in disinfection of water 4 4 kinetics of disinfection per pass disinfection model of hydrodynamic cavitation the kinetics of disinfection based on per pass disinfection factor is useful in understanding the disinfection behaviour 6 7 the rate equations in this regard are elaborated below for the conventional model the effective disinfection rate constant k s 1 is defined as 2 k ln c 0 c t where c 0 and c are bacteria concentrations initial and at any time t respectively cfu ml for per pass disinfection model of hydrodynamic cavitation the effective rate constant is defined as below k s 1 and is related to residence time τ 3 k φ n t φ τ where φ is per pass disinfection factor and n is number of passes per pass disinfection model is more realistic and requires parameters like flow rate q volume treated v operating pressure drop across cavitating device p and concentration time data the per pass disinfection factor φ represents the significance of cavitating device 4 φ ln c c 0 n also number of passes n is an important parameter used in cost calculations lower the value of n lower is the cost of disinfection process the number of passes can be obtained as 5 n q t v using the model effective rate constant and per pass disinfection factor can be calculated and these values are listed in table 2 the per pass disinfection factor φ for ginger oil in cavitation process is 5 times higher than cavitation alone and also 10 times higher than ginger extract as shown in fig 4 the values of φ are 0 36 0 07 and 0 036 for cavitation with oil cavitation alone and cavitation with extract for vortex diode as a cavitating device the per pass disinfection factor φ for cavitation with mango ginger extract is 3 5 times higher than cavitation alone by using vortex diode as cavitation device the value of φ for hc mango ginger extract is 0 243 the results for acoustic cavitation cavitation with mango ginger extract also show consistent results the variations in the values of φ because of the type of extract oil active components of extract oil are clearly evident it can be seen that per pass disinfection factors φ for e coli are higher for ginger oil and mango ginger mg extract with cavitation than other oils and extract it is also evident that in 15 min increase in per pass disinfection for cavitation with ginger oil is of the order of 500 and for mango ginger extract it is 300 more as compared to cavitation alone however since 100 disinfection is desired selection of oil and process integration is crucial it is also to be noted that 0 1 extract represents substantially low dose as compared to corresponding oil dose of 0 1 and therefore for higher disinfection efficiency more than 0 1 of extract is desirable the results clearly highlight utility of natural oil and plant extracts in enhancing the rates of disinfection a comprehensive comparison of performance of different hydrodynamic cavitation reactors is presented in table 3 many reactors such as high pressure homogenizer high speed homogenizer mixer blender and hydrodynamic cavitation with orifice plate utilized for cell disruption 51 54 majority studies exhibited lower disinfection efficiency and required more time for disinfection though the performance of can be enhanced by process intensification such as ozone o3 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 or ultrasonic probe us or use of chlorine oxides for example orifice alone gave only 40 disinfection and maximum of 75 using process intensification chlorination of some form as part of process intensification assists in reaching high levels of disinfection however disinfection by products formation in such scenario is not well reported the problems with rotor type devices are already well highlighted in earlier text the present approach showed a higher efficacy of hybrid cavitation with possible health benefits without forming any disinfection by products time saving with less energy requirement 4 5 mechanistic understanding of the process 4 5 1 philosophy behind selecting plant extract as an additive for hybrid cavitation curcuma amada which is also known as a mango ginger or ambe haldi or aam haldi is traditionally used for medicinal purposes as a herbal medicine in ayurveda unani medicine from centuries and in several food preparations it is well reported that rhizome is rich source of essential oils and containing more than 130 active ingredients with biomedical importance it has antibacterial insecticidal antifungal and antioxidant properties 38 the major chemical components with their biological activity include starch phenolic acids volatile oils curcuminoids and terpenoids like difurocumenonol amadannulen and amadaldehyde that are important from pharmacological point of view ramachandran et al 59 reported mango ginger s anticancer potential and its action for glioblastoma cells was reported where curcuma amada extract induces apoptosis in glioblastoma cells difurocumenonol one of active component from mango ginger is important for antimicrobial activity against gram positive and gram negative bacteria 41 de et al 60 reported presence of non polar terpenes in indian curcuma species e g c amada c aromatica c caesia c longa and c zedoaria also the lipophilic curcuminoid helps in killing microorganisms by inhibiting its cellular functioning c amada has a strong anti microbial and other biological activity the other active components may also enhance the disinfection or bactericidal activity by different mechanisms such as inhibition of cell wall synthesis interference with the permeability of cell membrane cause membrane disruption modifying cellular constituents and cell damage or cell mutation chandarana et al 61 showed the antimicrobial activity of aqueous extract of c amada against e coli b subtilis s aureus many such plant extracts can prove to be useful from health benefits point of view if appropriately used in the water treatment process and therefore the present study could provide starting point for elucidating use of plant extracts in hybrid cavitation process for water disinfection 4 5 2 functionality changes the ftir spectra of disinfection of water before and after cavitation with natural additives are presented in fig 5 a b and c the different functional groups of natural additives with vibrational frequencies are clearly evident the ftir spectra of the oil phase of ginger oil before and after hybrid cavitation indicates similarity in wavenumber but difference in intensity of transmittance the ftir spectra for the aqueous phase indicated no change in the functional groups before and after hybrid cavitation the ir band for oh vibration of alcohol and carboxylic acid group represented in the range of 2500 3300 cm 1 1700 1750 cm 1 interval is for ketone group the characteristic peak at 1430 1510 cm 1 wavenumber for cc vibration ascribed to benzene group 1375 cm 1 for co group 987 cm 1 wavenumber indicated for chh group and 883 cm 1 for para benzene functional group all these functional groups are representing α gingerol active component of ginger oil the results of ftir analysis before and after cavitation showed no indicative change suggesting no formation of byproducts or intermediates 4 5 3 structural changes a morphological analysis of bacteria before and after treatment was studied by tem fig 6a b and fe sem fig 6c and d tem results indicate intact healthy e coli cells with rod shape homogenous smooth surface and visible cytoplasmic contents that get damaged after 15 min of hybrid cavitation treatment significant change in shape size and morphology was observed and damage in the form of cell membrane rupture and leakage of cytoplasmic content due to hybrid cavitation is clearly visible 4 6 possible mechanism of disinfection from the literature studies it can be deduced that the conventional cavitating devices such as orifice and venturi can impart severe surface damage to the microorganisms but considerably limited cell breakage cleavage thereby limiting the overall efficiency the rotational devices largely effect cell cleavage rough surface though size reduction and leakage of cytoplasm is not significant 24 in the present work hybrid cavitation led to loss of cytoplasm reduction in size or totally deformed structure size reduced from 1 to 2 μm to 100 200 nm as seen from fig 6 b and d the combined effect of antimicrobial property of natural additives and hydrodynamic cavitation is evident in the form of increased efficiency fig 7 depicts this plausible mechanism of hybrid cavitation by highlighting contribution of different factors the results are also consistent with those reported earlier with hybrid method 6 7 thus the extreme conditions of temperature pressure at the point of cavity implosion high shear oxidation or oxidative damage action of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals of sulfhydryl group and double bonds of protein components etc fragment the cellular content and cell membrane damage dna and protein and resulting into cell death the active components of plant extract and essential oil both have lipophilic properties and permeate the cell wall as well as the cytoplasmic membrane inducing a loss of membrane integrity in microorganisms 45 the active component such as gingerol from ginger oil and curcuminoids and difurocumenonol from mango ginger extract can react with phospholipids of outer cell membrane thus altering the cell permeability and denature its protein thereby causes cell death 4 7 energy and cost considerations the energy requirement is evaluated for different reactor configurations and is compared in fig 8 filho et al 28 reported 99 97 of disinfection in 30 min with orifice as a cavitation device and copper coil in cooling system at a pressure of 10 mpa requiring 12 28 kwh energy its disinfection performance is higher than that reported earlier by chand et al 26 arrojo et al 25 and jancula et al 62 chand et al 26 reported disinfection efficiency of 75 using liquid whistle reactor with ozone and required energy of 15 3kwh pressure of 500 psi and 3 h of time of operation arrojo et al 25 reported disinfection of 91 1 for venturi and 32 7 for orifice in 2 h under 18 kwh energy and jancula et al 62 reported 99 of disinfection with venturi with 350 kpa discharge pressure 18 min of time with 18 kwh energy in recent reports on rotor stator type of devices reported by sun et al 63 64 obtained higher or similar disinfection efficiency of 100 of disinfection in 4 14 min of operation with rotational speed of 4200 rpm 1 4 m3 h flow rate and required low energy 0 748 3 48 kwh compared with other rotational based hydrodynamic cavitation reactor reported by 19 65 and conventional laminar flow based cavitation reactor sarc et al 21 and cerecedo et al 19 reported 99 95 9025 rpm 150 min required energy 0 7 kwh and 100 2400 rpm 7 8 min required energy 0 65 kwh respectively the drawback of the use of rotor and stator type of device is that with increase in the flow rate above 1 4 m3 h and high rotational speed of 4200 rpm the disinfection performance decreases flow rate of 2 6 m3 h showed no disinfection further very high temperatures above 90 c essentially indicate disinfection by way of boiling on the other hand jain et al 9 utilizing rotational flow based reactor vortex diode reported more than 98 of disinfection with only 2 bar of pressure drop within 60 min of time of operation corresponding to only 0 0872 kwh energy requirement mane et al 7 developed hybrid cavitation using natural oils that resulted in drastic reduction in time for disinfection with high disinfection efficiency and more than 99 of disinfection using 1 bar pressure drop for a very low 0 0025 0 005 kwh of energy requirement was obtained in the present study the disinfection efficiency for cavitation with ginger oil is 98 in 60 min of time with 0 03 kwh and first time reported the energy required for cavitation with mango ginger is 0 03 kwh with 95 60 min disinfection however since 100 disinfection is desired more investigations on plant extracts are essential the hybrid cavitation methodology using vortex diode appears to provide substantial advantages and low cost in addition the vortex based cavitation reactors are commercially available and have easy scale up 66 therefore in view of the techno economic feasibility no harmful by products and possible health benefits of plant extracts the hybrid cavitation process can provide alternative solution to conventional disinfection methods the cavitation yield per volume treated cfu ml j can be obtained as cavitation yield volume treated c 0 c p q t the cavitation yield per volume treated for hydrodynamic cavitation along with ginger oil and hydrodynamic cavitation along with mango ginger extract at time 15 min is 7 2 and 3 42 cfu ml j further the cost of treatment can be obtained using the following equation cost of treatment m 3 of water n p p e 36 η where n is number of passes can be obtained as n q t v for vortex diode the flow rate q measured at δp 1 bar is 720 lph and volume treated is 20 l at 15 min of time of operation t the number of passes n obtained is 9 assuming the cost of electricity pe as 10 rs kwh and pump efficiency η as 0 66 the cost of treatment per m3 of water is 3 8 rs m3 0 052 m3 in view of disinfection efficiency less than 100 using plant extract 0 1 it is required that either the process can be evaluated at higher dose of plant extract or be combined with natural oils so that 100 disinfection can be realized it may be noted that the cost of disinfection would get slightly modified increased in such eventuality since this work only provides the proof of concept for the use of plant extracts with limited examples many other plant extracts extraction methods different plant parts need to be investigated where possibly high disinfection can be obtained 5 conclusions the present study for the first time reports useful application of plant extracts in the hybrid cavitation process for disinfection of water and for providing possible health benefits followings are the main findings of the proposed green hybrid cavitation technology 1 the process effectively eliminates gram negative e coli at significantly higher rates 2 ginger oil was found to be effective natural oil and in case of plant extract mango ginger extract was found to be most effective than other plant extracts 3 a very small concentration of 0 1 of natural additive both ginger oil and mango ginger extract can effect disinfection though increased amount of plant extract may be required for obtaining high disinfection efficiency 4 the rate constant values can be improved to the extent of 3 times for hydrodynamic cavitation with mango ginger extract 5 times for hydrodynamic cavitation with ginger oil and 8 times for acoustic cavitation with mango ginger extract 5 the lipophilic nature of antimicrobial active ingredient of natural additive is responsible for increased cell permeability and cell denaturation 6 a plausible mechanism suggests synergistic effect of both natural additive and hydrodynamic cavitation and the rupture of cell wall cell death can be due to various factors such as oxidation effect high shear localized heat thermal effect and antimicrobial property of active constituents 7 the energy requirement is significantly low indicating techno economic feasibility the hybrid cavitation technology with plant extract or natural oils can be useful alternative to existing conventional processes for disinfection of water and more investigations into application of different plant extracts are required nomenclature c concentration cfu ml c 0 initial

13389,safe drinking water is the necessity of life the present study reveals use of natural resources such as plant extracts and natural oils for water disinfection differences between oil and water soluble additives were highlighted for plant extracts and insoluble natural oils a hybrid hydrodynamic cavitation process was quite effective in both the cases and high rates of disinfection were achieved studies were reported using oils ginger turmeric lavender tulsi and rhizome derived plant extracts such as ginger turmeric and mango ginger as additives in process intensification 0 1 v v a vortex based cavitation device vortex diode nominal capacity 1 m3 h was used with pressure drop of 1 bar a high disinfection of 96 and 88 was obtained in 15 min for ginger oil and mango ginger extract respectively as compared to 44 using cavitation alone acoustic cavitation gave 94 and 30 disinfection with and without additive mango ginger extract the ftir analyses before and after cavitation with ginger additive showed no by products formation and indicated gingerol as active component in disinfection the per pass disinfection values were also higher up to 5 times than cavitation alone hybrid hydrodynamic cavitation using natural plant derived materials can offer a promising technology alternative in water disinfection graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cavitation disinfection natural oil plant extract water treatment 1 introduction availability of safe drinking water is an important issue in today s context disinfection of water is essential for removing pathogenic microorganisms that are responsible for causing a number of water borne diseases as 88 of diseases in the developing world are largely due to unsafe drinking water about 842 000 people die every year from diarrhea especially children due to unsafe drinking water improper sanitization and hand hygiene 1 water scarcity in various parts of the world also demands preserving drinking water sources by recycle and reuse of water consequently demanding effective treatment methodologies according to various norms total coliform should be absent in drinking water 2 over the years many different physical and chemical treatment methods are being used for disinfection of water and the most common is chlorination the physical techniques for water disinfection are typically heating filtration microwave uv irradiation and plasma which generally have long treatment times limited capacity and high cost the chemical treatment method involves mainly chlorination and is widely used worldwide as the most preferred method for disinfection of water due to its effectiveness ease of operation and low cost however formation of disinfection by products dbp which are highly carcinogenic make chlorination process as not so environment and human friendly and in recent times is considered negatively especially in many developed countries the other possible technological alternatives are mainly adsorption photocatalysis membranes reverse osmosis etc newer types of adsorbents in the form of bionanocomposites especially that using antimicrobial properties of biomaterial and magnetic properties for easy separation can be promising from practical application point of view 3 4 similarly photocatalytic disinfection using catalysts such as tio2 coupled with processes such as uv radiation can effect disinfection in short time 5 many of these are cost intensive especially for higher volumes of operation and have fouling problems it is therefore instructive to further evaluate and develop more techno economically feasible alternative technologies for disinfection of water that would not have the disadvantages of chlorination and at the same time are cost effective hydrodynamic cavitation is reported as an effective technology for disinfection that does not generate any secondary disinfection byproducts hybrid technologies based on hydrodynamic cavitation such as by combining it with natural oils can be highly promising 6 7 the fundamental aspects of cavitation process are relatively well known 8 though its implementation and different applications are not so straightforward the process involves formation growth and collapse of cavities using suitable cavitation devices the collapse of cavities concentrates energy up to 1 1018 kw m3 which apart from playing direct role in disinfection also assist in homolytic cleavage of water with generation of hydroxyl radicals and consequent oxidation damage to microorganisms effecting water disinfection thus disinfection using cavitation typically includes combination of mechanical thermal and chemical effects mechanical effects in the form of shock waves intense shear stress with high pressures 5000 atm thermal effects in the form of extreme temperatures 10 000 k and chemical effects in the form of oxidation due to in situ generation of hydroxyl radicals oh and such oxidizing species the various forms of cavitation process are therefore exploited in different applications such as cleaning water disinfection wastewater treatment specifically for the removal of organic pollutants removal of ammoniacal nitrogen and also recently in desulfurization of fuels for the removal of refractory sulfur compounds 6 7 9 13 from practical and technological view point today acoustic cavitation ac and hydrodynamic cavitation hc appear most promising for disinfection of water the effects of ac or ultrasound on pathogenic bacteria were investigated by many especially as small scale operations gogate and coworkers found that intensity of cavitation decreased with increased distance from horn negligible effect above 2 5 cm from tip 14 in view of high cost unsatisfactory thermal efficiency and limitations in scale up hydrodynamic cavitation is being considered as a more robust technology in this regard hc offers ease of operation and different reactor designs variety of devices with without moving elements it can provide many a times simple design construction easy to scale up and low cost solutions compared to acoustic cavitation reactor in hydrodynamic cavitation reactors hcr using rotational mechanism shear shockwaves and heating are the main causes of disinfection milly et al reported 15 16 a shockwave power reactor converting electrical energy into thermal energy and increased temperature from 20 to 65 6 or 115 c for complete pasteurization and sterilization of various fluids foods such as calcium fortified apple juice tomato juice and skim milk rotor driven by a simple milling cutter showed decreased ability of division of 75 for e coli cells in 3 min 17 other advanced rotational hcr such as rotor and stator type device by jyoti and pandit 18 cerecedo et al 19 sun et al 20 and rotational generator by sarc et al 21 were effective for various bacteria with high levels of disinfection however super cavitation and high thermal effects in these rotational hcr may lead to serious erosion problems and coupled with low durability and higher costs practical applications of these can be limited thus it is imperative that newer forms of process intensifications for disinfection be explored using hydrodynamic cavitation employing cavitating devices without moving elements simple in design having ease of operation mild process operating conditions and at the same time accomplish equal or improved disinfection efficiencies for real life operations in hcr without moving elements cavitation is induced when static pressure falls below saturated vapor pressure either due to geometrical constriction in linear flow or due to vortex flow there are different types of cavitating devices that are reported mainly using linear flow based devices orifice venturi etc and vortex rotational flow based devices vortex diode the pressure energy requirement in linear flow devices is rather high loraine et al reported pump pressure of 345 kpa and 554 passes to achieve 99 999 of disinfection using a venturi reactor of 1 8 l water capacity 22 hybrid cavitation approaches using chemical process intensification are reported to enhance the performance of conventional cavitation devices such as venturi by addition of additional oxidizing agents such as h2o2 for increasing disinfection efficiency 21 23 27 the disinfection efficiencies were not satisfactory in general ranging from 24 to more than 90 for inactivation of e coli satisfactory disinfection of 100 was reported with excessively high operating pressures of the order of 12 mpa in 30 min by using orifice plate with high operational cost 28 recently vortex flow based cavitating device vortex diode has been reported for water and wastewater treatment pollution control 10 11 desulfurization 12 13 jain et al reported inactivation of gram negative and gram positive bacteria e coli and s aureus by vortex diode with substantially higher disinfection than conventional cavitation devices such as orifice and requiring lower operating pressure 9 mane et al developed a hybrid hydrodynamic cavitation process using natural oils having antimicrobial properties and could obtain practically complete disinfection within 10 min for different microorganisms 6 7 the optimized conditions were pressure drop of 1 bar and additive natural oils in 0 1 by volume the approach was shown to be effective from common to antimicrobial resistant amr bacteria and opportunistic difficult pathogen p aeruginosa with costs comparable to chlorination the use of plant extract coupled with cavitation technology for disinfection of water has not been discussed in the literature so far the present study extends the philosophy of hybrid hydrodynamic cavitation technology beyond natural oils to other natural plant derived materials such as plant extracts identify the differences in disinfection when the extract goes in water as a homogeneous mixture compared to heterogeneous oil water system reported earlier and evaluate the disinfection efficiencies for different oils and plant extracts in view of the earlier reports in this regard studies were carried out using comparable process conditions vortex diode

cavitation using miscible plant extracts plant extracts derived from different parts of natural plants can provide useful alternative to the use of natural oils and can offer similar benefits along with good disinfection efficiency in the hybrid cavitation process described earlier for natural oils a proof of concept is established here in this regard for the first time using different plants extracts from rhizomes such as turmeric extract ginger extract and mango ginger extract for ease of comparison with similar natural oils use of similar concentration 0 1 was made to evaluate disinfection efficiencies in selection of the natural plant resources medicinal properties of rhizomes of ginger turmeric and mango ginger are well thought out apart from their wide use in day to day life in order to establish the proof of concept experiments were initially carried out using acoustic cavitation fig 1 shows the results of acoustic cavitation using mango ginger extract it was observed that even simple process of acoustic cavitation can yield more than 90 disinfection in 15 min having established the disinfection efficacy of plant extract using acoustic cavitation further experiments were carried out using hydrodynamic cavitation due to its commercial potential in terms of ease of operation and energy effectiveness the results are presented in fig 2 it can be seen that the disinfection efficiency for the mango ginger plant extract is high of the order of 90 in 15 min for the other two extracts namely turmeric and ginger extract the extent of disinfection was lower than that using cavitation alone similar to that observed with many natural oils it is possible that the extraction efficiency for turmeric and ginger could be lower reflecting lowered content of the active ingredients as compared to mango ginger the roots of ginger turmeric and mango ginger contain essential oils and other active ingredients such as curcuminoids hanif et al 40 reported the essential oil yield of different plant extract by co2 supercritical fluid extraction and their antimicrobial properties indicating oil yield for rhizomes of curcuma amada as 6 38 roots of ginger as 5 59 and for curcuma longa as 3 56 it reveals higher antimicrobial activity for mango ginger than ginger and turmeric extract the aqueous plant extract with cavitation gives higher disinfection for mango ginger up to 95 disinfection in 60 min this can be attributed to presence of higher curcuminoids and higher of oil in mango ginger than for ginger extract and for turmeric extract the curcuminoids are lipophilic in nature and can reacts with phospholipids of the cell membrane and easily destroy the permeability of microorganisms policegoudra et al reported previously ignored component difurocumenonol as active ingredient responsible for antimicrobial activity and nonpolar extracts of mango ginger by chloroform demonstrated higher inhibition zone for different gram negative bacteria such as m luteus s aureus b cereus b subtilis l monocytogenes as compared to extraction obtained using hexane ethyl acetate acetone and methanol where negligible disinfection was obtained for e coli 41 the higher disinfection efficiency with mango ginger extract may also be attributed to the presence of oil content in the extract and lipophilic curcuminoids and difurocumenonol the results with the plant extracts of this study in cavitation clearly demonstrate their potential application in water disinfection 4 2 synergistic effect when working with hybrid methodology of cavitation it would be prudent to evaluate synergistic effect of plant extract in hybrid cavitation method extraction of active ingredients from mango ginger rhizomes without addition of any solvent gave good disinfection efficiency of 80 without cavitation the experiments using hybrid cavitation methodology with mango ginger extract exhibited higher rates of disinfection than cavitation and mango ginger individual effect fig 2 proof of concept is established by carrying out experiments using acoustic cavitation with same small quantity of mango ginger extract 0 1 it was observed that acoustic cavitation with mango ginger exhibited 95 disinfection which is higher than acoustic cavitation alone of 30 the synergistic effect for plant extract is evaluated using the following eq 1 1 f k hc oil extract k hc k oil extract where k is for rate constant in s 1 hc and hc oil extract indicated for hydrodynamic cavitation and hydrodynamic cavitation along with natural essential oil extract the value of f for mango ginger extract are 1 85 and 1 22 clearly indicating synergistic effect in hybrid process due to hydrodynamic cavitation along with mango ginger extract and acoustic cavitation along with mango ginger extract respectively similarly for other extract such as ginger extract synergistic index is found less than 1 and therefore no synergistic effect found 4 3 cavitation using immiscible oils the use of immiscible natural oils as bio additives in cavitation represents a complex heterogeneous system where oil phase is in addition to the conventional aqueous phase subsequently getting transformed into two phase gas e g water vapor air liquid water system during cavitation the cavitation processes are known to generate emulsion and the type of cavitation nature of cavitation device and such parameters dictate the extent of emulsion or micro mixing in general volatile organic compounds are the main components of essential oil that are expected to contribute in the process of disinfection and enhance the rates of disinfection as well the present work describes the effect of various immiscible oils namely ginger oil tulsi oil turmeric oil lavender oil and neem oil not reported so far in this regard fig 3 shows the disinfection efficiency using these natural oils in the hybrid cavitation process using vortex diode as a cavitating device and using the same process parameters as discussed in previous section for plant extracts it is seen that ginger oil and lavendor oil show significant increased efficiency of disinfection while the remaining oils perform negatively with decreased efficiency ginger is typically considered as a safe natural product to treat respiratory and gastrointestinal disease for many decades it belongs to zingiberaceae family perennial herb and because of its characteristic spicy aroma and taste it is traditionally used as a spice in foods and beverages in addition it is an excellent source of many bioactive phenols such as gingerols shogaols and zingerones it is reported that the antimicrobial activity of ginger essential oil geo has higher inhibition zone for various bacteria staphylococcus aureus and listeria monocytogenes followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa while some bacteria such as salmonella typhimurium shigella flexneri and escherichia coli were reported to be resistant to ginger essential oil 42 also s aureus has higher sensitivity for geo than e coli as these bacteria commonly used for disinfection study 43 minimum inhibitory concentration of geo for s aureus b subtilis e coli and penicillium spp exhibited the value of 8 69 86 92 173 84 and 869 2 mg ml respectively 44 e coli required much higher inhibitory concentration of geo compared with other microorganisms in the light of the reported literature it is evident from the present work that a small quantity of ginger oil along hydrodynamic cavitation exhibited excellent disinfection efficiency for e coli fig 3 a more scrutiny to elucidate the disinfection effects reveals the role of bio active components of ginger oil which include hydrophobic gingerol and hydrophilic polysaccharides the lipophilic gingerols have many pharmacological activities such as anti oxidant anti inflammatory antimicrobial anticancer anti emetic anti metabolic syndrome and neuroprotection 45 owing to lipophilic nature they are easily penetrable through cell membranes of microorganisms which may affect both the inner cellular components of cytoplasm and the external cell envelope consequently these contribute to enhanced bacterial cell membrane permeability subsequently leading to loss of ions and leakage of cellular components in some cases presence of active ingredient of natural oils such as thymol menthol and linalyl acetate leads to higher antimicrobial activity 46 the results of this work are also consistent with the reports of kumari et al 47 on antioxidant activity of essential oil and aqueous extract of ginger where essential oil was shown to exhibit higher antioxidant property due to the presence of high phenolic content or major contents of monoterpenoids than the aqueous extract of ginger contains lower content of sesquiterpenoids also similar to the findings of baris et al 48 hydrodynamic cavitation with ginger extract showed lower disinfection due to the presence of polar phenolics components with low activity it does not easily penetrate through cell membrane of microorganisms and may require higher dosage to obtain similar disinfection efficiency as that for cavitation with ginger oil a high disinfection of 98 in 60 min with oil 0 1 can be obtained using hybrid cavitation methodology it is possible that higher viscosity and surface tension of oils have adverse impact on cavitation the hybrid process using neem oil and tulsi oil showed lower rates of disinfection probably due to higher viscosity of these oils the neem oil has viscosity of 37 cp 49 tulsi oil has viscosity 26 75 cp and surface tension 84 29 n m 34 the ginger oil has low viscosity of 5 cp and surface tension of 30 9 dyn cm higher values of viscosity and surface tension adversely affect the growth stage of bubbles and increased the time of collapse 50 there could be reduced collapse of bubbles delay in collapse of bubble or implosions of low intensity producing less energy all contributing to reduced disinfection efficiency in the hybrid process the antimicrobial activity of ginger oil is mainly due to the high percentage of eugenol 50 94 as an active ingredient 36 considering easy availability of these medicinal plants and inherent health benefits associated with different plants applying this traditional knowledge mainly from ayurveda and advance oxidation technologies such as hydrodynamic cavitation can offer practical alternative to disinfection of water with possible health benefits of plant extracts followings revealing observations can be made from figs 2 and 3 corresponding to hybrid cavitation technology operation of 15 min 1 the rate of disinfection with ginger oil are higher an order of magnitude 2 times than cavitation alone and 3 times than cavitation with ginger extract 2 ginger oil showed higher degree of disinfection than ginger extract for the reasons explained above 3 the lavender oil exhibited higher rate of disinfection of the order of 1 5 times higher than cavitation alone 4 the turmeric oil and turmeric extract both showed nearly similar and lower extent of disinfection performance than cavitation alone 5 the neem oil and tulsi oil showed lower efficiency similar to turmeric oil 6 the rate of disinfection for mango ginger extract for both hybrid hydrodynamic cavitation and acoustic cavitation were significantly higher than cavitation alone for hydrodynamic cavitation the rates were 2 times higher and for acoustic cavitation 3 times higher rate of disinfection could be obtained the synergistic coefficient for ginger oil is greater than 1 again confirming superiority of combined effects of natural oil along with cavitation the results also indicate natural oils are more effective compared to plant extract in disinfection of water 4 4 kinetics of disinfection per pass disinfection model of hydrodynamic cavitation the kinetics of disinfection based on per pass disinfection factor is useful in understanding the disinfection behaviour 6 7 the rate equations in this regard are elaborated below for the conventional model the effective disinfection rate constant k s 1 is defined as 2 k ln c 0 c t where c 0 and c are bacteria concentrations initial and at any time t respectively cfu ml for per pass disinfection model of hydrodynamic cavitation the effective rate constant is defined as below k s 1 and is related to residence time τ 3 k φ n t φ τ where φ is per pass disinfection factor and n is number of passes per pass disinfection model is more realistic and requires parameters like flow rate q volume treated v operating pressure drop across cavitating device p and concentration time data the per pass disinfection factor φ represents the significance of cavitating device 4 φ ln c c 0 n also number of passes n is an important parameter used in cost calculations lower the value of n lower is the cost of disinfection process the number of passes can be obtained as 5 n q t v using the model effective rate constant and per pass disinfection factor can be calculated and these values are listed in table 2 the per pass disinfection factor φ for ginger oil in cavitation process is 5 times higher than cavitation alone and also 10 times higher than ginger extract as shown in fig 4 the values of φ are 0 36 0 07 and 0 036 for cavitation with oil cavitation alone and cavitation with extract for vortex diode as a cavitating device the per pass disinfection factor φ for cavitation with mango ginger extract is 3 5 times higher than cavitation alone by using vortex diode as cavitation device the value of φ for hc mango ginger extract is 0 243 the results for acoustic cavitation cavitation with mango ginger extract also show consistent results the variations in the values of φ because of the type of extract oil active components of extract oil are clearly evident it can be seen that per pass disinfection factors φ for e coli are higher for ginger oil and mango ginger mg extract with cavitation than other oils and extract it is also evident that in 15 min increase in per pass disinfection for cavitation with ginger oil is of the order of 500 and for mango ginger extract it is 300 more as compared to cavitation alone however since 100 disinfection is desired selection of oil and process integration is crucial it is also to be noted that 0 1 extract represents substantially low dose as compared to corresponding oil dose of 0 1 and therefore for higher disinfection efficiency more than 0 1 of extract is desirable the results clearly highlight utility of natural oil and plant extracts in enhancing the rates of disinfection a comprehensive comparison of performance of different hydrodynamic cavitation reactors is presented in table 3 many reactors such as high pressure homogenizer high speed homogenizer mixer blender and hydrodynamic cavitation with orifice plate utilized for cell disruption 51 54 majority studies exhibited lower disinfection efficiency and required more time for disinfection though the performance of can be enhanced by process intensification such as ozone o3 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 or ultrasonic probe us or use of chlorine oxides for example orifice alone gave only 40 disinfection and maximum of 75 using process intensification chlorination of some form as part of process intensification assists in reaching high levels of disinfection however disinfection by products formation in such scenario is not well reported the problems with rotor type devices are already well highlighted in earlier text the present approach showed a higher efficacy of hybrid cavitation with possible health benefits without forming any disinfection by products time saving with less energy requirement 4 5 mechanistic understanding of the process 4 5 1 philosophy behind selecting plant extract as an additive for hybrid cavitation curcuma amada which is also known as a mango ginger or ambe haldi or aam haldi is traditionally used for medicinal purposes as a herbal medicine in ayurveda unani medicine from centuries and in several food preparations it is well reported that rhizome is rich source of essential oils and containing more than 130 active ingredients with biomedical importance it has antibacterial insecticidal antifungal and antioxidant properties 38 the major chemical components with their biological activity include starch phenolic acids volatile oils curcuminoids and terpenoids like difurocumenonol amadannulen and amadaldehyde that are important from pharmacological point of view ramachandran et al 59 reported mango ginger s anticancer potential and its action for glioblastoma cells was reported where curcuma amada extract induces apoptosis in glioblastoma cells difurocumenonol one of active component from mango ginger is important for antimicrobial activity against gram positive and gram negative bacteria 41 de et al 60 reported presence of non polar terpenes in indian curcuma species e g c amada c aromatica c caesia c longa and c zedoaria also the lipophilic curcuminoid helps in killing microorganisms by inhibiting its cellular functioning c amada has a strong anti microbial and other biological activity the other active components may also enhance the disinfection or bactericidal activity by different mechanisms such as inhibition of cell wall synthesis interference with the permeability of cell membrane cause membrane disruption modifying cellular constituents and cell damage or cell mutation chandarana et al 61 showed the antimicrobial activity of aqueous extract of c amada against e coli b subtilis s aureus many such plant extracts can prove to be useful from health benefits point of view if appropriately used in the water treatment process and therefore the present study could provide starting point for elucidating use of plant extracts in hybrid cavitation process for water disinfection 4 5 2 functionality changes the ftir spectra of disinfection of water before and after cavitation with natural additives are presented in fig 5 a b and c the different functional groups of natural additives with vibrational frequencies are clearly evident the ftir spectra of the oil phase of ginger oil before and after hybrid cavitation indicates similarity in wavenumber but difference in intensity of transmittance the ftir spectra for the aqueous phase indicated no change in the functional groups before and after hybrid cavitation the ir band for oh vibration of alcohol and carboxylic acid group represented in the range of 2500 3300 cm 1 1700 1750 cm 1 interval is for ketone group the characteristic peak at 1430 1510 cm 1 wavenumber for cc vibration ascribed to benzene group 1375 cm 1 for co group 987 cm 1 wavenumber indicated for chh group and 883 cm 1 for para benzene functional group all these functional groups are representing α gingerol active component of ginger oil the results of ftir analysis before and after cavitation showed no indicative change suggesting no formation of byproducts or intermediates 4 5 3 structural changes a morphological analysis of bacteria before and after treatment was studied by tem fig 6a b and fe sem fig 6c and d tem results indicate intact healthy e coli cells with rod shape homogenous smooth surface and visible cytoplasmic contents that get damaged after 15 min of hybrid cavitation treatment significant change in shape size and morphology was observed and damage in the form of cell membrane rupture and leakage of cytoplasmic content due to hybrid cavitation is clearly visible 4 6 possible mechanism of disinfection from the literature studies it can be deduced that the conventional cavitating devices such as orifice and venturi can impart severe surface damage to the microorganisms but considerably limited cell breakage cleavage thereby limiting the overall efficiency the rotational devices largely effect cell cleavage rough surface though size reduction and leakage of cytoplasm is not significant 24 in the present work hybrid cavitation led to loss of cytoplasm reduction in size or totally deformed structure size reduced from 1 to 2 μm to 100 200 nm as seen from fig 6 b and d the combined effect of antimicrobial property of natural additives and hydrodynamic cavitation is evident in the form of increased efficiency fig 7 depicts this plausible mechanism of hybrid cavitation by highlighting contribution of different factors the results are also consistent with those reported earlier with hybrid method 6 7 thus the extreme conditions of temperature pressure at the point of cavity implosion high shear oxidation or oxidative damage action of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals of sulfhydryl group and double bonds of protein components etc fragment the cellular content and cell membrane damage dna and protein and resulting into cell death the active components of plant extract and essential oil both have lipophilic properties and permeate the cell wall as well as the cytoplasmic membrane inducing a loss of membrane integrity in microorganisms 45 the active component such as gingerol from ginger oil and curcuminoids and difurocumenonol from mango ginger extract can react with phospholipids of outer cell membrane thus altering the cell permeability and denature its protein thereby causes cell death 4 7 energy and cost considerations the energy requirement is evaluated for different reactor configurations and is compared in fig 8 filho et al 28 reported 99 97 of disinfection in 30 min with orifice as a cavitation device and copper coil in cooling system at a pressure of 10 mpa requiring 12 28 kwh energy its disinfection performance is higher than that reported earlier by chand et al 26 arrojo et al 25 and jancula et al 62 chand et al 26 reported disinfection efficiency of 75 using liquid whistle reactor with ozone and required energy of 15 3kwh pressure of 500 psi and 3 h of time of operation arrojo et al 25 reported disinfection of 91 1 for venturi and 32 7 for orifice in 2 h under 18 kwh energy and jancula et al 62 reported 99 of disinfection with venturi with 350 kpa discharge pressure 18 min of time with 18 kwh energy in recent reports on rotor stator type of devices reported by sun et al 63 64 obtained higher or similar disinfection efficiency of 100 of disinfection in 4 14 min of operation with rotational speed of 4200 rpm 1 4 m3 h flow rate and required low energy 0 748 3 48 kwh compared with other rotational based hydrodynamic cavitation reactor reported by 19 65 and conventional laminar flow based cavitation reactor sarc et al 21 and cerecedo et al 19 reported 99 95 9025 rpm 150 min required energy 0 7 kwh and 100 2400 rpm 7 8 min required energy 0 65 kwh respectively the drawback of the use of rotor and stator type of device is that with increase in the flow rate above 1 4 m3 h and high rotational speed of 4200 rpm the disinfection performance decreases flow rate of 2 6 m3 h showed no disinfection further very high temperatures above 90 c essentially indicate disinfection by way of boiling on the other hand jain et al 9 utilizing rotational flow based reactor vortex diode reported more than 98 of disinfection with only 2 bar of pressure drop within 60 min of time of operation corresponding to only 0 0872 kwh energy requirement mane et al 7 developed hybrid cavitation using natural oils that resulted in drastic reduction in time for disinfection with high disinfection efficiency and more than 99 of disinfection using 1 bar pressure drop for a very low 0 0025 0 005 kwh of energy requirement was obtained in the present study the disinfection efficiency for cavitation with ginger oil is 98 in 60 min of time with 0 03 kwh and first time reported the energy required for cavitation with mango ginger is 0 03 kwh with 95 60 min disinfection however since 100 disinfection is desired more investigations on plant extracts are essential the hybrid cavitation methodology using vortex diode appears to provide substantial advantages and low cost in addition the vortex based cavitation reactors are commercially available and have easy scale up 66 therefore in view of the techno economic feasibility no harmful by products and possible health benefits of plant extracts the hybrid cavitation process can provide alternative solution to conventional disinfection methods the cavitation yield per volume treated cfu ml j can be obtained as cavitation yield volume treated c 0 c p q t the cavitation yield per volume treated for hydrodynamic cavitation along with ginger oil and hydrodynamic cavitation along with mango ginger extract at time 15 min is 7 2 and 3 42 cfu ml j further the cost of treatment can be obtained using the following equation cost of treatment m 3 of water n p p e 36 η where n is number of passes can be obtained as n q t v for vortex diode the flow rate q measured at δp 1 bar is 720 lph and volume treated is 20 l at 15 min of time of operation t the number of passes n obtained is 9 assuming the cost of electricity pe as 10 rs kwh and pump efficiency η as 0 66 the cost of treatment per m3 of water is 3 8 rs m3 0 052 m3 in view of disinfection efficiency less than 100 using plant extract 0 1 it is required that either the process can be evaluated at higher dose of plant extract or be combined with natural oils so that 100 disinfection can be realized it may be noted that the cost of disinfection would get slightly modified increased in such eventuality since this work only provides the proof of concept for the use of plant extracts with limited examples many other plant extracts extraction methods different plant parts need to be investigated where possibly high disinfection can be obtained 5 conclusions the present study for the first time reports useful application of plant extracts in the hybrid cavitation process for disinfection of water and for providing possible health benefits followings are the main findings of the proposed green hybrid cavitation technology 1 the process effectively eliminates gram negative e coli at significantly higher rates 2 ginger oil was found to be effective natural oil and in case of plant extract mango ginger extract was found to be most effective than other plant extracts 3 a very small concentration of 0 1 of natural additive both ginger oil and mango ginger extract can effect disinfection though increased amount of plant extract may be required for obtaining high disinfection efficiency 4 the rate constant values can be improved to the extent of 3 times for hydrodynamic cavitation with mango ginger extract 5 times for hydrodynamic cavitation with ginger oil and 8 times for acoustic cavitation with mango ginger extract 5 the lipophilic nature of antimicrobial active ingredient of natural additive is responsible for increased cell permeability and cell denaturation 6 a plausible mechanism suggests synergistic effect of both natural additive and hydrodynamic cavitation and the rupture of cell wall cell death can be due to various factors such as oxidation effect high shear localized heat thermal effect and antimicrobial property of active constituents 7 the energy requirement is significantly low indicating techno economic feasibility the hybrid cavitation technology with plant extract or natural oils can be useful alternative to existing conventional processes for disinfection of water and more investigations into application of different plant extracts are required nomenclature c concentration cfu ml c 0 initial
