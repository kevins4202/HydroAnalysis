11255,alternate wetting and drying awd is an irrigation technique developed to save water in paddy rice farming we investigated how local paddy irrigation conditions affected the adoption of awd by farmers in an giang province of the mekong river delta region vietnam to this end we used community level statistics collected in the dry seasons of 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 we focused on paddy elevation density of channel networks and degree of triple cropping as indicators of irrigation conditions we performed a partial rank order correlation coefficient analysis between awd adoption rates and these irrigation conditions and several other related factors variations in irrigation conditions caused by paddy elevation and infrastructure status were identified as affecting awd implementation although awd is a knowledge intensive practice for optimizing watering amounts and timing in paddy rice farming and requires no extra infrastructure or machinery it does require well arranged irrigation conditions moreover the significance of the channel network in awd adoption was emphasized in a year with low rainfall indicating that farmers prefer continuous flooding to awd as a hedge against water shortages in awd continuous flooding is considered a waste of water from the viewpoint of rice plant physiology however where irrigation conditions are less than ideal continuous flooding includes the role of water reservoirs therefore the prerequisite conditions for diffusion of awd need to be reconsidered keywords alternate wetting and drying awd continuous flooding paddy rice farming 1 introduction as the global population continues to steadily increase staple crop yields must also increase to meet the demand for food fao 2011 water is an essential resource for stable agricultural production but as competition for water resources between domestic industrial and agricultural sectors increases the agricultural sector must increase food production with limited water resources and improving agricultural water productivity has become an urgent issue hundertmark and facon 2003 paddy rice farming in particular requires more water than other staple crops such as wheat and maize because irrigated rice paddies are generally flooded from the transplantation or sowing stage to harvest tuong and bouman 2003 thus the establishment of water saving techniques is particularly vital in rice farming the international rice research institute irri has found that paddy rice only needs to be flooded during the rooting and flowering stages van der hoek et al 2001 consequently irri developed a rice growing procedure called alternate wetting and drying awd whereby paddy fields are only intermittently irrigated outside of these critical stages a safe awd procedure for this intermittent irrigation stage can be described as follows 1 a perforated plastic pipe is set into the ground to precisely monitor the belowground water level 2 farmers supply no more than 5 cm of water to their paddies and then do not irrigate again until the water level naturally declines to 10 15 cm below the soil surface 3 this process is repeated several times after the rooting stage up until the flowering stage when farmers follow this procedure total water usage can be reduced by 10 40 relative to continuous flooding with no significant negative impact on yield improving agricultural water productivity e g lampayan et al 2015 hence irri has attempted to spread the awd practice in various asian rice growing regions e g sibayan et al 2010 in addition to saving water awd can also reduce farmers pumping costs and irrigation charges thereby directly increasing their net income moreover because awd is a knowledge intensive technique e g aakkula et al 2005 pingali et al 1998 for optimizing irrigation amounts and timing in paddies based on an understanding of soil water conditions by means of a simple instrument it can be adopted by local farmers at low cost kurschner et al 2010 therefore studies on awd diffusion have emphasized how the proper understanding and practice of the technique are imparted to the farmers kurschner et al 2010 rejesus et al 2013 however based on empirical studies in china li 2001 and loeve et al 2001 raised concerns that the successful implementation of awd requires not only a proper understanding and practice of the technique but also reliable and flexible irrigation conditions a similar situation was also shown in a qualitative study in the mekong delta of vietnam yamaguchi et al 2017 where farmers hesitated to adopt awd in paddies that did not directly connect with water channels or were located at higher elevations because such paddies tended to have unstable water conditions yamaguchi et al 2017 those studies indicated that farmers would be prepared to adopt awd when they were confident that their irrigation conditions were reliable and timely enough to allow irrigation to be carried out according to schedule mushtaq et al 2006 and conversely that awd might not be easily accepted in areas that have suffered from water scarcity despite the fact that awd was developed as a water saving technique moreover one of the awd s merits is its low cost for farmers to implement however if implementation of awd requires a considerable dependence on irrigation conditions then factors other than just introductory costs must also be examined these factors are likely to be of significant concern when considering awd diffusion however the relationship between adoption of awd and irrigation conditions has not been verified with quantitative data hence this study aimed to investigate the linkage between awd diffusion and water supply conditions by using quantitative data from the mekong delta vietnam the delta regions of south and southeast asian countries are good candidates for awd implementation kurschner et al 2010 quynh and sander 2015 delta basins such as the mekong irrawaddy chao phraya and bengal have long been primary rice production bases barker et al 1985 supporting the growing asian population however the current sea level rise due to global climate change has caused saline water intrusion into these regions creating a shortage of water for rice farming wassmann et al 2004 ibrd and world bank 2010 driel and nauta 2013 rahman and bhattacharya 2014 moreover groundwater overdraft and decreasing river flows have also contributed to deteriorating agricultural water conditions macdonald et al 2015 thilakarathne and sridhar 2017 awd has the potential to alleviate the negative impacts of these issues on rice farming in these regions the mekong delta region accounts for more than half of the domestic rice production in vietnam which is a leading rice exporter nevertheless for the reasons outlined above it is increasingly difficult for rice farmers in this region to obtain the required amount of water therefore water saving technologies are particularly crucial for rice farming in this region the mekong delta is a wide floodplain therefore slight variations in elevation have a substantial impact on drainage access to irrigation water and susceptibility to flooding and these factors significantly influence land cover and rice farm management in this region kaida 1974 thuy and anh 2015 we hypothesized that certain paddy elevations would hinder farmers adoption of awd by impeding water control this study evaluates the irrigation conditions of the mekong delta rice farming according to paddy elevation and water channel density mekong delta farmers have endured water shortages during the dry season in response channel networks have grown as rice farming has intensified kono 2001 in the areas where channel networks are limited farmers occasionally use plot to plot irrigation which leads to difficulties in controlling paddy water yamaguchi et al 2017 therefore the correlation between awd adoption and water channel development is also assessed 2 study area a brief history of rice farming and awd this study analyses awd dissemination and implementation based on the case of an giang province mekong river delta region vietnam fig 1 an giang is the second largest rice producer in the mekong delta maffj 2011 rice paddies account for about 70 of the total provincial area of 340 000 ha soag 2015 the monthly average temperature exceeds 25 c throughout the year and is very suitable for paddy rice farming precipitation however varies notably between the may october rainy season and the december march dry season fig 2 prior to the 1950s rice farming in the mekong delta was severely limited by water shortages during the dry season in addition rainy season farming was disturbed by the flooding of the mekong river so the only viable option was single cropping with floating rice xuan 1975 hieu 2010 after the 1960s early maturing rice cultivars and irrigation pumps were introduced embankments were constructed to protect paddies from inundation except for flooding during the mid rainy season september november double rice cropping from the dry season to the start of the rainy season became common practice the rate of adoption of double cropping by area in an giang exceeded 90 by the early 1990s otsuka 2014 since the end of the 1990s embankments have been raised and large capacity pumps have been installed to drain rainwater from within the paddies to outside the embankments hieu 2010 tran et al 2018 the infrastructure consisting of raised embankments and drainage pumps is known as a full dike system it has enabled triple cropping which had an adoption rate of 66 2 in this area by 2014 soag 2015 intensification of rice farming in an giang increased rice production in the region but because of increased production costs grower revenues did not commensurately increase thus the provincial government introduced a set of new measures to enhance the efficiency of rice farming chi et al 2013 awd was one of those measures in 2005 the local government in collaboration with irri introduced awd as a measure to lower pumping costs meier 2007 the local government has proactively arranged workshops on new technologies including awd for farmers and has set up model paddies showcasing advanced rice farming techniques all around an giang meier 2007 diangkinay quicho 2013 yamaguchi et al 2016 awd has been steadily adopted by the dry season of 2014 2015 the total area of paddies where awd had been implemented had increased to about 120 000 ha accounting for 52 of the total paddy area and the number of rice farming households that had implemented awd exceeded 120 000 table 1 compared to the situation in the philippines which has approximately 100 000 awd farmers in the entire country despite it being the country where awd diffusion originated lampayan 2013 it can be said that the diffusion of awd in an giang has been successful nevertheless for unknown reasons there were disparities in the rates of awd adoption among the local communities yamaguchi et al 2016 the aim of the present study was to use a geographic information system gis and statistical methods to identify the effects of the irrigation conditions on provincial scale awd dissemination and implementation 3 data and methodology 3 1 awd data the administrative units of vietnam are divided into first second and third tiers 1 provincial level units 2 district level units and 3 administrative units at the communal level world bank 2011 this study refers to the third tier units as communes as of 2014 an giang had 156 communes soag 2015 the an giang plant protection sub department agppsd the agency that assumes the role of introducing agricultural innovations to farmers has published awd adoption statistics for each commune since 2009 we used the data collected for the 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 dry seasons table 1 each commune has at least one agppsd extension agent awd adoption rates have been reported by extension agents through direct observation of irrigation management in each paddy however there are no rigid criteria to confirm whether farmers adopted awd therefore the awd statistics could include accidental errors and outliers thus the present study used nonparametric methods that are robust to outliers xiao et al 2016 we conducted unstructured interviews on awd implementation in an giang with agppsd provincial staff members and extension agents in september 2014 yamaguchi et al 2016 and may and september 2015 yamaguchi et al 2017 we complementarily utilized these qualitative data in the interpretation of the results 3 2 paddy polygons all gis processing in this study was performed with arcgis v 9 3 1 environmental systems research institute inc redlands ca usa paddy polygons within an giang were based on a map 1 50 000 issued by mnrev 2003 and the paddy area of each commune was based on these polygons we performed pearson s correlation coefficient analysis between the estimated paddy area based on the paddy polygons and the paddy area obtained from the agppsd statistics for each commune in the 2014 2015 dry season the results were well correlated fig 3 but the base map was published more than 10 years earlier the annual rate of increase in the provincial paddy area was very low 0 7 y 1 from 2005 to 2015 soag 2015 agppsd 2016 therefore we concluded that the paddy polygons derived from the map published in 2003 corresponded sufficiently well to the current paddy distribution 3 3 paddy classification by elevation based on a topographic map 1 50 000 issued by agppsd we extracted about 4000 elevation data points in 0 1 m increments the map was missing data for two small areas so we complemented the data with elevation point data from the mnrev map 2003 by using the elevation data included in the paddy polygons we created a paddy area elevation model 50 m resolution by inverse distance weighted interpolation we classified paddy areas into six elevation categories 1 m 1 2 m 2 3 m 3 4 m 4 5 m and 5 m and calculated the proportions of paddy area for each category relative to the total paddy area in each commune we performed spearman s rank order correlation coefficient rocc analysis between the awd adoption rate and the proportion of paddy area for each elevation category and within each commune the ppcor package in r kim 2015 was used for the statistical analysis through this analysis we estimated the paddy elevations suitable for awd implementation 3 4 irrigation networks we traced the irrigation networks using channel and river polylines derived from the mnrev map 2003 agppsd staff members stated that most of the major channels were constructed before the 1990s when double cropping was widespread a number of narrow channels however were constructed after 2000 implementation of full dike systems created an opportunity to construct new channels to improve drainage measurement of the extent of full dike system construction would provide a more accurate representation of current channel network development but there are no published statistics for paddy areas enclosed by full dike systems because triple cropping is only feasible in paddies having a full dike system hieu 2010 tran et al 2018 we substituted the data of triple cropping paddy area for each commune information on triple cropping paddy areas has been published only for each district as a whole therefore we estimated commune level data previous studies sakamoto et al 2009 son et al 2014 have distinguished between double and triple cropping paddies in the mekong delta region by using the extended vegetation index evi from modis satellite images three evi peaks appear in triple cropping paddies but evi values are lower in double cropping paddies during the mid rainy season september november fig 4 therefore we were able to estimate the area of triple cropping paddies by focusing on the evi values for the mid rainy season using the mod13q1 data in modis didan et al 2015 we compiled images from the first half of november 2009 2011 2013 and 2014 see table 4 in the results we classified the pixels within paddy polygons as planted or non planted based on the evi thresholds we increased the evi thresholds from 500 to 6000 in increments of 100 and compared the coefficients of determination r 2 between the estimated and statistics based values for triple cropping paddies by district using this information we selected the most consistent evi threshold 3 5 partial rank order correlation coefficient analysis this study aimed to verify the effects of irrigation conditions on awd implementation we used paddy elevation density of channel networks and degree of triple cropping as indicators of irrigation conditions of respective paddies and we added five other variables that might also be correlated with awd diffusion these eight factors are summarized in table 2 we then performed partial rank order correlation coefficient procc analysis on the correlations of these parameters with the awd adoption rate for each commune by using the ppcor package in r procc measures the magnitude and direction of the association between two ranked variables while it controls for the effects of at least one of the other variables sheskin 2000 4 results and discussion 4 1 trends and regional differences in awd diffusion in an giang by 2009 2010 the provincial capital long xuyen already had a high awd adoption rate 80 fig 5 because awd is a knowledge intensive technique diangkinay quicho 2013 and chi et al 2015 reported that government efforts to transmit proper information to farmers had been a significant factor in the diffusion of awd in an giang long xuyen was the first district where agppsd and irri collaborated on awd diffusion in 2005 meier 2007 and it is to be expected that such initial activities would promote awd diffusion there in contrast all of the other districts at that time had awd adoption rates of less than 30 in 2009 2010 there was also wide variation in the awd adoption rates among the communes for example in tri ton district where the awd adoption rate was only 20 the tan tuyen and ba chuc communes had adoption rates of 75 and 62 respectively whereas the ta danh and luong phi communes had rates below 5 from 2005 2009 approximately 500 farmers workshops on agricultural innovation were held in an giang agppsd 2014 however according to agppsd staff members the venues for such workshops tended to be near communes that were convenient in terms of transportation and therefore such communes might show an anomalously high adoption rate however the rates of awd adoption tan tuyen and ba chuc communes decreased sharply in 2014 2015 for unknown reasons because the awd statistics were collected by extension agents without any fixed process or criteria there is the possibility that outliers were generated the local government has held farmers workshops regularly after 2010 agppsd 2014 and such continuous efforts would have raised the overall adoption rate of awd in 2014 2015 moreover it was reported that in an giang in addition to water saving awd had an effect on reducing rice lodging ha et al 2014 lampayan et al 2015 and hence farmers often adopted awd after first hand observation of well grown rice in nearby awd paddies yamaguchi et al 2016 such spillover effects might promote awd diffusion over the whole of an giang however differences in the adoption patterns were still pronounced among the districts and the communes in 2014 2015 4 2 classification of paddies by elevation fig 6 shows the distribution of paddies by elevation approximately half of the paddies were located at an elevation of 1 2 m and 30 were 1 m in elevation fewer than 5 of the an giang paddies were located at 3 m elevation in 2009 2010 there was no significant correlation between the awd adoption rate and the proportions of paddy fields at any elevation range table 3 in 2011 2012 the proportion of paddies at an elevation of 1 2 m was positively correlated with the awd adoption rate but the proportions at the 1 m and 5 m elevations were negatively correlated with the awd adoption rate in 2013 2014 the proportion of paddies at an elevation of 1 2 m was positively correlated with the awd adoption rate and it remained so in 2014 2015 the proportions of paddies at the 1 m 3 4 m 4 5 m and 5 m elevations were all negatively correlated with the awd adoption rate in 2013 2014 and even more so in 2014 2015 diangkinay quicho 2013 conducted a household survey and reported that paddy elevation was not a significant factor affecting awd diffusion in an giang however their study was conducted in 2009 and thus is not inconsistent with the results of the current study according to interviews with agppsd extension agents yamaguchi et al 2017 lower paddies are not suitable for awd due to drainage problems but higher paddies are also not suitable for awd because those paddies often have difficulties in irrigating when channel water levels are low a similar situation exists in the case of the bengal delta where it has been reported that lower paddies were not suitable for awd kurschner et al 2010 in the case of an giang awd implementation would be influenced by the vertical location of each paddy with the elevation of 1 2 m being the most suitable for awd implementation 4 3 estimation of triple cropping paddy area by commune for the 2009 mid rainy season the triple cropping paddy area with the highest coefficient of determination had an estimated evi threshold of 4900 table 4 we determined suitable evi thresholds for 2011 2013 and 2014 based on the r 2 for each year the r 2 values ranged from 0 95 to 0 99 so the estimated triple cropping paddy areas were highly correlated with the statistics based values for each district whereas sakamoto et al 2009 and son et al 2014 extracted paddy areas based on only evi derived phenology and then classified the pixels within these polygons into double or triple cropping our classification was based on the precise paddy polygons extracted from the detailed map 1 50 000 issued by mnrev 2003 therefore the accuracy of our estimations is expected to be better than those of the previous studies however the accuracy of classification at the commune level still needs to be verified which is a task for the future the estimated and statistics based values were well aligned in 2014 but varied in the other years in 2011 and 2013 the triple cropping paddy area was overestimated whereas it was underestimated in 2009 the influence of these discrepancies would be mitigated by using nonparametric statistics in the procc analysis xiao et al 2016 4 4 procc analysis of the awd adoption rate the procc analysis table 5 indicated that the proportion of paddies at a suitable elevation 1 2 m was positively correlated with awd adoption rates in 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 even after controlling for confounding variables but no such correlation was observed for 2009 2010 or 2011 2012 in the bengal delta too it was reported that a 1 m difference in elevation made a difference in the suitability for awd implementation kurschner et al 2010 since delta regions are flat even a slight variation in elevation can influence paddy field hydrology thuy and anh 2015 making a difference in awd adoption patterns takahashi 2013 reported that effective connections between paddies and water channels were significant factors in awd adoption extension agents also mentioned the importance of the channel network in awd adoption yamaguchi et al 2017 and channel density was significantly positively correlated with the awd adoption rate in 2014 2015 although this analysis only included major channels constructed before 2003 this network was still having a significant impact on the awd adoption rate more than a decade later the proportion of triple cropping paddies was more strongly positively correlated with the awd adoption rate than was channel density the full dike systems were originally constructed for mid rainy season rice farming and triple cropping tran et al 2018 but according to agppsd personnel the construction of full dike systems also promoted development of channel networks in order to provide effective drainage of rainwater from within the full dike systems therefore farmers cultivating rice in full dike systems could easily adopt awd there were consistently high positive correlations between the awd adoption rate and communes within the provincial capital from 2009 to 2010 to 2014 to 2015 the relatively higher awd adoption rate in the communes of long xuyen may be explained the area s longer history of awd promotion and dissemination meier 2007 there were significant positive correlations between awd adoption rates and population densities in 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 the availability of household capital influences agricultural mechanization mottaleb et al 2016 and people living in urban areas of an giang have more opportunities for off farm employment and have higher incomes than those in rural areas soag 2015 more farmers may be able to purchase power pumps for rice farming using their off farm income in urban areas thereby promoting awd adoption even though road network development is an enabling factor in agricultural mechanization mottaleb et al 2016 no significant correlation was detected between road density and awd adoption rate there was no significant correlation between awd adoption and area of paddy fields cultivated per household farmers managing large paddy areas in an giang generally use agricultural machinery tsukada 2013 and the rate of power pump ownership is most likely higher among large scale farmers than among small scale farmers however agppsd reported that paddy surface evenness is a factor determining awd implementation by farmers yamaguchi et al 2017 and paddy surface irregularity generally increases with plot size jat et al 2006 therefore the relationship between paddy cultivation area per household and awd adoption appears to be complicated by several other factors there was no significant correlation between the awd adoption rate and the distribution of acid sulfate soil acid sulfate soil is widely distributed in the mekong delta and is detrimental to rice farming moreover aeration of acidic soil increases its deleterious effects on rice growth husson et al 2000 thus paddies with acidic soil would not be conducive to awd implementation agppsd personnel however mentioned that acidic soil liming was widely implemented by the local government in about 2000 and the harmful effects of acid sulfate soil may have been alleviated in addition the acidic soil distribution base map niapp 1990 used in the procc analysis was drawn more than 30 years ago and might not reflect the current acidic soil distribution the procc analysis of 2009 2010 table 5 indicated that only the provincial capital effect was significantly correlated with awd adoption in 2011 2012 however population density also was significantly correlated in 2014 2015 the number of variables significantly influencing the awd adoption rate had increased to five people who adopt an innovation in its early phase of dissemination innovators or early adopters tend to use various media to actively gather information on the innovations tend to be highly educated and tend to earn high incomes rogers 2003 awd information was initially offered in the provincial capital meier 2007 which has lower poverty rates and higher education levels than other regions in the study area soag 2015 furthermore the elevations of most paddies 93 in the provincial capital area are suitable for awd and the channel density is higher 82 m ha 1 than that in other districts 66 m ha 1 therefore conditions were such that awd could readily be accepted in the provincial capital as soon as it was introduced and in fact the provincial capital has had a consistently higher awd adoption rate than the other districts awd requires precise water management and is not feasible on paddies with unfavorable irrigation conditions such as high or low elevations or poor channel connections since the number of farmers who adopted awd has increased from 2009 to 2010 to 2014 2015 these unfavorable irrigation conditions probably gradually became more influential in the awd adoption rate for each commune agppsd personnel stated that the amount of annual precipitation also influenced awd adoption yamaguchi et al 2017 fig 7 shows the monthly water level of the mekong river in the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 dry seasons due to heavy rainfall in december 2013 the water levels were exceptionally high in the 2013 2014 dry season in contrast the scant precipitation between august and november 2014 caused the water level to be unusually low in the 2014 2015 dry season mrc 2015b in december 2014 when the 2014 2015 dry season farming started the water level was about 50 cm lower than it was in 2014 and there was still a 20 cm difference in march when the dry season ended acquiring irrigation water would have been more difficult in most paddies in the 2014 2015 dry season than it was in the 2013 2014 dry season therefore irrigation conditions such as the channel density and degree of triple cropping would have played a significant part in the implementation of awd in 2014 2015 5 conclusion and recommendations although awd is a technique for water saving in paddy rice farming it has been pointed out that paddy irrigation conditions would be an essential factor influencing whether farmers make the decision to adopt awd or not li 2001 loeve et al 2001 in this study we use quantitative data collected from an giang located in the northern part of the mekong delta vietnam to identify significant relationships between awd adoption rates and paddy irrigation conditions although on the whole awd has been smoothly disseminated in an giang there are variations in the diffusion patterns at the district and community levels this study aimed to verify the relationships between awd adoption rates and paddy irrigation conditions at the commune level by using rocc and procc analyses with statistics and gis data our analysis revealed that paddies at higher 3 m and lower 1 m elevations were not ideal for awd implementation due to inconvenient water conditions and thus the proportion paddies at suitable elevation 1 2 m positively influenced awd adoption rate moreover channel density had a positive effect on awd adoption rate in 2015 which was a year with little precipitation there was also positive relation between the rate of triple cropping and awd adoption rate in 2015 in an giang farmers are able to conduct triple cropping only under a full dike systems construction of full dike systems promotes channel network development and therefore triple cropping farmers would more readily implement awd these analyses indicated the significance of irrigation conditions in the implementation of awd raising concerns about how widely awd can be disseminated awd is considered a knowledge intensive technique that is possible to introduce at minimal cost to farmers e g kurschner et al 2010 however efforts to transmit proper information to farmers about awd would not in themselves be sufficient to ensure wide area diffusion of awd and paddies suitable for awd should be carefully considered from the viewpoint of irrigation conditions diffusion efforts should be conducted concurrently with construction of irrigation facilities moreover the significance of the irrigation network in the adoption of awd was emphasized in 2015 a year with low precipitation indicating that in cases where water conditions are very severe farmers would prefer continuous flooding to awd farmers in an giang fear drought in their paddies where water conditions are poor or in years with low precipitation yamaguchi et al 2017 and they would fear cessation of water supply when their paddy soil was unflooded during awd implementation the researchers who developed awd considered continuous flooding of paddies to be a waste of water from the viewpoint of rice plant physiology and thus suggested limiting flooding periods such as in the awd protocol e g humphreys et al 2010 however where irrigation conditions are unreliable farmers tended to keep water in their paddies as a reservoir to hedge against the risk of water shortages from that perspective continuous flooding has significant meaning for farmers when deciding paddies suitable for awd implementation the meaning of continuous flooding in paddies should be reconsidered from diverse perspectives owing to the overall accuracy of statistics and gis data in an giang this study adopted nonparametric analysis methods to alleviate negative influences of accidental errors and outliers thus the quantitative effects of irrigation conditions and other related factors on awd adoption is still unknown therefore a parametric analysis needs to be conducted to scrutinize data quality and to quantify the effects of each respective factor the procc analysis showed that population density was also significantly correlated with awd adoption rates in 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 but the causal relationship between the two remains unknown moreover the data available for the procc analysis was limited in an giang due to lack of sufficient statistics data at the commune level hence the overall picture of the awd diffusion process in an giang remains unexplained it is expected that the whole process of awd implementation will be grasped though detailed household surveys and though the integration of such micro scale studies with macro scale analysis acknowledgments we thank drs yagi kazuyuki and sudo shigeto for their

11255,alternate wetting and drying awd is an irrigation technique developed to save water in paddy rice farming we investigated how local paddy irrigation conditions affected the adoption of awd by farmers in an giang province of the mekong river delta region vietnam to this end we used community level statistics collected in the dry seasons of 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 we focused on paddy elevation density of channel networks and degree of triple cropping as indicators of irrigation conditions we performed a partial rank order correlation coefficient analysis between awd adoption rates and these irrigation conditions and several other related factors variations in irrigation conditions caused by paddy elevation and infrastructure status were identified as affecting awd implementation although awd is a knowledge intensive practice for optimizing watering amounts and timing in paddy rice farming and requires no extra infrastructure or machinery it does require well arranged irrigation conditions moreover the significance of the channel network in awd adoption was emphasized in a year with low rainfall indicating that farmers prefer continuous flooding to awd as a hedge against water shortages in awd continuous flooding is considered a waste of water from the viewpoint of rice plant physiology however where irrigation conditions are less than ideal continuous flooding includes the role of water reservoirs therefore the prerequisite conditions for diffusion of awd need to be reconsidered keywords alternate wetting and drying awd

essential resource for stable agricultural production but as competition for water resources between domestic industrial and agricultural sectors increases the agricultural sector must increase food

local farmers at low cost kurschner et al 2010 therefore studies on awd diffusion have emphasized how the proper understanding and practice of the technique are imparted to the farmers kurschner et al 2010 rejesus et al 2013 however based on empirical studies in china li 2001 and loeve et al 2001 raised concerns that the successful implementation of awd requires not only a proper understanding and practice of the technique but also reliable and flexible irrigation conditions a similar situation was also shown in a qualitative study in the mekong delta of vietnam yamaguchi et al 2017 where farmers hesitated to adopt awd in paddies that did not directly connect with water channels or were located at higher elevations because such paddies tended to have unstable water conditions yamaguchi et al 2017 those studies indicated that farmers would be prepared to adopt awd when they were confident that their irrigation conditions were reliable and timely enough to allow irrigation to be carried out according to schedule mushtaq et al 2006 and conversely that awd might not be easily accepted in areas that have suffered from water scarcity despite the fact that awd was developed as a water saving technique moreover one of the awd s merits is its low cost for farmers to implement however if implementation of awd requires a considerable dependence on irrigation conditions then factors other than just introductory costs must also be examined these factors are likely to be of significant concern when considering awd diffusion however the relationship between adoption of awd and irrigation conditions has not been verified with quantitative data hence this study aimed to investigate the linkage between awd diffusion and water supply conditions by using quantitative data from the mekong delta vietnam the delta regions of south and southeast asian countries are good candidates for awd implementation kurschner et al 2010 quynh and sander 2015 delta basins such as the mekong irrawaddy chao phraya and bengal have long been primary rice production bases barker et al 1985 supporting the growing asian population however the current sea level rise due to global climate change has caused saline water intrusion into these regions creating a shortage of water for rice farming wassmann et al 2004 ibrd and world bank 2010 driel and nauta 2013 rahman and bhattacharya 2014 moreover groundwater overdraft and decreasing river flows have also contributed to deteriorating agricultural water conditions macdonald et al 2015 thilakarathne and sridhar 2017 awd has the potential to alleviate the negative impacts of these issues on rice farming in these regions the mekong delta region accounts for more than half of the domestic rice production in vietnam which is a leading rice exporter nevertheless for the reasons outlined above it is increasingly difficult for rice farmers in this region to obtain the required amount of water therefore water saving technologies are particularly crucial for rice farming in this region the mekong delta is a wide floodplain therefore slight variations in elevation have a substantial impact on drainage access to irrigation water and susceptibility to flooding and these factors significantly influence land cover and rice farm management in this region kaida 1974 thuy and anh 2015 we hypothesized that certain paddy elevations would hinder farmers adoption of awd by impeding water control this study evaluates the irrigation conditions of the mekong delta rice farming according to paddy elevation and water channel density mekong delta farmers have endured water shortages during the dry season in response channel networks have grown as rice farming has intensified kono 2001 in the areas where channel networks are limited farmers occasionally use plot to plot irrigation which leads to difficulties in controlling paddy water yamaguchi et al 2017 therefore the correlation between awd adoption and water channel development is also assessed 2 study area a brief history of rice farming and awd this study analyses awd dissemination and implementation based on the case of an giang province mekong river delta region vietnam fig 1 an giang is the second largest rice producer in the mekong delta maffj 2011 rice paddies account for about 70 of the total provincial area of 340 000 ha soag 2015 the monthly average temperature exceeds 25 c throughout the year and is very suitable for paddy rice farming precipitation however varies notably between the may october rainy season and the december march dry season fig 2 prior to the 1950s rice farming in the mekong delta was severely limited by water shortages during the dry season in addition rainy season farming was disturbed by the flooding of the mekong river so the only viable option was single cropping with floating rice xuan 1975 hieu 2010 after the 1960s early maturing rice cultivars and irrigation pumps were introduced embankments were constructed to protect paddies from inundation except for flooding during the mid rainy season september november double rice cropping from the dry season to the start of the rainy season became common practice the rate of adoption of double cropping by area in an giang exceeded 90 by the early 1990s otsuka 2014 since the end of the 1990s embankments have been raised and large capacity pumps have been installed to drain rainwater from within the paddies to outside the embankments hieu 2010 tran et al 2018 the infrastructure consisting of raised embankments and drainage pumps is known as a full dike system it has enabled triple cropping which had an adoption rate of 66 2 in this area by 2014 soag 2015 intensification of rice farming in an giang increased rice production in the region but because of increased production costs grower revenues did not commensurately increase thus the provincial government introduced a set of new measures to enhance the efficiency of rice farming chi et al 2013 awd was one of those measures in 2005 the local government in collaboration with irri introduced awd as a measure to lower pumping costs meier 2007 the local government has proactively arranged workshops on new technologies including awd for farmers and has set up model paddies showcasing advanced rice farming techniques all around an giang meier 2007 diangkinay quicho 2013 yamaguchi et al 2016 awd has been steadily adopted by the dry season of 2014 2015 the total area of paddies where awd had been implemented had increased to about 120 000 ha accounting for 52 of the total paddy area and the number of rice farming households that had implemented awd exceeded 120 000 table 1 compared to the situation in the philippines which has approximately 100 000 awd farmers in the entire country despite it being the country where awd diffusion originated lampayan 2013 it can be said that the diffusion of awd in an giang has been successful nevertheless for unknown reasons there were disparities in the rates of awd adoption among the local communities yamaguchi et al 2016 the aim of the present study was to use a geographic information system gis and statistical methods to identify the effects of the irrigation conditions on provincial scale awd dissemination and implementation 3 data and methodology 3 1 awd data the administrative units of vietnam are divided into first second and third tiers 1 provincial level units 2 district level units and 3 administrative units at the communal level world bank 2011 this study refers to the third tier units as communes as of 2014 an giang had 156 communes soag 2015 the an giang plant protection sub department agppsd the agency that assumes the role of introducing agricultural innovations to farmers has published awd adoption statistics for each commune since 2009 we used the data collected for the 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 dry seasons table 1 each commune has at least one agppsd extension agent awd adoption rates have been reported by extension agents through direct observation of irrigation management in each paddy however there are no rigid criteria to confirm whether farmers adopted awd therefore the awd statistics could include accidental errors and outliers thus the present study used nonparametric methods that are robust to outliers xiao et al 2016 we conducted unstructured interviews on awd implementation in an giang with agppsd provincial staff members and extension agents in september 2014 yamaguchi et al 2016 and may and september 2015 yamaguchi et al 2017 we complementarily utilized these qualitative data in the interpretation of the results 3 2 paddy polygons all gis processing in this study was performed with arcgis v 9 3 1 environmental systems research institute inc redlands ca usa paddy polygons within an giang were based on a map 1 50 000 issued by mnrev 2003 and the paddy area of each commune was based on these polygons we performed pearson s correlation coefficient analysis between the estimated paddy area based on the paddy polygons and the paddy area obtained from the agppsd statistics for each commune in the 2014 2015 dry season the results were well correlated fig 3 but the base map was published more than 10 years earlier the annual rate of increase in the provincial paddy area was very low 0 7 y 1 from 2005 to 2015 soag 2015 agppsd 2016 therefore we concluded that the paddy polygons derived from the map published in 2003 corresponded sufficiently well to the current paddy distribution 3 3 paddy classification by elevation based on a topographic map 1 50 000 issued by agppsd we extracted about 4000 elevation data points in 0 1 m increments the map was missing data for two small areas so we complemented the data with elevation point data from the mnrev map 2003 by using the elevation data included in the paddy polygons we created a paddy area elevation model 50 m resolution by inverse distance weighted interpolation we classified paddy areas into six elevation categories 1 m 1 2 m 2 3 m 3 4 m 4 5 m and 5 m and calculated the proportions of paddy area for each category relative to the total paddy area in each commune we performed spearman s rank order correlation coefficient rocc analysis between the awd adoption rate and the proportion of paddy area for each elevation category and within each commune the ppcor package in r kim 2015 was used for the statistical analysis through this analysis we estimated the paddy elevations suitable for awd implementation 3 4 irrigation networks we traced the irrigation networks using channel and river polylines derived from the mnrev map 2003 agppsd staff members stated that most of the major channels were constructed before the 1990s when double cropping was widespread a number of narrow channels however were constructed after 2000 implementation of full dike systems created an opportunity to construct new channels to improve drainage measurement of the extent of full dike system construction would provide a more accurate representation of current channel network development but there are no published statistics for paddy areas enclosed by full dike systems because triple cropping is only feasible in paddies having a full dike system hieu 2010 tran et al 2018 we substituted the data of triple cropping paddy area for each commune information on triple cropping paddy areas has been published only for each district as a whole therefore we estimated commune level data previous studies sakamoto et al 2009 son et al 2014 have distinguished between double and triple cropping paddies in the mekong delta region by using the extended vegetation index evi from modis satellite images three evi peaks appear in triple cropping paddies but evi values are lower in double cropping paddies during the mid rainy season september november fig 4 therefore we were able to estimate the area of triple cropping paddies by focusing on the evi values for the mid rainy season using the mod13q1 data in modis didan et al 2015 we compiled images from the first half of november 2009 2011 2013 and 2014 see table 4 in the results we classified the pixels within paddy polygons as planted or non planted based on the evi thresholds we increased the evi thresholds from 500 to 6000 in increments of 100 and compared the coefficients of determination r 2 between the estimated and statistics based values for triple cropping paddies by district using this information we selected the most consistent evi threshold 3 5 partial rank order correlation coefficient analysis this study aimed to verify the effects of irrigation conditions on awd implementation we used paddy elevation density of channel networks and degree of triple cropping as indicators of irrigation conditions of respective paddies and we added five other variables that might also be correlated with awd diffusion these eight factors are summarized in table 2 we then performed partial rank order correlation coefficient procc analysis on the correlations of these parameters with the awd adoption rate for each commune by using the ppcor package in r procc measures the magnitude and direction of the association between two ranked variables while it controls for the effects of at least one of the other variables sheskin 2000 4 results and discussion 4 1 trends and regional differences in awd diffusion in an giang by 2009 2010 the provincial capital long xuyen already had a high awd adoption rate 80 fig 5 because awd is a knowledge intensive technique diangkinay quicho 2013 and chi et al 2015 reported that government efforts to transmit proper information to farmers had been a significant factor in the diffusion of awd in an giang long xuyen was the first district where agppsd and irri collaborated on awd diffusion in 2005 meier 2007 and it is to be expected that such initial activities would promote awd diffusion there in contrast all of the other districts at that time had awd adoption rates of less than 30 in 2009 2010 there was also wide variation in the awd adoption rates among the communes for example in tri ton district where the awd adoption rate was only 20 the tan tuyen and ba chuc communes had adoption rates of 75 and 62 respectively whereas the ta danh and luong phi communes had rates below 5 from 2005 2009 approximately 500 farmers workshops on agricultural innovation were held in an giang agppsd 2014 however according to agppsd staff members the venues for such workshops tended to be near communes that were convenient in terms of transportation and therefore such communes might show an anomalously high adoption rate however the rates of awd adoption tan tuyen and ba chuc communes decreased sharply in 2014 2015 for unknown reasons because the awd statistics were collected by extension agents without any fixed process or criteria there is the possibility that outliers were generated the local government has held farmers workshops regularly after 2010 agppsd 2014 and such continuous efforts would have raised the overall adoption rate of awd in 2014 2015 moreover it was reported that in an giang in addition to water saving awd had an effect on reducing rice lodging ha et al 2014 lampayan et al 2015 and hence farmers often adopted awd after first hand observation of well grown rice in nearby awd paddies yamaguchi et al 2016 such spillover effects might promote awd diffusion over the whole of an giang however differences in the adoption patterns were still pronounced among the districts and the communes in 2014 2015 4 2 classification of paddies by elevation fig 6 shows the distribution of paddies by elevation approximately half of the paddies were located at an elevation of 1 2 m and 30 were 1 m in elevation fewer than 5 of the an giang paddies were located at 3 m elevation in 2009 2010 there was no significant correlation between the awd adoption rate and the proportions of paddy fields at any elevation range table 3 in 2011 2012 the proportion of paddies at an elevation of 1 2 m was positively correlated with the awd adoption rate but the proportions at the 1 m and 5 m elevations were negatively correlated with the awd adoption rate in 2013 2014 the proportion of paddies at an elevation of 1 2 m was positively correlated with the awd adoption rate and it remained so in 2014 2015 the proportions of paddies at the 1 m 3 4 m 4 5 m and 5 m elevations were all negatively correlated with the awd adoption rate in 2013 2014 and even more so in 2014 2015 diangkinay quicho 2013 conducted a household survey and reported that paddy elevation was not a significant factor affecting awd diffusion in an giang however their study was conducted in 2009 and thus is not inconsistent with the results of the current study according to interviews with agppsd extension agents yamaguchi et al 2017 lower paddies are not suitable for awd due to drainage problems but higher paddies are also not suitable for awd because those paddies often have difficulties in irrigating when channel water levels are low a similar situation exists in the case of the bengal delta where it has been reported that lower paddies were not suitable for awd kurschner et al 2010 in the case of an giang awd implementation would be influenced by the vertical location of each paddy with the elevation of 1 2 m being the most suitable for awd implementation 4 3 estimation of triple cropping paddy area by commune for the 2009 mid rainy season the triple cropping paddy area with the highest coefficient of determination had an estimated evi threshold of 4900 table 4 we determined suitable evi thresholds for 2011 2013 and 2014 based on the r 2 for each year the r 2 values ranged from 0 95 to 0 99 so the estimated triple cropping paddy areas were highly correlated with the statistics based values for each district whereas sakamoto et al 2009 and son et al 2014 extracted paddy areas based on only evi derived phenology and then classified the pixels within these polygons into double or triple cropping our classification was based on the precise paddy polygons extracted from the detailed map 1 50 000 issued by mnrev 2003 therefore the accuracy of our estimations is expected to be better than those of the previous studies however the accuracy of classification at the commune level still needs to be verified which is a task for the future the estimated and statistics based values were well aligned in 2014 but varied in the other years in 2011 and 2013 the triple cropping paddy area was overestimated whereas it was underestimated in 2009 the influence of these discrepancies would be mitigated by using nonparametric statistics in the procc analysis xiao et al 2016 4 4 procc analysis of the awd adoption rate the procc analysis table 5 indicated that the proportion of paddies at a suitable elevation 1 2 m was positively correlated with awd adoption rates in 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 even after controlling for confounding variables but no such correlation was observed for 2009 2010 or 2011 2012 in the bengal delta too it was reported that a 1 m difference in elevation made a difference in the suitability for awd implementation kurschner et al 2010 since delta regions are flat even a slight variation in elevation can influence paddy field hydrology thuy and anh 2015 making a difference in awd adoption patterns takahashi 2013 reported that effective connections between paddies and water channels were significant factors in awd adoption extension agents also mentioned the importance of the channel network in awd adoption yamaguchi et al 2017 and channel density was significantly positively correlated with the awd adoption rate in 2014 2015 although this analysis only included major channels constructed before 2003 this network was still having a significant impact on the awd adoption rate more than a decade later the proportion of triple cropping paddies was more strongly positively correlated with the awd adoption rate than was channel density the full dike systems were originally constructed for mid rainy season rice farming and triple cropping tran et al 2018 but according to agppsd personnel the construction of full dike systems also promoted development of channel networks in order to provide effective drainage of rainwater from within the full dike systems therefore farmers cultivating rice in full dike systems could easily adopt awd there were consistently high positive correlations between the awd adoption rate and communes within the provincial capital from 2009 to 2010 to 2014 to 2015 the relatively higher awd adoption rate in the communes of long xuyen may be explained the area s longer history of awd promotion and dissemination meier 2007 there were significant positive correlations between awd adoption rates and population densities in 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 the availability of household capital influences agricultural mechanization mottaleb et al 2016 and people living in urban areas of an giang have more opportunities for off farm employment and have higher incomes than those in rural areas soag 2015 more farmers may be able to purchase power pumps for rice farming using their off farm income in urban areas thereby promoting awd adoption even though road network development is an enabling factor in agricultural mechanization mottaleb et al 2016 no significant correlation was detected between road density and awd adoption rate there was no significant correlation between awd adoption and area of paddy fields cultivated per household farmers managing large paddy areas in an giang generally use agricultural machinery tsukada 2013 and the rate of power pump ownership is most likely higher among large scale farmers than among small scale farmers however agppsd reported that paddy surface evenness is a factor determining awd implementation by farmers yamaguchi et al 2017 and paddy surface irregularity generally increases with plot size jat et al 2006 therefore the relationship between paddy cultivation area per household and awd adoption appears to be complicated by several other factors there was no significant correlation between the awd adoption rate and the distribution of acid sulfate soil acid sulfate soil is widely distributed in the mekong delta and is detrimental to rice farming moreover aeration of acidic soil increases its deleterious effects on rice growth husson et al 2000 thus paddies with acidic soil would not be conducive to awd implementation agppsd personnel however mentioned that acidic soil liming was widely implemented by the local government in about 2000 and the harmful effects of acid sulfate soil may have been alleviated in addition the acidic soil distribution base map niapp 1990 used in the procc analysis was drawn more than 30 years ago and might not reflect the current acidic soil distribution the procc analysis of 2009 2010 table 5 indicated that only the provincial capital effect was significantly correlated with awd adoption in 2011 2012 however population density also was significantly correlated in 2014 2015 the number of variables significantly influencing the awd adoption rate had increased to five people who adopt an innovation in its early phase of dissemination innovators or early adopters tend to use various media to actively gather information on the innovations tend to be highly educated and tend to earn high incomes rogers 2003 awd information was initially offered in the provincial capital meier 2007 which has lower poverty rates and higher education levels than other regions in the study area soag 2015 furthermore the elevations of most paddies 93 in the provincial capital area are suitable for awd and the channel density is higher 82 m ha 1 than that in other districts 66 m ha 1 therefore conditions were such that awd could readily be accepted in the provincial capital as soon as it was introduced and in fact the provincial capital has had a consistently higher awd adoption rate than the other districts awd requires precise water management and is not feasible on paddies with unfavorable irrigation conditions such as high or low elevations or poor channel connections since the number of farmers who adopted awd has increased from 2009 to 2010 to 2014 2015 these unfavorable irrigation conditions probably gradually became more influential in the awd adoption rate for each commune agppsd personnel stated that the amount of annual precipitation also influenced awd adoption yamaguchi et al 2017 fig 7 shows the monthly water level of the mekong river in the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 dry seasons due to heavy rainfall in december 2013 the water levels were exceptionally high in the 2013 2014 dry season in contrast the scant precipitation between august and november 2014 caused the water level to be unusually low in the 2014 2015 dry season mrc 2015b in december 2014 when the 2014 2015 dry season farming started the water level was about 50 cm lower than it was in 2014 and there was still a 20 cm difference in march when the dry season ended acquiring irrigation water would have been more difficult in most paddies in the 2014 2015 dry season than it was in the 2013 2014 dry season therefore irrigation conditions such as the channel density and degree of triple cropping would have played a significant part in the implementation of awd in 2014 2015 5 conclusion and recommendations although awd is a technique for water saving in paddy rice farming it has been pointed out that paddy irrigation conditions would be an essential factor influencing whether farmers make the decision to adopt awd or not li 2001 loeve et al 2001 in this study we use quantitative data collected from an giang located in the northern part of the mekong delta vietnam to identify significant relationships between awd adoption rates and paddy irrigation conditions although on the whole awd has been smoothly disseminated in an giang there are variations in the diffusion patterns at the district and community levels this study aimed to verify the relationships between awd adoption rates and paddy irrigation conditions at the commune level by using rocc and procc analyses with statistics and gis data our analysis revealed that paddies at higher 3 m and lower 1 m elevations were not ideal for awd implementation due to inconvenient water conditions and thus the proportion paddies at suitable elevation 1 2 m positively influenced awd adoption rate moreover channel density had a positive effect on awd adoption rate in 2015 which was a year with little precipitation there was also positive relation between the rate of triple cropping and awd adoption rate in 2015 in an giang farmers are able to conduct triple cropping only under a full dike systems construction of full dike systems promotes channel network development and therefore triple cropping farmers would more readily implement awd these analyses indicated the significance of irrigation conditions in the implementation of awd raising concerns about how widely awd can be disseminated awd is considered a knowledge intensive technique that is possible to introduce at minimal cost to farmers e g kurschner et al 2010 however efforts to transmit proper information to farmers about awd would not in themselves be sufficient to ensure wide area diffusion of awd and paddies suitable for awd should be carefully considered from the viewpoint of irrigation conditions diffusion efforts should be conducted concurrently with construction of irrigation facilities moreover the significance of the irrigation network in the adoption of awd was emphasized in 2015 a year with low precipitation indicating that in cases where water conditions are very severe farmers would prefer continuous flooding to awd farmers in an giang fear drought in their paddies where water conditions are poor or in years with low precipitation yamaguchi et al 2017 and they would fear cessation of water supply when their paddy soil was unflooded during awd implementation the researchers who developed awd considered continuous flooding of paddies to be a waste of water from the viewpoint of rice plant physiology and thus suggested limiting flooding periods such as in the awd protocol e g humphreys et al 2010 however where irrigation conditions are unreliable farmers tended to keep water in their paddies as a reservoir to hedge against the risk of water shortages from that perspective continuous flooding has significant meaning for farmers when deciding paddies suitable for awd implementation the meaning of continuous flooding in paddies should be reconsidered from diverse perspectives owing to the overall accuracy of statistics and gis data in an giang this study adopted nonparametric analysis methods to alleviate negative influences of accidental errors and outliers thus the quantitative effects of irrigation conditions and other related factors on awd adoption is still unknown therefore a parametric analysis needs to be conducted to scrutinize data quality and to quantify the effects of each respective factor the procc analysis showed that population density was also significantly correlated with awd adoption rates in 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 but the causal relationship between the two remains unknown moreover the data available for the procc analysis was limited in an giang due to lack of sufficient statistics data at the commune level hence the overall picture of the awd diffusion process in an giang remains unexplained it is expected that the whole process of awd implementation will be grasped though detailed household surveys and though the integration of such micro scale studies with macro scale analysis acknowledgments we thank drs yagi kazuyuki and sudo shigeto for their

fertilization 550 600 kg n ha 1 ju et al 2009 tan et al 2017 have been adopted as the key farming practices since the 1980s to achieve high crop yields these had resulted in lower efficiency of irrigation water and nutrient use and increasing greenhouse gas ghg emissions and non point source agricultural pollution yang et al 2015a b huang et al 2017 tan et al 2017 to address these challenges high output low pollution agriculture with highly efficient use of fertilizer and water has been suggested and implemented in recent years by the chinese government and farmers in the country in general and in the ncp in particular chen et al 2014 li et al 2015 many studies have been conducted in the ncp on how to improve water and nutrient use efficiency and to reduce ghg emissions while

mineral and organic fertilizers ding et al 2013 gao et al 2015 optimum nitrogen n fertilization with straw incorporation huang et al 2013a and deep tillage wang et al 2016b these investigations demonstrated promising agronomic and environmental benefits and have been used to make recommendations for better farming practices however most of these studies focused on only one or two of the above mentioned measures in reality farmers need to adopt several measures to improve farming practices and production a key hypothesis is that an integration of the previously mentioned farming practices would allow high productivity efficient utilization of water and fertilizer resources and low ghg emissions the effectiveness of these practices depends highly on edaphic and climatic conditions cai et al 2013 tan et al 2017 and therefore field studies of only one or two seasons duration cannot sufficiently address temporal variations across different farming years thus there is an urgent need to study the efficacy and sustainability of integrated farming management practices through long term field experiments agricultural irrigation is the major source of water consumption in agriculture system in previous evaluations of water utilization the amount directly used for irrigation was used as the main indicator of agricultural irrigation use however this ignores the indirect water consumption from the production chemical fertilizers and other agricultural materials water utilization by the soil and the effect of fertilizer and pesticide pollution on water resources to address these shortcomings hoekstra created the water footprints wf concept hoekstra and hung 2002 the wf is a comprehensive indicator of freshwater use and has three components blue green and grey water the green blue and grey wf components refer to the consumptive use of rainwater surface and groundwater and the freshwater required to assimilate the load of pollutants respectively hoekstra et al 2011 the wf evaluation broadens the connotation of the traditional water resources evaluation system establishes relationships between physical and virtual water and accurately reflects the

a calcareous fluvo aquic clay loam the soil has bulk density of 1 5 g cm 3 ph of 7 7 soil organic matter som content of 18 75 g kg 1 and total n tn content of 1 1 g kg 1 the initial som and tn contents in soil layers was shown in table s1 the growing year was from october of the current to october of the following year daily precipitation and mean air temperature over the experimental period was shown in fig 1 in summary annual precipitation and mean air temperature were 404 mm and 13 1 c respectively in the 1st year 775 mm and 12 2 c in the 2nd year 355 mm and 13 9 c in the 3rd year and 466 mm and 13 7 c in the 4th year 2 2 experiment designing and field management a randomized block design was employed with four replicates for each of the three treatments 1 local farmers conventional practices fp based on the local average rate of n fertilization and irrigation maize straw burning ash was buried into soil wheat straw incorporation buried into soil and rotary tillage 15 cm before wheat sown 2 recommended farming management rec with optimized n fertilization balanced n fertilization and the partial substitution of mineral n with organic manure water saving irrigation wheat and maize straw incorporation buried into soil and deep tillage 25 cm before wheat sown and 3 no n fertilization ck reduced irrigation straw incorporation left on the ground and no tillage each experimental plot had an area of 25 18 m2 detailed n fertilizer and irrigation over the experimental period were presented in table 1 for fp treatment winter wheat was sown in early october and maize was interplanted with wheat at the end of may for rec and ck treatment the cropping system was wheat and maize rotation winter wheat was sown in early october summer maize was planted in the middle of june in the fp treatment urea was applied at 300 kg n ha 1 yr 1 for winter wheat and summer maize respectively the ratio of n as basal fertilizer to top dressing at the shooting stage fertilizer during the winter wheat and summer maize seasons was 1 1 in the rec treatment the amount of fertilizer n applied depended on the crop n requirements and the amount of residual soil nitrate n 0 100 cm present before sowing balanced n fertilization cui et al 2008 in this practice nitrate n was measured before fertilization and the amount of nitrate n fertilizer was calculated as crop n requirement minus the amount of residual soil nitrate n for rec one third of n was applied from broiler manure as basal fertilizer for winter wheat and summer maize and the remaining n was supplied from mineral fertilizer urea for all the three treatments the phosphorus fertilizer triple superphosphate was applied at a rate of 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 for winter wheat and potassium potassium sulphate was applied at a rate of 100 kg k2o ha 1 for summer maize and both were applied as basal fertilizer groundwater well depth 80 m was extracted for irrigation irrigation times were determined according to soil moisture content winter wheat was irrigated 2 4 times and maize 2 3 times 100 mm for each application for fp and 75 mm for each application for rec and ck during the 4 year period pesticide and herbicide were sprayed during the wheat and maize season 2 3 measurement of crop yield and ghg emissions crop yield was measured at harvest in a 6 3 m2 area in each plot n quantity in grains was determined using a cn analyser thermo flash ea 1112 flash 2000 usa ghg n2o and ch4 emissions from 6 october 2011 to 5 october 2015 for all the treatments at each plot were measured using opaque static chambers area 0 5 0 5 m2 the height was adjusted according to the plant growth as described by shi et al 2013 for each measurement five gas samples using a 60 ml polypropylene syringe were taken from the chamber headspace with an interval of 8 min after the chamber was closed the fluxes were measured normally twice a week however following fertilization and or irrigation events they were measured every day for a continuous period of 7 days gas samples were taken between 9 00 11 00 a m yao et al 2015 local time and analysed using a gas chromatograph agilent 7820 a china within 24 h of sampling the fluxes and cumulative emissions were calculated using a linear model and a linear interpolation method respectively hu et al 2013 van der weerden et al 2016 2

significant differences were tested using an analysis of one way anova significant differences were assumed when p 0 05 correlation and linear or nonlinear regression analyses were used to test the relationships between seasonal n fertilizer input and seasonal n2o emissions 3 results 3 1 n utilization groundwater utilization and crop yield for rec treatment the average n inputs during the wheat season maize season and annually were 51 36 and 43 lower respectively than the fp treatment table 1 in the first 2 years the n input in the wheat season was lower than for the other years the average n input in the wheat season over the 4 years was higher than that in the maize season during the wheat season maize season and annual period rec treatment reduced water use by 25 32 and 28 when compared with fp treatment respectively furthermore the rec treatment had similar wheat yields 7 1 0 4 mg ha 1 and maize yields 9 4 0 7 mg ha 1 to that of fp treatment table s2 the ck treatment saved 300 kg n ha 1 per season and had the same water consumption as rec treatment however the wheat and maize yields were 2 5 0 1 and 5 4 0 9 mg ha 1 respectively which was about 64 and 44 lower respectively than that of fp treatment table s2 in all 4 years of the experiment the rec treatment significantly p 0 05 improved anue and iwue when compared with the fp treatment fig 2 a and c the average anue ren and iwue of fp and rec was shown in table s2 the average annual anue ren and iwue of the rec treatment were 79 62 and 41 higher respectively than that of the fp treatment 3 2 n2o and ch4 emissions from 2011 to 2015 the fp treatment cumulative n2o emissions ranged from 0 95 to 1 37 n2o n ha 1 and from 1 89 to 2 81 n2o n ha 1 during the winter and summer maize seasons respectively the fp treatment average n2o emissions were 1 12 0 18 and 2 32 0 47 kg n2o n ha 1 during the winter wheat and summer maize seasons respectively table 2 the rec treatment demonstrated significantly but not consistently lower n2o emissions 39 for the 1st year 37 for the 2nd year 1 for the 3rd year and 31 for the 4th year than the fp treatment table 2 ck treatment decreased n2o emissions significantly by 60 75 and 71 during the wheat season maize season and annual period respectively compared with fp treatment table 2 the n2o emission in the maize season accounted for 63 72 of annual n2o emissions and was significantly higher than that in the wheat season for the 4 year study table 2 during the maize season n2o emissions were significantly lower for the rec treatment than for the fp treatment however during the wheat season the n2o emissions for the rec and the fp treatment were similar thus the differences between fp and rec treatment in annual n2o emissions were mainly caused by the maize season soil acted as a sink for ch4 in all treatments during the study period the cumulative ch4 uptake in the rec and ck treatment were similar in the wheat season and the maize season and were 31 and 37 lower respectively than that of fp treatment table 2 3 3 ngwp and ghgi the net global warming potential i e direct ghg emission via n2o and ch4 and indirect ghg emission from farming operations and inputs fertilization power fuel and pesticide was calculated table s3 most of the ghg originated from fertilizer manufacturing 7 47 electricity used for irrigation 35 67 and field n2o emissions 12 15 the mean annual ghgi of three treatments had significantly difference and followed the sequence of fp ck rec fig 2 b the mean annual ngwp of three treatments had significantly difference and followed the sequence of fp rec ck fig 2d 3 4 water consumption the wfprod was calculated using the wfa method the total wf of fp ree and ck treatment was 18639 13 216 5 and 8076 5 t ha 1 respectively table 3 of these the wfgreen showed no difference in three treatments in the same year because the precipitation was obviously the same for all treatments the wfblue of fp treatment was more than that of rec and ck treatment in every year because the irrigation of rec and ck treatment was 25 less than that of fp treatment the wfgrey followed the sequence fp rec ck because of the different n fertilizer application rates the total wf followed the sequence of fp rec ck wfgreen wfblue and wfgrey accounted for 22 51 30 49 and 39 48 respectively of the total wf the total wfi of the rec treatment was the lowest there was no difference between the fp and ck treatment water consumptions were also calculated using the lca method table 4 the corresponding wfdistrict of the fp rec ck was 5187 8 3688 9 and 3655 9 t ha 1 respectively in this method wfblue was divided into two parts direct water use and indirect water use from farming operations and inputs fertilization power fuel and pesticide the direct wfblue component accounted for more than 95 of the total wfblue the total wfi followed the sequence of ck fp rec 4 discussion 4 1 ghg emissions influenced by farming practices and natural factors the main source of n2o was nitrification and denitrification reactions these reactions are affected by n application combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizer soil moisture and temperature smith et al 2010 ju et al 2011 scheer et al 2012 ding et al 2013 yan et al 2013 chen et al 2014 gao et al 2015 huang et al 2017 in our research we study the influence of different agricultural practices combined actionin on ghg emissions these results indicated that in the maize season n2o emission mainly depends on the n fertilizer application rate the n fertilizer application rate for the fp was greater than that for the rec and ck the maize season n2o emissions for fp treatment was significantly higher than for the rec and ck treatment the n2o emission for the ck treatment was the lowest in the experiment because no n fertilizer was used in the ck treatment tables 1 and 2 the organic fertilizer application in the rec treatment may be one of the reasons for the reduced n2o emissions high soil moisture increases the abundance of nitrite reducers and nirk gene copy numbers of denitrification microbes in soil and these will facilitate an increase in n2o emissions szukics et al 2010 the irrigation amounts were limited in the rec treatment and this may result in decreased n2o emissions compared with the fp treatment there was no significant difference in n2o emissions for fp and rec treatments in the wheat season because nitrification and denitrification reactions were weak in the winter wheat season due to the lower soil temperature in the present study n2o emissions fertilizer n used and power used for irrigation accounted for 87 93 of the positive gwp from all sources in the fp and rec treatments the negative gwp from ch4 uptakes contributed less than 1 of ngwp table s3 these results are similar to those from previous studies huang et al 2013a b gao et al 2015 the ngwp and ghgi of fp treatment was the highest of the three treatments because the n2o emissions and the n fertilizer and water application were higher than for the other treatments table 1 and table s3 the higher n2o emission was attributed to higher n fertilizer and water application scheer et al 2012 huang et al 2017 although the ngwp of the rec treatment was significantly higher than for the ck treatment the ghgi for rec and ck treatments was not significantly different because of the higher crop yield for the rec treatment 4 2 nitrogen and water use efficiency the nue for rec treatment decreased with increased n application rates with a significant negative correlation r2 0 98 p 0 01 similar trends were found in previous studies hartmann et al 2015 ayadi et al 2016 lassaletta et al 2016 for the fp treatment the nue showed variations for different years even when the management practices were the same this pattern was most likely the result of the variation in rainfall patterns and in precipitation amounts fig 1 yan et al 2013 wang et al 2016c the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizer in the rec treatment was another reason for rec treatment having a higher nue than fp treatment the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizer could have increased the nue because the organic fertilizer could have decreased the n loss wei et al 2016 thus as a result of balanced fertilization the n application rate for the rec treatment was less than for the fp treatment the iwue for the rec treatment was higher than that for fp treatment previous studies have shown that limiting irrigation could increase soil water content and maintain crop yields wang et al 2016a the application of organic fertilizer also affects iwue because organic fertilizer can increase the amount of large soil aggregate inhibit soil moisture evaporation and improve the soil water content hati et al 2007 zhao et al 2009 future studies are planned that will analyse the role of soil aggregate at the experimental site the wfa and lca methods were used to calculate water consumption tables 3 and 4 these methods were used to evaluate the water consumption of the wheat maize rotation system and showed that the water consumption of wheat and maize in the rec were 30 and 37 lower respectively than fp xu et al 2013 and liang et al 2018 used wfa method to estimate the water consumption of wheat and maize in ncp the result showed that the total wfi of wheat maize rotation in ncp was 2267 m3 t 1 in the present study the wfi of fp 2281 m3 t 1 determined using the wfa method was similar to the results of xu and liang the results for rec treatment are far less than these values which indicates that good progress is being made in reducing water consumption 4 3 validity analysis of the wfa and lca methods the wfa and lca methods have been widely used for agro ecosystem analysis sun et al 2013 zonderland thomassen and ledgard 2012 herath et al 2013 cao et al 2015 chiu et al 2015 lovarelli et al 2016 in the present study the wf and wfi of the rec was significantly less than that of the fp according to the results of both the wfa and lca methods this illustrates that both methods are able to correctly reflect the change of investment and management modes by a changed wf and wfi the wf and wfi evaluated using the lca method were less than those obtained using the wfa method this was caused by the inconsistent factors under consideration the wfa method takes into account real water consumption wfgreen and wfblue and virtual water consumption wfgrey in the farmland system however the lca method considers the water consumption in the agricultural process without calculating wfgreen and wfgrey the study results showed that the water consumption in the agriculture process was less than 130 t ha 1 in all three treatments using lca method but wfgreen and wfgrey was more than 3000 t ha 1 in fp and rec treatments using wfa method thus the wf evaluated by the lca method was less than that determined by the wfa method xu et al 2013 used the wfa and lca methods to evaluate the wf of wheat farming in the hai yellow huai and yangtze river regions their results showed that when the wfa method was used the wf of wheat farming in southern china huai and yangtze rivers regions was more than in northern china hai and yellow river regions in contrast when the lca method was used the wf in northern china was more than that in southern china xu et al 2013 suggested that when the wfa method was used for agricultural systems it could not reflect the real situation and needed improvement canals et al 2009 2010 suggested that green water use should not ordinarily be taken into account in the lca assessment of water use because these flows are part of the natural hydrological cycle whereby precipitation returns to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration from vegetation to obtain a more comprehensive evaluation researchers are increasingly using several methods including wfa and lca to analyse water resource consumption zonderland thomassen and ledgard 2012 herath et al 2013 lovarelli et al 2016 for example herath et al 2013 used volumetric wf stress weighted wfa and the lca based hydrological water balance method to estimate the water footprint of new zealand wine production liang et al 2018 used two methods wfa and lca to analyse agricultural ecological engineering in northern beijing china each method has its own advantages and limitations the lca method has the advantage of considering indirect water consumption while the wfa has the advantage of taking wfgreen into account which is an important factor affecting the quantity of blue water inconsistencies in these methods have been noted and are being addressed by many researchers and international organizations ridoutt and pfister 2010 jeswani and azapagic 2011 herath et al 2013 lovarelli et al 2016 iso 2014 4 4 overall performance of integrated management practices when compared with the fp treatment the rec treatment successfully decreased n and groundwater application rates while maintaining high crop yields and improved n and groundwater use efficiencies table 1 and table s2 these results are in accord with previous studies carried out in the ncp li et al 2015 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2015 balanced fertilization and reasonable limited irrigation could increase water and nutrient utilization in the soil and maintain high crop yields hartmann et al 2015 wang et al 2016b other studies have suggested that the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers or deep tillage can increase crop yields basir et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 omara et al 2017 as well as maintaining high crop yields the rec treatment can reduce n by 260 kg ha 1 water by 1560 m3 ha 1 and co2 eq emissions by 3 5 mg ha 1 when compared with the fp treatment for one crop rotation cycle there were 25 6 103 ha of cultivated land in huantai county in 2016 data from the huantai agricultural yearbook of 2016 if the rec system was used instead of the fp system reductions of 6 66 106 kg n 39 94 106 m3 water and 89 6 103 mg of co2 eq emissions could be made in one crop rotation cycle in a study of the ncp the n and water application were found to be 468 kg ha 1 and 5790 m3 ha 1 and the ghg emissions were 9 5 mg ha 1 in one crop rotation cycle zhang et al 2017b if the rec system was adopted in the ncp it could reduce n by 128 kg ha 1 27 4 water by 2030 m3 ha 1 34 and ghg emissions by 1 7 mg ha 1 17 9 the cost of n fertilizer and water was 0 96 dollars kg 1 and 0 07 dollars m 3 respectively if rec system was used in the ncp it could reduce 271 62 dollars ha 1 in one crop rotation cycle in addition there is a great potential for mitigating ghg emissions by using integrated management practices first the long term high inputs of carbon residues wheat straw maize straw and organic fertilizer in the rec treatment would increase soil carbon storage and offset part of the positive gwp lu et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 and reduce ghg emissions caused by maize straw burning acreche et al 2013 tubiello et al 2013 second changing the type and storage management of organic fertilizer could also reduce ghg emissions huang et al 2012a 5 conclusions this study showed that an optimized farming practices rec is an environmentally friendly and energy efficient sustainable agriculture farming system in the north china plain balanced n fertilization water saving irrigation and straw incorporation were optimized and integrated in rec farming practices that resulted in reducing n and irrigation water application mitigating ghg emissions and maintaining crop yield beneficial environmental effects higher resource use efficiency and high crop yields were achieved

11256,excessive nitrogen n application and shortage of water are the major obstacles to sustainable agricultural development in the high yielding regions of the north china plain new cropping systems need to be created that use integrated management practices to improve the utilization of nitrogen and water and to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases we conducted a 4 year 2011 2015 field experiment in huantai county using three cropping treatments local farmers conventional practices fp recommended farming management rec and no n fertilization ck the study revealed that the mean annual grain yield of fp and rec was both 16 5 mg ha 1 which was higher than ck 7 9 mg ha 1 in comparison with fp the rec treatment showed n fertilizer and groundwater input reduced by 43 and 28 with increasing of 79 3 and 61 7 of n use efficiency nue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue respectively the rec treatment demonstrated consistently lower n2o emissions 36 on average compared with the fp treatment the annual net global warming potentials of the rec and ck treatments were 37 and 73 lower respectively than that of the fp treatment the water footprint of the rec treatment was 30 the water footprint assessment method to 37 the life cycle assessment method less than that of the fp treatment these results indicate that rec is a promising and feasible treatment for ensuring environmentally friendly and energy efficient sustainable agriculture in the high yielding regions of the north china plain keywords nutrient utilization rate water utilization rate greenhouse gas emissions water footprint 1 introduction the north china plain ncp is one of the most important grain production regions in china produced 67 of nation s wheat and 28 of nation s maize nbsc 2015 and wheat maize rotation is the main cropping system in the region tian et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a in the conventional cropping systems excessive irrigation up to 667 mm yr 1 shi et al 2013 and over fertilization 550 600 kg n ha 1 ju et al 2009 tan et al 2017 have been adopted as the key farming practices since the 1980s to achieve high crop yields these had resulted in lower efficiency of irrigation water and nutrient use and increasing greenhouse gas ghg emissions and non point source agricultural pollution yang et al 2015a b huang et al 2017 tan et al 2017 to address these challenges high output low pollution agriculture with highly efficient use of fertilizer and water has been suggested and implemented in recent years by the chinese government and farmers in the country in general and in the ncp in particular chen et al 2014 li et al 2015 many studies have been conducted in the ncp on how to improve water and nutrient use efficiency and to reduce ghg emissions while maintaining a high crop yield hartmann et al 2015 yan et al 2015 wang et al 2016a meng et al 2017 trials have been carried out on optimized fertilization and irrigation lin et al 2015 a combination of mineral and organic fertilizers ding et al 2013 gao et al 2015 optimum nitrogen n fertilization with straw incorporation huang et al 2013a and deep tillage wang et al 2016b these investigations demonstrated promising agronomic and environmental benefits and have been used to make recommendations for better farming practices however most of these studies focused on only one or two of the above mentioned measures in reality farmers need to adopt several measures to improve farming practices and production a key hypothesis is that an integration of the previously mentioned farming practices would allow high productivity efficient utilization of water and fertilizer resources and low ghg emissions the effectiveness of these practices depends highly on edaphic and climatic conditions cai et al 2013 tan et al 2017 and therefore field studies of only one or two seasons duration cannot sufficiently address temporal variations across different farming years thus there is an urgent need to study the efficacy and sustainability of integrated farming management practices through long term field experiments agricultural irrigation is the major source of water consumption in agriculture system in previous evaluations of water utilization the amount directly used for irrigation was used as the main indicator of agricultural irrigation use however this ignores the indirect water consumption from the production chemical fertilizers and other agricultural materials water utilization by the soil and the effect of fertilizer and pesticide pollution on water resources to address these shortcomings hoekstra created the water footprints wf concept hoekstra and hung 2002 the wf is a comprehensive indicator of freshwater use and has three components blue green and grey water the green blue and grey wf components refer to the consumptive use of rainwater surface and groundwater and the freshwater required to assimilate the load of pollutants respectively hoekstra et al 2011 the wf evaluation broadens the connotation of the traditional water resources evaluation system establishes relationships between physical and virtual water and accurately reflects the ownership of and demand for water resources the water footprints assessment wfa method is used to calculate water resources in agro ecosystems hoekstra et al 2011 the life cycle assessment lca method is also used in agro ecosystems liang 2009 liang et al 2018 ridoutt and pfister 2010 suggested that the wf should be expressed as a single index h2o eq in the same manner that the carbon footprint is expressed as co2 eq a water stress index has also been introduced to compare the water consumption impacts and water scarcity among different countries and regions jeswani and azapagic 2011 both the lca and wfa methods can be used to compare the water resource utility of different products services and systems zonderland thomassen and ledgard 2012 herath et al 2013 lovarelli et al 2016 in the present study to study the environmental problems caused by over application of fertilizer in the ncp region a four year from 2011 to 2015 field experiment was carried out in an intensively farmed wheat maize production area in the ncp the aim of the study was to analyse the effects of integrated management practices on crop production n and water utilization and ghg emission reduction 2

irrigation wheat and maize straw incorporation buried into soil and deep tillage 25 cm before wheat sown and 3 no n fertilization ck reduced irrigation straw incorporation left on the ground and no tillage each experimental plot had an area of 25 18 m2 detailed n fertilizer and irrigation over the experimental period were presented in table 1 for fp treatment winter wheat was sown in early october and maize was interplanted with wheat at the end of may for rec and ck treatment the cropping system was wheat and maize rotation winter wheat was sown in early october summer maize was planted in the middle of june in the fp treatment urea was applied at 300 kg n ha 1 yr 1 for winter wheat and summer maize respectively the ratio of n as basal fertilizer to top dressing at the shooting stage fertilizer during the winter wheat and summer maize seasons was 1 1 in the rec treatment the amount of fertilizer n applied depended on the crop n requirements and the amount of residual soil nitrate n 0 100 cm present before sowing balanced n fertilization cui et al 2008 in this practice nitrate n was measured before fertilization and the amount of nitrate n fertilizer was calculated as crop n requirement minus the amount of residual soil nitrate n for rec one third of n was applied from broiler manure as basal fertilizer for winter wheat and summer maize and the remaining n was supplied from mineral fertilizer urea for all the three treatments the phosphorus fertilizer triple superphosphate was applied at a rate of 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 for winter wheat and potassium potassium sulphate was applied at a rate of 100 kg k2o ha 1 for summer maize and both were applied as basal fertilizer groundwater well depth 80 m was extracted for irrigation irrigation times were determined according to soil moisture content winter wheat was irrigated 2 4 times and maize 2 3 times 100 mm for each application for fp and 75 mm for each application for rec and ck during the 4 year period pesticide and herbicide were sprayed during the wheat and maize season 2 3 measurement of crop yield and ghg emissions crop yield was measured at harvest in a 6 3 m2 area in each plot n quantity in grains was determined using a cn analyser thermo flash ea 1112 flash 2000 usa ghg n2o and ch4 emissions from 6 october 2011 to 5 october 2015 for all the treatments at each

polypropylene syringe were taken from the chamber headspace with an interval of 8 min after the chamber was closed the fluxes were measured normally twice a week however following fertilization and or irrigation events they were measured every day for a continuous period of 7 days gas samples were taken between 9 00 11 00 a m yao et al 2015 local time and analysed using a gas chromatograph agilent

significant differences were tested using an analysis of one way anova significant differences were assumed when p 0 05 correlation and linear or nonlinear regression analyses were used to test the relationships between seasonal n fertilizer input and seasonal n2o emissions 3 results 3 1 n utilization groundwater utilization and crop yield for rec treatment the average n inputs during the wheat season maize season and annually were 51 36 and 43 lower respectively than the fp treatment table 1 in the first 2 years the n input in the wheat season was lower than for the other years the average n input in the wheat season over the 4 years was higher than that in the maize season during the wheat season maize season and annual period rec treatment reduced water use by 25 32 and 28 when compared with fp treatment respectively furthermore the rec treatment had similar wheat yields 7 1 0 4 mg ha 1 and maize yields 9 4 0 7 mg ha 1 to that of fp treatment table s2 the ck treatment saved 300 kg n ha 1 per season and had the same water consumption as rec treatment however the wheat and maize yields were 2 5 0 1 and 5 4 0 9 mg ha 1 respectively which was about 64 and 44 lower respectively than that of fp treatment table s2 in all 4 years of the experiment the rec treatment significantly p 0 05 improved anue and iwue when compared with the fp treatment fig 2 a and c the average anue ren and iwue of fp and rec was shown in table s2 the average annual anue ren and iwue of the rec treatment were 79 62 and 41 higher respectively than that of the fp treatment 3 2 n2o and ch4 emissions from 2011 to 2015 the fp treatment cumulative n2o emissions ranged from 0 95 to 1 37 n2o n ha 1 and from 1 89 to 2 81 n2o n ha 1 during the winter and summer maize seasons respectively the fp treatment average n2o emissions were 1 12 0 18 and 2 32 0 47 kg n2o n ha 1 during the winter wheat and summer maize seasons respectively table 2 the rec treatment demonstrated significantly but not consistently lower n2o emissions 39 for the 1st year 37 for the 2nd year 1 for the 3rd year and 31 for the 4th year than the fp treatment table 2 ck treatment decreased n2o emissions significantly by 60 75 and 71 during the wheat season maize season and annual period respectively compared with fp treatment table 2 the n2o emission in the maize season accounted for 63 72 of annual n2o emissions and was significantly higher than that in the wheat season for the 4 year study table 2 during the maize season n2o emissions were significantly lower for the rec treatment than for the fp treatment however during the wheat season the n2o emissions for the rec and the fp treatment were similar thus the differences between fp and rec treatment in annual n2o emissions were mainly caused by the maize season soil acted as a sink for ch4 in all treatments during the study period the cumulative ch4 uptake in the rec and ck treatment were similar in the wheat season and the maize season and were 31 and 37 lower respectively than that of fp treatment table 2 3 3 ngwp and ghgi the net global warming potential i e direct ghg emission via n2o and ch4 and indirect ghg emission from farming operations and inputs fertilization power fuel and pesticide was calculated table s3 most of the ghg originated from fertilizer manufacturing 7 47 electricity used for irrigation 35 67 and field n2o emissions 12 15 the mean annual ghgi of three treatments had significantly difference and followed the sequence of fp ck rec fig 2 b the mean annual ngwp of three treatments had significantly difference and followed the sequence of fp rec ck fig 2d 3 4 water consumption the wfprod was calculated using the wfa method the total wf of fp ree and ck treatment was 18639 13 216 5 and 8076 5 t ha 1 respectively table 3 of these the wfgreen showed no difference in three treatments in the same year because the precipitation was obviously the same for all treatments the wfblue of fp treatment was more than that of rec and ck treatment in every year because the irrigation of rec and ck treatment was 25 less than that of fp treatment the wfgrey followed the sequence fp rec ck because of the different n fertilizer application rates the total wf followed the sequence of fp rec ck wfgreen wfblue and wfgrey accounted for 22 51 30 49 and 39 48 respectively of the total wf the total wfi of the rec treatment was the lowest there was no difference between the fp and ck treatment water consumptions were also calculated using the lca method table 4 the corresponding wfdistrict of the fp rec ck was 5187 8 3688 9 and 3655 9 t ha 1 respectively in this method wfblue was divided into two parts direct water use and indirect water use from farming operations and inputs fertilization power fuel and pesticide the direct wfblue component accounted for more than 95 of the total wfblue the total wfi followed the sequence of ck fp rec 4 discussion 4 1 ghg emissions influenced by farming practices and natural factors the main source of n2o was nitrification and denitrification reactions these reactions are affected by n application combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizer soil moisture and temperature smith et al 2010 ju et al 2011 scheer et al 2012 ding et al 2013 yan et al 2013 chen et al 2014 gao et al 2015 huang et al 2017 in our research we study the influence of different agricultural practices combined actionin on ghg emissions these results indicated that in the maize season n2o emission mainly depends on the n fertilizer application rate the n fertilizer application rate for the fp was greater than that for the rec and ck the maize season n2o emissions for fp treatment was significantly higher than for the rec and ck treatment the n2o emission for the ck treatment was the lowest in the experiment because no n fertilizer was used in the ck treatment tables 1 and 2 the organic fertilizer application in the rec treatment may be one of the reasons for the reduced n2o emissions high soil moisture increases the abundance of nitrite reducers and nirk gene copy numbers of denitrification microbes in soil and these will facilitate an increase in n2o emissions szukics et al 2010 the irrigation amounts were limited in the rec treatment and this may result in decreased n2o emissions compared with the fp treatment there was no significant difference in n2o emissions for fp and rec treatments in the wheat season because nitrification and denitrification reactions were weak in the winter wheat season due to the lower soil temperature in the present study n2o emissions fertilizer n used and power used for irrigation accounted for 87 93 of the positive gwp from all sources in the fp and rec treatments the negative gwp from ch4 uptakes contributed less than 1 of ngwp table s3 these results are similar to those from previous studies huang et al 2013a b gao et al 2015 the ngwp and ghgi of fp treatment was the highest of the three treatments because the n2o emissions and the n fertilizer and water application were higher than for the other treatments table 1 and table s3 the higher n2o emission was attributed to higher n fertilizer and water application scheer et al 2012 huang et al 2017 although the ngwp of the rec treatment was significantly higher than for the ck treatment the ghgi for rec and ck treatments was not significantly different because of the higher crop yield for the rec treatment 4 2 nitrogen and water use efficiency the nue for rec treatment decreased with increased n application rates with a significant negative correlation r2 0 98 p 0 01 similar trends were found in previous studies hartmann et al 2015 ayadi et al 2016 lassaletta et al 2016 for the fp treatment the nue showed variations for different years even when the management practices were the same this pattern was most likely the result of the variation in rainfall patterns and in precipitation amounts fig 1 yan et al 2013 wang et al 2016c the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizer in the rec treatment was another reason for rec treatment having a higher nue than fp treatment the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizer could have increased the nue because the organic fertilizer could have decreased the n loss wei et al 2016 thus as a result of balanced fertilization the n application rate for the rec treatment was less than for the fp treatment the iwue for the rec treatment was higher than that for fp treatment previous studies have shown that limiting irrigation could increase soil water content and maintain crop yields wang et al 2016a the application of organic fertilizer also affects iwue because organic fertilizer can increase the amount of large soil aggregate inhibit soil moisture evaporation and improve the soil water content hati et al 2007 zhao et al 2009 future studies are planned that will analyse the role of soil aggregate at the experimental site the wfa and lca methods were used to calculate water consumption tables 3 and 4 these methods were used to evaluate the water consumption of the wheat maize rotation system and showed that the water consumption of wheat and maize in the rec were 30 and 37 lower respectively than fp xu et al 2013 and liang et al 2018 used wfa method to estimate the water consumption of wheat and maize in ncp the result showed that the total wfi of wheat maize rotation in ncp was 2267 m3 t 1 in the present study the wfi of fp 2281 m3 t 1 determined using the wfa method was similar to the results of xu and liang the results for rec treatment are far less than these values which indicates that good progress is being made in reducing water consumption 4 3 validity analysis of the wfa and lca methods the wfa and lca methods have been widely used for agro ecosystem analysis sun et al 2013 zonderland thomassen and ledgard 2012 herath et al 2013 cao et al 2015 chiu et al 2015 lovarelli et al 2016 in the present study the wf and wfi of the rec was significantly less than that of the fp according to the results of both the wfa and lca methods this illustrates that both methods are able to correctly reflect the change of investment and management modes by a changed wf and wfi the wf and wfi evaluated using the lca method were less than those obtained using the wfa method this was caused by the inconsistent factors under consideration the wfa method takes into account real water consumption wfgreen and wfblue and virtual water consumption wfgrey in the farmland system however the lca method considers the water consumption in the agricultural process without calculating wfgreen and wfgrey the study results showed that the water consumption in the agriculture process was less than 130 t ha 1 in all three treatments using lca method but wfgreen and wfgrey was more than 3000 t ha 1 in fp and rec treatments using wfa method thus the wf evaluated by the lca method was less than that determined by the wfa method xu et al 2013 used the wfa and lca methods to evaluate the wf of wheat farming in the hai yellow huai and yangtze river regions their results showed that when the wfa method was used the wf of wheat farming in southern china huai and yangtze rivers regions was more than in northern china hai and yellow river regions in contrast when the lca method was used the wf in northern china was more than that in southern china xu et al 2013 suggested that when the wfa method was used for agricultural systems it could not reflect the real situation and needed improvement canals et al 2009 2010 suggested that green water use should not ordinarily be taken into account in the lca assessment of water use because these flows are part of the natural hydrological cycle whereby precipitation returns to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration from vegetation to obtain a more comprehensive evaluation researchers are increasingly using several methods including wfa and lca to analyse water resource consumption zonderland thomassen and ledgard 2012 herath et al 2013 lovarelli et al 2016 for example herath et al 2013 used volumetric wf stress weighted wfa and the lca based hydrological water balance method to estimate the water footprint of new zealand wine production liang et al 2018 used two methods wfa and lca to analyse agricultural ecological engineering in northern beijing china each method has its own advantages and limitations the lca method has the advantage of considering indirect water consumption while the wfa has the advantage of taking wfgreen into account which is an important factor affecting the quantity of blue water inconsistencies in these methods have been noted and are being addressed by many researchers and international organizations ridoutt and pfister 2010 jeswani and azapagic 2011 herath et al 2013 lovarelli et al 2016 iso 2014 4 4 overall performance of integrated management practices when compared with the fp treatment the rec treatment successfully decreased n and groundwater application rates while maintaining high crop yields and improved n and groundwater use efficiencies table 1 and table s2 these results are in accord with previous studies carried out in the ncp li et al 2015 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2015 balanced fertilization and reasonable limited irrigation could increase water and nutrient utilization in the soil and maintain high crop yields hartmann et al 2015 wang et al 2016b other studies have suggested that the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers or deep tillage can increase crop yields basir et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 omara et al 2017 as well as maintaining high crop yields the rec treatment can reduce n by 260 kg ha 1 water by 1560 m3 ha 1 and co2 eq emissions by 3 5 mg ha 1 when compared with the fp treatment for one crop rotation cycle there were 25 6 103 ha of cultivated land in huantai county in 2016 data from the huantai agricultural yearbook of 2016 if the rec system was used instead of the fp system reductions of 6 66 106 kg n 39 94 106 m3 water and 89 6 103 mg of co2 eq emissions could be made in one crop rotation cycle in a study of the ncp the n and water application were found to be 468 kg ha 1 and 5790 m3 ha 1 and the ghg emissions were 9 5 mg ha 1 in one crop rotation cycle zhang et al 2017b if the rec system was adopted in the ncp it could reduce n by 128 kg ha 1 27 4 water by 2030 m3 ha 1 34 and ghg emissions by 1 7 mg ha 1 17 9 the cost of n fertilizer and water was 0 96 dollars kg 1 and 0 07 dollars m 3 respectively if rec system was used in the ncp it could reduce 271 62 dollars ha 1 in one crop rotation cycle in addition there is a great potential for mitigating ghg emissions by using integrated management practices first the long term high inputs of carbon residues wheat straw maize straw and organic fertilizer in the rec treatment would increase soil carbon storage and offset part of the positive gwp lu et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 and reduce ghg emissions caused by maize straw burning acreche et al 2013 tubiello et al 2013 second changing the type and storage management of organic fertilizer could also reduce ghg emissions huang et al 2012a 5 conclusions this study showed that an optimized farming practices rec is an environmentally friendly and energy efficient sustainable agriculture farming system in the north china plain balanced n fertilization water saving irrigation and straw incorporation were optimized and integrated in rec farming practices that resulted in reducing n and irrigation water application mitigating ghg emissions and maintaining crop yield beneficial environmental effects higher resource use efficiency and high crop yields were achieved

11257,uptake of irrigation scheduling tools by new zealand nz farmers has remained static for many years and some researchers consider the use of linear tech transfer approaches as the main reason for this to understand the controls and drivers that influence the uptake of these tools and to evaluate the effectiveness of a co innovation approach in improving their tools uptake a team of biophysical hydrologists and social researchers undertook a pilot study in an irrigation scheme in the south island of nz co innovation offers a multi directional multi level multi actor approach in which input from stakeholders is valued in every part of the process from problem definition to solution adoption in this study we focused on the adaptive aspect of co innovation that allows stakeholders to periodically review their actions and respond to it in a way that is inclusive others views and reflective of feedback received the pilot study activities were analysed retrospectively to develop a systemic view to the implementation of a co innovation based multi stakeholder hydrology project while implementing a co innovation approach five chronologically distinct yet overlapping phases emerged in the project 1 concept development where the hydrologists came up with the research idea and seed concept 2 trust building where researchers hydrologists and social interacted with key on farm stakeholders in developing and implementing the research idea into a pilot field study 3 knowledge synthesis where researchers collected on farm biophysical and behavioural data to record practice change 4 extended outreach where stakeholders including researchers devised pathways to sustain the lessons learned and practices changed and disseminated the learnings to the wider irrigation community and 5 project legacy where the researchers after the development of the seed concept into a practice change evolved an exit strategy apart from core research activities such as data collection on irrigation water use and changes in irrigation scheduling practices each one of the five phases included actions that were unique to that phase as well as to achieving the wider pilot study goal of improving water use efficiency this paper discusses the learnings from these phases including insights and key identifiers and indicators of pilot study progression during each phase which may serve as an example to other biophysical studies that propose to employ co innovation based multi stakeholder approach keywords irrigation weather forecast co innovation co learning stakeholder management 1 introduction our wellbeing economy and environment will all benefit from greater application of new scientific knowledge by businesses government agencies communities and other end users as well as uncovering new opportunities science is central in brokering the balance between the use of our rich but finite natural resources for the benefit of new zealanders today and kaitiakitanga 2 2 a kaitiaki is a guardian and the process and practices of protecting and looking after precious natural resources land and water are referred to as kaitiakitanga of this inheritance for the future joyce 2015 page 4 this statement from new zealand s minister of science and innovation reflects the need to focus the science research agenda towards practical stakeholder relevant science application a sentiment expressed by gibbons 2000 hessels and van lente 2008 and many other researchers in the past research projects increasingly face not only intellectual but also ethical social economic and political criteria for science evaluation gibbons et al 1994 gibbons 2000 context sensitive stakeholder inclusive mode 2 research has been put forward as an alternative to traditional mode 1 research where problems are set and solved in a context governed by the largely academic interests of a specific community gibbons 2000 pg 159 yarwood 2015 and williams et al 2015 analysed the role of innovation in new zealand nz primary sector agriculture horticulture and forestry and concluded that innovation often end up below the radar failing to generate learning about the conditions under which science investments deliver impact technological innovations fail when they fail to account for ethical social management organisational and institutional barriers many of which may lead to unexpected impacts smits 2002 for example when the successful drip irrigation technology from israel was imported to sub saharan africa it failed as researchers failed to consider the african context and suitably alter the technology garb and friedlander 2014 the absence of infrastructure to transfer pressurised water through the irrigation system clogging of filters by sediment laden water and chewing of driplines by wild animals all contributed to technological failure in the sub saharan africa garb and friedlander 2014 friedlander et al 2013 in the context of complex problems the idea of innovation as a linear process of technology transfer or a linear sequence of production diffusion and adoption has received considerable criticism leeuwis and aarts 2011 boyce et al 2018 alternative ways of thinking such as the innovation system approach and agricultural innovation systems emphasize the need to consider not only the technological e g tools or software but also the social economic and political contexts of innovation e g policies cultural norms consumer preferences and others furthermore these alternative approaches highlight the importance and influence of people and organisations within this innovation context and their inter actions röling 2009 van mierlo et al 2010 klerkx et al 2012 botha et al 2014 accordingly a system innovation is seen as a complex unpredictable process which lies beyond the control of small groups such as scientists as practiced in mode 1 research van mierlo et al 2013 a large selection of co innovation based case studies are available in nederlof et al 2011 and the world bank 2007 a few examples of primary sector based studies that are similar in context or setting to the pilot study described in this paper are reviewed here to highlight the challenges to co innovation approach albicette et al 2017 who examined the ways of improving the sustainability of livestock family farms in uruguay considered co innovation at three different levels farm region and institution at a farm level they reported co innovation practices increased the net income by 56 at a region level co innovation enabled a participatory approach to planning monitoring and evaluation and at an institutional level co innovation strengthened inter institutional networks and development of a common vision dogliotti et al 2014 applied a co innovation approach to adopting agricultural practices that were identified by researchers as economically profitable and environmentally sustainable in fourteen family farms in south uruguay and reported that co innovation resulted in improved farm economy per capita family income increased by 50 in 13 out of 14 farms and reduced soil erosion by 50 based on a comparative study of five nz based primary sector projects vereijssen et al 2017a concluded that co innovation requires an adaptable mind set rather than strict adherence to one approach srinivasan et al 2017 applied a co innovation approach to improve water use efficiency in an irrigation scheme in nz pilot study described in this paper and concluded that on farm water management decisions are influenced by both on farm controls and off farm stakeholder values and perspectives particularly those linked to environment economy and regulations srinivasan et al 2017 focussed on the on farm implementation aspect of co innovation process while the work described here covers the entire journey from the inception of a research idea to its implementation and exit strategy of co innovation in practice park et al 2015 analysed the nz based apple futures programme that was tasked to develop and implement practices to growing ultra low residue fruit they concluded that the programme was a success in terms of adaptation and impact williams et al 2015 credited the co innovation approach used in apple futures programme elevated stakeholders to one of participants in a genuine partnership thereby enhancing and sustaining the impact delivered by agricultural r d investments not all research programmes gain from impact oriented stakeholder centred co innovation principles context is important for the application of co innovation vereijssen et al 2017b evaluated the applicability of co innovation principles in a fundamental bio protection research programme addressing challenges to potato production and concluded that where basic science knowledge gaps are substantial and the time required to address them are significantly large setting up impact expectations may adversely affect the programme even in projects where co innovation principles are appropriate it is important to recognize all perspectives and practices when disseminating a technology or an approach to address a problem the tendency might be to identify those failing to adopt as failures however a study of farmers in ireland indicated that even those who were regarded as laggards had adopted innovative practices but not those recommended by the researchers and extension specialists and hence should not be discarded as failures leeuwis 1989 the objective of co innovation is to be inclusive of all perspectives and practices klerkx and nettle 2013 summarised that implementation of a co innovation approach means alignment of different mind sets and competencies creation of incentives leading to linkage building and collaboration and adaptation of research extension and innovation agenda setting and funding mechanisms to enable innovation co production it has been acknowledged that co innovation in practice is context specific and the practitioners need to be adaptive klerkx et al 2010 neef and neubert 2011 in our study we focused on the adaptive aspect termed as adaptive mind set of stakeholders by vereijssen et al 2017a earlier of co innovation and how it can be implemented in a hydrological project that previously has been dominated by tech transfer approaches innovation focused science projects face limited time frames thus there is a need for planned action various principles frameworks and guidelines have been developed to understand and facilitate innovation such as guidance of the search and socio technical landscapes e g geels 2002 wieczorek and hekkert 2012 however these theoretical discourses are too abstract for biophysical researchers and practitioners who work on a more practical level with end users and stakeholders and have real wicked problems to solve using an example pilot study this paper attempts to provide practical insights into the implementation of co innovation principles in a hydrology project the paper builds on a five year long water use efficiency wue pilot study in which hydrologists worked together with social researchers farmers industry professionals business communication and marketing managers regulators and irrigation scheme managers to enable pro active irrigation management here we discuss the stakeholders involved actions performed e g on farm monitoring of irrigation farmer workshops resources employed and insights gained during the pilot study and link those back to theoretical discourses to innovation management our objective in this paper was to draw lessons from the wue pilot study that can be applied in planning and implementing other similar innovation focused biophysical studies therefore the focus of this paper is on analysing the co innovation activities that shaped and guided the pilot study rather than on analysing the biophysical data collected during the project however key biophysical results from the wue project are available in srinivasan et al 2017 and vereijssen et al 2017a 2 methodology 2 1 water use efficiency pilot study in 2012 a team of hydrologists and social researchers launched a pilot study to examine the irrigation water use efficiency in a river based irrigation scheme the waimakariri irrigation scheme wis located in the south island of nz fig 1 previous investigations by srinivasan and duncan 2012 had highlighted poor irrigation scheduling practices irrigation applied based on supply than on soil or crop demand in the scheme owing largely to unreliable irrigation supply from the river the irrigation scheme draws water from the waimakariri river and supplies to over 240 shareholder farmers covering a command area of 44 000 ha via a network of open channels the total irrigated area is 18 000 ha wis holds the resource consent to abstract water from the river and thus has to abide by abstraction restrictions imposed by the local regional council environment canterbury ecan the irrigation season extends from september to april and most irrigation restrictions occur between january through march when river flows fall below abstraction limit srinivasan and duncan 2012 the current irrigation reliability is 74 and wis is developing plans to build a storage reservoir which would increase the reliability to 91 for the pilot study five farms 4 grazed dairy and one cropping were chosen within the scheme fig 1a grazed pastoral dairy farms dominate the scheme the pilot farms were intentionally chosen to represent the variability in weather and soil characteristics across the scheme srinivasan and duncan 2012 reported that the gradients in rainfall and evaporation across the scheme would result in gradients in irrigation demands across the scheme fig 1a similarly the soil plant available water varies widely across the scheme fig 1b owing to these gradients in weather and soil one irrigation scheduling practice would not fit all the wue pilot study was based on the hypothesis that on farm irrigation scheduling and thus wue could be improved by providing farmers with real time access to current demand soil and or crop water demand and future supply 2 to 15 day rainfall information in each pilot farm a rain gauge and soil moisture sensor were installed under one spray irrigator the most popular irrigation system in the region the pilot farms were provided with real time on line access to rainfall irrigation and soil moisture and soil temperature data collected on farm in order to increase the learning opportunities between pilot study farmers the project researchers with farmers consent allowed viewing of others data thus each pilot study farmer had an opportunity to see others irrigation decisions and practices in real time farmers were also sent a daily email updating last 7 days of rainfall irrigation soil moisture soil temperature estimated penman potential evapotranspiration and measured drainage from lysimeters installed in one of the pilot farms in addition farmers were provided with short term 2 6 and 15 day weather forecast which included forecast rainfall amount intensity and timing high resolution 12 km grid scale published every 6 h forecasting provided predictions on 2 to 6 day weather conditions climatological summaries 1972to present were used to derive 15 day forecast based on current demand and forecast supply farmers could schedule irrigation irrigation decisions were left to the farmers and the researchers did not make any recommendations between 2012 and 2015 soil moisture measurements were made at 20 cm depth to assess the irrigation demand however following stakeholder interactions see section 2 2 for more on these interactions in 2015 at each pilot farm a profile soil moisture sensor was installed adjacent to the existing soil moisture sensor the profile soil moisture sensor measured soil moisture and soil temperature at every 10 cm interval from the surface to 80 cm down the soil profile using the top four depths 0 40 cm depth to pasture root zone farmers assessed irrigation demand when to start the irrigation soil moisture increases at 70 to 80 cm depth immediately following irrigation events were indicative of over irrigation resulting in drainage more on the stakeholder interaction and changes to soil moisture sensor technology are available in section 3 3 each irrigation season ended with a workshop referred to as farmer workshop hereafter where all pilot farmers came together to reflect on the season discuss their irrigation decisions and make plans for the upcoming year reinforcing the out in the field character of the pilot study the farmer workshops were held within the irrigation scheme area initially in one of the pilot farms then in a local community hall as the size of the stakeholder group grew during the first year may 2013 the farmer workshop was attended by pilot study farmers irrigation scheme managers and researchers the following year may 2014 in addition to year 1 attendees ecan representatives and members of the local catchment management committee who advise ecan on resource management were invited to attend ecan or environment canterbury is the regional government agency that manages and regulates the use of natural resources in the region before the year 2 farmer workshop the pilot study farmers and researchers discussed the list of stakeholders to be invited as the stakeholder group grew over subsequent years suggestions for invitees came from the wider group at the year 3 farmer workshop may 2015 additional participants included non pilot study farmers from within wis area managers from neighbouring irrigation schemes and the project funders government officials during years 4 and 5 may 2016 and 2017 respectively farm based industry organisations and farmers from neighbouring irrigation schemes were invited to the farmer workshop during the entire pilot study the pilot farmers and researchers had equal access to all biophysical and weather forecast data individual farm visits enabled the researchers to train the farmers on data interpretation e g how to optimally combine current soil moisture conditions and forecast rainfall predictions to schedule an irrigation event or how to include the risk associated with weather forecast into irrigation scheduling and to learn from the farmers about the ease and usefulness of data provided these visits also helped the researchers to identify opportunities to improve the data presentation in line with farmers preferences through organisational niwa first and last authors host organisation meetings the researchers made sure that the provision of data and tools to participants was in line with organisational strategies these meetings also fostered discussions with the niwa business team about the translation of research findings into marketable products the crown research institutes cris of nz such as those involved in the pilot study are the largest group of dedicated science research agencies cris in addition to conduct scientific research are also expected to be financially viable by producing commercial marketable products developed from their research 2 2 systems perspective and co innovation approach the pilot project was aimed at improving irrigation scheduling at the farm level however on farm decisions are not made in isolation from their wider economic regulatory social technical geographical and natural context i e the system turner et al 2014 srinivasan et al 2017 while tech transfer is primarily focussed on individuals making on farm decisions and adoption process co innovation places greater emphasis on collectives and systems that requires new forms of interaction organisation and agreement between stakeholders leeuwis and van den ban 2004 based on schut et al 2015 we identified three roles emerging for stakeholders in the pilot study 1 providing a perspective to environmental sustainability economic feasibility and cultural and social acceptability of solutions developed through the co innovation process 2 as a collective becoming aware of interdependencies and thus promoting a collective action and 3 supporting and sustaining the solutions developed by actively involving themselves in the decision making process stakeholders provide a reality check on problem identified and solution developed the project researchers took several steps to establish rapport with the stakeholders specifically farmers by going out to the farms to talk to the pilot farmers in their own environment rather than communicating through telephone e mail or inviting the participants for meetings at their research office based on conversations with on and off farm stakeholders pilot study farmers irrigation scheme managers regulators irrigation industry professionals the researchers analysed the irrigation water management landscape from farm scale to regional and national scales srinivasan et al 2017 this system perspective aligned with the application of a co innovation approach which promotes the inclusion of non scientific stakeholders their opinions and knowledge boyce et al 2018 efforts to build relationship with stakeholders were guided by a social researcher third author of the paper who took on the role of a reflexive monitor she worked with the biophysical scientists in fostering an ongoing reflection of relationships between stakeholders activities results outputs outcomes and goals a reflexive monitor helps to maintain a problem focus and design the project to include new insights or contextual e g market policy changes van mierlo et al 2010 rijswijk et al 2015 the co innovation approach used in the pilot study was guided by nine principles described by nederlof et al 2011 in this project an adaptation of these principles by coutts et al 2017 was used the nine principles are listed in table 1 the principles are designed to be inclusive of multiple stakeholders and multiple perspectives right from problem definition to solution implementation 2 3 data collection and analysis data collection for this paper included data compiled from a variety of sources that were retrospectively analysed to describe the pilot study progression pilot study related meeting notices from the outlook calendar of the research leader first author were retrieved and analyzed to develop a timeline a qualitative content analysis of e mails agendas and minutes provided additional information on the content purpose and outcome of these meetings after each farmer workshop all attendees were asked to fill out a feedback form on the pilot study a sample feedback form is included in fig 2 these forms were used to evaluate the pilot study progression from stakeholders perspective due to the interactive and evolutionary nature of the pilot study it is impossible to attribute individual actions to study outcomes however by combining different sources of data with the experiences of the researchers inferences were made about how actions influenced each other actions and actors we also compiled a list of outcomes and outputs from the pilot study the following nine key aspects inspired by innovation systems literature van mierlo et al 2010 wieczorek and hekkert 2012 were used to evaluate the pilot study progression 1 objective 2 strategy 3 activity action 4 partners actors 5 resources 6 insights 7 value proposition 8 outcomes and 9 outputs each one of these categories was matched against each pilot study phase outcomes were distinguished from outputs as some results outcomes such as establishment of trust among participants did not generate a tangible output 3 results analysis of data compiled against the nine aspects listed in the last section provided an insight into the evolution of the pilot study through its life we identified five chronologically ordered phases that represented the focus of the pilot study and its evolution table 2 the overarching study goal improving water use efficiency through increased use of weather forecast remained unchanged across the phases see section 3 1 for more on the study goal however the specific objectives strategies actions and stakeholders varied between phases even though the phases were identified individually they often overlapped in time and sometimes over actions for example some of the ideas on pilot study legacy fifth and last phase such as how to sustain the knowledge resources and momentum developed during the pilot study beyond its life were already envisioned during the concept development phase first phase by exploring options to design an irrigation scheduling tool however actions did not occur until the legacy phase similarly trust building and knowledge synthesis were spread across the phases an indication of their deep routed and perennial nature 3 1 concept development phase the first phase started with the inception of the research idea to ended with the implementation of the pilot study earlier srinivasan and duncan 2012 had identified that on farm wue in wis could be improved by carefully managing the frequency and depth of irrigation applications building on this finding and with niwa s weather forecasting tools and expertise in mind in 2012 the pilot study leader first author developed a research idea wherein he envisioned an irrigation scheduling practice that accounts for both current soil crop water demand and short term rainfall forecast the project leader termed this as a justified irrigation practice as opposed to just in case which is a supply driven irrigation practice or just in time which is a demand driven practice justified irrigation accounts for both demand and supply simultaneously while there was no direct stakeholder input in conceiving or conceptualising it the research idea itself emerged from previous stakeholder interactions in formal conversations with farmers in the wis region weather forecasters at niwa and analysis of historical irrigation water use data a key insight during this phase was the realisation of potential value of combining weather forecast and current soil moisture status data and sharing them with farmers in real time to enable an informed irrigation decision with a concept conceived stakeholder engagement was initiated in line with host organisation s mission of enabling sustainable resource management and delivering innovative practical products and services niwa s business communication and marketing teams were engaged in a conversation they saw the market potential for weather related products for primary sector support from the niwa s internal team increased the pilot study s potential for organisational support and therefore its continuity a critical factor in the legacy phase the research idea also fitted with the co innovation approach envisioned in a national agricultural innovation programme called the primary innovation pi pi was a nz government funded five year research initiative that was launched in october 2012 to examine the value of co innovation in improving the uptake of science tools and concepts within nz s primary sector the first author was a part of the pi programme the pi programme directly linked research and its uptake by stakeholders the co innovation approach employed by pi was new to niwa hydrologists thus becoming a part of the pi team brought several benefits firstly the pi team provided support and knowledge from social innovation perspective secondly becoming part of a national programme such as pi brought visibility to the wue message promoted in the pilot study lastly alignment with pi led to additional funding to the pilot study with organisational science and governmental support established the researchers started the pilot study set up such a pilot study needs on farm measurements to quantify current wue and a robust communication channel that enables a meaningful timely data sharing with the stakeholders because of a prior relationship the researchers identified wis as the suitable host for the pilot study even though it was recognised that irrigation scheduling tools are poorly adopted by farmers in wis owing to poor supply reliability srinivasan and duncan 2012 addition of weather forecast was perceived as a catalyst for change for the selection of pilot farms the researchers sought input from the wis manager one of the pilot farmers identified was also a part of the wis board this was considered beneficial for his position could be helpful in engaging the scheme management helping with decisions that could influence the wider scheme and providing insight into scheme s vision for the future this highlighted that expanding the results of the research to the wider agricultural community was envisioned at the start of the project though actions did not occur until the fourth and fifth phases sections 3 4 and 3 5 respectively 3 2 trust building phase after the initial pilot study set up the researchers visited the potential pilot farmers individually the researchers explained the use of weather forecast for irrigation management and sought farmers consent to participate in the pilot study these visits allowed the researchers to share their research idea and vision listen to farmers feedback and ideas and understand their constraints to irrigation scheduling failure of innovations conceived by researchers with little understanding of stakeholders problems and priorities has been well documented röling 1988 leeuwis 1989 van veldhuizen et al 1997 kulecho and weatherhead 2005 belder et al 2007 friedlander et al 2013 and others it could also be speculated that some of the earlier technology transfer approaches to irrigation management might have failed to fully account for farmers understanding and use of technology building trust with the pilot farmers was considered crucial for pilot study delivery and continuity the researchers clearly articulated their aim to learn from the farmers positioning themselves as equals rather than superiors in terms of knowledge or power refer to co innovation principles 1 to 4 table 1 and that scientific and experiential knowledge from all stakeholders would be valued and weighted equally on farm telemetered data funded by the pilot study helped the researchers to quantify and test their hypothesis that irrigation scheduling has been poor in the scheme the on farm measurements helped to increase the trust in research findings the on farm data also provided an opening to engage with the farmers and other stakeholders at individual meetings and group workshops for instance the on farm data quantified the existence of the rainfall gradient across the scheme which matched the experiential knowledge held by the farmers this synchronisation of scientific data and experiential knowledge strengthened the trust in the validity of data collected associated science and eventually of the researchers enabling pilot farmers to see data on others irrigation practice proved to be very beneficial for stakeholder engagement firstly it enabled a transparency and openness to the engagement process which led to trust between the farmers and researchers secondly prior knowledge of others irrigation practices enriched discussions around irrigation decisions at the farmer workshops and ways of assessing and addressing risks associated with weather forecast finally the prior awareness of others practices eliminated any feeling of intimidation or finger pointing at the farmer workshop based on the data shared there was a free exchange of ideas and observations at the farmer workshops this sharing also highlighted the level of trust developing between the pilot farmers and their desire to learn from each other very early on the pilot study researchers started building relationship with other off farm stakeholders such as the irrigation scheme management industry professionals and regulators ecan this helped the pilot study group to stay abreast of upcoming changes to the wider irrigation landscape e g ecan s policy change relating to irrigation scheduling practices wis plan to build storage to increase reliability however all these stakeholders e g ecan were not yet invited to take part in the pilot or participate in the farmer workshops the researchers believed that the introduction of such off farm stakeholders may have a detrimental value until a trust had been established between the researchers pilot study farmers and irrigation scheme hence the introduction of off farm stakeholders was delayed until the third phase the reflexive monitor guided the process of identifying relevant stakeholders and the timing of their introduction to the wider pilot study team 3 3 knowledge synthesis phase the third phase was focussed on knowledge synthesis and learning on farm biophysical data collected since december 2012 played a key role in furthering the interaction among the stakeholders at the farmer workshops the pilot study farm participants gave their perspective on the data collected their interpretation and the resulting practice change and the pilot study in general at the year 1 farmer workshop farmers discussed the need for more focus on simultaneous management of irrigation drainage and nutrients this discussion was based on the imminent regulatory limits on drainage and more stringent nutrient management regulations this resulted in a key change in the pilot study focus from irrigation management to irrigation and drainage management at the farmer workshops the stakeholders discussed the need to integrate water and nutrient management while the water use efficiency practices improved nutrient use efficiency e g refraining from nutrient applications before forecast rainfall events no specific measurements of the fate and transport of nutrients in the pilot farms were made pilot study resources constraints did not allow this happen however the researchers by bringing in nutrient management specialists to the farmer workshops bridged the gap as much as possible two key insights from farmer workshops further enhanced the focus of the pilot study in this phase at the second farmer workshop in 2014 in response to additional focus on drainage at the first year farmer workshop the researchers presented drainage data in depth units for all pilot farms similar to other inputs such as rainfall and irrigation drainage was estimated based on measured on farm rainfall and irrigation data estimated potential evaporation from a local weather station within the scheme fig 1a and published plant available water fig 1b a simple water balance provided an estimate of farm specific drainage while farmers could relate to that they found it difficult to compare pilot farm performance the researchers based on their conversations with the pilot farmers developed an approximate monetary value for irrigation and rainfall drainage irrigation drainage was valued at 2 per ha for every millimetre of irrigation water lost this included pumping cost additional cost to refill leached soil nutrients and lost cost from the non availability of land for grazing owing to saturated soils from over irrigation rainfall drainage was valued at 1 50 per ha per millimetre of drainage as there was no pumping cost involved at the third farmer workshop in 2015 the presentation of drainage in monetary terms generated a robust discussion among the stakeholders including the benefit cost ratio from using weather forecast for irrigation the pilot study researchers emphasised that the dollar values were based on empirical and experiential knowledge of stakeholders the key insight of presenting drainage in monetary terms was later used in the irrigation scheduling tool irrimet developed at the end of the pilot study see irrimet tool in section 3 5 also the first author in an effort to capture the economic benefits of weather forecast for irrigation and drainage management successfully developed another proposal for government funding in 2016 see justified irrigation in section 3 5 the second key insight came at the third year 2015 farmer workshop at this workshop when the researchers presented the likely drainage based on soil moisture exceeding soil saturation at 20 cm depth location where soil moisture was being measured until then the stakeholder group discussed the need for collecting more concrete evidence on potential drainage rather than predicting based on one soil moisture measurement at 20 cm depth by then the pilot parmers had already been made aware of the economic value of drainage at this workshop while drainage lysimeter provided measurement of drainage data for one of the pilot farms owing to their high cost they were ruled out as an option for other pilot farms in response to this discussion at the workshop the researchers introduced the use of a profile soil moisture sensor that measured soil moisture and soil temperature at 10 cm intervals over a depth of 80 cm surface down to 80 cm vertically down the soil profile at 8 locations these sensors were installed in all pilot farms to provide additional evidence on drainage soil moisture changes at 70 80 cm depth following irrigation events provided real time feedback to the farmers of their practice this introduced another learning moment in the pilot study learning among stakeholders was one of the primary objective of the wue pilot study when the data sharing among the pilot farmers was enabled the objective was for farmers to observe each other s behaviour and learn however as the pilot farms were not located next to each other and a significant biophysical gradient existed between the farms the individual irrigation practices were not easily transferrable or comparable between farms even though the researchers realised this gap in the second year of the project they could not fill the gap because of lack of financial resources to instrument additional farms the significant shifts in the pilot study focus in this phase typify co innovation such shifts were possible because of flexible pilot study design and willingness of stakeholders to alter their actions to align with emerging landscape and needs many of which would not have been possible in a tech transfer setting 3 4 extended outreach phase wider societal impact was one of the goals of the pilot study however efforts to increase pilot study outreach did not occur until the fourth phase the preceding phases focussed on developing and testing of concepts and tools which enabled the pilot study researchers to approach wider farming community with a validated tool firstly the pilot study researchers started sharing the daily email update with the wider wis farming community this increased the awareness of practices possible in the scheme the number of daily email recipients steadily increased from 5 pilot farms only to more than 25 pilot farms and their neighbouring farms by this phase in this phase the researchers pro actively engaged regulators other irrigation schemes in the region and science partners in the pilot study by inviting them to meetings and farmer workshops the researchers also made several presentations to various groups industry regulators science community and farm shows highlighting the results and learnings from the pilot study and invited the pilot farmers to present their experience it was believed that pro actively communicating about the pilot study could lead to identifying new knowledge partners and opportunities e g knowledge transfer to other regions and influencing the irrigation management landscape such as informing policies to manage on farm water use in this phase the researchers were also approached by outsiders such as the beef and lamb new zealand who were interested in exploring options for improving wue these agencies and others were attracted to the fact that a farm based approach to improving water use efficiency has been shown to work and thus were interested in transferring the learnings to their farmer groups answering these requests for information was time and resource demanding and none of these outreach activities were allowed to derail the engagement with the pilot study stakeholders 3 5 project legacy phase as the science funding for the pi programme ended in september 2017 the pilot study moved into a legacy setting phase by 2016 while the pilot farms and on farm data collection were specific to a region the learnings are applicable to wider irrigation community the pilot study researchers looked beyond the five year project in search of a suitable exit strategy that would sustain the learning momentum and positive proactive behavioural changes to water management achieved the pilot study legacy phase was dominated by efforts at four different levels 1 development of online irrigation scheduling products such as irrimet and farmmet by niwa distilling the knowledge learning and insight from the pilot study 2 an increase in science outputs an important goal of scientific research 3 wis inviting proposals to implement the wue practices across the entire scheme based on their learning from the pilot study and 4 based on insights and experience gained in the wue project the niwa researchers started developing a new research proposal for government funding the new proposal justified irrigation was funded by the nz ministry of business innovation and employment in october 2016 for five years to examine and quantify the economic impact of using weather forecast for irrigation management the search for a suitable exit strategy meant that the project outputs should be at least partly independent of the skills and actions of individual researchers so far we can identify certain indicators that the moment of exit is near first scientific outputs have been developed 4 referred journal papers one referred science report 5 conference proceedings 7 conference presentations 3 popular publications 2 media interviews and a number of presentations second the scientific background of practical technological tools are in order and third external parties to the pilot study becoming aware of the tools available to improve wue e g beef and lamb new zealand the engagement of niwa s marketing and communication team early in the project provided that experience initial contact with potential investors in decision support tools was initiated by the researchers however these tasks had been taken over by those with more experience in this field nevertheless time will tell more specifically the success of the exit phase posing more interesting questions for further analysis tool development consumed significant resources during this phase experiences and key insights from past studies reported in the literature were used in developing the tools irrimet and farmmet stakeholders recognized that the usability of research generated would be enhanced when translated into products and decision support tools that can be easily accessed by others jakku and thorburn 2010 and cerf et al 2012 recommended the use of participatory approach and conceptual framework in co designing and developing such decision support tools for improved stakeholder uptake sumberg et al 2013 emphasised the need to include systematic user feedback in designing successful tools the first four phases of wue project provided the much needed stakeholder input for the tool design and development the tool was designed to respond to three levels of management questions for users operational should i irrigate today tactical could i trade my stored water today and still have water to irrigate next week and strategic should i upgrade my irrigation infrastructure these three levels correspond to three time frames short medium and long of planning one of the pilot farmers during the study by the way of strategic investment expanded the irrigated area by 10 but did not invest on additional water for irrigation and scheduling irrigations based on weather forecast and soil moisture demand 4 discussion 4 1 trust building bayne et al 2016 who investigated the structural and relation support necessary to support learning and knowledge uptake in the nz forestry sector concluded that the key factor in enhancing uptake and learning is requirement of an environment that encourages relationship building particularly trust building between parties although trust might not generally be seen as a research output it is crucial for a project s success and continuity fisher 2013 harris and lyon 2013 it creates attention and involvement while trust could not be imposed in the wue pilot study on farm biophysical measurements alignment of scientific data and experiential knowledge of weather gradient helped with fostering trust srinivasan and elley 2018 also by remaining inclusive to wider stakeholder group and sharing the on farm data with the wider pilot study group enhanced the trust based on the stakeholders input at the farmer workshop the researchers were able to alter their research question from when to start the irrigation irrigation management to when to start and stop the irrigation irrigation and drainage management this flexibility and ability to incorporate stakeholders feedback into the pilot study greatly increased the level of trust among the stakeholders 4 2 planning flexibility and adaptability in co innovation projects the wue pilot study provides insight into planning and advancing a co innovation based biophysical project planning ahead e g identifying key stakeholders identifying market opportunities at the start of the project can help the researchers decide on when and how to involve various stakeholders and how to foster on going learning to improve the project and its chance to succeed in a time bound project such as the wue pilot study spanned from 2011 to 2016 planning ahead helped the researchers in phasing the tasks as well as set up milestones that could be reported back on to the funders however such planning needs to be flexible enough to eliminate interference with the co innovation process itself based on a comparative study of five co innovation projects in nz vereijssen et al 2017a concluded that as co innovation practices are context specific the project leadership needs to have the willingness capacity and ability to adapt project scope and or research approach to maintain stakeholder engagement thus co innovation always includes elements of redesign encompassing new processes of learning and negotiation and hence should not be looked at merely as dissemination leeuwis 2004 pg 12 several researchers have acknowledged that the key challenge to practitioners of co innovation approach is to organise interventions that are adaptive and flexible and induce learning opportunities and emergent experiences that can be incorporated into ongoing activities leeuwis 2004 such interventions may require new forms of monitoring evaluation and process planning leeuwis 2004 interventions can neither be planned nor be enforced on stakeholders also interventions demand flexibility in project planning in case wue pilot study the introduction of profile soil moisture sensor to manage drainage and irrigation simultaneously and adding a monetary value to drainage proved to be successful interventions however the researchers did not intervene with irrigation scheduling decisions 4 3 pros and cons of co innovation the extensive stakeholder inclusion in co innovation projects has its own challenges stakeholder engagement is demanding on time and resources it requires working with different groups understanding their perspectives and suitably adapting the project goals including a reflexive monitor helped to spot opportunities for including relevant stakeholders and adapting the project to fit the evolving context better e g inclusion of representatives from the nz ministry of primary industries stakeholder inclusion can be a strategy to legitimize the project demonstration of the project s added value increase stakeholders attention and trigger a sense of ownership and eventual uptake leeuwis and van den ban 2004 stakeholder inclusion can also complicate a research project for example in terms of competition for resources or when a conflict or power struggle arises leeuwis and van den ban 2004 schut et al 2014 for instance financial limitations and contractual obligations with the funding agency meant that the wue pilot study could not expand to include a water quality component despite strong signals from stakeholders however the co innovation approach can lead to important benefits lending weight to other findings that stakeholder involvement is associated with increased knowledge resources networks and creativity leeuwis and van den ban 2004 moreover new collaborations can become fruitful in the future or through other projects beyond the scope of this project jakku and thorburn 2010 in the case of wue efficiency the wider stakeholder group enabled interactions with larger farm groups e g beef and lamb new zealand in a tech transfer based science process such interactions would have occurred via publications and presentations unlikely reaching the desired end users the farmers 4 4 boundary objects for stakeholder engagement and project focus park et al 2015 while examining the success of a co innovation based horticultural programme in nz concluded that clear drivers and clear goals with measureable targets strong leadership from industry regular communication among stakeholders a pilot study demonstrating the concept extensive monitoring and evaluation and a trusted science team are pivotal ingredients in securing adoption the study examined by park et al 2015 fell within the transition zone between tech transfer to co innovation hence includes elements of both by setting up a pilot study and sharing data in real time the wue pilot study team enabled an immediate science impact the profile soil moisture sensor allowed farmers to see the effectiveness and efficiency of individual irrigation events irrimet was also designed to provide a retrospective view of the irrigation season to allow stakeholders reflect on their irrigation practices and learn the philosophy of learning by doing allowed the pilot farmers to learn from their actions as well as from others including a monetary value to their practices e g conversion of drainage into dollars enhanced the stakeholder awareness and encouraged them to act when a large stakeholder group is engaged it is important that a robust communication is maintained and that stakeholders are engaged van dijk et al 2017 who used practices guided by co innovation principles in an animal welfare project in the netherlands concluded that co innovation is stakeholder network specific and thus practitioners seldom have sight of output making project planning challenging tools such as logical framework that trace the project evolution are greatly useful in unveiling this link botha et al 2017 boundary objects such as pilot studies decision support systems and on farm monitoring data are useful in maintaining project focus and purpose boundary objects after carlile 2002 and turnhout 2009 enable a shared understanding between the researchers and stakeholders and help communicating complex science and management concepts according to cerf et al 2012 such boundary objects represent three points of view cognitive problem description as stakeholders see it functional ways of producing information to arrive at a solution and operational implementation of the solution boundary objects provide opening as well as purpose for stakeholder engagement one of the key insights in the wue pilot study was that identifying and establishing boundary objects early on is critical to the engagement process 4 5 role management in a co innovation setting stakeholders particularly biophysical researchers are expected to don multiple roles experts in science facilitators of interactions translators of data into usable information catalyst for change lobbyist for action seekers and gatherers of resources to sustain the momentum generated and designers developers and disseminators of solutions and products sumberg et al 2013 schut et al 2014 wittmayer and schapke 2014 botha et al 2017 in the wue pilot study as the phases evolved and contexts changed the roles kept evolving the farmers from initially being passive receivers of data later actively participated in the project by reflecting on their irrigation practices and altering appropriately during the initial phases the pilot study researchers were focused on identifying stakeholders and setting up the pilot study but towards the legacy phase they were working on ways of disseminating the wue practices and learnings to the wider irrigation community when regulators ecan and industry e g beef and lamb new zealand were involved from the third phase the stakeholder group became truly inter disciplinary specifically the legacy phase demanded a wide range of non biophysical skills including commercial and marketing insights as well as resources human time and financial to reach out the wider farming community therefore an important insight is that project biophysical researchers should acknowledge the limits in their knowledge and involve people such as social researchers and marketing experts such inclusions demand that the biophysical researchers develop an insight into the future application of their research findings beyond science publications and presentations it is imperative as smits 2002 emphasized that biophysical researchers need to understand and embrace the reality that changes to science context can result in changes to their researchers roles responsibilities and relationships that need redefining schut et al 2014 pointed out that in all their engagements researchers need to explore and balance their role that enhance credibility relevance and legitimacy of science applied and knowledge developed 4 6 alignment with changing and emerging contexts inherently innovation is messy chaotic complex and unpredictable and quite incompatible with the idea of planning leeuwis and van den ban 2004 co innovation processes are best suited for conditions where management of a public good resource is in discussion in such contexts uncertainty and unpredictability are abound knowledge is often obscured by competing and contentious claims and problems are complex multi dimensional and multi level with multiple stakeholders and perspectives giller et al 2008 schut et al 2014 fielke and srinivasan 2018 additionally a changing landscape such as imminent regulations to water and nutrient management development of storage options to improve irrigation reliability or increasing concerns around the economic viability and environmental sustainability of farming in general can influence the context giller et al 2008 suggested that researchers to better understand and anticipate changing landscape need to embed themselves in policy processes to invoke locally relevant strategies such strategies would help to tailor research questions approaches and solutions co innovation processes are dynamic and context specific as context changes the outcomes of a co innovation process may also change context change could at many different levels biophysical setting e g construction of irrigation ponds to improve reliability regulatory setting e g changes to nutrient management regulations and economic e g water foot printing public perception to irrigation management and cultural and recreational values placed on water resources in the wue pilot study the researchers by including the irrigation scheme management were able to foresee the development of storage reservoir in the scheme however the influence of reservoir on irrigation management in wis is yet to be explored as the reservoir has not been in place this reservoir when completed would increase the reliability of irrigation and enhance the usefulness of weather forecast the implementation process needs to recognize that improved reliability would come at a financial cost to the scheme and the farmers also the availability of water on demand may change stakeholders current perspective to the rarity of the resource the project did not focus on water trading as it is not happening in this scheme yet however storage may open trading options which might open up other opportunities for the farmers scheme and region similarly through their interactions with the regulators the researchers learned about the upcoming regulations limiting irrigation induced drainage and embedded the same in their pilot study however this pilot study did not include the next logical step of nutrient management due to funding limitation these emerging contexts are the likely to define the boundaries to wue in years to come 5 conclusion the road towards a successful innovation project can be unpredictable and uncontrollable nevertheless innovation projects clearly have a start middle and an end this wue pilot study provides an insight into the co innovation process and how it can be applied a key purpose for this paper is to assist biophysical researchers in understanding the challenges to a co innovation process concept development trust building knowledge synthesis and outreach that happened throughout the pilot study reinforced the perspective that innovation is non linear the practitioners of co innovation have to be responsive to changes to cultural environmental economic social geographical policy and biophysical contexts in a dynamic environment continuous engagement with stakeholders means continuous monitoring evaluation reflection and re prioritisation of actions and objectives however implementation of such action research demands a flexible approach from funding agencies contractual obligations with funders may limit flexibility however by including them as a stakeholder in a co innovation process the funders can be provided first hand knowledge of stakeholder needs and any required changes to the research directions for instance in the wue pilot study when the definition of water use efficiency expanded to include both irrigation and drainage management the researchers were flexible enough to respond to the changing context however when stakeholders desired to combine nutrient and irrigation management the researchers could not respond positively owing to resource financial limitation and contractual obligation co innovation approach unlike tech transfer approaches demand a higher degree both in quantity and quality of stakeholder interaction such interactions often lead to changes in project context the project activities level of stakeholder engagement and objectives however the boundary objects such as pilot study on farm biophysical monitoring decision support tools and others act as reminders of the original study goal and provide a focus and purpose to the project finally co innovation can be time demanding and resource intensive outcomes such as trust take time and energy to build and sustain biophysical researchers applying co innovation approach are expected to perform multiple roles as a project evolves as well as have the ability flexibility and capacity to alter project focus as context demands biophysical researchers need to acknowledge and accept that a transition from technology oriented to system oriented approaches requires changes in organisational mandates incentives procedures and funding as well as investments in exchange of experiences learning and capacity development schut et al 2015 pg 1 acknowledgements we acknowledge the

11257,uptake of irrigation scheduling tools by new zealand nz farmers has remained static for many years and some researchers consider the use of linear tech transfer approaches as the main reason for this to understand the controls and drivers that influence the uptake of these tools and to evaluate the effectiveness of a co innovation approach in improving their tools uptake a team of biophysical hydrologists and social researchers undertook a pilot study in an irrigation scheme in the south island of nz co innovation offers a multi directional multi level multi actor approach in which input from stakeholders is valued in every part of the process from problem definition to solution adoption in this study we focused on the adaptive aspect of co innovation that allows stakeholders to periodically review their actions and respond to it in a way that is inclusive others views and reflective of feedback received the pilot study activities were analysed retrospectively to develop a systemic view to the implementation of a co innovation based multi stakeholder hydrology project while implementing a co innovation approach five chronologically distinct yet overlapping phases emerged in the project 1 concept development where the hydrologists came up with the research idea and seed concept 2 trust building where researchers hydrologists and social interacted with key on farm stakeholders in developing and implementing the research idea into a pilot field study 3 knowledge synthesis where researchers collected on farm biophysical and behavioural data to record practice change 4 extended outreach where stakeholders including researchers devised pathways to sustain the lessons learned and practices changed and disseminated the learnings to the wider irrigation community and 5 project legacy where the researchers after the development of the seed concept into a practice change evolved an exit strategy apart from core research activities such as data collection on irrigation water use and changes in irrigation scheduling practices each one of the five phases included actions that were unique to that phase as well as to achieving the wider pilot study goal of improving water use efficiency this paper discusses the learnings from these phases including insights and key identifiers and indicators of pilot study progression during each phase which may serve as an example to other biophysical studies that propose to employ co innovation based multi stakeholder approach keywords irrigation weather forecast co innovation co learning stakeholder management 1 introduction our wellbeing economy and environment will all benefit from greater application of new scientific knowledge by businesses government agencies communities and other end users as well as uncovering new opportunities science is central in brokering the balance between the use of our rich but finite natural resources for the benefit of new zealanders today and

for the future joyce 2015 page 4 this statement from new zealand s minister of science and innovation reflects the need to focus the science research agenda towards practical stakeholder relevant science application a sentiment expressed by gibbons 2000 hessels and van lente 2008 and many other researchers in the past research projects increasingly face not only intellectual but also ethical social economic and political criteria for science evaluation gibbons et al 1994 gibbons 2000 context sensitive stakeholder inclusive mode 2 research has been put forward as an alternative to traditional mode 1 research where problems are set and solved in a context governed by the largely academic interests of a specific community gibbons 2000 pg 159 yarwood 2015 and williams et al 2015 analysed the role of innovation in new zealand nz primary sector agriculture horticulture and forestry and concluded that innovation often end up below the radar failing to generate learning about the conditions under which science investments deliver impact technological innovations fail when they fail to account for ethical social management organisational and institutional barriers many of which may lead to unexpected impacts smits 2002 for example when the successful drip irrigation technology from israel was imported to sub saharan africa it failed as researchers failed to consider the african context and suitably alter the technology garb and friedlander 2014 the absence of infrastructure to transfer pressurised water through the irrigation system clogging of filters by sediment laden water and chewing of driplines by wild animals all contributed to technological failure in the sub saharan africa garb and friedlander 2014 friedlander et al 2013 in the context of complex problems the idea of innovation as a linear process of technology transfer or a linear sequence of production diffusion and adoption has received considerable criticism leeuwis and aarts 2011 boyce et al 2018 alternative ways of thinking such as the innovation system approach and agricultural innovation systems emphasize the need to consider not only the technological e g tools or software but also the social economic and political contexts of innovation e g policies cultural norms consumer preferences and others furthermore these alternative approaches highlight the importance and influence of people and organisations within this innovation context and their inter actions röling 2009 van mierlo et al 2010 klerkx et al 2012 botha et al 2014 accordingly a system innovation is seen as a complex unpredictable process which lies beyond the control of small groups such as scientists as practiced in mode 1 research van mierlo et al 2013 a large selection of co innovation based case studies are available in nederlof et al 2011 and the world bank 2007 a few examples of primary sector based studies that are similar in context or setting to the pilot study described in this paper are reviewed here to highlight the challenges to co innovation approach albicette et al 2017 who examined the ways of improving the sustainability of livestock family farms in uruguay considered co innovation at three different levels farm region and institution at a farm level they reported co innovation practices increased the net income by 56 at a region level co innovation enabled a participatory approach to planning monitoring and evaluation and at an institutional level co innovation strengthened inter institutional networks and development of a common vision dogliotti et al 2014 applied a co innovation approach to adopting agricultural practices that were identified by researchers as economically profitable and environmentally sustainable in fourteen family farms in south uruguay and reported that co innovation resulted in improved farm economy per capita family income increased by 50 in 13 out of 14 farms and reduced soil erosion by 50 based on a comparative study of five nz based primary sector projects vereijssen et al 2017a concluded that co innovation requires an adaptable mind set rather than strict adherence to one approach srinivasan et al 2017 applied a co innovation approach to improve water use efficiency in an irrigation scheme in nz pilot study described in this paper and concluded that on farm water management decisions are influenced by both on farm controls and off farm stakeholder values and perspectives particularly those linked to environment economy and regulations srinivasan et al 2017 focussed on the on farm implementation aspect of co innovation process while the work described here covers the entire journey from the inception of a research idea to its implementation and exit strategy of co innovation in practice park et al 2015 analysed the nz based apple futures programme that was tasked to develop and implement practices to growing ultra low residue fruit they concluded that the programme was a success in terms of adaptation and impact williams et al 2015 credited the co innovation approach used in apple futures programme elevated stakeholders to one of participants in a genuine partnership thereby enhancing and sustaining the impact delivered by agricultural r d investments not all research programmes gain from impact oriented stakeholder centred co innovation principles context is important for the application of co innovation vereijssen et al 2017b evaluated the applicability of co innovation principles in a fundamental bio protection research programme addressing challenges to potato production and concluded that where basic science knowledge gaps are substantial and the time required to address them are significantly large setting up impact expectations may adversely affect the programme even in projects where co innovation principles are appropriate it is important to recognize all perspectives and practices when disseminating a technology or an approach to address a problem the tendency might be to identify those failing to adopt as failures however a study of farmers in ireland indicated that even those who were regarded as laggards had adopted innovative practices but not those recommended by the researchers and extension specialists and hence should not be discarded as failures leeuwis 1989 the objective of co innovation is to be inclusive of all perspectives and practices klerkx and nettle 2013 summarised that implementation of a co innovation approach means alignment of different mind sets and competencies creation of incentives leading to linkage building and collaboration and adaptation of research extension and innovation agenda setting and funding mechanisms to enable innovation co production it has been acknowledged that co innovation in practice is context specific and the practitioners need to be adaptive klerkx et al 2010 neef and neubert 2011 in our study we focused on the adaptive aspect termed as adaptive mind set of stakeholders by vereijssen et al 2017a earlier of co innovation and how it can be implemented in a hydrological project that previously has been dominated by tech transfer approaches innovation focused science projects face limited time frames thus there is a need for planned action various principles frameworks and guidelines have been developed to understand and facilitate innovation such as guidance of the search and socio technical landscapes e g geels 2002 wieczorek and hekkert 2012 however these theoretical discourses are too abstract for biophysical researchers and practitioners who work on a more practical level with end users and stakeholders and have real wicked problems to solve using an example pilot study this paper attempts to provide practical insights into the implementation of co innovation principles in a hydrology project the paper builds on a five year long water use efficiency wue pilot study in which hydrologists worked together with social researchers farmers industry professionals business communication and marketing managers regulators and irrigation scheme managers to enable pro active irrigation management here we discuss the stakeholders involved actions performed e g on farm monitoring of irrigation farmer workshops resources employed and insights gained during the pilot study and link those back to theoretical discourses to innovation management our objective in this paper was to draw lessons from the wue pilot study that can be applied in planning and implementing other similar innovation focused biophysical studies therefore the focus of this paper is on analysing the co innovation activities that shaped and guided the pilot study rather than on analysing the biophysical data collected during the project however key biophysical results from the wue project are available in srinivasan et al 2017 and vereijssen et al 2017a 2 methodology 2 1 water use efficiency pilot study in 2012 a team of hydrologists and social researchers launched a pilot study to examine the irrigation water use efficiency in a river based irrigation scheme the waimakariri irrigation scheme wis located in the south island of nz fig 1 previous investigations by srinivasan and duncan 2012 had highlighted poor irrigation scheduling practices irrigation applied based on supply than on soil or crop demand in the scheme owing largely to unreliable irrigation supply from the river the irrigation scheme draws water from the waimakariri river and supplies to over 240 shareholder farmers covering a command area of 44 000 ha via a network of open channels the total irrigated area is 18 000 ha wis holds the resource consent to abstract water from the river and thus has to abide by abstraction restrictions imposed by the local regional council environment canterbury ecan the irrigation season extends from september to april and most irrigation restrictions occur between january through march when river flows fall below abstraction limit srinivasan and duncan 2012 the current irrigation reliability is 74 and wis is developing plans to build a storage reservoir which would increase the reliability to 91 for the pilot study five farms 4 grazed dairy and one cropping were chosen within the scheme fig 1a grazed pastoral dairy farms dominate the scheme the pilot farms were intentionally chosen to represent the variability in weather and soil characteristics across the scheme srinivasan and duncan 2012 reported that the gradients in rainfall and evaporation across the scheme would result in gradients in irrigation demands across the scheme fig 1a similarly the soil plant available water varies widely across the scheme fig 1b owing to these gradients in weather and soil one irrigation scheduling practice would not fit all the wue pilot study was based on the hypothesis that on farm irrigation scheduling and thus wue could be improved by providing farmers with real time access to current demand soil and or crop water demand and future supply 2 to 15 day rainfall information in each pilot farm a rain gauge and soil moisture sensor were installed under one spray irrigator the most popular irrigation system in the region the pilot farms were provided with real time on line access to rainfall irrigation and soil moisture and soil temperature data collected on farm in order to increase the learning opportunities between pilot study farmers the project researchers with farmers consent allowed viewing of others data thus each pilot study farmer had an opportunity to see others irrigation decisions and practices in real time farmers were also sent a daily email updating last 7 days of rainfall irrigation soil moisture soil temperature estimated penman potential evapotranspiration and measured drainage from lysimeters installed in one of the pilot farms in addition farmers were provided with short term 2 6 and 15 day weather forecast which included forecast rainfall amount intensity and timing high resolution 12 km grid scale published every 6 h forecasting provided predictions on 2 to 6 day weather conditions climatological summaries 1972to present were used to derive 15 day forecast based on current demand and forecast supply farmers could schedule irrigation irrigation decisions were left to the farmers and the researchers did not make any recommendations between 2012 and 2015 soil moisture measurements were made at 20 cm depth to assess the irrigation demand however following stakeholder interactions see section 2 2 for more on these interactions in 2015 at each pilot farm a profile soil moisture sensor was installed adjacent to the existing soil moisture sensor the profile soil moisture sensor measured soil moisture and soil temperature at every 10 cm interval from the surface to 80 cm down the soil profile using the top four depths 0 40 cm depth to pasture root zone farmers assessed irrigation demand when to start the irrigation soil moisture increases at 70 to 80 cm depth immediately following irrigation events were indicative of over irrigation resulting in drainage more on the stakeholder interaction and changes to soil moisture sensor technology are available in section 3 3 each irrigation season ended with a workshop referred to as farmer workshop hereafter where all pilot farmers came together to reflect on the season discuss their irrigation decisions and make plans for the upcoming year reinforcing the out in the field character of the pilot study the farmer workshops were held within the irrigation scheme area initially in one of the pilot farms then in a local community hall as the size of the stakeholder group grew during the first year may 2013 the farmer workshop was attended by pilot study farmers irrigation scheme managers and researchers the following year may 2014 in addition to year 1 attendees ecan representatives and members of the local catchment management committee who advise ecan on resource management were invited to attend ecan or environment canterbury is the regional government agency that manages and regulates the use of natural resources in the region before the year 2 farmer workshop the pilot study farmers and researchers discussed the list of stakeholders to be invited as the stakeholder group grew over subsequent years suggestions for invitees came from the wider group at the year 3 farmer workshop may 2015 additional participants included non pilot study farmers from within wis area managers from neighbouring irrigation schemes and the project funders government officials during years 4 and 5 may 2016 and 2017 respectively farm based industry organisations and farmers from neighbouring irrigation schemes were invited to the farmer workshop during the entire pilot study the pilot farmers and researchers had equal access to all biophysical and weather forecast data individual farm visits enabled the researchers to train the farmers on data interpretation e g how to optimally combine current soil moisture conditions and forecast rainfall predictions to schedule an irrigation event or how to include the risk associated with weather forecast into irrigation scheduling and to learn from the farmers about the ease and usefulness of data provided these visits also helped the researchers to identify opportunities to improve the data presentation in line with farmers preferences through organisational niwa first and last authors host organisation meetings the researchers made sure that the provision of data and tools to participants was in line with organisational strategies these meetings also fostered discussions with the niwa business team about the translation of research findings into marketable products the crown research institutes cris of nz such as those involved in the pilot study are the largest group of dedicated science research agencies cris in addition to conduct scientific research are also expected to be financially viable by producing commercial marketable products developed from their research 2 2 systems perspective and co innovation approach the pilot project was aimed at improving irrigation scheduling at the farm level however on farm decisions are not made in isolation from their wider economic regulatory social technical geographical and natural context i e the system turner et al 2014 srinivasan et al 2017 while tech transfer is primarily focussed on individuals making on farm decisions and adoption process co innovation places greater emphasis on collectives and systems that requires new forms of interaction organisation and agreement between stakeholders leeuwis and van den ban 2004 based on schut et al 2015 we identified three roles emerging for stakeholders in the pilot study 1 providing a perspective to environmental sustainability economic feasibility and cultural and social acceptability of solutions developed through the co innovation process 2 as a collective becoming aware of interdependencies and thus promoting a collective action and 3 supporting and sustaining the solutions developed by actively involving themselves in the decision making process stakeholders provide a reality check on problem identified and solution developed the project researchers took several steps to establish rapport with the stakeholders specifically farmers by going out to the farms to talk to the pilot farmers in their own environment rather than communicating through telephone e mail or inviting the participants for meetings at their research office based on conversations with on and off farm stakeholders pilot study farmers irrigation scheme managers regulators irrigation industry professionals the researchers analysed the irrigation water management landscape from farm scale to regional and national scales srinivasan et al 2017 this system perspective aligned with the application of a co innovation approach which promotes the inclusion of non scientific stakeholders their opinions and knowledge boyce et al 2018 efforts to build relationship with stakeholders were guided by a social researcher third author of the paper who took on the role of a reflexive monitor she worked with the biophysical scientists in fostering an ongoing reflection of relationships between stakeholders activities results outputs outcomes and goals a reflexive monitor helps to maintain a problem focus and design the project to include new insights or contextual e g market policy changes van mierlo et al 2010 rijswijk et al 2015 the co innovation approach used in the pilot study was guided by nine principles described by nederlof et al 2011 in this project an adaptation of these principles by coutts et al 2017 was used the nine principles are listed in table 1 the principles are designed to be inclusive of multiple stakeholders and multiple perspectives right from problem definition to solution implementation 2 3 data collection and analysis data collection for this paper included data compiled from a variety of sources that were retrospectively analysed to describe the pilot study progression pilot study related meeting notices from the outlook calendar of the research leader first author were retrieved and analyzed to develop a timeline a qualitative content analysis of e mails agendas and minutes provided additional information on the content purpose and outcome of these meetings after each farmer workshop all attendees were asked to fill out a feedback form on the pilot study a sample feedback form is included in fig 2 these forms were used to evaluate the pilot study progression from stakeholders perspective due to the interactive and evolutionary nature of the pilot study it is impossible to attribute individual actions to study outcomes however by combining different sources of data with the experiences of the researchers inferences were made about how actions influenced each other actions and actors we also compiled a list of outcomes and outputs from the pilot study the following nine key aspects inspired by innovation systems literature van mierlo et al 2010 wieczorek and hekkert 2012 were used to evaluate the pilot study progression 1 objective 2 strategy 3 activity action 4 partners actors 5 resources 6 insights 7 value proposition 8 outcomes and 9 outputs each one of these categories was matched against each pilot study phase outcomes were distinguished from outputs as some results outcomes such as establishment of trust among participants did not generate a tangible output 3 results analysis of data compiled against the nine aspects listed in the last section provided an insight into the evolution of the pilot study through its life we identified five chronologically ordered phases that represented the focus of the pilot study and its evolution table 2 the overarching study goal improving water use efficiency through increased use of weather forecast remained unchanged across the phases see section 3 1 for more on the study goal however the specific objectives strategies actions and stakeholders varied between phases even though the phases were identified individually they often overlapped in time and sometimes over actions for example some of the ideas on pilot study legacy fifth and last phase such as how to sustain the knowledge resources and momentum developed during the pilot study beyond its life were already envisioned during the concept development phase first phase by exploring options to design an irrigation scheduling tool however actions did not occur until the legacy phase similarly trust building and knowledge synthesis were spread across the phases an indication of their deep routed and perennial nature 3 1 concept development phase the first phase started with the inception of the research idea to ended with the implementation of the pilot study earlier srinivasan and duncan 2012 had identified that on farm wue in wis could be improved by carefully managing the frequency and depth of irrigation applications building on this finding and with niwa s weather forecasting tools and expertise in mind in 2012 the pilot study leader first author developed a research idea wherein he envisioned an irrigation scheduling practice that accounts for both current soil crop water demand and short term rainfall forecast the project leader termed this as a justified irrigation practice as opposed to just in case which is a supply driven irrigation practice or just in time which is a demand driven practice justified irrigation accounts for both demand and supply simultaneously while there was no direct stakeholder input in conceiving or conceptualising it the research idea itself emerged from previous stakeholder interactions in formal conversations with farmers in the wis region weather forecasters at niwa and analysis of historical irrigation water use data a key insight during this phase was the realisation of potential value of combining weather forecast and current soil moisture status data and sharing them with farmers in real time to enable an informed irrigation decision with a concept conceived stakeholder engagement was initiated in line with host organisation s mission of enabling sustainable resource management and delivering innovative practical products and services niwa s business communication and marketing teams were engaged in a conversation they saw the market potential for weather related products for primary sector support from the niwa s internal team increased the pilot study s potential for organisational support and therefore its continuity a critical factor in the legacy phase the research idea also fitted with the co innovation approach envisioned in a national agricultural innovation programme called the primary innovation pi pi was a nz government funded five year research initiative that was launched in october 2012 to examine the value of co innovation in improving the uptake of science tools and concepts within nz s primary sector the first author was a part of the pi programme the pi programme directly linked research and its uptake by stakeholders the co innovation approach employed by pi was new to niwa hydrologists thus becoming a part of the pi team brought several benefits firstly the pi team provided support and knowledge from social innovation perspective secondly becoming part of a national programme such as pi brought visibility to the wue message promoted in the pilot study lastly alignment with pi led to additional funding to the pilot study with organisational science and governmental support established the researchers started the pilot study set up such a pilot study needs on farm measurements to quantify current wue and a robust communication channel that enables a meaningful timely data sharing with the stakeholders because of a prior relationship the researchers identified wis as the suitable host for the pilot study even though it was recognised that irrigation scheduling tools are poorly adopted by farmers in wis owing to poor supply reliability srinivasan and duncan 2012 addition of weather forecast was perceived as a catalyst for change for the selection of pilot farms the researchers sought input from the wis manager one of the pilot farmers identified was also a part of the wis board this was considered beneficial for his position could be helpful in engaging the scheme management helping with decisions that could influence the wider scheme and providing insight into scheme s vision for the future this highlighted that expanding the results of the research to the wider agricultural community was envisioned at the start of the project though actions did not occur until the fourth and fifth phases sections 3 4 and 3 5 respectively 3 2 trust building phase after the initial pilot study set up the researchers visited the potential pilot farmers individually the researchers explained the use of weather forecast for irrigation management and sought farmers consent to participate in the pilot study these visits allowed the researchers to share their research idea and vision listen to farmers feedback and ideas and understand their constraints to irrigation scheduling failure of innovations conceived by researchers with little understanding of stakeholders problems and priorities has been well documented röling 1988 leeuwis 1989 van veldhuizen et al 1997 kulecho and weatherhead 2005 belder et al 2007 friedlander et al 2013 and others it could also be speculated that some of the earlier technology transfer approaches to irrigation management might have failed to fully account for farmers understanding and use of technology building trust with the pilot farmers was considered crucial for pilot study delivery and continuity the researchers clearly articulated their aim to learn from the farmers positioning themselves as equals rather than superiors in terms of knowledge or power refer to co innovation principles 1 to 4 table 1 and that scientific and experiential knowledge from all stakeholders would be valued and weighted equally on farm telemetered data funded by the pilot study helped the researchers to quantify and test their hypothesis that irrigation scheduling has been poor in the scheme the on farm measurements helped to increase the trust in research findings the on farm data also provided an opening to engage with the farmers and other stakeholders at individual meetings and group workshops for instance the on farm data quantified the existence of the rainfall gradient across the scheme which matched the experiential knowledge held by the farmers this synchronisation of scientific data and experiential knowledge strengthened the trust in the validity of data collected associated science and eventually of the researchers enabling pilot farmers to see data on others irrigation practice proved to be very beneficial for stakeholder engagement firstly it enabled a transparency and openness to the engagement process which led to trust between the farmers and researchers secondly prior knowledge of others irrigation practices enriched discussions around irrigation decisions at the farmer workshops and ways of assessing and addressing risks associated with weather forecast finally the prior awareness of others practices eliminated any feeling of intimidation or finger pointing at the farmer workshop based on the data shared there was a free exchange of ideas and observations at the farmer workshops this sharing also highlighted the level of trust developing between the pilot farmers and their desire to learn from each other very early on the pilot study researchers started building relationship with other off farm stakeholders such as the irrigation scheme management industry professionals and regulators ecan this helped the pilot study group to stay abreast of upcoming changes to the wider irrigation landscape e g ecan s policy change relating to irrigation scheduling practices wis plan to build storage to increase reliability however all these stakeholders e g ecan were not yet invited to take part in the pilot or participate in the farmer workshops the researchers believed that the introduction of such off farm stakeholders may have a detrimental value until a trust had been established between the researchers pilot study farmers and irrigation scheme hence the introduction of off farm stakeholders was delayed until the third phase the reflexive monitor guided the process of identifying relevant stakeholders and the timing of their introduction to the wider pilot study team 3 3 knowledge synthesis phase the third phase was focussed on knowledge synthesis and learning on farm biophysical data collected since december 2012 played a key role in furthering the interaction among the stakeholders at the farmer workshops the pilot study farm participants gave their perspective on the data collected their interpretation and the resulting practice change and the pilot study in general at the year 1 farmer workshop farmers discussed the need for more focus on simultaneous management of irrigation drainage and nutrients this discussion was based on the imminent regulatory limits on drainage and more stringent nutrient management regulations this resulted in a key change in the pilot study focus from irrigation management to irrigation and drainage management at the farmer workshops the stakeholders discussed the need to integrate water and nutrient management while the water use efficiency practices improved nutrient use efficiency e g refraining from nutrient applications before forecast rainfall events no specific measurements of the fate and transport of nutrients in the pilot farms were made pilot study resources constraints did not allow this happen however the researchers by bringing in nutrient management specialists to the farmer workshops bridged the gap as much as possible two key insights from farmer workshops further enhanced the focus of the pilot study in this phase at the second farmer workshop in 2014 in response to additional focus on drainage at the first year farmer workshop the researchers presented drainage data in depth units for all pilot farms similar to other inputs such as rainfall and irrigation drainage was estimated based on measured on farm rainfall and irrigation data estimated potential evaporation from a local weather station within the scheme fig 1a and published plant available water fig 1b a simple water balance provided an estimate of farm specific drainage while farmers could relate to that they found it difficult to compare pilot farm performance the researchers based on their conversations with the pilot farmers developed an approximate monetary value for irrigation and rainfall drainage irrigation drainage was valued at 2 per ha for every millimetre of irrigation water lost this included pumping cost additional cost to refill leached soil nutrients and lost cost from the non availability of land for grazing owing to saturated soils from over irrigation rainfall drainage was valued at 1 50 per ha per millimetre of drainage as there was no pumping cost involved at the third farmer workshop in 2015 the presentation of drainage in monetary terms generated a robust discussion among the stakeholders including the benefit cost ratio from using weather forecast for irrigation the pilot study researchers emphasised that the dollar values were based on empirical and experiential knowledge of stakeholders the key insight of presenting drainage in monetary terms was later used in the irrigation scheduling tool irrimet developed at the end of the pilot study see irrimet tool in section 3 5 also the first author in an effort to capture the economic benefits of weather forecast for irrigation and drainage management successfully developed another proposal for government funding in 2016 see justified irrigation in section 3 5 the second key insight came at the third year 2015 farmer workshop at this workshop when the researchers presented the likely drainage based on soil moisture exceeding soil saturation at 20 cm depth location where soil moisture was being measured until then the stakeholder group discussed the need for collecting more concrete evidence on potential drainage rather than predicting based on one soil moisture measurement at 20 cm depth by then the pilot parmers had already been made aware of the economic value of drainage at this workshop while drainage lysimeter provided measurement of drainage data for one of the pilot farms owing to their high cost they were ruled out as an option for other pilot farms in response to this discussion at the workshop the researchers introduced the use of a profile soil moisture sensor that measured soil moisture and soil temperature at 10 cm intervals over a depth of 80 cm surface down to 80 cm vertically down the soil profile at 8 locations these sensors were installed in all pilot farms to provide additional evidence on drainage soil moisture changes at 70 80 cm depth following irrigation events provided real time feedback to the farmers of their practice this introduced another learning moment in the pilot study learning among stakeholders was one of the primary objective of the wue pilot study when the data sharing among the pilot farmers was enabled the objective was for farmers to observe each other s behaviour and learn however as the pilot farms were not located next to each other and a significant biophysical gradient existed between the farms the individual irrigation practices were not easily transferrable or comparable between farms even though the researchers realised this gap in the second year of the project they could not fill the gap because of lack of financial resources to instrument additional farms the significant shifts in the pilot study focus in this phase typify co innovation such shifts were possible because of flexible pilot study design and willingness of stakeholders to alter their actions to align with emerging landscape and needs many of which would not have been possible in a tech transfer setting 3 4 extended outreach phase wider societal impact was one of the goals of the pilot study however efforts to increase pilot study outreach did not occur until the fourth phase the preceding phases focussed on developing and testing of concepts and tools which enabled the pilot study researchers to approach wider farming community with a validated tool firstly the pilot study researchers started sharing the daily email update with the wider wis farming community this increased the awareness of practices possible in the scheme the number of daily email recipients steadily increased from 5 pilot farms only to more than 25 pilot farms and their neighbouring farms by this phase in this phase the researchers pro actively engaged regulators other irrigation schemes in the region and science partners in the pilot study by inviting them to meetings and farmer workshops the researchers also made several presentations to various groups industry regulators science community and farm shows highlighting the results and learnings from the pilot study and invited the pilot farmers to present their experience it was believed that pro actively communicating about the pilot study could lead to identifying new knowledge partners and opportunities e g knowledge transfer to other regions and influencing the irrigation management landscape such as informing policies to manage on farm water use in this phase the researchers were also approached by outsiders such as the beef and lamb new zealand who were interested in exploring options for improving wue these agencies and others were attracted to the fact that a farm based approach to improving water use efficiency has been shown to work and thus were interested in transferring the learnings to their farmer groups answering these requests for information was time and resource demanding and none of these outreach activities were allowed to derail the engagement with the pilot study stakeholders 3 5 project legacy phase as the science funding for the pi programme ended in september 2017 the pilot study moved into a legacy setting phase by 2016 while the pilot farms and on farm data collection were specific to a region the learnings are applicable to wider irrigation community the pilot study researchers looked beyond the five year project in search of a suitable exit strategy that would sustain the learning momentum and positive proactive behavioural changes to water management achieved the pilot study legacy phase was dominated by efforts at four different levels 1 development of online irrigation scheduling products such as irrimet and farmmet by niwa distilling the knowledge learning and insight from the pilot study 2 an increase in science outputs an important goal of scientific research 3 wis inviting proposals to implement the wue practices across the entire scheme based on their learning from the pilot study and 4 based on insights and experience gained in the wue project the niwa researchers started developing a new research proposal for government funding the new proposal justified irrigation was funded by the nz ministry of business innovation and employment in october 2016 for five years to examine and quantify the economic impact of using weather forecast for irrigation management the search for a suitable exit strategy meant that the project outputs should be at least partly independent of the skills and actions of individual researchers so far we can identify certain indicators that the moment of exit is near first scientific outputs have been developed 4 referred journal papers one referred science report 5 conference proceedings 7 conference presentations 3 popular publications 2 media interviews and a number of presentations second the scientific background of practical technological tools are in order and third external parties to the pilot study becoming aware of the tools available to improve wue e g beef and lamb new zealand the engagement of niwa s marketing and communication team early in the project provided that experience initial contact with potential investors in decision support tools was initiated by the researchers however these tasks had been taken over by those with more experience in this field nevertheless time will tell more specifically the success of the exit phase posing more interesting questions for further analysis tool development consumed significant resources during this phase experiences and key insights from past studies reported in the literature were used in developing the tools irrimet and farmmet stakeholders recognized that the usability of research generated would be enhanced when translated into products and decision support tools that can be easily accessed by others jakku and thorburn 2010 and cerf et al 2012 recommended the use of participatory approach and conceptual framework in co designing and developing such decision support tools for improved stakeholder uptake sumberg et al 2013 emphasised the need to include systematic user feedback in designing successful tools the first four phases of wue project provided the much needed stakeholder input for the tool design and development the tool was designed to respond to three levels of management questions for users operational should i irrigate today tactical could i trade my stored water today and still have water to irrigate next week and strategic should i upgrade my irrigation infrastructure these three levels correspond to three time frames short medium and long of planning one of the pilot farmers during the study by the way of strategic investment expanded the irrigated area by 10 but did not invest on additional water for irrigation and scheduling irrigations based on weather forecast and soil moisture demand 4 discussion 4 1 trust building bayne et al 2016 who investigated the structural and relation support necessary to support learning and knowledge uptake in the nz forestry sector concluded that the key factor in enhancing uptake and learning is requirement of an environment that encourages relationship building particularly trust building between parties although trust might not generally be seen as a research output it is crucial for a project s success and continuity fisher 2013 harris and lyon 2013 it creates attention and involvement while trust could not be imposed in the wue pilot study on farm biophysical measurements alignment of scientific data and experiential knowledge of weather gradient helped with fostering trust srinivasan and elley 2018 also by remaining inclusive to wider stakeholder group and sharing the on farm data with the wider pilot study group enhanced the trust based on the stakeholders input at the farmer workshop the researchers were able to alter their research question from when to start the irrigation irrigation management to when to start and stop the irrigation irrigation and drainage management this flexibility and ability to incorporate stakeholders feedback into the pilot study greatly increased the level of trust among the stakeholders 4 2 planning flexibility and adaptability in co innovation projects the wue pilot study provides insight into planning and advancing a co innovation based biophysical project planning ahead e g identifying key stakeholders identifying market opportunities at the start of the project can help the researchers decide on when and how to involve various stakeholders and how to foster on going learning to improve the project and its chance to succeed in a time bound project such as the wue pilot study spanned from 2011 to 2016 planning ahead helped the researchers in phasing the tasks as well as set up milestones that could be reported back on to the funders however such planning needs to be flexible enough to eliminate interference with the co innovation process itself based on a comparative study of five co innovation projects in nz vereijssen et al 2017a concluded that as co innovation practices are context specific the project leadership needs to have the willingness capacity and ability to adapt project scope and or research approach to maintain stakeholder engagement thus co innovation always includes elements of redesign encompassing new processes of learning and negotiation and hence should not be looked at merely as dissemination leeuwis 2004 pg 12 several researchers have acknowledged that the key challenge to practitioners of co innovation approach is to organise interventions that are adaptive and flexible and induce learning opportunities and emergent experiences that can be incorporated into ongoing activities leeuwis 2004 such interventions may require new forms of monitoring evaluation and process planning leeuwis 2004 interventions can neither be planned nor be enforced on stakeholders also interventions demand flexibility in project planning in case wue pilot study the introduction of profile soil moisture sensor to manage drainage and irrigation simultaneously and adding a monetary value to drainage proved to be successful interventions however the researchers did not intervene with irrigation scheduling decisions 4 3 pros and cons of co innovation the extensive stakeholder inclusion in co innovation projects has its own challenges stakeholder engagement is demanding on time and resources it requires working with different groups understanding their perspectives and suitably adapting the project goals including a reflexive monitor helped to spot opportunities for including relevant stakeholders and adapting the project to fit the evolving context better e g inclusion of representatives from the nz ministry of primary industries stakeholder inclusion can be a strategy to legitimize the project demonstration of the project s added value increase stakeholders attention and trigger a sense of ownership and eventual uptake leeuwis and van den ban 2004 stakeholder inclusion can also complicate a research project for example in terms of competition for resources or when a conflict or power struggle arises leeuwis and van den ban 2004 schut et al 2014 for instance financial limitations and contractual obligations with the funding agency meant that the wue pilot study could not expand to include a water quality component despite strong signals from stakeholders however the co innovation approach can lead to important benefits lending weight to other findings that stakeholder involvement is associated with increased knowledge resources networks and creativity leeuwis and van den ban 2004 moreover new collaborations can become fruitful in the future or through other projects beyond the scope of this project jakku and thorburn 2010 in the case of wue efficiency the wider stakeholder group enabled interactions with larger farm groups e g beef and lamb new zealand in a tech transfer based science process such interactions would have occurred via publications and presentations unlikely reaching the desired end users the farmers 4 4 boundary objects for stakeholder engagement and project focus park et al 2015 while examining the success of a co innovation based horticultural programme in nz concluded that clear drivers and clear goals with measureable targets strong leadership from industry regular communication among stakeholders a pilot study demonstrating the concept extensive monitoring and evaluation and a trusted science team are pivotal ingredients in securing adoption the study examined by park et al 2015 fell within the transition zone between tech transfer to co innovation hence includes elements of both by setting up a pilot study and sharing data in real time the wue pilot study team enabled an immediate science impact the profile soil moisture sensor allowed farmers to see the effectiveness and efficiency of individual irrigation events irrimet was also designed to provide a retrospective view of the irrigation season to allow stakeholders reflect on their irrigation practices and learn the philosophy of learning by doing allowed the pilot farmers to learn from their actions as well as from others including a monetary value to their practices e g conversion of drainage into dollars enhanced the stakeholder awareness and encouraged them to act when a large stakeholder group is engaged it is important that a robust communication is maintained and that stakeholders are engaged van dijk et al 2017 who used practices guided by co innovation principles in an animal welfare project in the netherlands concluded that co innovation is stakeholder network specific and thus practitioners seldom have sight of output making project planning challenging tools such as logical framework that trace the project evolution are greatly useful in unveiling this link botha et al 2017 boundary objects such as pilot studies decision support systems and on farm monitoring data are useful in maintaining project focus and purpose boundary objects after carlile 2002 and turnhout 2009 enable a shared understanding between the researchers and stakeholders and help communicating complex science and management concepts according to cerf et al 2012 such boundary objects represent three points of view cognitive problem description as stakeholders see it functional ways of producing information to arrive at a solution and operational implementation of the solution boundary objects provide opening as well as purpose for stakeholder engagement one of the key insights in the wue pilot study was that identifying and establishing boundary objects early on is critical to the engagement process 4 5 role management in a co innovation setting stakeholders particularly biophysical researchers are expected to don multiple roles experts in science facilitators of interactions translators of data into usable information catalyst for change lobbyist for action seekers and gatherers of resources to sustain the momentum generated and designers developers and disseminators of solutions and products sumberg et al 2013 schut et al 2014 wittmayer and schapke 2014 botha et al 2017 in the wue pilot study as the phases evolved and contexts changed the roles kept evolving the farmers from initially being passive receivers of data later actively participated in the project by reflecting on their irrigation practices and altering appropriately during the initial phases the pilot study researchers were focused on identifying stakeholders and setting up the pilot study but towards the legacy phase they were working on ways of disseminating the wue practices and learnings to the wider irrigation community when regulators ecan and industry e g beef and lamb new zealand were involved from the third phase the stakeholder group became truly inter disciplinary specifically the legacy phase demanded a wide range of non biophysical skills including commercial and marketing insights as well as resources human time and financial to reach out the wider farming community therefore an important insight is that project biophysical researchers should acknowledge the limits in their knowledge and involve people such as social researchers and marketing experts such inclusions demand that the biophysical researchers develop an insight into the future application of their research findings beyond science publications and presentations it is imperative as smits 2002 emphasized that biophysical researchers need to understand and embrace the reality that changes to science context can result in changes to their researchers roles responsibilities and relationships that need redefining schut et al 2014 pointed out that in all their engagements researchers need to explore and balance their role that enhance credibility relevance and legitimacy of science applied and knowledge developed 4 6 alignment with changing and emerging contexts inherently innovation is messy chaotic complex and unpredictable and quite incompatible with the idea of planning leeuwis and van den ban 2004 co innovation processes are best suited for conditions where management of a public good resource is in discussion in such contexts uncertainty and unpredictability are abound knowledge is often obscured by competing and contentious claims and problems are complex multi dimensional and multi level with multiple stakeholders and perspectives giller et al 2008 schut et al 2014 fielke and srinivasan 2018 additionally a changing landscape such as imminent regulations to water and nutrient management development of storage options to improve irrigation reliability or increasing concerns around the economic viability and environmental sustainability of farming in general can influence the context giller et al 2008 suggested that researchers to better understand and anticipate changing landscape need to embed themselves in policy processes to invoke locally relevant strategies such strategies would help to tailor research questions approaches and solutions co innovation processes are dynamic and context specific as context changes the outcomes of a co innovation process may also change context change could at many different levels biophysical setting e g construction of irrigation ponds to improve reliability regulatory setting e g changes to nutrient management regulations and economic e g water foot printing public perception to irrigation management and cultural and recreational values placed on water resources in the wue pilot study the researchers by including the irrigation scheme management were able to foresee the development of storage reservoir in the scheme however the influence of reservoir on irrigation management in wis is yet to be explored as the reservoir has not been in place this reservoir when completed would increase the reliability of irrigation and enhance the usefulness of weather forecast the implementation process needs to recognize that improved reliability would come at a financial cost to the scheme and the farmers also the availability of water on demand may change stakeholders current perspective to the rarity of the resource the project did not focus on water trading as it is not happening in this scheme yet however storage may open trading options which might open up other opportunities for the farmers scheme and region similarly through their interactions with the regulators the researchers learned about the upcoming regulations limiting irrigation induced drainage and embedded the same in their pilot study however this pilot study did not include the next logical step of nutrient management due to funding limitation these emerging contexts are the likely to define the boundaries to wue in years to come 5 conclusion the road towards a successful innovation project can be unpredictable and uncontrollable nevertheless innovation projects clearly have a start middle and an end this wue pilot study provides an insight into the co innovation process and how it can be applied a key purpose for this paper is to assist biophysical researchers in understanding the challenges to a co innovation process concept development trust building knowledge synthesis and outreach that happened throughout the pilot study reinforced the perspective that innovation is non linear the practitioners of co innovation have to be responsive to changes to cultural environmental economic social geographical policy and biophysical contexts in a dynamic environment continuous engagement with stakeholders means continuous monitoring evaluation reflection and re prioritisation of actions and objectives however implementation of such action research demands a flexible approach from funding agencies contractual obligations with funders may limit flexibility however by including them as a stakeholder in a co innovation process the funders can be provided first hand knowledge of stakeholder needs and any required changes to the research directions for instance in the wue pilot study when the definition of water use efficiency expanded to include both irrigation and drainage management the researchers were flexible enough to respond to the changing context however when stakeholders desired to combine nutrient and irrigation management the researchers could not respond positively owing to resource financial limitation and contractual obligation co innovation approach unlike tech transfer approaches demand a higher degree both in quantity and quality of stakeholder interaction such interactions often lead to changes in project context the project activities level of stakeholder engagement and objectives however the boundary objects such as pilot study on farm biophysical monitoring decision support tools and others act as reminders of the original study goal and provide a focus and purpose to the project finally co innovation can be time demanding and resource intensive outcomes such as trust take time and energy to build and sustain biophysical researchers applying co innovation approach are expected to perform multiple roles as a project evolves as well as have the ability flexibility and capacity to alter project focus as context demands biophysical researchers need to acknowledge and accept that a transition from technology oriented to system oriented approaches requires changes in organisational mandates incentives procedures and funding as well as investments in exchange of experiences learning and capacity development schut et al 2015 pg 1 acknowledgements we acknowledge the

11258,plastic film mulch increases crop yields in rain fed agriculture in cool semi arid climates by warming the soil and reducing evaporative water losses the semi arid khorchin area in northeast china is an important production area for rain fed maize drought stress occurs frequently even if plastic film mulch is applied at sowing we hypothesized that the yield and water capture of maize could be increased by reducing evaporative loss of water by use of plastic film cover during the autumn and winter preceding sowing in this study we compared maize growth water uptake and yield in three film cover treatments 1 film cover from the autumn before maize sowing until maize harvest autumn mulching am 2 film cover from maize sowing till harvest conventional practice spring mulching sm 3 no film cover no mulch nm field experiments were conducted in fuxin city khorchin region liaoning province china in 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 autumn mulching increased grain yield on average by 18 when compared to spring mulching and by 36 when compared to no mulching the 1000 kernel weight in am was 7 higher than in sm and 12 higher than in nm soil water content in the root zone before sowing was 35 mm greater in am than in sm and nm water uptake during the growing season was 34 mm greater in am than in sm and nm water use efficiency for grain yield yield per unit water uptake in am was on average 2 5 higher than in conventional mulching sm and 27 higher than in nm autumn mulching advanced development with an advance of 5 days in tasseling time as compared to sm and 10 days when compared to nm these results show that film cover during the fallow period before maize sowing can increase crop yield and water use efficiency and reduce climate risks in rain fed agriculture under semi arid conditions keywords film cover water availability yield components soil temperature 1 introduction maize zea mays l is one of the worldmost important cereals it is a major food and feed crop in china and 31 of the grain production amount occurs in the northeast region where maize is mainly rain fed with an average yield of 5 3 t ha 1 dong et al 2017 low spring temperatures and frequent summer droughts are limiting factors for yield in this region cai et al 2017 with global warming a drying trend with high variation of precipitation was reported piao et al 2010 and an increase in the frequency and severity of droughts was projected for northeast china xu et al 2013 song et al 2014 yu et al 2014 such changes would have a strong negative impact on future maize yield and yield stability misra 2014 zhu et al 2015 plastic film mulching decreases soil evaporation li et al 2013 tian et al 2003 wang et al 2008 it is a water saving measure that improves maize yield and yield stability in dryland agriculture and is widely applied in many countries but especially in china gan et al 2013 liu et al 2014a other water saving measures are also applied such as straw mulching tao et al 2015 conservation bench terraces sharda et al 2015 or contour furrows gebreegziabher et al 2009 the area of plastic film cover in china was approximately 20 million hectares in 2011 and it has increased by 7 1 per year in recent years liu et al 2014a film mulching can significantly improve crop yield and quality kar 2003 li et al 2004 luis et al 2011 ramakrishna et al 2006 wang et al 2008 film mulching accelerates growth and development daryanto et al 2017 and increases water use efficiency wue due to lower water loss through evaporation and a higher proportion of the water that is used for transpiration than would be the case without film cover wang et al 2008 zegada lizarazu and berliner 2011 li et al 2013 film mulching increases maize yield by 34 and wue by 39 across whole china liu et al 2014a soil temperature under film increases 1 6 3 5 c during early growth gan et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 resulting in rapid germination and seedling establishment wang et al 2005 zhao et al 2012 bhardwaj 2013 liu et al 2016 the effects of plastic film mulching differ with climate soil and management li et al 2001 ren et al 2008 zhang et al 2011 in semi arid northeast china 20 of the precipitation occurs during the fallow season in autumn and winter and part of this water is lost due to high soil evaporation caused by high wind speed and a bare soil surface li et al 2004 dong et al 2009 even if the average total precipitation in a whole year generally equals the crop water requirement approximately 500 mm the yearly and intra seasonal variation my still result in drought stress mostly mild drought stress during the summer cai et al 2017 rainfall during the maize growing season does not completely satisfy the demand of maize zhang et al 2014 especially not in dry years even when film cover is applied during the vegetation period jia et al 2017 the khorchin area of liaoning province in northeast china is suitable for rain fed maize growing from 1985 to 2015 the annual precipitation was 483 mm in whole year and the average precipitation during the crop growing season was 407 mm may to september the total rainfall during crop growing season is thus not enough for growing high yield maize we hypothesized that water availability water use efficiency and maize yield could be improved if the water loss during fallow season was reduced by the use of mulching film during the fallow season other advantages of mulching film during fallow season would be the alleviation of drought stress and an increase in soil temperature during early spring which would allow faster germination and earlier sowing thus lengthening the growing season a multi site and long term experiment in gansu northwest china showed that plastic film cover during winter and the crop growing season increased maize yield by 30 107 compared to a treatment without film cover wang et al 2016 on the other hand film cover at sowing and leaving the film at field during winter and the next crop in no tillage maize showed no significant yield increase compared to a no film control or a treatment with spring film cover from one month before sowing under conventional tillage in gansu liu et al 2009 a simulation study showed that plastic film mulching increased crop yield from 4 to 254 on the loess plateau of china when compared with no film control and highly associated with the condition of precipitation and air temperature zhang et al 2018 previous studies thus indicate variation in benefits of film cover during winter previous studies do not elucidate the role of film cover during the winter and leave questions about the effects of tillage difference effects of film mulch vary with climatic conditions there is no knowledge of the effects of film during the fallow season under the semi arid conditions of northeast china where farmers usually do not use film cover or only during the crop season because of a better hydrothermal condition than in northwest china to our knowledge this is the first study to test the use of film cover during the fallow period before sowing in this type of environment the objective of this study was to quantify crop growth development yield and water use efficiency of rain fed maize in a semi arid region when the film cover was applied during the previous autumn we used two reference treatments film mulching at sowing which is the current practice and a film free control 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design field experiments were conducted from october 2013 to september 2015 including two entire crop seasons 2014 and 2015 at the scientific observing and experiment station of fuxin agro environment and arable land conservation ministry of agriculture fuxin county liaoning province located in the

the two experimental seasons on average 530 mm the precipitation during the growing season was 310 mm in 2014 and 249 mm in 2015 all below the historical average the soil texture was a calcic cinnamon soil 60 6 sand 20 5 silt and 18 9 clay the mean bulk density to 1 m depth was 1 55 g cm 3 determined by the cutting ring method before sowing in 2014 organic matter in the top 20 cm soil layer was 11

out as a randomized complete block design with three replicates plot area was 50 m2 10 m in length 5 m in width three treatments were 1 plastic film mulching in the autumn after harvest of the previous crop autumn mulching am 2 plastic film mulching in spring before maize was sown spring mulching sm and 3 no film no mulching nm the plastic film was a locally produced common white film with a thickness of 0 008 mm the maize variety was zhengdan 958 the field was ploughed to 20 cm depth with a tractor mounted moldboard plough on 1 october fertilizer was applied in the autumn before film placement in the am treatment and in the spring before sowing in the other two treatments the old film in the am and sm treatments were removed at harvest row spacing was 50 cm and plant distance in a row was 33 3 cm resulting in a plant density of 6 plants m 2 the width of film was 100 cm covering two rows of maize and 10 cm for each side of film was buried in soil to fix the film resulting a soil cover ratio of 80 sowing date was 26 april and harvest date was 22 september in 2014 sowing date was 28 april and harvest date was 24 september in 2015 only basal fertilizer was applied in each treatment with ureophil 46 n 522 kg ha 1 superphosphate 1250 kg ha 1 12 p2o5 and potassium sulfate 147 kg ha 1 51 k2o no irrigation was given in both years herbicide acetochlor was applied before the application of film cover am and sm or sowing nm other management was the same as local farmer practice plots were at same place in the two experimental years 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 yield and dry matter yield was measured at harvest on 22 september in 2014 and 24 september in 2015 in a sub sampling area of 6 m2 2 m in width 3 m in length in the middle of each plot the grain was sun dried to a water content of 14 in each plot 10 plants were randomly selected within the sub sampling area to measure yield components ear density ear m 2 ear number per plant multiplying with plant density kernels per ear and 1000 kernel weight maize dry matter only above ground was determined in each plot by randomly harvesting 3 plants in a sub sampling area of 2 m2 1 m in width and 2 m in length during the crop growing season and 6 m2 same sampling as yield measurement at harvest time for final dry matter dry matter samplings were conducted five times on 29 may 19 june 29 july 15 august 22 september in 2014 and 8 june 30 june 28 july 20 august and 24 september in 2015 each sub sampling area was at least 1 m apart from previously sampled areas to avoid gap effects the samples were separated into stems leaves and reproductive organs and oven dried at 80 c for 48 h to constant weight harvest index hi was calculated as grain yield divided by final dry matter 2 2 2 soil moisture content and temperature soil moisture content was measured by taking soil cores between two rows in the middle of each plot using an auger five measurements were conducted in both years i in 2014 on 26 april sowing time 19 june 19 july 15 august and 22 september harvesting time ii in 2015 on 28 april sowing time 30 june 27 july 20 august and 24 september harvesting time soil cores were taken till 100 cm depth and cut in 10 cm slices for measuring gravimetric water content the samples were oven dried at 105 c for 48 h to constant weight the volumetric soil moisture content was used and calculated by multiplying gravimetric water content with soil bulk density the soil water storage in the 0 100 m root zone was calculated by summing soil moisture content over depths at each sampling time the water measurements in the 1 m upper soil layer though common in agronomic studies might not count total water use but represent a substantial part of the water use soil temperature was continuously monitored using temperature sensors of decagon 5tm decagon ec tm usa from 1 october 2013 to 24 september 2015 the sensors were placed at 5 cm soil depth between two rows in the middle of each plot data were recorded at one hour interval 2 3 calculated parameters water uptake wu mm during the growing season and the fallow period including evaporation from bare soil and transpiration by the crop was calculated using a simplified soil water balance equation 1 wu p sw where p mm is rainfall and sw is the change of soil water storage within the 0 100 cm root zone between the times of sowing and harvest use of a simplified equation was warranted because deep percolation and capillary rise of water do not often occur in semi arid rain fed agriculture and they are commonly ignored in calculating the water balance allen et al 1998 angus and van herwaarden 2001 chen et al 2015 moiwo and tao 2015 bai et al 2016 because of low rain intensity less than 50 mm for the maximum and deep water table the experimental plots were separated by brick walls 10 cm higher than soil surface therefore there was no surface runoff water use efficiency wue g m 2 mm 1 was calculated for each plot as grain yield or biomass divided by total water uptake during the crop growing season 2 wue y wu where y g m 2 is grain yield or final dry matter and wu mm is the water use from sowing to harvest 2 4 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova of yield dry matter harvest index temperature wu and wue was performed using spss 18 0 ibm usa in the statistical analyses treatment and year were entered as fixed factors while replicate was a random factor nested within year least significant differences were used to separate treatment means at the 5 significance level 3 results 3 1 yield and yield components the grain yield was 13 2 t ha 1 in am averaged over two years 18 higher than in sm significantly and 36 higher than in nm p 0 05 table 1 the interaction between year and treatment was significant the film effect on maize yield was stronger in very dry 2015 than in less dry 2014 the number of kernels per ear was similar in am and sm but 18 higher in am than in nm the greater number of kernels per ear in am and sm were associated with greater ear length and ear diameter table 1 the 1000 kernel weight averaged across two years was 7 higher in am than in sm and 12 higher in am than in nm the ear density i e the number of ears per unit ground area was slightly greater in am than in the other two treatments but not significantly over the two years the treatment effect on kernels per ear significantly interacted with year while kernel weight did not 3 2 dry matter and harvest index dry matter was much higher in am and sm than in nm in both years p 0 05 there was no significant difference between am and sm in dry matter during the early season before 90 days after sowing das however the dry matter during the later season after tasseling was significantly higher in am than in sm fig 2 a significantly lower hi was found in sm than in the other treatments while there was no significant difference in hi between am and nm table 1 3 3 soil temperature the soil temperature at 5 cm depth in am was on average 1 7 c higher than in the other two treatments during the fallow season and 3 c higher at sowing time during the seedling stage from maize emergence to v6 6 fully expanded

11258,plastic film mulch increases crop yields in rain fed agriculture in cool semi arid climates by warming the soil and reducing evaporative water losses the semi arid khorchin area in northeast china is an important production area for rain fed maize drought stress occurs frequently even if plastic film mulch is applied at sowing we hypothesized that the yield and water capture of maize could be increased by reducing evaporative loss of water by use of plastic film cover during the autumn and winter preceding sowing in this study we compared maize growth water uptake and yield in three film cover treatments 1 film cover from the autumn before maize sowing until maize harvest autumn mulching am 2 film cover from maize sowing till harvest conventional practice spring mulching sm 3 no film cover no mulch nm field experiments were conducted in fuxin city khorchin region liaoning province china in 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 autumn mulching increased grain yield on average by 18 when compared to spring mulching and by 36 when compared to no mulching the 1000 kernel weight in am was 7 higher than in sm and 12 higher than in nm soil water content in the root zone before sowing was 35 mm greater in am than in sm and nm water uptake during the growing season was 34 mm greater in am than in sm and nm water use efficiency for grain yield yield per unit water uptake in am was on average 2 5 higher than in conventional mulching sm and 27 higher than in nm autumn mulching advanced development with an advance of 5 days in tasseling time as compared to sm and 10 days when compared to nm these results show that film cover during the fallow period before maize sowing can increase crop yield and water use efficiency and reduce climate risks in rain fed agriculture under semi arid conditions keywords film cover water availability yield components soil temperature 1 introduction maize zea mays l is one of the worldmost important cereals it is a major food and feed crop in china and 31 of the grain production amount occurs in the northeast region where maize is mainly rain fed with an average yield of 5 3 t ha 1 dong et al 2017 low spring temperatures and frequent summer droughts are limiting factors for yield in this region cai et al 2017 with global warming a drying trend with high variation of precipitation was reported piao et al 2010 and an increase in the frequency and severity of droughts was projected for northeast china xu et al 2013 song et al 2014 yu et al 2014 such changes would have a strong negative impact on future maize yield and yield stability misra 2014 zhu et al 2015 plastic film mulching decreases soil evaporation li et al 2013 tian et al 2003 wang et al 2008 it is a water saving measure that improves maize yield and yield stability in dryland agriculture and is widely applied in many countries but especially in china gan et al 2013 liu et al 2014a other water saving measures are also applied such as straw mulching tao et al 2015 conservation bench terraces sharda et al 2015 or contour furrows gebreegziabher et al 2009 the area of plastic film cover in china was approximately 20 million hectares in 2011 and it has increased by 7 1 per year in recent years liu et al 2014a film mulching can significantly improve crop yield and quality kar 2003 li et al 2004 luis et al 2011 ramakrishna et al 2006 wang et al 2008 film mulching accelerates growth and development daryanto et al 2017 and increases water use efficiency wue due to lower water loss through evaporation and a higher proportion of the water that is used for transpiration than would be the case without film cover wang et al 2008 zegada lizarazu and berliner 2011 li et al 2013 film mulching increases maize yield by 34 and wue by 39 across whole china liu et al 2014a soil temperature under film increases 1 6 3 5 c during early growth gan et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 resulting in rapid germination and seedling establishment wang et al 2005 zhao et al 2012 bhardwaj 2013 liu et al 2016 the effects of plastic film mulching differ with climate soil and management li et al 2001 ren et al 2008 zhang et al 2011 in semi arid northeast china 20 of the precipitation occurs during the fallow season in autumn and winter and part of this water is lost due to high soil evaporation caused by high wind speed and a bare soil surface li et al 2004 dong et al 2009 even if the average total precipitation in a whole year generally equals the crop water requirement approximately 500 mm the yearly and intra seasonal variation my still result in drought stress mostly mild drought stress during the summer cai et al 2017 rainfall during the maize growing season does not completely satisfy the demand of maize zhang et al 2014 especially not in dry years even when film cover is applied during the vegetation period jia et al 2017 the khorchin area of liaoning province in northeast china is suitable for rain fed maize growing from 1985 to 2015 the annual precipitation was 483 mm in whole year and the average precipitation during the crop growing season was 407 mm may to september the total rainfall during crop growing season is thus not enough for growing high yield maize we hypothesized that water availability water use efficiency and maize yield could be improved if the water loss during fallow season was reduced by the use of mulching film during the fallow season other advantages of mulching film during fallow season would be the alleviation of drought stress and an increase in soil temperature during early spring which would allow faster germination and earlier sowing thus lengthening the growing season a multi site and long term experiment in gansu northwest china showed that plastic film cover during winter and the crop growing season increased maize yield by 30 107 compared to a treatment without film cover wang et al 2016 on the other hand film cover at sowing and leaving the film at field during winter and the next crop in no tillage maize showed no significant yield increase compared to a no film control or a treatment with spring film cover from one month before sowing under conventional tillage in gansu liu et al 2009 a simulation study showed that plastic film mulching increased crop yield from 4 to 254 on the loess plateau of china when compared with no film control and highly associated with the condition of precipitation and air temperature zhang et al 2018 previous studies thus indicate variation in benefits of film cover during winter previous studies do not elucidate the role of film cover during the winter and leave questions about the effects of tillage difference effects of film mulch vary with climatic conditions there is no knowledge of the effects of film during the fallow season under the semi arid conditions of northeast china where farmers usually do not use film cover or only during the crop season because of a better hydrothermal condition than in northwest china to our knowledge this is the first study to test the use of film cover during the fallow period before sowing in this type of environment the objective of this study was to quantify crop growth development yield and water use efficiency of rain fed maize in a semi arid region when the film cover was applied during the previous autumn we used two reference treatments film mulching at sowing which is the current practice and a film free control 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design field experiments were conducted from october 2013 to september 2015 including two entire crop

out as a randomized complete block design with three replicates plot area was 50 m2 10 m in length 5 m in width three treatments were 1 plastic film mulching in the autumn after harvest of the previous crop autumn mulching am 2 plastic film mulching in spring before maize was sown spring mulching sm and 3 no film no mulching nm the plastic film was a locally produced common white film with a thickness of 0 008 mm the maize variety was zhengdan 958 the field was ploughed to 20 cm depth with a tractor mounted moldboard plough on 1 october fertilizer was applied in the autumn before film placement in the am treatment and in the spring before sowing in the other two treatments the old film in the am and sm treatments were removed at harvest row spacing was 50 cm and plant distance in a row was 33 3 cm resulting in a plant density of 6 plants m 2 the width of film was 100 cm covering two rows of maize and 10 cm for each side of film was buried in soil to fix the film resulting a soil cover ratio of 80 sowing date was 26 april and harvest date was 22 september in 2014 sowing date was 28 april and harvest date was 24 september in 2015 only basal fertilizer was applied in each treatment with ureophil 46 n 522 kg ha 1 superphosphate 1250 kg ha 1 12 p2o5 and potassium sulfate 147 kg ha 1 51 k2o no irrigation was given in both years herbicide acetochlor was applied before the application of film cover am and sm or sowing nm other management was the same as local farmer practice plots were at same place in the two experimental years 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 yield and dry matter yield was measured at harvest on 22 september in 2014 and 24 september in 2015 in a sub sampling area of 6 m2 2 m in width 3 m in length in the middle of each plot the grain was sun dried to a water content of 14 in each plot 10 plants were randomly selected within the sub sampling area to measure yield components ear density ear m 2 ear number per plant multiplying with plant density kernels per ear and 1000 kernel weight maize dry matter only above ground was determined in each plot by randomly harvesting 3 plants in a sub sampling area of 2 m2 1 m in width and 2 m in length during the crop growing season and 6 m2 same sampling as yield measurement at harvest time for final dry matter dry matter samplings were conducted five times on 29 may 19 june 29 july 15 august 22 september in 2014 and 8 june 30 june 28 july 20 august and 24 september in 2015 each sub sampling area was at least 1 m apart from previously sampled areas to avoid gap effects the samples were separated into stems leaves and reproductive organs and oven dried at 80 c for 48 h to constant weight harvest index hi was calculated as grain yield divided by final dry matter 2 2 2 soil moisture content and temperature soil moisture content was measured by taking soil cores between two rows in the middle of each plot using an auger five measurements were conducted in both years i in 2014 on 26 april sowing time 19 june 19 july 15 august and 22 september harvesting time ii in 2015 on 28 april sowing time 30 june 27 july 20 august and 24 september harvesting time soil cores were taken till 100 cm depth and cut in 10 cm slices for measuring gravimetric water content the samples were oven dried at 105 c for 48 h to constant weight the volumetric soil moisture content was used and calculated by multiplying gravimetric water content with soil bulk density the soil water storage in the 0 100 m root zone was calculated by summing soil moisture content over depths at each sampling time the water measurements in the 1 m upper soil layer though common in agronomic studies might not count total water use but represent a substantial part of the water use soil temperature was continuously monitored using temperature sensors of decagon 5tm decagon ec tm usa from 1 october 2013 to 24 september 2015 the sensors were placed at 5 cm soil depth between two rows in the middle of each plot data were recorded at one hour interval 2 3 calculated parameters water uptake wu mm during the growing season and the fallow period including evaporation from bare soil and transpiration by the crop was calculated using a simplified soil water balance equation 1 wu p sw where p mm is rainfall and sw is the change of soil water storage within the 0 100 cm root zone between the times of sowing and harvest use of a simplified equation was warranted because deep percolation and capillary rise of water do not often occur in semi arid rain fed agriculture and they are commonly ignored in calculating the water balance allen et al 1998 angus and van herwaarden 2001 chen et al 2015 moiwo and tao 2015 bai et al 2016 because of low rain intensity less than 50 mm for the maximum and deep water table the experimental plots were separated by brick walls 10 cm higher than soil surface therefore there was no surface runoff water use efficiency wue g m 2 mm 1 was calculated for each plot

11259,agricultural land use on slope areas is susceptible to nutrition loss via surface runoff which would result in negative impacts on downstream waters however the linkage between nutrition loss and off site crop production has been rarely reported a study was conducted in a small independent agroforestry watershed in subtropical hilly terrain of china nutrition loss via surface runoff was measured from cropland tea garden citrus orchard and natural woodland on a slope area grain production of rain fed uplands and irrigated rice paddies were also investigated results exhibited that the runoff and associated nutrient loss were substantially affected by land use patterns in general the cropland generated the highest runoff and associated nutrient loss followed by tea garden citrus orchard and woodland despite of land use patterns the descending order of nutrient elements losses was ca2 k so4 s tn total nitrogen mg2 tp total phosphorus irrigated rice paddies had a higher level of self sustainability of grain production compared with rain fed uplands which should be partially attributed to the nutrients input from irrigated water the results imply that the runoff harvesting for irrigation especially the runoff harvesting from agricultural land use patterns can increase crop production with extra nutrition input by irrigation and reduce nutrition load to downstream waters keywords land use pattern surface runoff crop production watershed level non point pollution 1 introduction hilly areas of south china with rich water and heat resources are mainly distributed in the subtropical monsoon region covering a total area of 134 300 km2 ouyang et al 2013 these areas abound in timber fruits tea and grain with continuous growth in population the demand for agricultural products has become increasingly larger however the replacement of natural vegetation by agriculture often results in increase of water erosion kateb et al 2013 a driving force for nutrient migration to surface waters hilly landscape comprises various watersheds in sizes and shapes where slopes account for a large proportion many studies have focused on water erosion on sloping cropland that is highly susceptible to water erosion due to extensive soil disturbance bouraima et al 2016 reza et al 2016 vaezi et al 2017a zhang et al 2016 however few studies have been conducted in orchard and tea ecosystems in south of china and nutrition loss via surface runoff is rarely reported land use patterns affect canopy cover surface litter and soil physical properties and consequently affect the runoff and soil erosion processes and associated nutrition loss dagnew et al 2017 jin et al 2009 montenegro et al 2013 zuazo and pleguezuelo 2008 therefore the magnitude of nutrition loss varies according to land use patterns the nutrition loss via runoff not only represents an important pathway of soil degradation but also leads to negative impacts on surface waters zhu et al 2012a the understanding of hot spots of nutrition loss from agricultural land use patterns will be conducive for non point source pollution control zhu et al 2012b for example runoff harvesting for irrigation can give priority to runoffs which are relatively rich in nutrient content increasing efforts have been made to control n and p loss in agricultural land such as in situ water harvesting techniques grum et al 2017 trench with grass mulch panigrahi et al 2017 contour hedgerow xia et al 2013 grass hedge wu et al 2010 and grass filter al wadaey et al 2012 however strategies on farm level or watershed level are rarely reported nutrition loss from slope lands may have positive impacts on crop production of irrigated cropland especially for rice paddies which need extensive irrigation king et al 2009 wu et al 2017 in general croplands are located in relatively low and flat places in hilly terrains the runoff from slope lands is the main source of irrigation water and the associated nutrition loss from slope lands may be an important nutrition source for irrigated crop so integrative strategies on farm level or watershed level are urgently needed to accomplish environmental and agronomic objectives simultaneously this study was conducted in a small agroforestry watershed in a subtropical hilly terrain of southern china the specific objectives of the research are to quantify the runoff and nutrition loss from different land use patterns to evaluate crop production of rain fed uplands and irrigated rice paddies to understand the linkage between crop production and nutrition loss from slope lands and thereby to optimize agricultural management practices for crop production and non point source pollution control 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was conducted at taoyuan agro ecological experimental station 28 55 n 111 27 e altitude 92 2 125 3 m which covers a small watershed in a typical hilly terrain in south of china the region is characterized by a subtropical humid monsoon climate with an annual average air temperature of 16 5 0 1 c and precipitation of 1354 98 mm from 2006 to 2010 the soil is developed from quaternary red clay the watershed mainly consists of gentle slopes 13 degrees generally rice paddies are located in valleys rich in water resources in contrast orchard tea garden dry cropland and natural woodland are in highlands or other places where water resource is inadequate for rice cultivation 2 2 experimental design this study consisted of two parts i surface runoff and nutrition loss from slope with different land use patterns and ii crop production of rice rice cropping systems and maize oilseed rape cropping systems the runoff observation plots were established in 1995 each plot extended from the top to the bottom of a slope 11 degrees covering a horizontal area of 50 m 20 m the treatments included citrus orchard tea garden cropland and natural woodland without replicated plots due to the limitation of the slope area the citrus orchard was planted with citrus trees the tea garden with tea trees the cropland with a rotation of maize oilseed rape sweet potato turnip every two years and the woodland was mainly covered by natural trees the citrus orchard the tea garden and the cropland were operated under conventional local management practices the fertilizers used in the runoff observation plots included urea superphosphate potassium chloride and compound fertilizer the annual amounts of fertilizers used in the cropland were approximately 150 kg n ha 1 25 kg p ha 1 and 75 kg k ha 1 the annual amounts of fertilizers used in the tea garden and the citrus orchard were approximately 75 96 kg n ha 1 22 28 kg p ha 1 and 62 80 kg k ha 1 the rice rice cropping plots were located in a valley and were initiated in 1990 with each plot covering an area of 33 m2 the treatments included unfertilized control ck paddy and conventional dose of chemical fertilizers npk paddy there were three replicated plots for ck paddy and npk paddy respectively the maize oilseed rape cropping plots were located in a flat upland and were initiated in 2006 with each plot covering an area of 46 m2 the treatments included unfertilized control ck upland and conventional dose of chemical fertilizers npk upland there were three replicated plots for npk upland and one replicated plot for ck upland the fertilizers included urea calcium superphosphate and potassium chloride the annual fertilizing rates were 182 kg n ha 1 39 3 kg p ha 1 and 198 kg k ha 1 for npk paddy and 341 kg n ha 1 91 7 kg p ha 1 and 420 kg k ha 1 for npk upland the paddy plots were primarily flooded by irrigation during each rice season in contrast the upland plots didn t receive any irrigation the general soil properties of these sites are listed in table 1 2 3 surface runoff and nutrition loss the surface runoff investigation was conducted from 2006 to 2010 there were a cement wall into soil to a depth of 50 cm and an intercepting ditch 10 20 cm in depth at the bottom side of each plot surface runoff was guided by the intercepting ditch into a sedimentation tank 1 m 1 m 1 m and a water tank 3 m 3 m 1 m the other three sides of each plot were surrounded by a cement wall into soil to a depth of 50 cm and above soil at a height of 30 cm the surface runoff volume was measured after every precipitation event water samples were filtered 0 45 μm and analyzed by an atomic absorption spectrometer analytik jena ag to determine the concentrations of k ca2 mg2 and so4 2 total n and total p were determined by digestion of original water samples using the potassium persulfate oxidation method and the molybdate colorimetric method respectively annual nutrient losses were obtained by multiplying the nutrient concentrations and the corresponding runoff volumes the crop at maturity stage in each plot was hand harvested grain samples were oven dried at 70 c and weighed with the grain yield being was determined on the basis of 14 water content 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed with spss 17 0 spss inc usa the effects of treatments on surface runoff and associated nutrition loss were analyzed using anova with the student newman keuls test as there were no replicated plots for each treatment the values of each year from 2006 to 2010 were treated as replicated values p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results 3 1 runoff and nutrition loss from slope lands surface runoff volumes variedgreatly due to different land use patterns fig 1 in general the surface runoff from the cropland plot was the highest 194 m3 ha 1 yr 1 which was 1 83 times that from the tea garden plot 3 81 times that from the citrus orchard plot and 13 82 times that from the woodland plot as with differences in the runoff the nutrient losses also varied greatly due to different land use patterns fig 2 in general the nutrient loss in the cropland plot was the highest followed by that in the tea garden and the citrus orchard plots the nutrition loss of which was close to each other the nutrient loss in the woodland plot was the lowest losses of different nutrient elements varied greatly from one another under all the treatments ca2 loss was higher than all the other five nutrient elements and varied from 0 35 kg ha 1 yr 1 in the woodland to 4 42 kg ha 1 yr 1 in the cropland total n k and so4 s losses were close to each other total n loss varied from 0 15 kg ha 1 yr 1 in the woodland to 0 83 kg ha 1 yr 1 in the cropland k loss varied from 0 20 kg ha 1 yr 1 in the woodland to 1 36 kg ha 1 yr 1 in the cropland so4 s loss varied from 0 11 kg ha 1 yr 1 in the woodland to 1 02 kg ha 1 yr 1 in the cropland total p loss was the lowest among different nutrient elements and varied from 0 01 kg ha 1 yr 1 in the woodland to 0 05 kg ha 1 yr 1 in the cropland mg2 losses were slightly higher than total p loss and varied from 0 02 kg ha 1 yr 1 in the woodland to 0 14 kg ha 1 yr 1 in the cropland 3 2 crop production of rice rice cropping system and maize oilseed rape cropping system crop production of rice rice cropping system from 1990 to 2010 is shown in fig 3 under the conventional fertilization rate the yield of early rice varied between 3290 7475 kg ha 1 with an average yield of 4837 kg ha 1 and the yield of late rice varied between 3334 6365 kg ha 1 with an average yield of 5119 kg ha 1 without any fertilizer the yield of early rice varied between 1408 3473 kg ha 1 with an average yield of 2497 kg ha 1 and the yield of late rice varied between 2082 4339 kg ha 1 with an average yield of 3476 kg ha 1 without any fertilizer the rice paddy system could maintain an annual yield of 5973 kg ha 1 reaching 60 of the yield of the treatment with the conventional fertilization rate moreover no obvious downtrend was observed in the yield of the treatment without any fertilizer crop production of maize oilseed rape cropping system from 2006 to 2010 is shown in fig 4 under the conventional fertilization rate the yield of maize varied between 2706 4826 kg ha 1 with an average yield of 3851 kg ha 1 and the yield of oilseed rape varied between 963 1943 kg ha 1 with an average yield of 1482 kg ha 1 without any fertilizer the yield of maize varied between 1114 1640 kg ha 1 with an average yield of 1295 kg ha 1 accounting for 40 of the yield of maize in the treatment under the conventional fertilization rate and the yield of oilseed rape varied between 67 782 kg ha 1 with an average yield of 522 kg ha 1 accounting for 38 of the yield of oilseed rape in the treatment under the conventional fertilization rate the results indicate that irrigated rice system could maintain a relatively high level of self sustainability in production without employing any fertilizer 4 discussion 4 1 surface runoff and nutrition loss from different land use patterns water erosion under different land use patterns was controlled virtually by plant cover and anthropogenic soil disturbance the vegetation influences erosion mainly by intercepting rainfall and runoff protecting soil surface against the impact of rainfall drops and improving soil aggregate stability and water infiltration zuazo and pleguezuelo 2008 vaezi et al 2017b lu et al 2016 agriculture land use patterns result in soil disturbance by tillage and or digging which leads to negative impact on soil aggregate stability dagnew et al 2017 in the present study the cropland plot was the most susceptible to water loss which is consistent with previous studies bouraima et al 2016 reza et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 the great runoff from the sloping cropland could be attributed to repeated tillage simple vegetation with low coverage moreover the fertilizer was mainly broadcast over the cropland leading to a great potential for nutrition loss in contrast the natural woodland had a multi layer of canopy cover trees shrubs grass and an increasing litter layer which could better intercept rainfall and runoff and protect the soil from raindrop erosion jin et al 2009 montenegro et al 2013 therefore small surface runoff could be observed in the natural woodland furthermore no fertilizer was employed so the nutrient loss via surface runoff was smallest in natural woodland since both the vegetation cover and the surface litter layer of the citrus orchard and the tea garden were much lower than that of the natural woodland their runoffs were higher than that of the natural woodland but lower than that of the cropland at the same time since the fertilization rate in the citrus orchard and the tea garden was lower than that in the cropland and the hole application was the primary fertilization mode the nutrient loss was lower than that in the cropland but higher than that in the natural woodland in the present study we estimated the losses of six chemical elements via surface runoff which ranked as ca2 k so4 2 s tn mg2 tp fig 2 n p and k are macroelements for plant growth which must be supplied by fertilization in agricultural land previous studies focused on n and p losses which contributed most to eutrophication in the present study the n and p losses via surface runoff varied respectively between 0 15 0 83 kg ha 1 yr 1 and 0 009 0 053 kg ha 1 yr 1 which were much lower compared with that in some previous studies liu et al 2012 xia et al 20153 xia et al 2015 but comparable with the values in hu et al 2013 slope gradient is one of the most key factors on runoff hu et al 2013 kateb et al 2013 vaezi et al 2017a since the slope was gentle in this study area the runoff volumes and associated nutrition loss were relatively small previous studies showed that the interflow is major pathway for nutrient loss zheng et al 2016 zhu et al 2009 wang and zhu 2011 the low surface runoff suggests that more water and nutrition might be transferred from the interflow in the present study wang and zhu 2011 estimated that annual losses of no3 n through the overland flow and the interflow were 0 9 and 33 5 kg n ha 1 respectively from a hill slope cropland in southwest of china ca s and mg are secondary nutrients for plant growth however the losses of ca2 so4 2 s and mg2 are rarely reported the ca2 loss was the highest fig 2 which could be related with the low soil ph in this area table 1 soil acidification can facilitate the ca2 loss with surface runoff and great amount of ca2 loss in turn may contribute to soil acidification mg is one of the essential elements for chlorophyll and other metabolic activities although the mg2 loss was relatively small fig 2 long term mg2 loss may result in soil degradation of slope lands 4 2 differential response of crop production of rice paddies and uplands to un fertilization in the present study the yield of rain fed maize oilseed rape cropping system without fertilizer was quite low accounting for 38 40 of the yield of treatment with conventional fertilization rate fig 4 in contrast the yield of irrigated rice rice cropping system without fertilizer reached 5973 kg ha 1 yr 1 accounting for 60 of the yield with conventional fertilization rate without any obvious downtrend in the yield fig 3 this suggests that the paddy ecosystem has a high self sustaining production rice paddies in subtropical china accumulated soc faster than uplands wu 2011 suggesting faster improvement of soil fertility of rice paddy that upland besides upland crop may have higher nutrition demand than rice and rain fed upland crop is prone to suffer drought than irrigated rice despite of different features among these crop systems the most possible reason could be that un negligible amount of nutrition was input into rice paddy through irrigation a long term investigation in this watershed showed that flooded rice cultivation required irrigation water of about 8000 m3 ha 1 yr 1 wu et al 2017 based on the nutrient content in runoffs from different land use patterns the rice paddies could obtain an average of 25 6 87 0 kg n ha 1 1 1 5 4 kg p ha 1 and 37 8 113 1 kg k ha 1 through irrigation with runoff water per year 4 3 implications for integrating agricultural and environmental management strategies non point source pollution from agricultural lands is a global problem for water environmental sustainability the transfer of excessive nutrient losses via surface runoff to downstream aquatic ecosystems will result in deterioration of water quality the harvesting of surface runoff can not only provide water resources for agricultural irrigation but also increase the nutrients for the cropland and reduce nutrient loss of the watershed climate change is expected to cause more frequent extreme weather events such as drought and rainstorms drought would result in the reduction of crop yield especially in rain fed uplands the non point source nitrogen and phosphorus come mainly from the storm runoff kleinman et al 2006 zhu et al 2009 2012a zhu et al 2012b on farm irrigation tanks can effectively increase agricultural return flow reuse and remove pollutants shao et al 2013 since surface runoff loss and nutrient loss were relative high from the cropland citrus orchard and tea garden fig 2 priority should be given to the harvesting of surface runoff from agricultural land use patterns in the present study the rice consumed less fertilizer than the maize but the yield of rice was higher than the yield of maize besides rice paddies can intercept runoff directly and thereby reduce the associated nutrition loss therefore in hilly areas we should increase irrigation tanks and enlarge the area of irrigated cropland especially rice paddies accordingly thus to reduce nutrition load to downstream rivers and improve the grain yield on watershed level 5 conclusions sustainable agriculture requires the integration of agricultural and environmental management strategies at a watershed level this study provided information on nutrition loss via different slope land use patterns and off site crop production of rain fed uplands and irrigated rice paddies in a small agroforestry watershed in the subtropical hilly terrain of southern china agricultural land uses especially the cropland were found to increase the surface runoff and nutrition loss compared with rain fed uplands the irrigated rice paddies had a higher level of self sustainability in grain production and the nutrition input by irrigation should be one important contributing factor to accomplish environmental and agronomic objectives simultaneously in hilly areas we should optimize their capacity of runoff harvesting for irrigation and the area of irrigated cropland accordingly thus to reduce nutrition load to downstream rivers and improve the grain yield on

measured from cropland tea garden citrus orchard and natural woodland on a slope area grain production of rain fed uplands and irrigated rice paddies were also investigated results exhibited that the

et al 2009 wang and zhu 2011 the low surface runoff suggests that more water and nutrition might be transferred from the interflow in the present study wang and zhu 2011 estimated that annual losses of no3 n through the overland flow and the interflow were 0 9 and 33 5 kg n ha 1 respectively from a hill slope cropland in southwest of china ca s and mg are secondary nutrients for plant growth however the losses of ca2 so4 2 s and mg2 are rarely reported the ca2 loss was the highest fig 2 which could be related with the low soil ph in this area table 1 soil acidification can facilitate the ca2 loss with surface runoff and great amount of ca2 loss in turn may contribute to soil acidification mg is one of the essential elements for chlorophyll and other metabolic activities although the mg2 loss was relatively small fig 2 long term mg2 loss may result in soil degradation of slope lands 4 2 differential response of crop production of rice paddies and uplands to un fertilization in the present study the yield of rain fed maize oilseed rape cropping system without fertilizer was quite low accounting for 38 40 of the yield of treatment with conventional fertilization rate fig 4 in contrast the yield of irrigated rice rice cropping system without fertilizer reached 5973 kg ha 1 yr 1 accounting for 60 of the yield with conventional fertilization rate without any obvious downtrend in the yield fig 3 this suggests that the paddy ecosystem has a high self sustaining production rice paddies in subtropical china accumulated soc faster than uplands wu 2011 suggesting faster improvement of soil fertility of rice paddy that upland besides upland crop may have higher nutrition demand than rice and rain fed upland crop is prone to suffer drought than irrigated rice despite of different features among these crop systems the most possible reason could be that un negligible amount of nutrition was input into rice paddy through irrigation a long term investigation in this watershed showed that flooded rice cultivation required irrigation water of about 8000 m3 ha 1 yr 1 wu et al 2017 based on the nutrient content in runoffs from different land use patterns the rice paddies could obtain an average of 25 6 87 0 kg n ha 1 1 1 5 4 kg p ha 1 and 37 8 113 1 kg k ha 1 through irrigation with runoff water per year 4 3 implications for integrating agricultural and environmental management strategies non point source pollution from agricultural lands is a global problem for water environmental sustainability the transfer of excessive nutrient losses via surface runoff to downstream aquatic ecosystems will result in deterioration of water quality the harvesting of surface runoff can not only provide water resources for agricultural irrigation but also increase the nutrients for the cropland and reduce nutrient loss of the watershed climate change is expected to cause more frequent extreme weather events such as drought and rainstorms drought would result in the reduction of crop yield especially in rain fed uplands the non point source nitrogen and phosphorus come mainly from the storm runoff kleinman et al 2006 zhu et al 2009 2012a zhu et al 2012b on farm irrigation tanks can effectively increase agricultural return flow reuse and remove pollutants shao et al 2013 since surface runoff loss and nutrient loss were relative high from the cropland citrus orchard and tea garden fig 2 priority should be given to the harvesting of surface runoff from agricultural land use patterns in the present study the rice consumed less fertilizer than the maize but the yield of rice was higher than the yield of maize besides rice paddies can intercept runoff directly and thereby reduce the associated nutrition loss therefore in hilly areas we should increase irrigation tanks and enlarge the area of irrigated cropland especially rice paddies accordingly thus to reduce nutrition load to downstream rivers and improve the grain yield on watershed level 5 conclusions sustainable agriculture requires the integration of agricultural and environmental management strategies at a watershed level this study provided information on nutrition loss via different slope land use patterns and off site crop production of rain fed uplands and irrigated rice paddies in a small agroforestry watershed in the subtropical hilly terrain of southern china agricultural land uses especially the cropland were found to increase the surface runoff and nutrition loss compared with rain fed uplands the irrigated rice paddies had a higher level of self sustainability in grain production and the nutrition input by irrigation should be one important contributing factor to accomplish environmental and agronomic objectives simultaneously in hilly areas we should optimize their capacity of runoff harvesting for irrigation and the area of irrigated cropland accordingly thus to reduce nutrition load to downstream rivers and improve the grain yield on
