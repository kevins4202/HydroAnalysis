22335,initial imperfections can greatly reduce critical buckling load of axially compressed thin walled cylindrical shells during the buckling process of a cylindrical shell the total potential energy of cylindrical shell can be divided into a constant linear component and a square nonlinear component in this study based on deriving the buckling load of a perfect cylindrical shell under axial compression the role of different stiffness reductions in the evaluation of stable load carrying capacity was assessed with reference to the reduction stiffness method rsm then the influence of initial axisymmetric defects on stiffness of each part of compressed cylindrical shell was discussed the mechanism by which axially symmetric initial imperfections affected the stability of axially compressed cylindrical shells was analyzed the results show that 1 initial axisymmetric defects affected the membrane stiffness of cylindrical shell 2 the stability carrying capacity of axially compressed cylindrical shell was reduced 3 the initial defect was amplified by the square of instability wavenumber of cylindrical shell hence a small defect could have a significant influence on stability carrying capacity of axially compressed cylindrical shell the results presented in this paper provide a useful reference for the design of axially compressed cylindrical shell structures keywords axial compression cylindrical shell axially symmetric defects reduction stiffness method load carrying capacity buckling 1 introduction thin walled cylindrical shell structures are widely used in various engineering fields example applications include submarines submersibles platform legs towers or chimneys and silos and hold up vessels which are subjected to different forms of loading the bearing capacity of these structures mainly depends on the buckling strength the evaluation of the buckling load has attracted the attention of many scientists and researchers cylindrical shell structures are often subjected to compressive stresses in the direction of the cylinder axis which can be either uniform or varying throughout the cylinder the buckling strength of a thin cylindrical shell under axial compression is particularly sensitive to imperfections in the shell the changing patterns of behavior with the changing geometry loading and boundary conditions make an axially compressed cylinder a classical exemplar for behaviors that may be found in a less marked form in other structures or in shells under other loading conditions teng and rotter 2004 for these reasons the reliable prediction of the buckling strength of thin walled cylindrical shells subjected to axial compression has been a major focus of past research qiao 2018 providing a wealth of evidence from both experimental and theoretical work structural members subjected to compression are susceptible to euler buckling and the euler buckling stress of a given quantity of material is at its greatest when all the material is placed as far as possible from the axis this makes thin cylindrical tubes or shells the most efficient forms for compression members however as a tube wall becomes thinner other local forms of buckling intervene and these shell buckling modes control the strength of thin walled cylinders the test results of the instability of a cylindrical shell are quite different from the euler buckling this is mainly due to the initial defects of the shell structures therefore in addition to the linear and nonlinear analytical theories numerical methods for studying the buckling loads of cylindrical shells have been executed e zhu et al 2001a proposed an empirical formula for calculating buckling stress of axially compressed cylindrical shells using the mathematical statistical analysis of a large volume of experimental data mao et al 2011 developed mathematical and parameterized finite element method fem optimization models for an orthogonal rib stiffened thin cylindrical shell under axial loading the analysis software package was used for the optimization calculation they discussed the impacts of the loads and yielding limits of the materials on the optimization design and the influence of the structural parameters on the buckling loads and modes wagner et al 2018 investigated the robust knockdown factors for the design of cylindrical shells under axial compression including stiffened and unstiffened cylinders due to the existence of initial defects the critical buckling load of axially compressed thin walled cylindrical shells actcs will be greatly reduced wang 2007 focused on the defects of the elastic buckling mode defects local defects integral roundness deviation and shell thickness deviation and used the finite element method to study the ultimate bearing capacity of the pressure spherical shells of manned submersibles with different design depths kougias 2009 focused on the defect form of a cylinder s non roundness and used the finite element method to study the stability bearing capacity of cylindrical shells under axial compression the results showed that the corresponding buckling capacity of the cylindrical shells could be reduced by 8 38 37 8 65 9 and 75 when the out of roundness of the thickness of the cylindrical shells was 1 10 50 and 100 respectively hao 2013 studied the sensitivity of the critical axial load of a stiffened cylindrical shell with inwardly concave and outwardly convex hyperbolic busbars with different amplitudes to the initial imperfection the results showed that the shape of the outward convex hyperbolic busbar exhibited low sensitivity to defects and the defect sensitivity of the structure could be reduced by making a convex shape liang et al 2019a 2019b and 2019c studied the dynamic behavior of cylindrical shells with arbitrary boundaries an analysis of the influences of boundaries on the time history response of cylindrical shells indicated that the peak displacement was closely related to the degrees of freedom of the boundaries the influences of the length radius ratios and the thickness radius ratios on the peak displacement were further investigated numerous studies of the stability of shell structures have been conducted in order to find reliable design criteria without carrying out an experimental study which has made the evaluation of shell structure more precise in mechanics performance reliability and robustness and enhanced the load carrying capacity of shell structures however the reduction factors of shell structures in design are more conservative than the test results the influence of the boundary conditions shell parameters and defects is neglected thus it is necessary to develop a reliable method for analyzing the instability of a shell structure with imperfections a reduced stiffness method rsm was put forward by croll 2006 to evaluate the lower buckling limit of cylindrical shells that were subjected to different forms of loading this method provides a good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental observations rapid development has been achieved since the rsm method was proposed jaca et al 2007 used the stiffness reduction method srm to study the buckling problem of an open cylindrical vessel under a wind load the results showed that the buckling lower bound obtained using this method was in good agreement with that obtained using nonlinear analysis considering the initial defects the result was in good agreement with the data from their tests wang and croll 2008 applied the srm to optimize the load carrying capacity of the lower buckling boundary of a shell the results showed that the optimization improved the buckling critical load within the given material and geometric parameters sosa and godoy 2010 used the srm to analyze the initial defect sensitivity of a vessel with a conical tip under a wind load the lower bound of the buckling critical load was obtained and the results were compared with the static nonlinear analysis of the same model li 2014 applied the srm to study the influence of axisymmetric initial defects local dents and non axisymmetric defects on the stability of cylindrical shells under hydrostatic pressure based on previous studies the stability bearing capacity of axially compressed cylindrical shells was further analyzed using srm bai et al 2015 analyzed the load carrying capacity of cylindrical shells with axisymmetric initial imperfections under hydrostatic pressure the results indicated that the imperfections induced reductions in the axial bending stiffness and the stability load carrying of the cylindrical shells bai et al 2017 analyzed the impact of stiffness reduction on the load carrying capacity of ring ribbed cylindrical shells the results showed that the circumferential membrane stiffness had the greatest influence on the stability of the cylindrical shells in contrast the axial bending stiffness had little impact on the stability of the cylindrical shells this paper focuses on the investigation of the effects of different stiffnesses on the stability of cylindrical shells that were subjected to axial compression the total potential energies of the cylindrical shells that were subjected to axial compression that affected their stability are clarified in this paper this potential energy includes a constant component and linear and high order nonlinear components based on the derivation of the cylindrical shell buckling load the stiffness was divided into the membrane stiffness bending stiffness and geometric stiffness influenced by the external force the stiffness reduction factor method was then applied in order to estimate each stiffness in the evaluation of the stable load carrying capacity of a cylindrical shell that was subjected to axial compression the effect of the axially symmetric defects on the membrane stiffness was analyzed the carrying capacity of the structures after stiffness reduction is also discussed in this paper 2 buckling load of a cylindrical shell under axial compression with complete stiffness an intact thin walled cylindrical shell subjected to uniform axial pressure was considered as shown in fig 1 its length l wall thickness t radius r external uniform axial pressure p elastic modulus of material e and displacement u v w were known according to thin shell theory the membrane solution of a cylindrical shell under the pre buckling stress state condition can be obtained as follows 1 σ x f σ θ f p 0 2 e x f e θ f p e μ p e where σ x f and σ θ f are the axial and circumferential stresses of a cylindrical shell in the pre buckling state respectively and e x f and e θ f are the axial and circumferential strains of a cylindrical shell in the pre buckling state respectively in contrast to the pre buckling stress state of the membrane the equilibrium state after buckling can be obtained in the form of the superposition of the displacement increment in the stress state of the membrane 3 u u σ f u v v σ f v w w σ f w where u σ f v σ f and w σ f represent the axial displacements circumferential displacements and radial displacements of a cylindrical shell subjected to axial pressure in the pre buckling state u v and w are the displacement increments of a cylindrical shell in the post buckling state relative to the pre buckling state in the post buckling state the total stress strain bending moment and rotational angle of the structure can be written in the following form 4 σ x σ x f n x σ θ σ θ f n θ σ x θ σ x θ f n x θ n x θ e x

show the total stress strain moment and angle of the cylindrical shell buckled on the left the stress strain moment and angle before buckling are represented by the first term on the right the second items are the increments of the post buckling relative to the pre buckling the strain of a cylindrical shell subjected to uniform axial pressure is divided into linear components ε x ε θ ε x θ and nonlinear components ε x ε θ ε x θ the corresponding stress can also be expressed as the combination of linear components n x n θ n x θ and nonlinear components n x n θ n x θ subsequently the total potential energy of the cylindrical shell in the buckling state can be expressed as 5 v v 0 v 1 v 2 where the third order terms and other higher order terms are neglected 6 v 0 1 2 0 l 0 2 π n x f e x

represents the total potential energy of a cylindrical shell in the pre buckling state v 1 is the linear total potential energy according to bai et al 2017 eqs 6 and 7 are both equal to 0 in the film state eq 8 is the nonlinear strain energy of a thin membrane and it is determined by the nonlinear relationship between the strain and the displacement it is the key to determining the instability of cylindrical shells subjected to uniform axial compression the first integral of eq 8 is the membrane strain energy v m the sum of the strain energy of axial circumferential and torsional thin films the second integral is the bending strain energy v b the sum of the bending strain energy in the axial circumferential and torsional directions the third integral is the nonlinear membrane strain energy v 2m these terms are determined by the non linear relationship between the strain and the displacement in which the pre buckling stress is taken as the coefficient which shows that the pre buckling stress state has a certain influence on the critical buckling load of the shell structure according to the geometric equations of a linear cylindrical shell using the donnell approximation croll and gavrilenko 2000 and the signal rules of stress and strain in fig 1 the geometrical equations of a cylindrical shell under axial compression can be expressed as 9 ε x u x γ x 2 w x 2 ε θ 1 r

of the stress it is assumed that the two ends of the shell are freely supported on the rigid perimeter and the displacement of the cylindrical shell that satisfies the above conditions can be selected as 12 u u i j cos i θ cos j π x l v v i j sin i θ sin j π x l w w i j cos i θ cos j π x l where i represents the wave numbers along the circumferential direction and j represents the half wave numbers along the axial direction u ij v ij and w ij are arbitrary constants applying the cylindrical shell geometry equation and hooke s law in bai et al 2017 the membrane strain energy v m the bending

perfect thin walled cylindrical shell subjected to uniform axial pressure can be obtained by summing eq 14 16 according to the stability condition of the shell structure u ij v ij and w ij should be arbitrary constants in eq 12 and the following relationships should be satisfied 17 v 2 u i j 0 v 2 v i j 0 v 2 w i j 0 in this manner solving the stability problem of the cylindrical shell can be transformed into the following eigenvalue equation 18 a 11 a 12 a 13 a 21 a 22 a 23 a 31 a 32 a 33 u i j v i j w i j 0 where a i j a i j λ a i j has the following form 19 a 11 λ 2 1 2 1 μ i 2 a 12 1 2

to 0 hence the analytical expression of the critical instability load of a smooth cylindrical shell subjected to uniform axial pressure can be obtained 20 λ 1 μ 2 λ 4 i 2 λ 2 2 i 2 λ 2 2 α 1 μ 2 λ 2 applying eq 20 it is assumed that the determinant of the coefficient matrix is equal to 0 so the buckling load of smooth cylindrical shells subjected to uniform axial pressure can be obtained fig 2 shows the spectrum of the critical buckling stress when assuming the same structural parameters as those of bai et al 2017 j 1 5 l 2 88 r 300 μ 0 3 it can be found that a cylindrical shell subjected to uniform axial pressure could have a variety of unstable modes but that the critical load of the instability was unique in other words it had nothing to do with the unstable modes this result is consistent with the classical theoretical solution of enchun zhu et al 2001b which is expressed as σ cr 1 21 e h d σ cr is the instability stress h is the shell thickness and d is the shell diameter the buckling critical loads of cylindrical shells with different l and r subjected to uniform axial pressure are shown in fig 3 figs 3 and 4 show that the buckling load of the cylindrical shell subjected to axial uniform pressure was related to the ratio r of the radius and the thickness of the cylindrical shell it was independent of the ratio l of the length and radius therefore the minimum value in eq 20 was found as 21 λ 1 3 1 μ 2 1 r eq 21 is consistent with the classical elastic critical stress formula at present many studies regarding the calculation formulas and numerical analyses for the buckling load of a cylindrical shell under axial compression have been proposed by many researchers the comparison of some of the formulas with the obtained results is given in the present work the classical critical buckling load of the total stability for a cylindrical shell under axial compression can be determined as qian et al 2018 p cl e t r 3 1 μ 2 0 605 e t r a comparison of the calculation results using different methods including the classical critical buckling load the finite element method and the present method is listed in table 1 the parameters used in the comparison were length of the cylindrical shell l 0 9200 mm radius inner radius of the cylindrical shell r 875 mm and thickness t 24 mm from table 1 it can be seen that the calculation result in the present method was lower than the classical critical buckling load by about 8 17 and lower than the result of the finite element method by about 2 7 therefore the calculation results in the present method can be regarded as stable and they can be applied in realistic research work 3 effect of the structural parameters on the total stability of a cylindrical shell under axial compression the relationship between the stiffness and the critical buckling load of cylindrical shells under uniform axial pressure was analyzed using a membrane stiffness reduction factor β β 1 and bending stiffness reduction factor ξ ξ 1 the term v 2 in the total potential energy is written as 22 v 2 0 l 0 2 π v m v b λ v 2 m σ r d θ d x according to the stability conditions of the shell structure the stability problem of the cylindrical shell under hydrostatic pressure can be reduced to solving the eigenvalue problem of the characteristic equation 23 k m k b λ c k g φ 0 where k m k b and k g are the membrane stiffness matrix bending stiffness matrix and geometric stiffness matrix respectively λ c and φ are the eigenvalue and the eigenvector which correspond to the buckling load and the buckling mode of the cylindrical shell respectively when the stiffness of the cylindrical shell is reduced eq 23 should be written as 24 β k m ξ k b λ k g φ 0 where λ and φ are the new eigenvalue and eigenvectors after the stiffness is reduced therefore the coefficient in eq 19 becomes 25 a 11 β λ 2 β 2 1 μ i 2 a 12 β 2 1 μ i λ a 22 β i 2 β 2 1 μ λ 2 a 23 β i a 13 β μ λ a 33 ξ α i 2 λ 2 2 β a 23 1 μ 2 λ 2 a 11 a 22

reduction of the membrane stiffness and the bending stiffness affected the instability mode of the axially compressed cylindrical shell the circumferential wave number decreased with the decrease of the membrane stiffness and increased with the decrease of the bending stiffness when the axially compressed cylindrical shell was unstable 4 buckling of axial compressed cylindrical shells with axially symmetric defects based on rsm this section describes the use of different stiffness reduction factors to analyze the relationship of all the stiffness and critical buckling loads of cylindrical shells with axially symmetric defects under axial compression a cylindrical shell with axisymmetric initial defects was considered as shown in fig 7 the length l of the cylindrical shell the radius r the amplitude w 0 of the initial defect the curvature ρ of the defect the hydrostatic pressure p and the thickness t of the shell were known see fig 8 w 0 was small relative to the radius r and its impact on the stress distribution of the cylindrical shell was ignored the stress and strain of cylindrical shells before buckling are given by eqs 1 and 2 the geometric equation is as follows 28 ε x u x w ρ γ x 2 w x 2 w ρ 2 ε θ 1 r v θ w r γ θ 1 r 2 2 w θ 2 ε x θ 1 2 v θ 1 r u θ γ x θ 1 r 2 w x θ ε θ 1 2 r 2 w θ 2 according to section 2 the membrane strain energy v m bending strain energy v b and nonlinear thin membrane strain energy v 2m can be obtained substituting eqs 28 and 10 12 into the first second and third integrals of eq 8 separately then 29 2 l 0 l sin 2 j π x

cylindrical shells with defects under uniform axial pressure can be obtained by summing eq 30 32 from the stability condition of the shell eq 17 the coefficient of the coefficient determinant eq 18 is obtained 33 a 11 λ 2 1 2 1 μ i 2 a 12 1 2 1 μ i λ a 22 i 2 1 2 1 μ λ 2 a 23 i μ i r a 13 μ λ λ r a 33 1 α i 2 λ 2 2 1 α r 4 2 λ 2 r 2 2 μ i 2 r 2 1 r 2 2 μ r a 11 a 22 a 13 a 23 a 12 0 a 33 1 μ 2 λ 2 applying the coefficients in eq 33 the instability critical load formula of the axially symmetric defective cylindrical shell subjected to axial uniform pressure is given by 34 λ i 2 r λ 2 2 i 2 λ 2 2 i 2 λ 2 2 2 μ i 2 r 2 2 r 2 λ 2 r 4 α 1 μ 2 λ 2 next the impact of the initial defects on membrane stiffness and bending stiffness was analyzed equation 34 can be written as 35 λ a 1 λ 2 2 i 2 λ 2 2 i 2 λ 2 2 a 2 α 1 μ 2 λ 2 where 36 a 1 i 2 r a 2 2 μ i 2 r 2 2 r 2 λ 2 r 4 let a 1 a 2 0 the impact of axisymmetric initial defects on the stiffness of the axially compressed cylindrical shells was also analyzed fig 9 shows that the impact of a 2 on the cylindrical shell was small and negligible therefore eq 35 can be simplified to 37 λ i 2 r λ 2 2 i 2 λ 2 2 i 2 λ 2 2 α 1 μ 2 λ 2 equation 37 shows that the axisymmetric initial defect was the quadratic amplification of the axial wavenumber when the cylindrical shell was destabilized therefore small initial defects had a great impact on the stability of the cylindrical shells the buckling load diagram was obtained by applying eq 37 and it is shown in fig 10 fig 11 is different from the instability mode of axially compressed cylindrical shells without defects when the longitudinal instability wavenumber was 1 the buckling load of the axially compressed cylindrical shell containing the axially symmetric initial defect had a minimum value comparing eqs 37 and 27 when the axially symmetric defective cylindrical shell was subjected to axial uniform pressure the relationship between the membrane stiffness reduction factor and the axisymmetric initial defect was as follows 38 β i 4 r 2 2 i 2 λ 2 r λ 4 λ 4 fig 12 shows the relationship between the membrane stiffness reduction factor and the axially symmetric initial defect when the cylindrical shell with axially symmetric defects was subjected to axial uniform pressure the diagram shows that the stiffness reduction coefficient of the membrane decreased with the increase of the initial defect the diagram also shows that the reduction coefficient of the membrane stiffness was reduced to 0 when the initial defect exceeded a certain value figs 13 and 14 show that the initial axisymmetric defects were more sensitive to the ratio r of the radius to the thickness the axisymmetric defects mainly affected the film stiffness of the cylindrical shell its influence on the bending stiffness was negligible and could be ignored the stiffness reduction coefficient of the film decreased with the increase of the initial defect and its minimum value could be close to 0 according to eq 37 it can be seen that the defects of the cylindrical shell were only related to molecular terms therefore in eq 38 the coexistence of positive and negative numbers in i made the reduction coefficient the same in addition it was beyond the scope of the initial defect of the thin shell when the ratio of the defect to the radius was too large hence fig 13 only needs to describe the curve before the deduction factor equal to 0 5 conclusions the total potential energy of a perfect cylindrical shell under axial compression is divided into constant component linear component and square nonlinear component the total potential energy item that affects the stable load is clarified and based on the derivation of the critical load equation for cylindrical shells under uniform axial compression the critical load equations of axially compressed cylindrical shells with stiffness reduction coefficients were obtained then the impacts of stiffness on the critical loads of cylindrical shells under compression are discussed in this paper the critical load equation of a cylindrical shell with axisymmetric defects was also derived and the relationship between the initial defect and the stiffness reduction coefficient was obtained the conclusions are as follows 1 a cylindrical shell subjected to uniform axial pressure could have a variety of unstable modes and the critical load of the instability was unique it is different from the instability characteristics of cylindrical shell under static pressure 2 for the stability of the circumferentially compressed cylindrical shell the reduction in stiffness affected the instability mode of the axially compressed cylindrical shell the circumferential wave number decreased with the decrease of the membrane stiffness and increased with the decrease of the bending stiffness 3 the axisymmetric defects mainly influenced the membrane stiffness of the axially compressed cylindrical shells and had little impact on the bending stiffness which could be ignored the stiffness reduction coefficient of the film and the buckling load of the shell both decreased with the radius of the cylinder under certain initial defect conditions 4 the axisymmetric initial defects influenced the reduction of the membrane stiffness through the quadratic amplification of the unstable wavenumber of the cylindrical shells therefore small initial defects will have a greater impact on the stable bearing capacity of cylindrical shells declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

keywords axial compression cylindrical shell axially symmetric defects reduction stiffness method load carrying capacity buckling 1 introduction thin walled cylindrical shell structures are widely used in various engineering fields example applications include submarines submersibles platform legs towers or chimneys and silos and hold up vessels which are subjected to different forms of loading the bearing capacity of these structures mainly depends on the buckling strength the evaluation of the buckling load has attracted the attention of many scientists and researchers cylindrical shell structures are often subjected to compressive stresses in the direction of the cylinder axis which can be either uniform or varying throughout the cylinder the buckling strength of a thin cylindrical shell under axial compression is particularly sensitive to imperfections in the shell the changing patterns of behavior with the changing geometry loading and boundary conditions make an axially compressed cylinder a classical exemplar for behaviors that may be found in a less marked form in other structures or in shells under other loading conditions teng and rotter 2004 for these reasons the reliable prediction of the buckling strength of thin walled cylindrical shells subjected to axial compression has been a major focus of past research qiao 2018 providing a wealth of evidence from both experimental and theoretical work structural members subjected to compression are susceptible to euler buckling and the euler buckling stress of a given quantity of material is at its greatest when all the material is placed as far as possible from the axis this makes thin cylindrical tubes or shells the most efficient forms for compression members however as a tube wall becomes thinner other local forms of buckling intervene and these shell buckling modes control the strength of thin walled cylinders the test results of the instability of a cylindrical shell are quite different from the euler buckling this is mainly due to the initial defects of the shell structures therefore in addition to the linear and nonlinear analytical theories numerical methods for studying the buckling

load of a stiffened cylindrical shell with inwardly concave and outwardly convex hyperbolic busbars with different amplitudes to the initial imperfection the results showed that the shape of the outward convex hyperbolic busbar exhibited low sensitivity to defects and the defect sensitivity of the structure could be reduced by making a convex shape liang et al 2019a 2019b and 2019c studied the dynamic behavior of cylindrical shells with arbitrary boundaries an analysis of the influences of boundaries on the time history response of cylindrical shells indicated that the peak displacement was closely related to the degrees of freedom of the boundaries the influences of the length radius ratios and the thickness radius ratios on the peak displacement were further investigated numerous studies of the stability of shell structures have been conducted in order to find reliable design criteria without carrying out an experimental study which has made the evaluation of shell structure more precise in mechanics performance reliability and robustness and enhanced the load carrying capacity of shell structures however the reduction factors of shell structures in design are more conservative than the test results the influence of the boundary conditions shell parameters and defects is neglected thus it is necessary to develop a reliable method for analyzing the instability of a shell structure with imperfections a reduced stiffness method rsm was put forward by croll 2006 to evaluate the lower buckling limit of cylindrical shells that were subjected to different forms of loading this method provides a good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental observations rapid development has been achieved since the rsm method was proposed jaca et al 2007 used the stiffness reduction method srm to study the buckling problem of an open cylindrical vessel under a wind load the results showed that the buckling lower bound obtained using this method was in good agreement with that obtained using nonlinear analysis considering the initial defects the result was in good agreement with the data from their tests wang and croll 2008 applied the srm to optimize the load carrying capacity of the lower buckling boundary of a shell the results showed that the optimization improved the buckling critical load within the given material and geometric parameters sosa and godoy 2010 used the srm to analyze the initial defect sensitivity of a vessel with a conical tip under a wind load the lower bound of the buckling critical load was obtained and the results were compared with the static nonlinear analysis of the same model li 2014 applied the srm to study the influence of axisymmetric initial defects local dents and non axisymmetric defects on the stability of cylindrical shells under hydrostatic pressure based on previous studies the stability bearing capacity of axially compressed cylindrical shells was further analyzed using srm bai et al 2015 analyzed the load carrying capacity of cylindrical shells with axisymmetric initial imperfections under hydrostatic pressure the results indicated that the imperfections induced reductions in the axial bending stiffness and the stability load carrying of the cylindrical shells bai et al 2017 analyzed the impact of stiffness reduction on the load carrying capacity of ring ribbed cylindrical shells the results showed that the circumferential membrane stiffness had the greatest influence on the stability of the cylindrical shells in contrast the axial bending stiffness had little impact on the stability of the cylindrical shells this paper focuses on the investigation of the effects of different stiffnesses on the stability of cylindrical shells that were subjected to axial compression the total potential energies of the cylindrical shells that were subjected to axial compression that affected their stability are clarified in this paper this potential energy includes a constant component and linear and high order nonlinear components based on the derivation of the cylindrical shell buckling load the stiffness was divided into the membrane stiffness bending stiffness and geometric stiffness influenced by the external force the stiffness reduction factor method was then applied in order to estimate each stiffness in the evaluation of the stable load carrying capacity of a cylindrical shell that was subjected to axial compression the effect of the axially symmetric defects on the membrane stiffness was analyzed the carrying capacity of the structures after stiffness reduction is also discussed in this paper 2 buckling load of a cylindrical shell under axial compression with complete stiffness an intact thin walled cylindrical shell subjected to uniform

cylindrical shell subjected to axial pressure in the pre buckling state u v and w are the displacement increments of a cylindrical shell in the post buckling state relative to the pre buckling state in the post buckling state the total stress strain bending moment and rotational angle of the structure can be written in the following form 4 σ x σ x f n x σ θ σ θ f n θ σ x θ σ x θ f n x θ n x θ e x

state eq 8 is the nonlinear strain energy of a thin membrane and it is determined by the nonlinear relationship between the strain and the displacement it is the key to determining the instability of cylindrical shells subjected to uniform axial compression the first integral of eq 8 is the membrane strain energy v m the sum of the strain energy of axial circumferential and torsional thin films the second integral is the bending strain energy v b the sum of the bending strain energy in the axial circumferential and torsional directions the third integral is the nonlinear membrane strain energy v 2m these terms are determined by the non linear relationship between the strain and the displacement in which the pre buckling stress is taken as the coefficient which shows that the pre buckling stress state has a certain influence on the critical buckling load of the shell structure according to the geometric equations of a linear cylindrical shell using the donnell approximation croll and gavrilenko 2000 and the signal rules of stress and strain in fig 1 the geometrical equations of a cylindrical shell under axial compression can be expressed as 9 ε x u x γ x 2 w x 2 ε θ 1 r

to 0 hence the analytical expression of the critical instability load of a smooth cylindrical shell subjected to uniform axial pressure can be obtained 20 λ 1 μ 2 λ 4 i 2 λ 2 2 i 2 λ 2 2 α 1 μ 2 λ 2 applying eq 20 it is assumed that the determinant of the coefficient matrix is equal to 0 so the buckling load of smooth cylindrical shells subjected to uniform axial pressure can be obtained fig 2 shows the spectrum of the critical buckling stress when assuming the same structural parameters as those of bai et al 2017 j 1 5 l 2 88 r 300 μ 0 3 it can be found that a cylindrical shell subjected to uniform axial pressure could have a variety of unstable modes but that the critical load of the instability was unique in other words it had nothing to do with the unstable modes this result is consistent with the classical theoretical solution of enchun zhu et al 2001b which is expressed as σ cr 1 21 e h d σ cr is the instability stress h is the shell thickness and d is the shell diameter the buckling critical loads of cylindrical shells with different l and r subjected to uniform axial pressure are shown in fig 3 figs 3 and 4 show that the buckling load of the cylindrical shell subjected to axial uniform pressure was related to the ratio r of the radius and the thickness of the cylindrical shell it was independent of the ratio l of the length and radius therefore the minimum value in eq 20 was found as 21 λ 1 3 1 μ 2 1 r eq 21 is consistent with the classical elastic critical stress formula at present many studies regarding the calculation formulas and numerical analyses for the buckling load of a cylindrical shell under axial compression have been proposed by many researchers the comparison of some of the formulas with the obtained results is given in the present work the classical critical buckling load of the total stability for a cylindrical shell under axial compression can be determined as qian et al 2018 p cl e t r 3 1 μ 2 0 605 e t r a comparison of the

were length of the cylindrical shell l 0 9200 mm radius inner radius of the cylindrical shell r 875 mm and thickness t 24 mm from table 1 it can be seen that the calculation result in the present method was lower than the classical critical buckling load by about 8 17 and lower than the result of the finite element method by about 2 7 therefore the calculation results in the present method can be regarded as stable and they can be applied in realistic research work 3 effect of the structural parameters on the total stability of a cylindrical shell under axial compression the relationship between the stiffness and the critical buckling load of cylindrical shells under uniform axial pressure was analyzed using a membrane stiffness reduction factor β β 1 and bending stiffness reduction

reduction of the membrane stiffness and the bending stiffness affected the instability mode of the axially compressed cylindrical shell the circumferential wave number decreased with the decrease of the membrane stiffness and increased with the decrease of the bending stiffness when the axially compressed cylindrical shell was unstable 4 buckling of axial compressed cylindrical shells with axially symmetric defects based on rsm this section describes the use of different stiffness reduction factors to analyze the relationship of all the stiffness and critical buckling loads of cylindrical shells with axially symmetric defects under axial compression a cylindrical shell with axisymmetric initial defects was considered as shown in fig 7 the length l of the cylindrical shell the radius r the amplitude w 0 of the initial defect the curvature ρ of the defect the hydrostatic pressure p and the thickness t of the shell were known see fig 8 w 0 was small relative to the radius r and its impact on the stress distribution of the cylindrical shell was ignored the stress and strain of cylindrical shells before buckling are given by eqs 1 and 2 the geometric equation is as

obtained 33 a 11 λ 2 1 2 1 μ i 2 a 12 1 2 1 μ i λ a 22 i 2 1 2 1 μ λ 2 a 23 i μ i r a 13 μ λ λ r a 33 1 α i 2 λ 2 2 1 α r 4 2 λ 2 r 2 2 μ i 2 r 2 1 r 2 2 μ r a 11 a 22 a 13 a 23 a 12 0 a 33 1 μ 2 λ 2 applying the coefficients in eq 33 the instability critical load formula of the axially symmetric defective cylindrical shell subjected to axial uniform pressure is given by 34 λ i 2 r λ 2 2 i 2 λ 2 2 i 2 λ 2 2 2 μ i 2 r 2 2 r 2 λ 2 r 4 α 1 μ 2 λ 2 next the impact of the initial defects on membrane stiffness and bending stiffness was analyzed equation 34 can be written as 35 λ a 1 λ 2 2 i 2 λ 2 2 i 2 λ 2 2 a 2 α 1 μ 2 λ 2 where 36 a 1 i 2 r a 2 2 μ i 2 r 2 2 r 2 λ 2 r 4 let a 1 a 2 0 the impact of axisymmetric initial defects on the stiffness of the axially compressed cylindrical shells was also analyzed fig 9 shows that the impact of a 2 on the cylindrical shell was small and negligible therefore eq 35 can be simplified to 37 λ i 2 r λ 2 2 i 2 λ 2 2 i 2 λ 2 2 α 1 μ 2 λ 2 equation 37 shows that the axisymmetric initial defect was the quadratic amplification of the axial wavenumber when the cylindrical shell was destabilized therefore small initial defects had a great impact on the stability of the cylindrical shells the buckling load diagram was obtained by applying eq 37 and it is shown in fig 10 fig 11 is different from the instability mode of axially compressed cylindrical shells without defects when the longitudinal instability wavenumber was 1 the buckling load of the axially compressed cylindrical shell containing the axially symmetric initial defect had a minimum value comparing eqs 37 and 27 when the axially symmetric defective cylindrical shell was subjected to axial uniform pressure the relationship between the membrane stiffness reduction factor and the axisymmetric initial defect was as follows 38 β i 4 r 2 2 i 2 λ 2 r λ 4 λ 4 fig 12 shows the relationship between the membrane stiffness reduction factor and the axially symmetric initial defect when the cylindrical shell with axially symmetric defects was subjected to axial uniform pressure the diagram shows that the stiffness reduction coefficient of the membrane decreased with the increase of the initial defect the diagram also shows that the reduction coefficient of the membrane stiffness was reduced to 0 when the initial defect exceeded a certain value figs 13 and 14 show that the initial axisymmetric defects were more sensitive to the ratio r of the radius to the thickness the axisymmetric defects mainly affected the film stiffness of the cylindrical shell its influence on the bending stiffness was negligible and could be ignored the stiffness reduction coefficient of the film decreased with the increase of the initial defect and its minimum value could be close to 0 according to eq 37 it can be seen that the defects of the cylindrical shell were only related to molecular terms therefore in eq 38 the coexistence of positive and negative numbers in i made the reduction coefficient the same in addition it was beyond the scope of the initial defect of the thin shell when the ratio of the defect to the radius was too large hence fig 13 only needs to describe the curve before the deduction factor equal to 0 5 conclusions the total potential energy of a perfect cylindrical shell under axial compression is divided into constant component linear component and square nonlinear component the total potential energy item that affects the stable load is clarified and based on the derivation of the critical load equation for cylindrical shells under uniform axial compression the critical load equations of axially compressed cylindrical shells with stiffness reduction coefficients were obtained then the impacts of stiffness on the critical loads of cylindrical shells under compression are discussed in this paper the critical load equation of a cylindrical shell with axisymmetric defects was also derived and the relationship between the initial defect and the stiffness reduction coefficient was obtained the conclusions are as follows 1 a cylindrical shell subjected to uniform axial pressure could have a variety of unstable modes and the critical load of the instability was unique it is different from the instability characteristics of cylindrical shell under static pressure 2 for the stability of the circumferentially compressed cylindrical shell the reduction in stiffness affected the instability mode of the axially compressed cylindrical shell the circumferential wave number decreased with the decrease of the membrane stiffness and increased with the decrease of the bending stiffness 3 the axisymmetric defects mainly influenced the membrane stiffness of the axially compressed cylindrical shells and had little impact on the bending stiffness which could be ignored the stiffness reduction coefficient of the film and the buckling load of the shell both decreased with the radius of the cylinder under certain initial defect conditions 4 the axisymmetric initial defects influenced the reduction of the membrane stiffness through the quadratic amplification of the unstable wavenumber of the cylindrical shells therefore small initial defects will have a greater impact on the stable bearing capacity of cylindrical shells declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

22336,flow induced vibrations fiv of two tandem cylinders are the major concerns in many engineering fields however little attention is paid to the fiv mechanisms of two tandem flexible cylinders especially for the hydrodynamic features to investigate the fiv hydrodynamic characteristic of two tandem flexible cylinders the fluid forces on the flexible cylinders were reconstructed by a finite element model using the response displacements acquired from model tests considering the coupling effect of multi frequency vibrations the lift coefficients varying drag coefficients cross flow cf and in line il added mass coefficients were obtained utilizing the forgetting factor least squares ff ls method to investigate the influence of the spacing ratio t d where t is the center to center separation distance between the two cylinders and d is the cylinder diameter on the fiv hydrodynamic features five spacing ratios t d 4 0 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 were considered the upstream cylinder and the single cylinder have cf hydrodynamic coefficients that share similar trends versus the reduced velocity except for t d 4 0 the downstream cylinder may disturb the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder leading to the decrease in mean lift coefficients and mean varying drag coefficients on the upstream cylinder both the wake shielding effect and the vortex shedding effect have a significant influence on the hydrodynamic features of the downstream cylinder under the wake shielding effect the mean lift coefficients and mean varying drag coefficients on the downstream cylinder are reduced while the mean cf and il added mass coefficients are increased owing to the vortex shedding effect the mean lift coefficients and mean varying drag coefficients calculated using the local flow velocity are higher than those on the single cylinder which increases the contribution of the adjacent modes to the vibrations keywords spacing ratio hydrodynamic coefficients tandem flexible cylinder flow induced vibration 1 introduction cylindrical structures under flows normally experience fluctuating hydrodynamic forces induced by the well known vortex shedding phenomenon flexible or elastically mounted cylindrical structures can vibrate in two directions cross flow cf and in line il under periodic hydrodynamic forces this type of flow induced vibration fiv is widely observed in cylindrical structures such as marine risers mooring lines submarine pipelines chimney stacks stay cables and overhead transmission lines the fiv of cylindrical structures may result in fatigue damage which attracts extensive attention in many engineering applications hence this type of vibration problem has been studied by many investigators in recent decades and information about fluid structure interaction fsi mechanisms vortex modes structural responses and hydrodynamic features can be found in numerous publications bearman 2011 chaplin et al 2005 gao et al 2019 gopalkrishnan 1993 lu et al 2019 pavlovskaia et al 2016 williamson and govardhan 2008 wu and wang 2018 zhu et al 2019 groups of circular cylinders are becoming increasingly common in various engineering fields as a simple case with multiple cylinders the fiv of two tandem cylinders has been widely discussed in recent years due to wake flow interference the fiv of two tandem cylinders show distinct structural dynamics flow behaviours and hydrodynamic features compared to the fiv of an isolated cylinder many studies about the flow around two fixed rigid cylinders with tandem configuration have revealed important flow and hydrodynamic characteristics which are beneficial for revealing the complex fiv mechanisms of pairs of cylinders igarashi 1982 xu and zhou 2004 zhou and yiu 2016 three different flow types depending on the spacing ratio t d where t is the centre to centre space between the two cylinders and d is the outer diameter of the cylinder have been identified sumner 2010 zdravkovich 1987 when the spacing ratio is small 1 0 t d 1 2 1 8 an extended body regime is observed and the two cylinders are both wrapped in the vortices as the spacing ratio increases 1 2 1 8 t d 3 4 3 8 the shear layers of the upstream cylinder reattach to the surface of the downstream cylinder which is known as the reattachment regime at a large spacing ratio t d 3 4 3 8 vortex shedding appears between the two cylinders and the wake of the upstream cylinder interacts with the vortex shedding of the downstream cylinder which are the major features of the co shedding regime when the vortex shedding disappears between the cylinders the upstream cylinder has a lower mean drag compared to the isolated single cylinder while the downstream cylinder experiences negative mean drag furthermore the downstream cylinder experiences a larger lift than the upstream cylinder in the co shedding regime alam et al 2003 many studies have been conducted to explore the fiv response and hydrodynamic characteristics of two elastically mounted rigid cylinders in tandem arrangement the downstream cylinder is immersed in the wake flow of the upstream cylinder and experiences many influences of the wake flow hence the fiv hydrodynamic characteristics of the downstream cylinder have attracted considerable attention for the sake of simplification some researchers fix the upstream rigid cylinder and allow the downstream cylinder to vibrate in the wake flow from the stationary upstream cylinder hover and triantafyllou 2001 and assi et al 2010 2013 experimentally investigated the fiv of the downstream cylinder in hover and triantafyllou 2001 the downstream cylinder which was 4 75d behind the stationary leading cylinder was towed at reynolds number re 30000 re ud ν u is the flow velocity and ν is the kinematic viscosity coefficient the frequency lock in of the downstream cylinder began at nearly the same reduced velocity as that of an isolated single cylinder however the downstream cylinder experienced large amplitude galloping responses at high reduced velocities which conflicted with the vibration amplitude of the isolated single cylinder within the lock in region of the single cylinder the cf and il fluctuating force coefficients on the downstream cylinder were much lower than those on the single cylinder assi et al 2010 studied the wake induced vibration wiv at various spacing ratios beyond the critical value of t d 2 5 and the re was up to 30000 this study suggested that unsteady fluid structure interactions input energy into the system that sustained the wiv mechanism coherent vortices between the two cylinders impinged on the downstream cylinder and merged with the vortex shedding from the downstream cylinder which caused the cf fluctuating forces to be unsynchronized with the motion furthermore assi et al 2013 utilized the wake stiffness phenomenon to define the wiv characteristics the spacing ratio had remarkable influences on the responses and hydrodynamics of the downstream cylinder as the spacing ratio increased the diffusion of the vortices between the two cylinders was enhanced which induced weaker forces recently assi 2014 investigated the oscillations of the downstream cylinder with two degrees of freedom dof when the cylinders were arranged in the tandem form the wiv response was not qualitatively distinct with that in only the cf direction however the frequencies of the cf and il fluctuating forces showed that traces of the wake stiffness frequency affected the il oscillation rather than the cf oscillation the vibrations of the upstream cylinder enhance the complexity of the wake interference between the two tandem cylinders papaioannou et al 2008 xu et al 2019 zdravkovich 1985 zdravkovich 1985 studied the fiv of two tandem cylinders which were elastically mounted at low reduced velocities the fluid dynamic excitation forces were induced by the vortex shedding behind the cylinders the spacing ratio had a slight influence on the cf response of the upstream cylinder when t d was larger than approximately 2 2 the cf response of the downstream cylinder was very high at t d 4 75 and decreased as t d increased to approximately 7 0 at high reduced velocity oscillations resulted from the fluid elastic forces the downstream cylinder had large vibration amplitudes in both the cf and il directions at t d 4 0 and the amplitudes gradually grew with increasing reduced velocity prasanth and mittal 2009 numerically investigated the fiv of two tandem rigid cylinders with two dofs at re 100 the cf fluctuating force coefficient on the upstream cylinder which was 5 5d from the downstream cylinder was qualitatively similar to that on a single cylinder within the lock in region the maximum values of the cf and il fluctuating force coefficients on the downstream cylinder were lower than the coefficients on the upstream cylinder however the downstream cylinder experienced larger forces which were insensitive to the reduced velocity than the upstream cylinder beyond the lock in region papaioannou et al 2008 investigated the fiv of two tandem cylinders at re 160 the spacing ratio t d was 2 5 3 5 and 5 0 the maximum root mean square rms of the fluid force coefficients on the upstream cylinder varied among the different spacing ratios the cf fluctuating force coefficients on the upstream cylinder and the single cylinder were in good agreement at t d 5 0 within the lock in region the downstream cylinder had much lower il fluctuating force coefficients compared to the single cylinder haider and sohn 2018 investigated the free vibrations of two tandem cylinders in their cf directions at re 100 the spacing ratio t d varied from 1 05 to 12 0 the fluid force coefficients showed a discontinuous jump at a critical spacing ratio t d 3 5 where the upstream cylinder started shedding vortices below the critical spacing ratio the upstream cylinder had low values of cf fluctuating force coefficients for t d 4 0 8 0 the cf fluctuating force coefficients on the two cylinders remained constant the fiv response of two flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement has been studied by several researchers brika and laneville 1997 1999 showed that the upstream cylinder and its vibration significantly affected the response of the downstream cylinder the lock in of the downstream cylinder occurred at a higher reduced velocity than that of the isolated single cylinder and the lock in region of the former was much wider than that of the latter the downstream cylinder demonstrated a hysteresis response when the upstream cylinder was free to vibrate huera huarte and bearman 2011 huera huarte and gharib 2011 investigated the fiv of two tandem flexible cylinders at t d 2 0 8 0 both cylinders showed classical vortex induced vibrations at a low reduced velocity independent of the spacing ratios however at high reduced velocity the responses of the downstream cylinder varied with the spacing ratio when the spacing ratio was large enough for vortex shedding to exist in the gap between the two cylinders the vibrations of the downstream cylinder were wake induced at high reduced velocity furthermore huera huarte et al 2016 experimentally studied the multi mode vibration of a flexible cylinder in the wake of a stationary cylinder the multi mode response of the downstream cylinder was enhanced due to the wake of the upstream cylinder the spacing ratio had little influence on the displacement and frequency of the downstream cylinder recently xu et al 2018a 2018b conducted model tests to investigate the fiv dynamic characteristics of two tandem flexible cylinders and the suppression efficiency of helical strakes the upstream cylinder was insignificantly affected by the downstream cylinder due to wake shielding effects the downstream cylinder experienced larger mean drag coefficients than the upstream cylinder and isolated single cylinder regarding the displacement of the downstream cylinder there were no clear trends associated with the spacing ratio which is consistent with the results of huera huarte et al 2016 however except for in wang et al 2017 few attention is focused on the fiv hydrodynamics of two tandem flexible cylinders in wang et al 2017 the cf fiv of two tandem flexible cylinders were numerically investigated at re 500 with t d 2 5 3 5 and 5 0 the upstream cylinder had similar cf fluctuating force coefficients compared to the single cylinder at t d 5 0 which indicated that the downstream cylinder had a weak effect on this coefficient the cf fluctuating force coefficient on the downstream cylinder was very sensitive to the spacing ratio which was closely associated with the vortices between the two cylinders flexible cylinders with a large aspect ratio l d where l is the cylinder length such as marine risers stay cables and transmission lines are widely used in many engineering fields the oscillation of long flexible cylinders always exhibits multi mode behaviour which is more complicated than that of rigid cylinders the fiv mechanisms and hydrodynamic characteristics of two tandem rigid cylinders have been explored by many numerical and experimental studies however fewer studies have been done on the fiv hydrodynamics features of two tandem flexible cylinder compared to two tandem rigid cylinders in this paper the influences of the spacing ratio on the fiv hydrodynamic characteristics of two tandem flexible cylinders are investigated based on the reconstructed hydrodynamic forces it is a great challenge for measuring the fiv hydrodynamic forces on a flexible cylinder reconstructing the hydrodynamic forces on flexible cylinders using the displacements is a universal method that has been employed in many studies han et al 2018a huera huarte et al 2006 liu et al 2018 song et al 2016 to study the influences of the spacing ratio on the fiv hydrodynamic characteristics of two tandem flexible cylinders the forgetting factor least squares ff ls method is applied to calculate the hydrodynamic forces on the flexible cylinder under multi frequency vibrations the remainder of this paper is organized into the following sections the method for identifying the hydrodynamic coefficients on cylinders under multi frequency vibrations is described in section 2 introductions to the model tests and data processing are presented in section 3 the hydrodynamic coefficients in the cf and il directions are presented and discussed in section 4 some conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 calculation of fluid forces under multi frequency vibrations it is a great challenge for measuring the fiv hydrodynamic forces on a flexible cylinder without affecting the flowing field hence inverse analysis methods were applied to calculate the hydrodynamic force according to the responses of the flexible cylinder huera huarte et al 2006 song et al 2016 to further analyse hydrodynamic characteristics the cf fluctuating force was decomposed into two parts the part in phase with the velocity namely the lift and the part in phase with the acceleration namely the cf added mass force due to the effect of incoming flow the structure experiences the mean drag and the il fluctuating force in the il direction the il displacements of the structure are composed of the mean displacements and the vibration displacements the il fluctuating force is closely related to the vibration displacement similar to the hydrodynamic forces in cf direction the varying drag and the il added mass force can be calculated by decomposing the il fluctuating force many fluid force decomposition methods are based on a single frequency aronsen 2007 gopalkrishnan 1993 song et al 2016 however the fluid forces acting on two tandem flexible cylinders comprise robust multi frequency components due to the flow interactions between the cylinders liu et al 2018 proposed the ff ls method for identifying

al 2016 for the sake of brevity we take the identification of cf hydrodynamic coefficients as an example the flexible cylinder can be modelled as an euler bernoulli beam and the cf vibration equation of the flexible cylinder undergoing fiv can be expressed as eq 1 han et al 2018a huera huarte et al 2006 song et al 2016 1 e i 4 y z t z 4 t z 2 y z t z 2 c y y z t m s y z t f c f z t the flexible

from the model tests conducted by xu et al 2018a the velocity and acceleration in the cf direction y z t and y z t are calculated based on y z t by cubic spline method the cf fluctuating force f cf z

y f y the cf structural damping matrix c y can be expressed as 4 c y λ 3 m s λ 4 k e k g where λ 3 and λ 4 are the cf rayleigh damping constants which are obtained from free decay tests the fluid force load matrix f y is the only unknown in eq 3 and it is easy to calculate f y hence the cf fluctuating force f cf z t is determined from the fluid force load matrix the rms of the cf fluctuating force coefficient is calculated from eq 5 5 c c f r m s 2 ρ d u 2 l l l i 1 l l 1 n s j 1 n s f c f 2 z i t j the decomposition of the cf fluctuating force with multi frequency vibrations is

historical moment data before t n to identify θ n the decaying factor β was introduced when ff ls method was employed β is a constant and satisfies 0 β 1 at the present moment the decaying factor is equal to 1 while the decaying factor is β n 1 at the initial moment at different moments the force and response are multiplied by different decaying factors 19 f n β n 1 f n 1 β n 2 f n 2 β f n n 1 f

descriptions of model tests 3 1 experimental arrangement xu et al 2018a carried out model tests on two identical flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement in xu et al 2018a the multi mode fiv behaviours were presented and analysed in detail in this paper the fiv hydrodynamic force coefficients on the two cylinders were calculated using the response information acquired from the model tests in xu et al 2018a two flexible cylinders of the same size properties and pre tension were dragged by towing carriage in still water with a uniform velocity which generated the uniform flow condition the flow velocity in the experiments was varied from 0 05 m s to 1 0 m s with an interval of 0 05 m s the corresponding reynolds numbers nearly ranged from 800 to 16 000 the spacing ratios were set as t d 4 0 6 0 8 0 10 0 16 0 shown in fig 2 a total of 120 runs including the cases of two tandem cylinders and a single cylinder were carried out in each run the sampling time was 50s and the sampling frequency was 100hz to ensure the disturbed water clam down there were at least 15 min between two consecutive runs the flexible cylinder model was composed of an inner copper pipe with an outer diameter of 8 0 mm and a wall thickness of 1 0 mm and an outer silicone tube with an outer diameter of 16 mm seven measurement points were set on the inner copper pipe and each measurement point was installed four strain gauges to collect the bending strains in the cf and il directions the main properties of the flexible cylinder model are listed in table 1 more detailed information about the model tests can be found in xu et al 2018a recently the same flexible cylinder model had been employed to investigate the fiv characteristics of multi cylinders in various arrangements ma et al 2019 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2018c 2018d 3 2 natural frequencies and structural damping to obtain the natural characteristics of the flexible cylinder free decay tests were performed on each cylinder model in air and still water xu et al 2018e and han et al 2018b used the two flexible cylinders employed in xu et al 2018a to study the fiv responses and hydrodynamic characteristics of two side by side cylinders the first seven order natural frequencies in the cf direction of the flexible cylinders are presented in table 2 the natural frequencies in the il direction are close to those in the cf direction and are not presented the theoretical values of natural frequencies calculated from eq 25 are also presented in table 2 as a comparison lie and kaasen 2006 25 f n n 2 l t z m s m a n π l 2 e i m s m a where f n is the nth order natural frequency and m a is the added mass per unit when we calculate the natural frequency in air m a is equal to 0 however m a is equal to ρπd 2 4 if we calculate the natural frequency in water the cf natural frequencies of the flexible cylinder model show slight differences from the theoretical values the rayleigh damping constants can be calculated according to the structural damping ratios and the natural angular frequencies the calculation of structural damping ratios and the rayleigh damping constants were further explained in han et al 2018b the il rayleigh damping constants λ 1 λ 2 and the cf rayleigh damping constants λ 3 and λ 4 are shown in table 3 3 3 data processing the vibration displacements in the cf and il directions of the flexible cylinders were obtained based on the measured strains using the modal analysis method xu et al 2018a before reconstructing the oscillation displacement the strain signals were processed and filtered conservatively details of the strain processing method were presented in xu et al 2018a the displacement responses of two tandem flexible cylinders usually have multiple frequency components due to the flow interactions and the multi mode fivs utilizing the ff ls method hydrodynamic force coefficients with multi frequency components can be calculated the wavelet analysis method was employed to identify the frequency components of the displacement responses time frequency graphs of the cf displacement of the downstream cylinder for t d 8 0 and u 0 80 m s at two measurement points are presented in fig 3 the horizontal axis denotes time t and the vertical axis denotes the frequency the color bar represents the wavelet coefficient which is positively correlated with the energy of the frequency component a time frequency graph was drawn for each measurement point the graphs of the measurement points at z 0 375l and z 0 5l are presented as examples the graphs of the other measurement points have similar frequency components as the graph of the measurement point z 0 375l the displacement of the measurement point at z 0 5l has one prominent frequency of 8 10 hz while the displacements at the other measurement points have two prominent frequencies i e 4 97 hz and 8 10 hz hence the cf displacements were filtered at 4 97 hz and 8 10 hz with a bandwidth of 1 hz superposing the displacements at 4 97 hz and 8 10 hz we obtained a new displacement signal that was used to reconstruct the fluid forces acting on the flexible cylinder the frequency components of the il displacements are much wider than those of the cf displacements the filtered bandwidth of the il displacements was set as 2 hz the selection of μ must compromise between the loss of estimate accuracy and fast adaptive capability if the forgetting factor μ is large the data at the previous moments have strong effect on the result at the present moment and the noise effects are reduced in contrast for small μ values the data at the previous moments have weak effect on the result at the present moment and the estimate can easily track changes in the results to determine the forgetting factor μ the cf fluctuating forces f cf z t were reconstructed again using the lift coefficient and the added mass coefficients according to eq 13 fig 4 shows the cf fluctuating forces based on different μ on the downstream cylinder for t d 8 0 and u 0 80 m s re 12800 at z 0 375l the original f cf z t was calculated from eq 3 the rms values of f cf z t based on different μ are presented in table 4 the rms values of f cf z t based on different μ are close to that of the original f cf z t however some differences appear in several local peaks and troughs of the time varying f cf z t shown in fig 4 the deviation between the reconstructed f cf z t and the original f cf z t increases with increasing μ fig 4 indicates that the fast adaptive capability for μ 0 8 is the weakest among the three cases hence the forgetting factor μ was chosen from the values 0 6 and 0 7 fig 5 shows the time varying lift coefficient based on different μ on the downstream cylinder for t d 8 0 and u 0 80 m s re 12800 at z 0 375l the time varying lift coefficients on μ 0 6 have many narrow peaks and troughs at several moments which results from the noise of the signal the time mean c ly z t based on different μ are shown in table 4 due to the narrow peaks and troughs the time mean c ly z t based on μ 0 6 is much larger than that based on μ 0 7 considering the above described compromise the forgetting factor μ was set as 0 7 in the present research it should be pointed that the hydrodynamic coefficients based on μ 0 7 may not be the optimal results but the results of hydrodynamic coefficients have considerable accuracy for the qualitative analysis 4 results and discussion in this section the calculated hydrodynamic coefficients on the two flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement are presented and discussed the rms of cf fluctuating force coefficient c cf rms was obtained from eq 5 for the sake of a better comparison the mean lift coefficient c ly mean and the mean cf added mass c ay mean coefficient were determined based on the following formulas 26 c l y m e a n l l i 1 l l 1 n s j 1 n s c l y z i t j 27 c a y m e a n l l i 1 l l 1 n s j 1 n s c a y z i t j the rms of il fluctuating force coefficient c il rms the mean varying drag coefficient c dx mean and the mean il added mass c ax mean coefficient were determined by a similar method the reduced velocity is defined as v r u f 1 d f 1 is the theoretical value of the first order natural frequency in still water because the measured natural frequencies of the upstream cylinder and the downstream cylinder have small differences the theoretical value f 1 was selected to define the reduced velocity the cf and il fluctuating force coefficients vary with both time t and axial position z the time domain cf and il fluctuating force coefficients have a mean value near zero hence the rms of cf and il fluctuating force coefficients were calculated at each element node firstly to compare and analyse the results among all the conditions of spacing ratios and reduced velocities the axial mean values of the rms of cf and il fluctuating force coefficients were selected as the indices c ly z t c ay z t c dx z t and c ax z t under multi frequency vibration vary with both time t and axial position z while these coefficients under the single frequency vibration only vary with axial position z for the sake of comparison the time mean values of c ly z t c ay z t c dx z t and c ax z t were calculated firstly then axial mean values of these coefficients were acquired for the convenient analysis 4 1 hydrodynamic characteristics in the cf direction 4 1 1 cf fluctuating force coefficients fig 6 shows the rms of cf fluctuating force coefficient on the two cylinders with tandem configuration xu et al 2018a obtained the dominant modes of the two tandem flexible cylinders and the single cylinder undergoing fiv for clarity the figure includes four colored areas i ii iii and iv that indicate the first four order mode resonance regions of the single cylinder for example in the second order mode resonance region the second order modal weight is far larger than the other order modal weight and the second order mode dominates the vibration also the vibration dominant frequency is close to the second order natural frequency the areas between two adjacent mode resonance regions are the mode switch regions the results of the isolated single cylinder are indicated by a dark grey dashed line the results of the two tandem cylinders are presented by colored markers for the single flexible cylinder the c cf rms increases and after reaching local peak value decreases in every single mode resonance regions which is closely related to the variation in the cf response amplitudes similar phenomenon has been found in many studies about the fivs of a single flexible cylinder han et al 2018a 2018b huera huarte et al 2006 as shown in fig 6 a the c cf rms on the upstream cylinder with t d 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 shows similar tendencies with that on the single cylinder except for several reduced velocities v r 15 0 16 3 and 17 5 near the end of the second order mode resonance region at such reduced velocities the dominant frequencies of the upstream cylinder with t d 10 0 and 16 0 are slightly higher than those of the upstream cylinder with other spacing ratios and the single cylinder which results in slightly larger c cf rms however the c cf rms on the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 shows moderate and significant differences from that on the single cylinder in the second and third order mode resonance regions respectively it is possible that the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 is disturbed by the downstream cylinder the space of 4 0d is just an initial space between the two cylinders due to the oscillations of the cylinders and the different mean il displacements the space between the cylinders changes with time xu et al 2018a showed that the mean drag coefficients on the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 are significantly larger than those on the downstream cylinder at high reduced velocities indicating that the space between the cylinder may be smaller than 4 0d in addition the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 has low strouhal number found by xu et al 2018a fig 7 shows the time frequency graph of the cf displacements of the upstream cylinder for t d 4 0 and t d 6 0 at z 0 25l and v r 21 3 the response frequency of the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 changes dramatically with time which confirms that the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder is disturbed the c cf rms value on the upstream cylinder with a t d larger than 6 0 is slightly affected by the downstream cylinder however for t d 4 0 the downstream cylinder disturbs the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder and causes a decrease in c cf rms especially at high reduced velocities the rms of cf fluctuating force coefficients on the downstream cylinder are significantly affected by the upstream cylinder as shown in fig 6 b the c cf rms on the downstream cylinder always reaches local peaks at a much higher reduced velocity than that on the single cylinder moreover the former c cf rms peak values are smaller than the latter c cf rms peak values for t d 4 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 the downstream cylinder has approximately similar c cf rms values which are much larger than the c cf rms on the downstream cylinder with t d 16 0 the above phenomena are caused by the wake shielding effects huang and herfjord 2013 xu et al 2018a fig 8 shows the time frequency graph of the cf displacement of the two cylinders with t d 8 0 at z 0 125l and v r 21 29 the upstream cylinder oscillates with a dominant frequency of 8 37 hz while the downstream cylinder oscillates with two predominant frequency components of 5 57 hz and 8 47 hz due to the wake shielding effect the vortex shedding frequency of the downstream cylinder is approximately 5 57 hz which is much lower than the response frequency of the upstream cylinder in addition to the 5 57 hz frequency component the downstream cylinder has a frequency component of 8 47 hz which is close to the response frequency of the upstream cylinder hence the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder considerably affects the downstream cylinder it can be concluded that the upstream cylinder affects the hydrodynamic behaviour of the downstream cylinder in two ways the wake shielding effect and the vortex shedding effect the mean wake flow velocity of the downstream cylinder is not equal to the uniform flow velocity due to the wake shielding effects however the hydrodynamic coefficients of the downstream cylinder are calculated according to uniform flow velocity which cannot accurately indicate the hydrodynamic features of the downstream cylinder to weaken the wake shielding effect the mean wake flow velocity of the downstream cylinder was estimated using the wake velocity model proposed by schlichting 1968 and modified by huse 1993 huang and herfjord 2013 also employed the same wake velocity model to calculate the inflow to the downstream cylinder the wake flow velocity can be calculated using the formula as follows 28 u l u u c d d 4 d c d t where u l is the local flow velocity to the downstream cylinder and c d is the mean drag coefficient on the upstream cylinder in this paper the c d was chosen as 1 20 which is the mean drag coefficient on a fixed cylinder in uniform flow the local reduced velocity is v rl u l f 1d the hydrodynamic coefficients on the downstream cylinder were recalculated based on u l fig 9 shows the rms of the cf fluctuating force coefficients based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder versus the local reduced velocity using the local flow velocity the c cf rms on the downstream cylinder with t d 4 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 are significantly higher than the c cf rms on the single cylinder mainly due to the effect of vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder the c cf rms based on local flow velocity shows a decreasing trend as t d increases indicating that the intensity of the vortices from the upstream cylinder decreases with increasing t d when the spacing ratio is 16 0 the c cf rms based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder and the c cf rms on the single cylinder are close to each other in the first order mode resonance region however the downstream cylinder has a much lower c cf rms than the single cylinder in the second order mode resonance region because the wake velocity model still has some shortcomings for the flexible cylinder it can be concluded that the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder has a limited effect on the c cf rms on the downstream cylinder when the spacing ratio is increased to 16 0 assi et al 2010 showed that the vortices from the upstream wake have more time to diffuse and that the fluid structure interaction is weakened as the downstream cylinder is moved farther away which is consistent with the results of the present research the numerical study about two tandem flexible cylinders wang et al 2017 in low reynolds numbers found that a downstream cylinder experiences a larger c cf rms than an isolated single cylinder in the present research the c cf rms on the downstream cylinder does not show an uptrend with reduced velocity due to the wake shielding effect after removing the wake shielding effect the c cf rms based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder is much larger than that on the single cylinder which agrees with the numerical results reported by other researchers 4 1 2 lift coefficients fig 10 presents the mean lift coefficient of the two tandem flexible cylinders consistent with the c cf rms the c ly mean on the flexible cylinder reaches a local maximum value in every single mode resonance regions and then decreases to a low value at the interval between two adjacent mode resonance regions as shown in fig 10 a the mean lift coefficient c ly mean on the upstream cylinder shows similar tendencies with that on the single cylinder except for several reduced velocities which suggests that the downstream cylinder has limited effects on the upstream cylinder in the third order mode resonance region the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 experiences a much lower c ly mean than the single cylinder because the presence of the downstream cylinder disturbs the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder this conclusion can be verified by the time frequency graph of the cf displacement of the upstream cylinder shown in fig 7 fig 11 shows the time mean lift coefficient distribution of the single cylinder and the upstream cylinder for t d 4 0 8 0 and 16 0 at v r 21 3 when t d is equal to 16 0 the time mean lift coefficient distribution of the upstream cylinder show a similar tendency with that of the single cylinder except for the local peaks near z l 0 4 and 0 6 the time mean c ly z of the upstream cylinder with t d 8 0 is very close to that of the single cylinder except for a slight discrepancy near the two ends for t d 6 0 10 0 the upstream cylinder has a similar time mean c ly z as the single cylinder and the corresponding results are not presented here due to the effect of the downstream cylinder the time mean c ly z of the upstream cylinder is different from that of the single cylinder when the spacing ratio is 4 0 the time mean c ly z of the single cylinder has local maximum values at approximately z 0 2l and 0 8l however the time mean c ly z of the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 reaches a maximum value near the middle point due to the wake shielding effect the mean lift coefficient on the downstream cylinder achieves local maximum values at a much higher reduced velocity than the single cylinder as shown in fig 10 b at low reduced velocity the local peak values of mean lift coefficient on the downstream cylinder are slightly smaller than those on the single cylinder within the third order mode resonance region the c ly mean on the downstream cylinder is lower than that on the single cylinder considering the effect of spacing ratio the c ly mean on the downstream cylinder differs slightly with t d 4 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 however the downstream cylinder with t d 16 0 has a lower c ly mean than the downstream cylinder with other spacing ratios fig 12 shows the time mean lift coefficient distribution of the single cylinder and the downstream cylinder for t d 4 0 8 0 and 16 0 at v r 21 3 for t d 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 the time mean c ly z of the downstream cylinder are similar so the result of t d 6 0 and 10 0 are not presented here the time mean c ly z of the downstream cylinder varies depending on the spacing ratio the differences in the time mean c ly z between the downstream cylinder and the single cylinder increase with an increase in the spacing ratio the mean lift coefficients of the downstream cylinder shown in fig 10 b do not demonstrate high regularity owing to the combination of the wake shielding effect and the vortex shedding effect from the upstream cylinder fig 13 shows the mean lift coefficient based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder at the beginning of the first order mode resonance region the c ly mean based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder with t d 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 is slightly higher than the c ly mean on the single cylinder for t d 4 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 the downstream cylinder experiences significantly larger c ly mean based on local flow velocity than the single cylinder at the end of the first order mode resonance region and the interval between the first order mode and second order mode resonance regions however the c ly mean based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder with t d 10 0 and 16 0 and the c ly mean on the single cylinder are in good agreement in the first order mode resonance region except for the spacing ratio of 16 0 the downstream cylinder has very high c ly mean based on local flow velocity compared to the single cylinder in the second order mode resonance region the enlargement of the c ly mean based on local flow velocity is closely related to the vortex shedding effect of the upstream cylinder in general the c ly mean based on local flow velocity in the cases of t d 4 0 and 6 0 are much higher than those in the cases of t d 8 0 and 10 0 and the c ly mean based on local flow velocity in the case of t d 16 0 is similar to that on the single cylinder this phenomenon indicates that the effect of vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder gradually weakens as the spacing ratio increases due to the vortex shedding effect of the upstream cylinder the c ly mean based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder increases when the wake shielding effect is eliminated however the cf response amplitudes of the downstream flexible cylinder are not significantly increased xu et al 2018a to further investigate the effect of lift on the cf response amplitude the modal weight of the cf response amplitude was analysed fig 14 shows the modal weight of the cf response displacements of the single cylinder and the downstream cylinder with t d 10 0 the local reduced velocities of the single cylinder and the downstream cylinder are 12 5 and 12 3 respectively the second order mode is the dominant mode for the downstream cylinder and the single cylinder the second order modal weight values of the downstream cylinder and the single cylinder are roughly equivalent apart from the second order mode the third and fourth order modes make some contribution to the vibration in the cf direction however the third and fourth order modal weights of the downstream cylinder are much larger than those of the single cylinder it can be concluded that the enlargement of the lift coefficient calculated using the local flow velocity makes the adjacent modes have a greater contribution to the vibration due to the wake shielding effect the two flexible cylinders have different dominant modes and dominant frequencies the vortex shedding frequency of the upstream cylinder may be much higher than the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder hence the c ly mean based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder enlarged by the vortex shedding effect of the upstream cylinder has a limited effect on the dominant mode of the downstream cylinder but will enhance the modal weight of the adjacent modes owing to the mode competition the cf displacements of the downstream cylinder are not increased when the c ly mean based on local flow velocity is enlarged 4 1 3 cf added mass coefficients the added mass coefficient is one of the most important parameters in fsis aronsen 2007 gopalkrishnan 1993 vikestad et al 2000 the added mass coefficient on a single cylinder undergoing fiv decreases gradually with the reduced velocity within the mode resonance region leading to an increase of the natural frequency however insufficient data are available on the added mass coefficients of two tandem flexible cylinders undergoing fiv fig 15 presents the mean cf added mass coefficient on the two cylinders in tandem arrangement the c ay mean on the single flexible cylinder decreases monotonically with the reduced velocity in the first three order mode resonance regions in fig 15 a the variation in c ay mean on the upstream cylinder with t d 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 differs slightly from that on the single flexible cylinder for the case of t d 4 0 the c ay mean on the upstream cylinder shows some differences from that on the single cylinder within the third order mode resonance region the c ay mean on the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 is near the value 1 0 which is much higher than the value on the single cylinder the distinctness of the mean cf added mass coefficient is mainly related to the variation in the response frequency as mentioned above the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 can be disturbed by the downstream cylinder at high reduced velocities the time varying response frequency of the upstream cylinder with this spacing ratio is unstable over time as shown in fig 7 a hence the c ay mean on the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 does not decrease with the reduced velocity in the third order mode resonance region consequently the dominant frequencies of the upstream cylinder in such cases are slightly lower than those of the single cylinder and upstream cylinder in other cases xu et al 2018a due to the combined wake shielding and vortex shedding effects the mean cf added mass coefficients on the downstream cylinder are greatly scattered as shown in fig 15 b the downstream cylinder has a larger c ay mean than the single cylinder at v r 5 0 7 5 and 16 3 23 8 whereas the results are opposite at v r 8 8 13 8 to further investigate the effect of vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder the c ay mean on the downstream cylinder versus the local reduced velocity is presented in fig 16 for the sake of a better analysis fig 17 shows the cf dominant frequencies of the downstream cylinder versus the local reduced velocity when v rl is under 6 3 both the single cylinder and the downstream cylinder are in the first order mode resonance region and the c ay mean decreases gradually however due to the different intensities of the vortex shedding effect the c ay mean on the downstream cylinder with different spacing ratios varies among each other then the c ay mean on the downstream cylinder with t d 16 0 and the single cylinder gradually increase and reach a local peak in the second order mode resonance region in the cases of t d 4 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 the mean cf added mass coefficients reach a local maximum value rapidly which makes the vibration of the downstream cylinder enter the second order mode at relatively low local reduced velocities when the local reduced velocity ranges from 10 0 to 15 0 the c ay mean values on the downstream cylinder are much lower than those on the single cylinder consistent with the variation in the value of c ay mean the cf dominant frequencies at such reduced velocities are much higher than those of the single cylinder apart from the prominent cf dominant frequency the cf displacement of the downstream cylinder also has a frequency component close to the vortex shedding frequency of the upstream cylinder the mean cf added mass coefficients in the present research were calculated considering the coupling effect of multi frequency vibrations the frequency component closed to the vortex shedding frequency of the upstream cylinder may be one of the reasons that the c ay mean on the downstream cylinder is lower 4 2 hydrodynamic characteristics in the il direction 4 2 1 il fluctuating force coefficients fig 18 shows the rms of il fluctuating force coefficients on the two tandem flexible cylinders the il vibrations of the single cylinder are very complicated and the sixth order mode vibrations are excited for the single cylinder the c il rms reaches local maximum values in every single mode resonance regions higher order vibration modes are easily excited in the il direction and the rms of il fluctuating force coefficients do not change monotonically versus the reduced velocity in fig 18 a the variation in the c il rms on the upstream cylinder with t d 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 is generally identical to that on the single cylinder except for at some reduced velocities similar to c cf rms the c il rms on the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 is much lower than that on the single cylinder and the upstream cylinder with other spacing ratios at higher reduced velocities fig 19 shows the time frequency graph of the il displacement of the upstream cylinder for t d 4 0 and 6 0 at z 0 25l and v r 21 3 the il displacements of the upstream cylinder under the aforementioned conditions both have two predominant frequency components and the dominant frequency is the higher frequency component however the time varying frequencies of the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 are unstable which indicates that the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder is disturbed by the downstream cylinder hence the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 has low rms of il fluctuating force coefficients at high reduced velocities for cases with spacing ratios larger than 4 0 the downstream cylinder still shows some influence on the c il rms of the upstream cylinder the c il rms on the upstream cylinder is larger or smaller than that on the single cylinder at certain reduced velocities due to the wake interference between the two cylinders the il displacements of the upstream cylinder may have different frequency components compared to the single cylinder the discrepancies of the c il rms values are attributed to the different frequency components of the il displacements the c il rms on the downstream cylinder shows distinct characteristics compared to that on the single cylinder and the upstream cylinder as shown in fig 18 b the c il rms values on the downstream cylinder with all spacing ratios are similar to each other and much lower than the c il rms on the single cylinder in the second order mode resonance region which is attributed to the wake shielding effect of the upstream cylinder at v r 8 8 12 5 the downstream cylinder has a much higher value of c il rms than the single cylinder owing to the vortex shedding effect when the reduced velocity ranges from 15 0 to 18 8 the downstream cylinder with t d 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 experiences a much higher c il rms than the single cylinder and the downstream cylinder with t d 4 0 and 6 0 this is mainly because the wake shielding effect is weaker than the vortex shedding effect at such reduced velocities when v r exceeds 20 0 the downstream cylinder has low c il rms values due to wake shielding effects the c il rms on the downstream cylinder is significantly influenced by the wake shielding effects to further investigate the wake shielding effect on the il vibration fig 20 presents the time frequency graph of the il displacement of the two cylinders for t d 8 0 and v r 21 29 at z 0 5l the il displacements of the upstream cylinder have two predominant frequency components that are stable with a dominant frequency of 16 83 hz however the il displacements of the downstream cylinder have several unstable frequency components that are lower than the dominant frequency of the upstream cylinder due to the wake shielding effect hence the downstream cylinder has a much lower c il rms than the upstream cylinder to study the vortex shedding effects of the upstream cylinder in more detail the rms of il fluctuating force coefficient based on local flow velocity are presented in fig 21 the c il rms based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder is much higher than the c il rms on the single cylinder when the local reduced velocity ranges from 5 0 to 15 0 due to the fact that the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder may interact with the il vibration of the downstream cylinder the peak c il rms values based on local reduced flow velocity are decreased with increasing spacing ratios indicating that the interaction of vortices from the upstream cylinder with the downstream cylinder weakens with increasing spacing ratios when the t d is increased to 16 0 the effect of vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder on the downstream cylinder is still considerable 4 2 2 varying drag coefficients fig 22 shows the mean varying drag coefficient of the two tandem flexible cylinders as shown in fig 22 a the c dx mean values on the upstream cylinder with t d 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 are generally similar to that on the single cylinder which indicates that the downstream cylinder has a mild effect on the c dx mean on the upstream cylinder for t d 4 0 the downstream cylinder has much smaller c dx mean than the single cylinder as the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder may be disturbed by the downstream cylinder notably the c dx mean on the upstream cylinder with spacing ratios larger than 4 0 is still slightly different from that on the single cylinder at several reduced velocities such as v r 13 8 16 3 and 17 5 for example fig 23 shows the time frequency graph of the il displacement of the single cylinder and the upstream cylinder for t d 10 0 and v r 13 8 at z 0 25l in contrast with the il displacement frequencies of the single cylinder the time varying frequencies of the upstream cylinder with t d 10 0 are disordered and discontinuous fig 23 suggests that the il vibration of the upstream cylinder with a t d larger than 4 0 can be disturbed by the downstream cylinder at some reduced velocities fig 24 shows the time mean varying drag coefficient distribution of the single cylinder and the upstream cylinder for t d 4 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 at v r 13 8 the time mean c dx z of the upstream cylinder with t d 16 0 is similar to that of the upstream cylinder with t d 10 0 hence the result for t d 16 0 is not present here the time mean c dx z of the upstream cylinder is distinct from that of the single cylinder due to the presence of the downstream cylinder moreover the time mean c dx z of the upstream cylinder vary with the spacing ratios the c dx mean on the downstream cylinder is much lower than that on the single cylinder and the upstream cylinder see fig 22 b the spacing ratio was not an important parameter for determining the mean varying drag coefficient on the downstream cylinder in the present research the reason for this result is mainly related to the wake shielding effect xu et al 2018a found that lower frequencies and modes dominate the vibrations of the downstream cylinder compared to those of the upstream cylinder and the single cylinder the rms of il fluctuating force coefficients on the downstream flexible cylinder are also lower than the coefficients on the single flexible cylinder as described in section 4 1 2 to investigate the vortex shedding effect mean varying drag coefficients were calculated based on local flow velocity and the results are presented in fig 25 for the sake of a better comparison the maximum rms of the il displacement of the downstream cylinder versus the local reduced velocity is shown in fig 26 after eliminating the wake shielding effect the c dx mean values based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder are at the same level as those on the single flexible cylinder in the second order mode resonance region the c dx mean based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder with t d 4 0 and 6 0 is higher than that on the downstream cylinder with t d 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 at most local reduced velocities which makes the downstream cylinder with t d 4 0 and 6 0 have slightly higher il vibration amplitudes at these local reduced velocities in the third order mode resonance region the downstream cylinder with t d 4 0 6 0 10 0 and 16 0 has a much higher c dx mean based on local flow velocity than the single cylinder and the x max rms d of the downstream cylinder with these spacing ratios is increased monotonously with the local reduced velocity in the fourth order mode resonance region the c dx mean based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder with t d 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 is lower than that on the single cylinder which causes smaller il displacements the relationship between the c dx mean based on local flow velocity and x max rms d values of the downstream cylinder is complicated and nonlinear vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder has a significant effect on the mean varying drag coefficients on the downstream cylinder even when the spacing ratio is 16 0 fig 27 shows the modal weight of the il response displacements of the single cylinder and the downstream cylinder for t d 16 0 the local reduced velocities of the single cylinder and the downstream cylinder are 11 3 and 11 9 respectively the third order mode is the dominant mode of the il vibrations however due to the vortex shedding effect of the upstream cylinder the fourth order modal weights of the downstream cylinder are much larger than those of the single cylinder which is consistent with the higher c dx mean shown in fig 25 similar to the vibration in the cf direction the increase in varying drag coefficients calculated using the local flow velocity makes the adjacent modes have a greater contribution to the il vibration 4 2 3 il added mass coefficients fig 28 presents the mean il added mass coefficient on the two tandem cylinders in the second and third order mode resonance regions the c ax mean values on the single cylinder show a downtrend with reduced velocity which is in accordance with previous results han et al 2018a 2018b in the fourth and fifth order mode resonance regions the c ax mean on the single cylinder is approximately zero and changes slightly as shown in fig 28 a the variations in c ax mean on the upstream cylinder with t d 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 demonstrate a similar trend as those on the single cylinder in the second and third order mode resonance regions however the downstream cylinder has a slightly larger c ax mean than the single cylinder in the fourth and fifth order mode resonance regions except for in certain cases the c ax mean on the upstream cylinder is affected by the downstream cylinder resulting in a significant difference in the mean il added mass coefficients for example the upstream cylinder with certain spacing ratios have much lower c ax mean values which range from 0 5 to 1 5 at reduced velocities v r 7 5 18 8 these distinct c ax mean values are related to the large values of c il rms presented in fig 18 a in the cases where c ax mean is low and c il rms is high the results of il displacement frequency indicate that the il displacements have high harmonic components due to the wake interaction between the upstream cylinder and the downstream cylinder the mean il added mass coefficients were calculated based on multi frequency vibrations and have considered the coupling effect of multi frequency vibrations hence the values of c ax mean in such cases are distinct from those on the single cylinder the c ax mean on the downstream cylinder is affected by the combined wake shielding and vortex shedding effect see fig 28 b in the second order mode resonance region the c ax mean on the downstream cylinder shows similar tendencies with that on the single cylinder indicating that the il displacement frequency components of the downstream cylinder and the single cylinder differ only slightly however the c ax mean on the downstream cylinder in most cases is much lower than that on the single cylinder which corresponds to the large c il rms shown in fig 18 b the vortices shedding from the upstream cylinder act on the downstream cylinder and allow the il vibration of the downstream cylinder to have high harmonic components resulting in a low c ax mean when v r is larger than 20 0 the c ax mean values on the downstream cylinder with t d 10 0 and 16 0 are much higher than those on the single cylinder this phenomenon is mainly because the vortex shedding effect is weakened and the wake shielding effect is enhanced in such cases and the high harmonic components of the il displacement diminish 5 conclusions to investigate the fiv hydrodynamic features of two tandem flexible cylinders the hydrodynamic forces acting on the cylinders were reconstructed by a finite element model using experimental response data considering the coupling effect of the multi frequency vibrations the ff ls method was employed to obtain the lift coefficients varying drag coefficients cf added mass coefficients and il added mass coefficients according to the hydrodynamic coefficient results the effects of spacing ratio on the fiv hydrodynamic features of two tandem flexible cylinders were studied and discussed in detail some conclusions can be drawn as follows for the upstream flexible cylinder the hydrodynamic force coefficients in the cf direction show similar tendencies with those on the single flexible cylinder the rms of cf fluctuating force coefficients and the mean lift coefficients on the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 are slightly lower at high reduced velocities than those on the single cylinder which indicates that the downstream cylinder may disturb the vortices shedding from the upstream cylinder for t d 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 the downstream cylinder has a limited effect on the hydrodynamic force coefficients in the cf direction however the downstream cylinder has a moderate influence on the il hydrodynamic coefficients even when the spacing ratio is 16 0 due to vortex shedding interactions the il responses of the upstream cylinder have high harmonic components resulting in large rms of il fluctuating force coefficients and low mean il added mass coefficients due to the disturbance of the downstream cylinder the time varying frequency of the il displacements may be unstable and discontinuous making the upstream cylinder have low mean varying drag coefficients at some reduced velocities the hydrodynamic coefficients on the downstream cylinder are influenced by a combination of the wake shielding effect and the vortex shedding effect under the wake shielding effect a lower frequency dominates the vibrations of the downstream cylinder the rms of cf and il fluctuating force coefficients the mean lift coefficients and the mean varying drag coefficients are reduced the mean cf and il added mass coefficients are increased the rms of cf fluctuating force coefficients and the mean lift coefficients on the downstream cylinder reach local peaks at much higher reduced velocities in every single mode resonance regions than those on the single cylinder the vortices shedding from the upstream cylinder have a significant effect on the hydrodynamic coefficients on the downstream cylinder after eliminating the wake shielding effect the rms of cf fluctuating force coefficients and the mean lift coefficients calculated using the local flow velocity decrease as t d increases when t d increases to 16 0 the vortex shedding effect is weakened however the effect of vortex shedding on the il hydrodynamic coefficients is still strong even when the spacing ratio is 16 0 under the vortex shedding effect the il displacement has many high harmonic components that cause large rms of il fluctuating force coefficients and low mean il added mass coefficients the increases in the mean lift coefficients and the mean varying drag coefficients calculated using the local flow velocity enhance the contribution of the adjacent modes to the vibrations acknowledgments the support of this

22336,flow induced vibrations fiv of two tandem cylinders are the major concerns in many engineering fields however little attention is paid to the fiv mechanisms of two tandem flexible cylinders especially for the hydrodynamic features to investigate the fiv hydrodynamic characteristic of two tandem flexible cylinders the fluid forces on the flexible cylinders were reconstructed by a finite element model using the response displacements acquired from model tests considering the coupling effect of multi frequency vibrations the lift coefficients varying drag coefficients cross flow cf and in line il added mass coefficients were obtained utilizing the forgetting factor least squares ff ls method to investigate the influence of the spacing ratio t d where t is the center to center separation distance between the two cylinders and d is the cylinder diameter on the fiv hydrodynamic features five spacing ratios t d 4 0 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 were considered the upstream cylinder and the single cylinder have cf hydrodynamic coefficients that share similar trends versus the reduced velocity except for t d 4 0 the downstream cylinder may disturb the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder leading to the decrease in mean lift coefficients and mean varying drag coefficients on the upstream cylinder both the wake shielding effect and the vortex shedding effect have a significant influence on the hydrodynamic features of the downstream cylinder under the wake shielding effect the mean lift coefficients and mean varying drag coefficients on the downstream cylinder are reduced while the mean cf and il added mass coefficients are increased owing to the vortex shedding effect the mean lift coefficients and mean varying drag coefficients calculated using the local flow velocity are higher than those on the single cylinder which increases the contribution of the adjacent modes to the vibrations keywords spacing ratio hydrodynamic coefficients tandem flexible cylinder flow induced vibration 1 introduction cylindrical structures under flows normally experience fluctuating hydrodynamic forces induced by the well known vortex shedding phenomenon flexible or elastically mounted cylindrical structures can vibrate in two directions cross flow cf and in line il under periodic hydrodynamic forces this type of flow induced vibration fiv is widely observed in cylindrical structures such as marine risers mooring lines submarine pipelines chimney stacks stay cables and overhead transmission lines the fiv of cylindrical structures may result in fatigue damage which attracts extensive attention in many engineering applications hence this type of vibration problem has been studied by many investigators in recent decades and information about fluid structure interaction fsi mechanisms vortex modes structural responses and hydrodynamic features can be found in numerous publications bearman 2011 chaplin et al 2005 gao et al 2019 gopalkrishnan 1993 lu et al 2019 pavlovskaia et al 2016 williamson and govardhan 2008 wu and wang 2018 zhu et al 2019 groups of circular cylinders are becoming increasingly common in various engineering fields as a simple case with multiple cylinders the fiv of two tandem cylinders has been widely discussed in recent years due to wake flow interference the fiv of two tandem cylinders show distinct structural dynamics flow behaviours and hydrodynamic features compared to the fiv of an isolated cylinder many studies about the flow around two fixed rigid cylinders with tandem configuration have revealed important flow and hydrodynamic characteristics which are beneficial for revealing the complex fiv mechanisms of pairs of cylinders igarashi 1982 xu and zhou 2004 zhou and yiu 2016 three different flow types depending on the spacing ratio t d where t is the centre to centre space between the two cylinders and d is the outer diameter of the cylinder have been identified sumner 2010 zdravkovich 1987 when the spacing ratio is small 1 0 t d 1 2 1 8 an extended body regime is observed and the two cylinders are both wrapped in the vortices as the spacing ratio increases 1 2 1 8 t d 3 4 3 8 the shear layers of the upstream cylinder reattach to the surface of the downstream cylinder which is known as the reattachment regime at a large spacing ratio t d 3 4 3 8 vortex shedding appears between the two cylinders and the wake of the upstream cylinder interacts with the vortex shedding of the downstream cylinder which are the major features of the co shedding regime when the vortex shedding disappears between the cylinders the upstream cylinder has a lower mean drag compared to the isolated single cylinder while the downstream cylinder experiences negative mean drag furthermore the downstream cylinder experiences a larger lift than the upstream cylinder in the co shedding regime alam et al 2003 many studies have been conducted to explore the fiv response and hydrodynamic characteristics of two elastically mounted rigid cylinders in tandem arrangement the downstream cylinder is immersed in the wake flow of the upstream cylinder and experiences many influences of the wake flow hence the fiv hydrodynamic characteristics of the downstream cylinder have attracted considerable attention for the sake of simplification some researchers fix the upstream rigid cylinder and allow the downstream cylinder to vibrate in the wake flow from the stationary upstream cylinder hover and triantafyllou 2001 and assi et al 2010 2013 experimentally investigated the fiv of the downstream cylinder in hover and triantafyllou 2001 the downstream cylinder which was 4 75d behind the stationary leading cylinder was towed at reynolds number re 30000 re ud ν u is the flow velocity and ν is the kinematic viscosity coefficient the frequency lock in of the downstream cylinder began at nearly the same reduced velocity as that of an isolated single cylinder however the downstream cylinder experienced large amplitude galloping responses at high reduced velocities which conflicted with the vibration amplitude of the isolated single cylinder within the lock in region of the single cylinder the cf and il fluctuating force coefficients on the downstream cylinder were much lower than those on the single cylinder assi et al 2010 studied the wake induced vibration wiv at various spacing ratios beyond the critical value of t d 2 5 and the re was up to 30000 this study suggested that unsteady fluid structure interactions input energy into the system that sustained the wiv mechanism coherent vortices between the two cylinders impinged on the downstream cylinder and merged with the vortex shedding from the downstream cylinder which caused the cf fluctuating forces to be unsynchronized with the motion furthermore assi et al 2013 utilized the wake stiffness phenomenon to define the wiv characteristics the spacing ratio had remarkable influences on the responses and hydrodynamics of the downstream cylinder as the spacing ratio increased the diffusion of the vortices between the two cylinders was enhanced which induced weaker forces recently assi 2014 investigated the oscillations of the downstream cylinder with two degrees of freedom dof when the cylinders were arranged in the tandem form the wiv response was not qualitatively distinct with that in only the cf direction however the frequencies of the cf and il fluctuating forces showed that traces of the wake stiffness frequency affected the il oscillation rather than the cf oscillation the vibrations of the upstream cylinder enhance the complexity of the wake interference between the two tandem cylinders papaioannou et al 2008 xu et al 2019 zdravkovich 1985 zdravkovich 1985 studied the fiv of two tandem cylinders which were elastically mounted at low reduced velocities the fluid dynamic excitation forces were induced by the vortex shedding behind the cylinders the spacing ratio had a slight influence on the cf response of the upstream cylinder when t d was larger than approximately 2 2 the cf response of the downstream cylinder was very high at t d 4 75 and decreased as t d increased to approximately 7 0 at high reduced velocity oscillations resulted from the fluid elastic forces the downstream cylinder had large vibration amplitudes in both the cf and il directions at t d 4 0 and the amplitudes gradually grew with increasing reduced velocity prasanth and mittal 2009 numerically investigated the fiv of two tandem rigid cylinders with two dofs at re 100 the cf fluctuating force coefficient on the upstream cylinder which was 5 5d from the downstream cylinder was qualitatively similar to that on a single cylinder within the lock in region the maximum values of the cf and il fluctuating force coefficients on the downstream cylinder were lower than the coefficients on the upstream cylinder however the downstream cylinder experienced larger forces which were insensitive to the reduced velocity than the upstream cylinder beyond the lock in region papaioannou et al 2008 investigated the fiv of two tandem cylinders at re 160 the spacing ratio t d was 2 5 3 5 and 5 0 the maximum root mean square rms of the fluid force coefficients on the upstream cylinder varied among the different spacing ratios the cf fluctuating force coefficients on the upstream cylinder and the single cylinder were in good agreement at t d 5 0 within the lock in region the downstream cylinder had much lower il fluctuating force coefficients compared to the single cylinder haider and sohn 2018 investigated the free vibrations of two tandem cylinders in their cf directions at re 100 the spacing ratio t d varied from 1 05 to 12 0 the fluid force coefficients showed a discontinuous jump at a critical spacing ratio t d 3 5 where the upstream cylinder started shedding vortices below the critical spacing ratio the upstream cylinder had low values of cf fluctuating force coefficients for t d 4 0 8 0 the cf fluctuating force coefficients on the two cylinders remained constant the fiv response of two flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement has been studied by several researchers brika and laneville 1997 1999 showed that the upstream cylinder and its vibration significantly affected the response of the downstream cylinder the lock in of the downstream cylinder occurred at a higher reduced velocity than that of the isolated single cylinder and the lock in region of the former was much wider than that of the latter the downstream cylinder demonstrated a hysteresis response when the upstream cylinder was free to vibrate huera huarte and bearman 2011 huera huarte and gharib 2011 investigated the fiv of two tandem flexible cylinders at t d 2 0 8 0 both cylinders showed classical vortex induced vibrations at a low reduced velocity independent of the spacing ratios however at high reduced velocity the responses of the downstream cylinder varied with the spacing ratio when the spacing ratio was large enough for vortex shedding to exist in the gap between the two cylinders the vibrations of the downstream cylinder were wake induced at high reduced velocity furthermore huera huarte et al 2016 experimentally studied the multi mode vibration of a flexible cylinder in the wake of a stationary cylinder the multi mode response of the downstream cylinder was enhanced due to the wake of the upstream cylinder the spacing ratio had little influence on the displacement and frequency of the downstream cylinder recently xu et al 2018a 2018b conducted model tests to investigate the fiv dynamic characteristics of two tandem flexible cylinders and the suppression efficiency of helical strakes the upstream cylinder was insignificantly affected by the downstream cylinder due to wake shielding effects the downstream cylinder experienced larger mean drag coefficients than the upstream cylinder and isolated single cylinder regarding the displacement of the downstream cylinder there were no clear trends associated with the spacing ratio which is consistent with the results of huera huarte et al 2016 however except for in wang et al 2017 few attention is focused on the fiv hydrodynamics of two tandem flexible cylinders in wang et al 2017 the cf fiv of two tandem flexible cylinders were numerically investigated at re 500 with t d 2 5 3 5 and 5 0 the upstream cylinder had similar cf fluctuating force coefficients compared to the single cylinder at t d 5 0 which indicated that the downstream cylinder had a weak effect on this coefficient the cf fluctuating force coefficient on the downstream cylinder was very sensitive to the spacing ratio which was closely associated with the vortices between the two cylinders flexible cylinders with a large aspect ratio l d where l is the cylinder length such as marine risers stay cables and transmission lines are widely used in many engineering fields the oscillation of long flexible cylinders always exhibits multi mode behaviour which is more complicated than that of rigid cylinders the fiv mechanisms and hydrodynamic characteristics of two tandem rigid cylinders have been explored by many numerical and experimental studies however fewer studies have been done on the fiv hydrodynamics features of two tandem flexible cylinder compared to two tandem rigid cylinders in this paper the influences of the spacing ratio on the fiv hydrodynamic characteristics of two tandem flexible cylinders are investigated based on the reconstructed hydrodynamic forces it is a great challenge for measuring the fiv hydrodynamic forces on a flexible cylinder reconstructing the hydrodynamic forces on flexible cylinders using the displacements is a universal method that has been employed in many studies han et al 2018a huera huarte et al 2006 liu et al 2018 song et al 2016 to study the influences of the spacing ratio on the fiv hydrodynamic characteristics of two tandem flexible cylinders the forgetting factor least squares ff ls method is applied to calculate the hydrodynamic forces on the flexible cylinder under multi frequency vibrations the remainder of this paper is organized into the following sections the method for identifying the hydrodynamic coefficients on cylinders under multi frequency vibrations is described in section 2 introductions to the model tests and data processing are presented in section 3 the hydrodynamic coefficients in the cf and il directions are presented and discussed in section 4 some conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 calculation of fluid forces under multi frequency vibrations it is a great challenge for measuring the fiv hydrodynamic forces on a flexible cylinder without affecting the flowing field hence inverse analysis methods were applied to calculate the hydrodynamic force according to the responses of the flexible cylinder huera huarte et al 2006 song et al 2016 to further analyse hydrodynamic characteristics the cf fluctuating force was decomposed into two parts the part in phase with the velocity namely the lift and the part in phase with the acceleration namely the cf added mass force due to the effect of incoming flow the structure experiences the mean drag and the il fluctuating force in the il direction the il displacements of the structure are composed of the mean displacements and the vibration displacements the il fluctuating force is closely related to the vibration displacement similar to the hydrodynamic forces in cf direction the varying drag and the il added mass force can be calculated by decomposing the il fluctuating force many fluid force decomposition methods are based on a single frequency aronsen 2007 gopalkrishnan 1993 song et al 2016 however the fluid forces acting on two tandem flexible cylinders comprise robust multi frequency components due to the flow interactions between the cylinders liu et al 2018 proposed the ff ls method for identifying

al 2016 for the sake of brevity we take the identification of cf hydrodynamic coefficients as an example the flexible cylinder can be modelled as an euler bernoulli beam and the cf vibration equation of the flexible cylinder undergoing fiv can be expressed as eq 1 han et al 2018a huera huarte et al 2006 song et al 2016 1 e i 4 y z t z 4 t z 2 y z t z 2 c y y z t m s y z t f c f z t the flexible

from the model tests conducted by xu et al 2018a the velocity and acceleration in the cf direction y z t and y z t are calculated based on y z t by cubic spline method the cf fluctuating force f cf z

y f y the cf structural damping matrix c y can be expressed as 4 c y λ 3 m s λ 4 k e k g where λ 3 and λ 4 are the cf rayleigh damping constants which are obtained from free decay tests the fluid force load matrix f y is the only unknown in eq 3 and it is easy to calculate f y hence the cf fluctuating force f cf z t is determined from the fluid force load matrix the rms of the cf fluctuating force coefficient is calculated from eq 5 5 c c f r m s 2 ρ d u 2 l l l i 1 l l 1 n s j 1 n s f c f 2 z i t j the decomposition of the cf fluctuating force with multi frequency vibrations is

historical moment data before t n to identify θ n the decaying factor β was introduced when ff ls method was employed β is a constant and satisfies 0 β 1 at the present moment the decaying factor is equal to 1 while the decaying factor is β n 1 at the initial moment at different moments the force and response are multiplied by different decaying factors 19 f n β n 1 f n 1 β n 2 f n 2 β f n n 1 f

descriptions of model tests 3 1 experimental arrangement xu et al 2018a carried out model tests on two identical flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement in xu et al 2018a the multi mode fiv behaviours were presented and analysed in detail in this paper the fiv hydrodynamic force coefficients on the two cylinders were calculated using the response information acquired from the model tests in xu et al 2018a two flexible cylinders of the same size properties and pre tension were dragged by towing carriage in still water with a uniform velocity which generated the uniform flow condition the flow velocity in the experiments was varied from 0 05 m s to 1 0 m s with an interval of 0 05 m s the corresponding reynolds numbers nearly ranged from 800 to 16 000 the spacing ratios were set as t d 4 0 6 0 8 0 10 0 16 0 shown in fig 2 a total of 120 runs including the cases of two tandem cylinders and a single cylinder were carried out in each run the sampling time was 50s and the sampling frequency was 100hz to ensure the disturbed water clam down there were at least 15 min between two consecutive runs the flexible cylinder model was composed of an inner copper pipe with an outer diameter of 8 0 mm and a wall thickness of 1 0 mm and an outer silicone tube with an outer diameter of 16 mm seven measurement points were set on the inner copper pipe and each measurement point was installed four strain gauges to collect the bending strains in the cf and il directions the main properties of the flexible cylinder model are listed in table 1 more detailed information about the model tests can be found in xu et al 2018a recently the same flexible cylinder model had been employed to investigate the fiv characteristics of multi cylinders in various arrangements ma et al 2019 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2018c 2018d 3 2 natural frequencies and structural damping to obtain the natural characteristics of the flexible cylinder free decay tests were performed on each cylinder model in air and still water xu et al 2018e and han et al 2018b used the two flexible cylinders employed in xu et al 2018a to study the fiv responses and hydrodynamic characteristics of two side by side cylinders the first seven order natural frequencies in the cf direction of the flexible cylinders are presented in table 2 the natural frequencies in the il direction are close to those in the cf direction and are not presented the theoretical values of natural frequencies calculated from eq 25 are also presented in table 2 as a comparison lie and kaasen 2006 25 f n n 2 l t z m s m a n π l 2 e i m s m a where f n is the nth order natural frequency and m a is the added mass per unit when we calculate the natural frequency in air m a is equal to 0 however m a is equal to ρπd 2 4 if we calculate the natural frequency in water the cf natural frequencies of the flexible cylinder model show slight differences from the theoretical values the rayleigh damping constants can be calculated according to the structural damping ratios and the natural angular frequencies the calculation of structural damping ratios and the rayleigh damping constants were further explained in han et al 2018b the il rayleigh damping constants λ 1 λ 2 and the cf rayleigh damping constants λ 3 and λ 4 are shown in table 3 3 3 data processing the vibration displacements in the cf and il directions of the flexible cylinders were obtained based on the measured strains using the modal analysis method xu et al 2018a before reconstructing the oscillation displacement the strain signals were processed and filtered conservatively details of the strain processing method were presented in xu et al 2018a the displacement responses of two tandem flexible cylinders usually have multiple frequency components due to the flow interactions and the multi mode fivs utilizing the ff ls method hydrodynamic force coefficients with multi frequency components can be calculated the wavelet analysis method was employed to identify the frequency components of the displacement responses time frequency graphs of the cf displacement of the downstream cylinder for t d 8 0 and u 0 80 m s at two measurement points are presented in fig 3 the horizontal axis denotes time t and the vertical axis denotes the frequency the color bar represents the wavelet coefficient which is positively correlated with the energy of the frequency component a time frequency graph was drawn for each measurement point the graphs of the measurement points at z 0 375l and z 0 5l are presented as examples the graphs of the other measurement points have similar frequency components as the graph of the measurement point z 0 375l the displacement of the measurement point at z 0 5l has one prominent frequency of 8 10 hz while the displacements at the other measurement points have two prominent frequencies i e 4 97 hz and 8 10 hz hence the cf displacements were filtered at 4 97 hz and 8 10 hz with a bandwidth of 1 hz superposing the displacements at 4 97 hz and 8 10 hz we obtained a new displacement signal that was used to reconstruct the fluid forces acting on the flexible cylinder the frequency components of the il displacements are much wider than those of the cf displacements the filtered bandwidth of the il displacements was set as 2 hz the selection of μ must compromise between the loss of estimate accuracy and fast adaptive capability if the forgetting factor μ is large the data at the previous moments have strong effect on the result at the present moment and the noise effects are reduced in contrast for small μ values the data at the previous moments have weak effect on the result at the present moment and the estimate can easily track changes in the results to determine the forgetting factor μ the cf fluctuating forces f cf z t were reconstructed again using the lift coefficient and the added mass coefficients according to eq 13 fig 4 shows the cf fluctuating forces based on different μ on the downstream cylinder for t d 8 0 and u 0 80 m s re 12800 at z 0 375l the original f cf z t was calculated from eq 3 the rms values of f cf z t based on different μ are presented in table 4 the rms values of f cf z t based on different μ are close to that of the original f cf z t however some differences appear in several local peaks and troughs of the time varying f cf z t shown in fig 4 the deviation between the reconstructed f cf z t and the original f cf z t increases with increasing μ fig 4 indicates that the fast adaptive capability for μ 0 8 is the weakest among the three cases hence the forgetting factor μ was chosen from the values 0 6 and 0 7 fig 5 shows the time varying lift coefficient based on different μ on the downstream cylinder for t d 8 0 and u 0 80 m s re 12800 at z 0 375l the time varying lift coefficients on μ 0 6 have many narrow peaks and troughs at several moments which results from the noise of the signal the time mean c ly z t based on different μ are shown in table 4 due to the narrow peaks and troughs the time mean c ly z t based on μ 0 6 is much larger than that based on μ 0 7 considering the above described compromise the forgetting factor μ was set as 0 7 in the present research it should be pointed that the hydrodynamic coefficients based on μ 0 7 may not be the optimal results but the results of hydrodynamic coefficients have considerable accuracy for the qualitative analysis 4 results and discussion in this section the calculated hydrodynamic coefficients on the two flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement are presented and discussed the rms of cf fluctuating force coefficient c cf rms was obtained from eq 5 for the sake of a better comparison the mean lift coefficient c ly mean and the mean cf added mass c ay mean coefficient were determined based on the following formulas 26 c l y m e a n l l i 1 l l 1 n s j 1 n s c l y z i t j 27 c a y m e a n l l i 1 l l 1 n s j 1 n s c a y z i t j the rms of il fluctuating force coefficient c il rms the mean varying drag coefficient c dx mean and the mean il added mass c ax mean coefficient were determined by a similar method the reduced velocity is defined as v r u f 1 d f 1 is the theoretical value of the first order natural frequency in still water because the measured natural frequencies of the upstream cylinder and the downstream cylinder have small differences the theoretical value f 1 was selected to define the reduced velocity the cf and il fluctuating force coefficients vary with both time t and axial position z the time domain cf and il fluctuating force coefficients have a mean value near zero hence the rms of cf and il fluctuating force coefficients were calculated at each element node firstly to compare and analyse the results among all the conditions of spacing ratios and reduced velocities the axial mean values of the rms of cf and il fluctuating force coefficients were selected as the indices c ly z t c ay z t c dx z t and c ax z t under multi frequency vibration vary with both time t and axial position z while these coefficients under the single frequency vibration only vary with axial position z for the sake of comparison the time mean values of c ly z t c ay z t c dx z t and c ax z t were calculated firstly then axial mean values of these coefficients were acquired for the convenient analysis 4 1 hydrodynamic characteristics in the cf direction 4 1 1 cf fluctuating force coefficients fig 6 shows the rms of cf fluctuating force coefficient on the two cylinders with tandem configuration xu et al 2018a obtained the dominant modes of the two tandem flexible cylinders and the single cylinder undergoing fiv for clarity the figure includes four colored areas i ii iii and iv that indicate the first four order mode resonance regions of the single cylinder for example in the second order mode resonance region the second order modal weight is far larger than the other order modal weight and the second order mode dominates the vibration also the vibration dominant frequency is close to the second order natural frequency the areas between two adjacent mode resonance regions are the mode switch regions the results of the isolated single cylinder are indicated by a dark grey dashed line the results of the two tandem cylinders are presented by colored markers for the single flexible cylinder the c cf rms increases and after reaching local peak value decreases in every single mode resonance regions which is closely related to the variation in the cf response amplitudes similar phenomenon has been found in many studies about the fivs of a single flexible cylinder han et al 2018a 2018b huera huarte et al 2006 as shown in fig 6 a the c cf rms on the upstream cylinder with t d 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 shows similar tendencies with that on the single cylinder except for several reduced velocities v r 15 0 16 3 and 17 5 near the end of the second order mode resonance region at such reduced velocities the dominant frequencies of the upstream cylinder with t d 10 0 and 16 0 are slightly higher than those of the upstream cylinder with other spacing ratios and the single cylinder which results in slightly larger c cf rms however the c cf rms on the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 shows moderate and significant differences from that on the single cylinder in the second and third order mode resonance regions respectively it is possible that the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 is disturbed by the downstream cylinder the space of 4 0d is just an initial space between the two cylinders due to the oscillations of the cylinders and the different mean il displacements the space between the cylinders changes with time xu et al 2018a showed that the mean drag coefficients on the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 are significantly larger than those on the downstream cylinder at high reduced velocities indicating that the space between the cylinder may be smaller than 4 0d in addition the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 has low strouhal number found by xu et al 2018a fig 7 shows the time frequency graph of the cf displacements of the upstream cylinder for t d 4 0 and t d 6 0 at z 0 25l and v r 21 3 the response frequency of the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 changes dramatically with time which confirms that the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder is disturbed the c cf rms value on the upstream cylinder with a t d larger than 6 0 is slightly affected by the downstream cylinder however for t d 4 0 the downstream cylinder disturbs the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder and causes a decrease in c cf rms especially at high reduced velocities the rms of cf fluctuating force coefficients on the downstream cylinder are significantly affected by the upstream cylinder as shown in fig 6 b the c cf rms on the downstream cylinder always reaches local peaks at a much higher reduced velocity than that on the single cylinder moreover the former c cf rms peak values are smaller than the latter c cf rms peak values for t d 4 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 the downstream cylinder has approximately similar c cf rms values which are much larger than the c cf rms on the downstream cylinder with t d 16 0 the above phenomena are caused by the wake shielding effects huang and herfjord 2013 xu et al 2018a fig 8 shows the time frequency graph of the cf displacement of the two cylinders with t d 8 0 at z 0 125l and v r 21 29 the upstream cylinder oscillates with a dominant frequency of 8 37 hz while the downstream cylinder oscillates with two predominant frequency components of 5 57 hz and 8 47 hz due to the wake shielding effect the vortex shedding frequency of the downstream cylinder is approximately 5 57 hz which is much lower than the response frequency of the upstream cylinder in addition to the 5 57 hz frequency component the downstream cylinder has a frequency component of 8 47 hz which is close to the response frequency of the upstream cylinder hence the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder considerably affects the downstream cylinder it can be concluded that the upstream cylinder affects the hydrodynamic behaviour of the downstream cylinder in two ways the wake shielding effect and the vortex shedding effect the mean wake flow velocity of the downstream cylinder is not equal to the uniform flow velocity due to the wake shielding effects however the hydrodynamic coefficients of the downstream cylinder are calculated according to uniform flow velocity which cannot accurately indicate the hydrodynamic features of the downstream cylinder to weaken the wake shielding effect the mean wake flow velocity of the downstream cylinder was estimated using the wake velocity model proposed by schlichting 1968 and modified by huse 1993 huang and herfjord 2013 also employed the same wake velocity model to calculate the inflow to the downstream cylinder the wake flow velocity can be calculated using the formula as follows 28 u l u u c d d 4 d c d t where u l is the local flow velocity to the downstream cylinder and c d is the mean drag coefficient on the upstream cylinder in this paper the c d was chosen as 1 20 which is the mean drag coefficient on a fixed cylinder in uniform flow the local reduced velocity is v rl u l f 1d the hydrodynamic coefficients on the downstream cylinder were recalculated based on u l fig 9 shows the rms of the cf fluctuating force coefficients based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder versus the local reduced velocity using the local flow velocity the c cf rms on the downstream cylinder with t d 4 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 are significantly higher than the c cf rms on the single cylinder mainly due to the effect of vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder the c cf rms based on local flow velocity shows a decreasing trend as t d increases indicating that the intensity of the vortices from the upstream cylinder decreases with increasing t d when the spacing ratio is 16 0 the c cf rms based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder and the c cf rms on the single cylinder are close to each other in the first order mode resonance region however the downstream cylinder has a much lower c cf rms than the single cylinder in the second order mode resonance region because the wake velocity model still has some shortcomings for the flexible cylinder it can be concluded that the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder has a limited effect on the c cf rms on the downstream cylinder when the spacing ratio is increased to 16 0 assi et al 2010 showed that the vortices from the upstream wake have more time to diffuse and that the fluid structure interaction is weakened as the downstream cylinder is moved farther away which is consistent with the results of the present research the numerical study about two tandem flexible cylinders wang et al 2017 in low reynolds numbers found that a downstream cylinder experiences a larger c cf rms than an isolated single cylinder in the present research the c cf rms on the downstream cylinder does not show an uptrend with reduced velocity due to the wake shielding effect after removing the wake shielding effect the c cf rms based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder is much larger than that on the single cylinder which agrees with the numerical results reported by other researchers 4 1 2 lift coefficients fig 10 presents the mean lift coefficient of the two tandem flexible cylinders consistent with the c cf rms the c ly mean on the flexible cylinder reaches a local maximum value in every single mode resonance regions and then decreases to a low value at the interval between two adjacent mode resonance regions as shown in fig 10 a the mean lift coefficient c ly mean on the upstream cylinder shows similar tendencies with that on the single cylinder except for several reduced velocities which suggests that the downstream cylinder has limited effects on the upstream cylinder in the third order mode resonance region the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 experiences a much lower c ly mean than the single cylinder because the presence of the downstream cylinder disturbs the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder this conclusion can be verified by the time frequency graph of the cf displacement of the upstream cylinder shown in fig 7 fig 11 shows the time mean lift coefficient distribution of the single cylinder and the upstream cylinder for t d 4 0 8 0 and 16 0 at v r 21 3 when t d is equal to 16 0 the time mean lift coefficient distribution of the upstream cylinder show a similar tendency with that of the single cylinder except for the local peaks near z l 0 4 and 0 6 the time mean c ly z of the upstream cylinder with t d 8 0 is very close to that of the single cylinder except for a slight discrepancy near the two ends for t d 6 0 10 0 the upstream cylinder has a similar time mean c ly z as the single cylinder and the corresponding results are not presented here due to the effect of the downstream cylinder the time mean c ly z of the upstream cylinder is different from that of the single cylinder when the spacing ratio is 4 0 the time mean c ly z of the single cylinder has local maximum values at approximately z 0 2l and 0 8l however the time mean c ly z of the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 reaches a maximum value near the middle point due to the wake shielding effect the mean lift coefficient on the downstream cylinder achieves local maximum values at a much higher reduced velocity than the single cylinder as shown in fig 10 b at low reduced velocity the local peak values of mean lift coefficient on the downstream cylinder are slightly smaller than those on the single cylinder within the third order mode resonance region the c ly mean on the downstream cylinder is lower than that on the single cylinder considering the effect of spacing ratio the c ly mean on the downstream cylinder differs slightly with t d 4 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 however the downstream cylinder with t d 16 0 has a lower c ly mean than the downstream cylinder with other spacing ratios fig 12 shows the time mean lift coefficient distribution of the single cylinder and the downstream cylinder for t d 4 0 8 0 and 16 0 at v r 21 3 for t d 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 the time mean c ly z of the downstream cylinder are similar so the result of t d 6 0 and 10 0 are not presented here the time mean c ly z of the downstream cylinder varies depending on the spacing ratio the differences in the time mean c ly z between the downstream cylinder and the single cylinder increase with an increase in the spacing ratio the mean lift coefficients of the downstream cylinder shown in fig 10 b do not demonstrate high regularity owing to the combination of the wake shielding effect and the vortex shedding effect from the upstream cylinder fig 13 shows the mean lift coefficient based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder at the beginning of the first order mode resonance region the c ly mean based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder with t d 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 is slightly higher than the c ly mean on the single cylinder for t d 4 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 the downstream cylinder experiences significantly larger c ly mean based on local flow velocity than the single cylinder at the end of the first order mode resonance region and the interval between the first order mode and second order mode resonance regions however the c ly mean based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder with t d 10 0 and 16 0 and the c ly mean on the single cylinder are in good agreement in the first order mode resonance region except for the spacing ratio of 16 0 the downstream cylinder has very high c ly mean based on local flow velocity compared to the single cylinder in the second order mode resonance region the enlargement of the c ly mean based on local flow velocity is closely related to the vortex shedding effect of the upstream cylinder in general the c ly mean based on local flow velocity in the cases of t d 4 0 and 6 0 are much higher than those in the cases of t d 8 0 and 10 0 and the c ly mean based on local flow velocity in the case of t d 16 0 is similar to that on the single cylinder this phenomenon indicates that the effect of vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder gradually weakens as the spacing ratio increases due to the vortex shedding effect of the upstream cylinder the c ly mean based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder increases when the wake shielding effect is eliminated however the cf response amplitudes of the downstream flexible cylinder are not significantly increased xu et al 2018a to further investigate the effect of lift on the cf response amplitude the modal weight of the cf response amplitude was analysed fig 14 shows the modal weight of the cf response displacements of the single cylinder and the downstream cylinder with t d 10 0 the local reduced velocities of the single cylinder and the downstream cylinder are 12 5 and 12 3 respectively the second order mode is the dominant mode for the downstream cylinder and the single cylinder the second order modal weight values of the downstream cylinder and the single cylinder are roughly equivalent apart from the second order mode the third and fourth order modes make some contribution to the vibration in the cf direction however the third and fourth order modal weights of the downstream cylinder are much larger than those of the single cylinder it can be concluded that the enlargement of the lift coefficient calculated using the local flow velocity makes the adjacent modes have a greater contribution to the vibration due to the wake shielding effect the two flexible cylinders have different dominant modes and dominant frequencies the vortex shedding frequency of the upstream cylinder may be much higher than the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder hence the c ly mean based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder enlarged by the vortex shedding effect of the upstream cylinder has a limited effect on the dominant mode of the downstream cylinder but will enhance the modal weight of the adjacent modes owing to the mode competition the cf displacements of the downstream cylinder are not increased when the c ly mean based on local flow velocity is enlarged 4 1 3 cf added mass coefficients the added mass coefficient is one of the most important parameters in fsis aronsen 2007 gopalkrishnan 1993 vikestad et al 2000 the added mass coefficient on a single cylinder undergoing fiv decreases gradually with the reduced velocity within the mode resonance region leading to an increase of the natural frequency however insufficient data are available on the added mass coefficients of two tandem flexible cylinders undergoing fiv fig 15 presents the mean cf added mass coefficient on the two cylinders in tandem arrangement the c ay mean on the single flexible cylinder decreases monotonically with the reduced velocity in the first three order mode resonance regions in fig 15 a the variation in c ay mean on the upstream cylinder with t d 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 differs slightly from that on the single flexible cylinder for the case of t d 4 0 the c ay mean on the upstream cylinder shows some differences from that on the single cylinder within the third order mode resonance region the c ay mean on the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 is near the value 1 0 which is much higher than the value on the single cylinder the distinctness of the mean cf added mass coefficient is mainly related to the variation in the response frequency as mentioned above the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 can be disturbed by the downstream cylinder at high reduced velocities the time varying response frequency of the upstream cylinder with this spacing ratio is unstable over time as shown in fig 7 a hence the c ay mean on the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 does not decrease with the reduced velocity in the third order mode resonance region consequently the dominant frequencies of the upstream cylinder in such cases are slightly lower than those of the single cylinder and upstream cylinder in other cases xu et al 2018a due to the combined wake shielding and vortex shedding effects the mean cf added mass coefficients on the downstream cylinder are greatly scattered as shown in fig 15 b the downstream cylinder has a larger c ay mean than the single cylinder at v r 5 0 7 5 and 16 3 23 8 whereas the results are opposite at v r 8 8 13 8 to further investigate the effect of vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder the c ay mean on the downstream cylinder versus the local reduced velocity is presented in fig 16 for the sake of a better analysis fig 17 shows the cf dominant frequencies of the downstream cylinder versus the local reduced velocity when v rl is under 6 3 both the single cylinder and the downstream cylinder are in the first order mode resonance region and the c ay mean decreases gradually however due to the different intensities of the vortex shedding effect the c ay mean on the downstream cylinder with different spacing ratios varies among each other then the c ay mean on the downstream cylinder with t d 16 0 and the single cylinder gradually increase and reach a local peak in the second order mode resonance region in the cases of t d 4 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 the mean cf added mass coefficients reach a local maximum value rapidly which makes the vibration of the downstream cylinder enter the second order mode at relatively low local reduced velocities when the local reduced velocity ranges from 10 0 to 15 0 the c ay mean values on the downstream cylinder are much lower than those on the single cylinder consistent with the variation in the value of c ay mean the cf dominant frequencies at such reduced velocities are much higher than those of the single cylinder apart from the prominent cf dominant frequency the cf displacement of the downstream cylinder also has a frequency component close to the vortex shedding frequency of the upstream cylinder the mean cf added mass coefficients in the present research were calculated considering the coupling effect of multi frequency vibrations the frequency component closed to the vortex shedding frequency of the upstream cylinder may be one of the reasons that the c ay mean on the downstream cylinder is lower 4 2 hydrodynamic characteristics in the il direction 4 2 1 il fluctuating force coefficients fig 18 shows the rms of il fluctuating force coefficients on the two tandem flexible cylinders the il vibrations of the single cylinder are very complicated and the sixth order mode vibrations are excited for the single cylinder the c il rms reaches local maximum values in every single mode resonance regions higher order vibration modes are easily excited in the il direction and the rms of il fluctuating force coefficients do not change monotonically versus the reduced velocity in fig 18 a the variation in the c il rms on the upstream cylinder with t d 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 is generally identical to that on the single cylinder except for at some reduced velocities similar to c cf rms the c il rms on the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 is much lower than that on the single cylinder and the upstream cylinder with other spacing ratios at higher reduced velocities fig 19 shows the time frequency graph of the il displacement of the upstream cylinder for t d 4 0 and 6 0 at z 0 25l and v r 21 3 the il displacements of the upstream cylinder under the aforementioned conditions both have two predominant frequency components and the dominant frequency is the higher frequency component however the time varying frequencies of the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 are unstable which indicates that the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder is disturbed by the downstream cylinder hence the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 has low rms of il fluctuating force coefficients at high reduced velocities for cases with spacing ratios larger than 4 0 the downstream cylinder still shows some influence on the c il rms of the upstream cylinder the c il rms on the upstream cylinder is larger or smaller than that on the single cylinder at certain reduced velocities due to the wake interference between the two cylinders the il displacements of the upstream cylinder may have different frequency components compared to the single cylinder the discrepancies of the c il rms values are attributed to the different frequency components of the il displacements the c il rms on the downstream cylinder shows distinct characteristics compared to that on the single cylinder and the upstream cylinder as shown in fig 18 b the c il rms values on the downstream cylinder with all spacing ratios are similar to each other and much lower than the c il rms on the single cylinder in the second order mode resonance region which is attributed to the wake shielding effect of the upstream cylinder at v r 8 8 12 5 the downstream cylinder has a much higher value of c il rms than the single cylinder owing to the vortex shedding effect when the reduced velocity ranges from 15 0 to 18 8 the downstream cylinder with t d 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 experiences a much higher c il rms than the single cylinder and the downstream cylinder with t d 4 0 and 6 0 this is mainly because the wake shielding effect is weaker than the vortex shedding effect at such reduced velocities when v r exceeds 20 0 the downstream cylinder has low c il rms values due to wake shielding effects the c il rms on the downstream cylinder is significantly influenced by the wake shielding effects to further investigate the wake shielding effect on the il vibration fig 20 presents the time frequency graph of the il displacement of the two cylinders for t d 8 0 and v r 21 29 at z 0 5l the il displacements of the upstream cylinder have two predominant frequency components that are stable with a dominant frequency of 16 83 hz however the il displacements of the downstream cylinder have several unstable frequency components that are lower than the dominant frequency of the upstream cylinder due to the wake shielding effect hence the downstream cylinder has a much lower c il rms than the upstream cylinder to study the vortex shedding effects of the upstream cylinder in more detail the rms of il fluctuating force coefficient based on local flow velocity are presented in fig 21 the c il rms based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder is much higher than the c il rms on the single cylinder when the local reduced velocity ranges from 5 0 to 15 0 due to the fact that the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder may interact with the il vibration of the downstream cylinder the peak c il rms values based on local reduced flow velocity are decreased with increasing spacing ratios indicating that the interaction of vortices from the upstream cylinder with the downstream cylinder weakens with increasing spacing ratios when the t d is increased to 16 0 the effect of vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder on the downstream cylinder is still considerable 4 2 2 varying drag coefficients fig 22 shows the mean varying drag coefficient of the two tandem flexible cylinders as shown in fig 22 a the c dx mean values on the upstream cylinder with t d 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 are generally similar to that on the single cylinder which indicates that the downstream cylinder has a mild effect on the c dx mean on the upstream cylinder for t d 4 0 the downstream cylinder has much smaller c dx mean than the single cylinder as the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder may be disturbed by the downstream cylinder notably the c dx mean on the upstream cylinder with spacing ratios larger than 4 0 is still slightly different from that on the single cylinder at several reduced velocities such as v r 13 8 16 3 and 17 5 for example fig 23 shows the time frequency graph of the il displacement of the single cylinder and the upstream cylinder for t d 10 0 and v r 13 8 at z 0 25l in contrast with the il displacement frequencies of the single cylinder the time varying frequencies of the upstream cylinder with t d 10 0 are disordered and discontinuous fig 23 suggests that the il vibration of the upstream cylinder with a t d larger than 4 0 can be disturbed by the downstream cylinder at some reduced velocities fig 24 shows the time mean varying drag coefficient distribution of the single cylinder and the upstream cylinder for t d 4 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 at v r 13 8 the time mean c dx z of the upstream cylinder with t d 16 0 is similar to that of the upstream cylinder with t d 10 0 hence the result for t d 16 0 is not present here the time mean c dx z of the upstream cylinder is distinct from that of the single cylinder due to the presence of the downstream cylinder moreover the time mean c dx z of the upstream cylinder vary with the spacing ratios the c dx mean on the downstream cylinder is much lower than that on the single cylinder and the upstream cylinder see fig 22 b the spacing ratio was not an important parameter for determining the mean varying drag coefficient on the downstream cylinder in the present research the reason for this result is mainly related to the wake shielding effect xu et al 2018a found that lower frequencies and modes dominate the vibrations of the downstream cylinder compared to those of the upstream cylinder and the single cylinder the rms of il fluctuating force coefficients on the downstream flexible cylinder are also lower than the coefficients on the single flexible cylinder as described in section 4 1 2 to investigate the vortex shedding effect mean varying drag coefficients were calculated based on local flow velocity and the results are presented in fig 25 for the sake of a better comparison the maximum rms of the il displacement of the downstream cylinder versus the local reduced velocity is shown in fig 26 after eliminating the wake shielding effect the c dx mean values based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder are at the same level as those on the single flexible cylinder in the second order mode resonance region the c dx mean based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder with t d 4 0 and 6 0 is higher than that on the downstream cylinder with t d 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 at most local reduced velocities which makes the downstream cylinder with t d 4 0 and 6 0 have slightly higher il vibration amplitudes at these local reduced velocities in the third order mode resonance region the downstream cylinder with t d 4 0 6 0 10 0 and 16 0 has a much higher c dx mean based on local flow velocity than the single cylinder and the x max rms d of the downstream cylinder with these spacing ratios is increased monotonously with the local reduced velocity in the fourth order mode resonance region the c dx mean based on local flow velocity on the downstream cylinder with t d 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 is lower than that on the single cylinder which causes smaller il displacements the relationship between the c dx mean based on local flow velocity and x max rms d values of the downstream cylinder is complicated and nonlinear vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder has a significant effect on the mean varying drag coefficients on the downstream cylinder even when the spacing ratio is 16 0 fig 27 shows the modal weight of the il response displacements of the single cylinder and the downstream cylinder for t d 16 0 the local reduced velocities of the single cylinder and the downstream cylinder are 11 3 and 11 9 respectively the third order mode is the dominant mode of the il vibrations however due to the vortex shedding effect of the upstream cylinder the fourth order modal weights of the downstream cylinder are much larger than those of the single cylinder which is consistent with the higher c dx mean shown in fig 25 similar to the vibration in the cf direction the increase in varying drag coefficients calculated using the local flow velocity makes the adjacent modes have a greater contribution to the il vibration 4 2 3 il added mass coefficients fig 28 presents the mean il added mass coefficient on the two tandem cylinders in the second and third order mode resonance regions the c ax mean values on the single cylinder show a downtrend with reduced velocity which is in accordance with previous results han et al 2018a 2018b in the fourth and fifth order mode resonance regions the c ax mean on the single cylinder is approximately zero and changes slightly as shown in fig 28 a the variations in c ax mean on the upstream cylinder with t d 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 demonstrate a similar trend as those on the single cylinder in the second and third order mode resonance regions however the downstream cylinder has a slightly larger c ax mean than the single cylinder in the fourth and fifth order mode resonance regions except for in certain cases the c ax mean on the upstream cylinder is affected by the downstream cylinder resulting in a significant difference in the mean il added mass coefficients for example the upstream cylinder with certain spacing ratios have much lower c ax mean values which range from 0 5 to 1 5 at reduced velocities v r 7 5 18 8 these distinct c ax mean values are related to the large values of c il rms presented in fig 18 a in the cases where c ax mean is low and c il rms is high the results of il displacement frequency indicate that the il displacements have high harmonic components due to the wake interaction between the upstream cylinder and the downstream cylinder the mean il added mass coefficients were calculated based on multi frequency vibrations and have considered the coupling effect of multi frequency vibrations hence the values of c ax mean in such cases are distinct from those on the single cylinder the c ax mean on the downstream cylinder is affected by the combined wake shielding and vortex shedding effect see fig 28 b in the second order mode resonance region the c ax mean on the downstream cylinder shows similar tendencies with that on the single cylinder indicating that the il displacement frequency components of the downstream cylinder and the single cylinder differ only slightly however the c ax mean on the downstream cylinder in most cases is much lower than that on the single cylinder which corresponds to the large c il rms shown in fig 18 b the vortices shedding from the upstream cylinder act on the downstream cylinder and allow the il vibration of the downstream cylinder to have high harmonic components resulting in a low c ax mean when v r is larger than 20 0 the c ax mean values on the downstream cylinder with t d 10 0 and 16 0 are much higher than those on the single cylinder this phenomenon is mainly because the vortex shedding effect is weakened and the wake shielding effect is enhanced in such cases and the high harmonic components of the il displacement diminish 5 conclusions to investigate the fiv hydrodynamic features of two tandem flexible cylinders the hydrodynamic forces acting on the cylinders were reconstructed by a finite element model using experimental response data considering the coupling effect of the multi frequency vibrations the ff ls method was employed to obtain the lift coefficients varying drag coefficients cf added mass coefficients and il added mass coefficients according to the hydrodynamic coefficient results the effects of spacing ratio on the fiv hydrodynamic features of two tandem flexible cylinders were studied and discussed in detail some conclusions can be drawn as follows for the upstream flexible cylinder the hydrodynamic force coefficients in the cf direction show similar tendencies with those on the single flexible cylinder the rms of cf fluctuating force coefficients and the mean lift coefficients on the upstream cylinder with t d 4 0 are slightly lower at high reduced velocities than those on the single cylinder which indicates that the downstream cylinder may disturb the vortices shedding from the upstream cylinder for t d 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 the downstream cylinder has a limited effect on the hydrodynamic force coefficients in the cf direction however the downstream cylinder has a moderate influence on the il hydrodynamic coefficients even when the spacing ratio is 16 0 due to vortex shedding interactions the il responses of the upstream cylinder have high harmonic components resulting in large rms of il fluctuating force coefficients and low mean il added mass coefficients due to the disturbance of the downstream cylinder the time varying frequency of the il displacements may be unstable and discontinuous making the upstream cylinder have low mean varying drag coefficients at some reduced velocities the hydrodynamic coefficients on the downstream cylinder are influenced by a combination of the wake shielding effect and the vortex shedding effect under the wake shielding effect a lower frequency dominates the vibrations of the downstream cylinder the rms of cf and il fluctuating force coefficients the mean lift coefficients and the mean varying drag coefficients are reduced the mean cf and il added mass coefficients are increased the rms of cf fluctuating force coefficients and the mean lift coefficients on the downstream cylinder reach local peaks at much higher reduced velocities in every single mode resonance regions than those on the single cylinder the vortices shedding from the upstream cylinder have a significant effect on the hydrodynamic coefficients on the downstream cylinder after eliminating the wake shielding effect the rms of cf fluctuating force coefficients and the mean lift coefficients calculated using the local flow velocity decrease as t d increases when t d increases to 16 0 the vortex shedding effect is weakened however the effect of vortex shedding on the il hydrodynamic coefficients is still strong even when the spacing ratio is 16 0 under the vortex shedding effect the il displacement has many high harmonic components that cause large rms of il fluctuating force coefficients and low mean il added mass coefficients the increases in the mean lift coefficients and the mean varying drag coefficients calculated using the local flow velocity enhance the contribution of the adjacent modes to the vibrations acknowledgments the support of this

22337,maintenance of the main propulsion system is an important part of ship operation whose costs account for the most of the costs of ship machinery maintenance related literature has shown that condition based maintenance can minimize maintenance costs and machinery downtime in this respect we propose a one class support vector machine based approach for machinery decay status assessment which helps to achieve condition based maintenance the novelty of our work lies in the using of decision values returned by the trained models to estimate the decay degree and the main decay direction in particular only the normal data and a small amount of labeled decayed data is necessary in model training process which greatly reduces the requirement for labeled data consequently it can be used as a decision support tool for condition based maintenance not only on this plant but also on many other machinery keywords condition based maintenance one class svm decay detection decay degree main

occurs if the decay degree of one component in the equipment is deeper than that of other component we regard the decay of that component as the main decay direction of the equipment 1 introduction ships are the most important means of transport in global trade latest data show that more than ten billion tons of goods are transported by ships brooks and faust 2018 therefore ensuring the safe and efficient operation of ships can not only guarantee the smooth development of international trade but also bring huge economic benefits heij et al 2011 sufficient and efficient maintenance of machinery is an important aspect to guarantee the normal operation of ships cheliotis and lazakis 2018 it can not only reduce the failure rate of machinery but also prolong its service life liu and frangopol 2019 however maintenance is not always the more the better on one hand excessive maintenance will shorten continuous service time of machinery and inevitably lead to increased costs on the other hand it may bring some potential dangers caused by human factors how to balance under maintenance and over maintenance is an important research subject emovon et al 2015 at present there are three main maintenance strategies the first one is reactive maintenance the second one is time based maintenance and the third one is condition based maintenance ahmad and kamaruddin 2012 budai balke 2009 emovon et al 2015 reactive maintenance or called corrective maintenance is a remedial action taken after the machine breaks down coraddu et al 2014 kothamasu and huang 2007 undoubtedly reactive maintenance is a kind of under maintenance which can maximize the continuous service time of a system however due to the complexity of marine mechanical system a small fault may cause irreparable damage to the whole system under reactive maintenance strategy moreover reactive maintenance strategy requires to prepare a large number of spare parts and can only be used for non critical components with strong independence high redundancy and low cost lazakis et al 2018a although reactive maintenance reduces the cost in terms of maintenance times the cost in terms of spare parts preparation and accident consequences is often enormous coraddu et al 2014 time based maintenance is a kind of preventive maintenance performed before failure occurs which is a regular maintenance activity regardless of the machinery state cipollini et al 2018b coraddu et al 2014 lazakis et al 2018a the time interval of maintenance is determined by long term experience which has certain scientific basis this maintenance strategy can generally prevent most of the failures however time based maintenance is usually carried out under health machinery state which shortens the period of continuous running of machinery and has the problem of over maintenance besides it not only increases the maintenance costs but also may bring human errors into the maintenance process dhillon and liu 2006 moreover there is blindness in regular maintenance and it is impossible to maintain all parts of the machinery in an all round way the combination of reactive maintenance and time based maintenance is adopted in actual operation usually condition based maintenance also called predictive maintenance is such a maintenance strategy which detects the machinery state by means of intelligent analysis tools on the basis of data collected by sensors installed on the machines jardine et al 2006 it is based on condition monitoring of machinery lazakis et al 2018b which can maximize the period of continuous service and effectively prevent the occurrence of faults it is the main development direction of ship machinery maintenance in the future 1 1 related literatures although condition based maintenance has not yet been widely used in the maritime field some related attempts have been made by researchers an evolutionary neural networks model combining genetic algorithm and back propagation neural network has been proposed to predict the content of metal elements contained in lubricating oil of marine diesel engine wei and wang 2011 ahmad and kamaruddin 2012 presented an overview of time based and condition based maintenance in industrial application a numerical model of a naval vessel powered by a gas turbine as part of an innovative codlag system has been developed to predict the performance decay of the main components altosole et al 2014 two supervised machine learning algorithms such as regularized least squares and support vector regression have been applied to detect the decay of gas

ship machinery systems components through the combination of fault tree analysis and failure mode and effects analysis and artificial neural networks were used to predict the main engine cylinders exhaust gas temperature of a panamax size container ship raptodimos and lazakis 2018 proposed a method of artificial neural network self organizing map for data clustering of marine engine condition monitoring cipollini et al 2019 exploited an unsupervised deep learning architecture for induction motor bearing fault detection through extracting a compact and expressive representation of the bearings state from the stator current signal coraddu et al 2019 used one class support vector machine and k nearest neighbor to predict the hull and propeller fouling condition based on data measured by the on board systems of the research vessel named princess royal 1 2 aim of this paper in order to explore the application of condition based maintenance in ship machinery maintenance we need to establish a method to assess the decay state and main decay direction of ship machinery firstly unlike many other industries it is difficult to obtain labeled decayed data due to safety considerations and closed environment in maritime field therefore supervised learning algorithm can only achieve good results in theory but it is almost impossible in maritime practical application although decayed data with labels is difficult to obtain in the field of maritime there are a lot of normal data collected by the automation system that has not been used yet considering this situation we propose a one class svm based approach inspired by cipollini et al 2018b lazakis et al 2018a to assess the decay state of a marine gas turbine system which mainly uses normal data to train the assessment model our work is the continuation of cipollini et al 2018b coraddu et al 2014 for the same ship we will further accomplish two additional tasks on the basis of previous literatures which have achieved decay detection one is to estimate the overall decay degree of the system and another one is to predict which component of the equipment is more decayed since we have to retrain the decay detection model when estimating the overall decay degree of the system we will also briefly introduce the decay detection process although this has been achieved by previous literature cipollini et al 2018b based on the above this paper aims to explore the application of a one class svm based approach on the overall decay degree estimation and main decay direction prediction of a naval propulsion plant using normal data and a small amount of labeled decayed data this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a general description of the vessel and dataset section 3 presents the proposed one class svm based approach for decay degree estimation and main decay direction prediction section 4 presents the experiment results discussion and conclusion are presented in section 5 and section 6 respectively 2 vessel and dataset description 2 1 vessel description the vessel studied in this paper is a frigate characterized by a combined diesel electric and gas propulsion plant the main propulsion system of the frigate consists of a lm2500 marine gas turbine a cross connected gear box four clutches two propulsion motors two controllable pitch propellers and four diesel generators overall the gas turbine mechanically drives the controllable pitch propellers through the gearbox clutches and a propulsion motor is installed on each thrust shaft the propulsion system can work by electric propulsion composed of diesel generator set propulsion motor and controllable pitch propeller or by gas turbine propulsion composed of gas turbine gear box and controllable pitch propeller the switching of the two propulsion modes is realized by the operation of the clutches this paper only considers the gas turbine propulsion system for details about the vessel please refer to the literature coraddu et al 2014 2 2 dataset description the dataset used in this paper is from a real data validated numerical simulator developed for the vessel described in section 2 1 we get the dataset freely from the uci website in this dataset the authors considered the decay processes of the gas turbine compressor gtc and the gas turbine gt the dataset contains 11934 samples each sample consisting of 18 attributes as shown in table 1 in the 18 attributes attribute 17 and attribute 18 are both labeled attributes while the other 16 attributes represent measurements that correspond to sensors installed on the vessel the decay state coefficients reflect the decay degree of the components the smaller the decay coefficient the higher the decay degree in the measurements attribute 1 attribute 2 attribute 9 and attribute 12 are all scenarios attributes corresponding to different working conditions and the other 12 attributes are behavioral attributes corresponding to the performance parameters of the system since attribute 9 attribute 12 are constants there is no need to consider without considering the transient process attribute 1 and attribute 2 are linearly related therefore it s enough to consider either of the first two attributes as the representative of the working condition in this paper we take attribute 1 with the symbol lp as the representative of the working condition in theory the completely normal data is the samples with both decay coefficients equal to one however this kind of data is very few which is not enough to train an accurate model therefore we think that the normal data contains not only absolutely normal samples but also slightly decayed samples we define the normal data range reflected by the decay coefficients as follows cipollini et al 2018b 1 gtc c o e f f i c i e n t 0 98 1 g t c n o t d e c a y e d gtc c o e f f i c i e n t 0 0 98 g t c d e c a y e d 2 gt c o e f f i c i e n t 0 99 1 g t n o t d e c a y e d gt c o e f f i c i e n t 0 0 99 g t d e c a y e d 3 methodology 3 1 proposed method in this paper we use the euclidean distance between samples to reflect the degree and direction of equipment decay as shown in fig 1 on this basis we can use distance based algorithm for our research for decay detection it only needs to train a decision boundary with normal samples which has been achieved in previous literature cipollini et al 2018b lazakis et al 2018a however in practical work we are not only concerned about whether the equipment has been decayed but also about the degree of equipment decay and which component is more decayed considering these requirements we propose a one class svm based approach to accomplish the above two additional tasks in this process we need to train three different models based on the same one class svm algorithm to achieve different detection objectives the differences between the three models are only reflected in the selection of training data besides the distance values returned by the models are considered and they play an important role in the estimation of decay degree and the prediction of main decay direction the first model corresponding to decision boundary 1 is used for the decay degree estimation in addition it also has the function of decay detection we use the distance value returned by decision boundary 1 as a measure of the decay degree if we only care about whether the equipment has decayed it is enough to train the model without any labeled data but only with normal data if we want to estimate the decay degree of the equipment according to the distance value we need a most decayed labeled data point to determine a lower limit of the distance value this labeled data point should meet the requirement that both gtc and gt are decayed to the upper limit if the required labeled data is not available we can focus on the changing rate of the distance values the sudden acceleration of the changing rate usually indicates that the decay is accelerating which often indicates that a fault is about to occur and needs special attention of the marine engineers the second model corresponding to decision boundary 2 is used to estimate the degree of test samples tending to the upper limit of gtc decay it is trained with a few decayed samples which satisfy the requirement that gtc reaches the decay upper limit but gt almost has no decay we use the distance values returned by the trained model to estimate the degree of test samples tending to the upper limit of gtc decay the third model corresponding to decision boundary 3 is used to estimate the degree of test samples tending to the upper limit of gt decay it is trained with a few decayed samples which satisfy the requirement that gt reaches the decay upper limit but gtc almost has no decay we use the distance values returned by the trained model to estimate the degree of test samples tending to the upper limit of gt decay we choose to oversample the two training datasets because the training datasets of the second model and the third model are too small to predict the main decay direction is to predict which component is more decayed it can be achieved through comparing the distances of test samples tending to decision boundary 2 and decision boundary 3 however it is impossible to predict the main decay direction by directly comparing the distance values returned by the second model and the third model because the parameters of the second model and the third model are different therefore we choose to normalize the two sets of distance values separately and take the normalized distance values as the confidence levels which indicate the percentage degree of the test samples tending to the two decision boundaries finally we predict the main decay direction by comparing the two sets of confidence levels the toolbox we used in this paper is the libsvm toolbox written by professor chih jen lin of taiwan university chang and lin 2011 3 2 data pre processing the dataset used in this paper is clean without noise missing values and non numerical items but data pre processing is still necessary firstly we need to remove some invariant and linearly related attributes to reduce the dimension of the dataset after this process only one scenario attribute with a symbol lp needs to be considered and there are only 12 behavioral attributes left in addition the attribute lp will be used as a hyperparameter in the detection models another purpose of data pre processing is data normalization which is generally regarded as the basic work of data mining tan 2018 the purpose of normalization is to avoid the influence of different dimension data on data analysis vafaei et al 2018 in addition data normalization is also helpful to improve the convergence rate of the model kohler et al 2019 the normalization method used in this paper is the built in mapminmax function in matlab in order to observe the data more intuitively we visualized the normalized data under different working conditions in fig 2 we find that the parameters that can reflect the decay of equipment are different under different working conditions although the previous literature cipollini et al 2018b has proved that the decay detection performance under different working conditions is similar different working conditions still need to be considered in order to confirm whether the decay degree estimation and the main decay direction prediction follow the same rule in addition we also find that the decay degree of the equipment is positively correlated with the distance between the decayed measurements and non decayed measurements thus it is possible to estimate the decay degree according to the distance relationship between samples 3 3 decay assessment model in our work the one class svm algorithm is used to train the decay assessment model which is one of the most popular algorithms for one class classification khan and madden 2009 it is a semi supervised learning algorithm developed from the theory of classical support vector machine which can train a decision boundary only by using normal samples to separate normal samples from decayed samples lazakis et al 2018a the classification hyperplane can be defined as schölkopf et al 2000 3 w t x b 0 where w is the weight vector perpendicular to the classification hyperplane x and b are the input vector and bias term respectively in one class support vector machines it cannot train a decision boundary according to the classical principle of maximizing the interval between the support vectors of two classes due to the absence of another class in fact it is assumed that the origin is the only negative sample in feature space the goal of learning is to find a decision boundary as far as possible from the origin as the best decision boundary which means that the decision boundary should be as close as possible to the normal training samples in original space khan and madden 2009 the feature space is a higher dimensional space than the original space it is mapped by mapping function whose aim is to make the indivisible samples in low dimensional space easier to separate in a high dimensional space the classification hyperplane in high dimensional space can be defined as 4 w t φ x ρ 0 where w is the normal vector of the hyperplane φ x is the mapping function ρ is the margin between the origin and the mapped samples in feature space the euclidean distance from the origin to the support vector point is ρ w therefore the original optimization problem of one class support vector machines is to maximize ρ w the final optimization problem of one class support vector machine can be transformed into schölkopf et al 2000 5 min w ρ ξ i 1 2 w 2 1 v n i 1 n ξ i ρ subject to w t φ x i ρ ξ i and ξ i 0 i where v 0 1 is the upper bound of classification error rate and the lower bound of the number of all support vectors wu and srihari 2003 n is the number of input samples ξ i are the slack variables in order to increase the robustness of the model ρ is the offset it is a convex quadratic programming problem with global optimal solution by introducing lagrange multiplier method to solve the problem the final decision function is obtained as follows 6 f x sgn i 1 n α i k x i x ρ where α i can be obtained by solving the dual problem 7 min α i 1 2 i 1 n j 1 n α i α j k x i x j subject to 0 α i 1 v n i 1 n α i 1 ρ can be obtained from any sample that satisfies the requirement that 0 α j 1 v n and that sample is a support vector 8 ρ j 1 n α j k x i x j where k x i x j is the kernel function that will be described in section 3 3 1 3 3 1 kernel function kernel function is the core content of svm algorithm it maps the indivisible samples in the original space to a dimensional feature space to make them linear separable schölkopf and smola 2001 let x i and x j be any two points of the input vector x in the original space then the expression of the kernel function can be defined as follows 9 k x i x j φ x i φ x j although there are a variety of kernel functions to choose rbf kernel functions can usually achieve better performance so generally as the first choice hsu et al 2003 in our work we select to use rbf kernel function which is defined as follows 10 k x i x j exp x i x j 2 σ 2 σ is the radial base radius let γ 1 σ 2 then formula 10 can be changed to k x i x j exp γ x i x j 2 it can also be called gaussian kernel function 3 3 2 decision value and distance one class svm is a classification algorithm based on boundary partition the trained model is actually a decision boundary since the decision boundary is determined by training samples the distance between the test sample and the decision boundary can reflect the proximity or similarity between the test sample and the training samples the absolute distance between test sample and decision boundary is defined as follows chang and lin 2011 11 d absolute de c i s i o n v a l u e w where the decision value is determined by the trained model and the input vector after the model is trained the decision value depends only on the input vector then the distance between test sample and decision boundary depends only on the test sample however according to the description in lazakis et al 2018a the distance of test sample to the hyperplane can also be positive negative and zero a positive distance indicates that the test sample is a normal sample a negative distance indicates that the test sample is outside the normal range and a distance of zero indicates that the sample falls on the hyperplane consequently the distance can also be defined as 12 d de c i s i o n v a l u e w in fact the absolute distance defined in formula 11 is easy to confuse normal and decayed samples thus affecting the estimation of the decay degree and the distance defined in formula 12 just can solve this problem therefore we choose the distance defined in formula 12 to estimate the decay degree of test samples since w is a constant after the model is trained we can also choose the decision value as a measure of the distance between the test sample and the decision boundary in our work we firstly consider using the distance value as a measure of decay degree then we find that using decision values which are more accessible can achieve the same results according to formula 12 therefore we finally choose the decision value as the index to measure the decay degree of the system however this method can only be used in the same svm model because they have the same model parameters among different models the model parameters are different and only the test sample are the same so that the decision values or distance values cannot be directly compared then we consider normalizing the distance values of all test samples as the confidence levels of the samples toward the decision boundary since w can be eliminated in the process of distance normalization the normalization of distances and the normalization of decision values are actually equivalent in the later work we will directly use the decision value as a measure of sample decay 3 3 3 hyperparameter optimization the performance of most algorithms depends heavily on the selection of hyperparameters in the one class svm with rbf kernel function there are two significant hyperparameters v and γ need to be optimized in our work we use k fold cross validation method to optimize the hyper parameters k fold cross validation is a statistical analysis method to verify the performance of classifiers it firstly divides the original training dataset into k subsets evenly then the dataset composed of k 1 subsets is used as training set to train the model and the remaining subset is used as a validation set to verify the performance of the classifier finally the classification accuracy of the validation set on the classifier is used as an index to evaluate the performance of the classifier since each subset needs to be used as a validation set k classifier models will be trained and the average classification accuracy of the validation set will be used as the comprehensive performance index to evaluate the classifier under k fold cross validation k fold cross validation can only evaluate the performance of the model under a certain combination of hyperparameters but cannot change the hyperparameters automatically selection of hyperparameters still depends on other search algorithms in our work we firstly tried to search the optimal parameters by using particle swarm optimization pso pso has a shorter search time but it is easy to fall into the local optimal solution therefore we finally choose the grid search algorithm 3 4 experiments in our experiments we train three one class svm models using different training datasets to achieve the tasks of decay degree estimation and main decay direction prediction under different working condition represented by lp in addition in order to characterize the decay degree and decay balance we introduce the concepts of aoddi bdt bddi and ddt actual overall decay degree index aoddi 13 aoddi n o r m a l i z e d n o r m a l i z e d g t c c o e f f i c i e n t n o r m a l i z e d g t c o e f f i c i e n t where aoddi 0 1 the lower the aoddi the deeper the overall decay balanced decay threshold bdt and balanced decay degree index bddi 14 bddi n o r m a l i z e d g t c c o e f f i c i e n t n o r m a l i z e d g t c c o e f f i c i e n t n o r m a l i z e d g t

have undergone serious decay and need to be maintained it is not necessary to analyze whether the decay is balanced or not our work of main decay direction prediction is to identify imbalanced decay in non deep decay samples 3 4 1 overall decay degree estimation we use the normalized decision values to estimate the decay degree all normal samples are used as training dataset and the remaining samples are used as test dataset since this training dataset contains all combinations of gtc and gt decay coefficients in normal ranges it is almost impossible in practice therefore we use nonparametric bootstrap method to resample with replacement for 1000 times to simulate the conditions in a real ship as much as possible at the same time as a classification problem the decay detection results will also be obtained in the process of decay degree estimation 3 4 2 main decay direction prediction the main decay direction prediction is to estimate which component is more decayed it can be transformed into a problem that which most decayed boundary the test sample tends to in our experiments a few amount of decayed samples are used to train the two models of decision boundary 2 and decision boundary 3 and all the decayed samples are used as test dataset the training dataset of the gtc most decayed model is composed of samples whose gtc decay reaches the upper limit and gt has almost no decay and the training dataset of the gt most decayed model is composed of samples whose gt decay reaches the upper limit and gtc has almost no decay each model is trained with three six nine samples respectively since each training dataset is too small to train an accurate model the oversampling method is adopted the training datasets are both oversampled to 50 times the original size and then the models are trained for 100 times respectively using datasets obtained by nonparametric bootstrap method with replacement finally we calculate the two sets of test samples confidence levels according to the decision values returned by the two trained models to predict which component is more decayed algorithm 1 prediction of main decay direction image 10229 3 5 validation 3 5 1 validation of the overall decay degree to validate the effectiveness of our method for overall decay degree estimation we need to select an indicator that can measure the actual overall decay degree of equipment in our work we take the actual overall decay degree index aoddi defined in formula 13 as the indicator therefore we can validate the effectiveness of our method by comparing the normalized decision values and the normalized sum of coefficients 3 5 2 validation of the main decay direction to validate the accuracy of our method for main decay direction prediction we need to select an indicator that can measure which component is more decayed in our work we take the difference symbols of the two sets of normalized decay state coefficients as the index of actual main decay direction by comparing the symbols of predicted main decay direction with that of the actual main decay direction we can obtain the prediction accuracy of our method algorithm 2 validation of main decay direction image 10171 considering that it is not necessary to predict the main decay direction for samples with deep decay or balanced decay two thresholds are used to filter out samples that are more necessary to detect as test dataset one is based on the contribution of single component decay to overall decay referring to the definition of balanced decay degree index bddi which can help to filter out severe imbalanced decayed samples another is based on the consideration of the depth of the overall decay referring to the definition of deep decay threshold ddt deep decay often means that both components are severely decayed and they both need to be maintained in this case it is not meaningful to distinguish which component is more decayed therefore we select the test samples according to the balanced decay threshold bdt and the deep decay threshold ddt to test our models ability to detect significant imbalanced decay algorithm 3 prediction of main decay direction considering thresholds image 10381 3 5 3 sensitivity analysis in the training of models for main decay direction prediction our goal is not to find the models with the highest classification accuracies but to find the decision boundaries that best represents the training samples however it is often not easy to obtain such accurate fitting models especially when there are few training samples in order to test the sensitivity of the final prediction of main decay direction to the classification accuracies of decision boundary 2 and decision boundary 3 several sets of experiments are conducted with decision boundary 2 and decision boundary 3 under a variety of classification accuracies the models of decision boundary 2 and decision boundary 3 are trained 100 times respectively all combinations of these two sets of models are used in the final main decay direction prediction 4 results in this section we present the results of experiments described in section 3 4 based on the dataset described in section 2 2 in table 2 the results of overall decay detection with only normal samples are presented and the results are the average of 1000 tests in fig 3 and fig 4 we present the estimation of decay degree based on decision values returned by the trained model we carried out 1000 tests under each working condition the results described in figs 3 and 4 are the intermediate results among the 1000 tests in addition we marked the balanced decay samples gtc more decayed samples and gt more decayed samples with different colors in fig 5 we present the accuracy of main decay direction predicted by the models trained with nine labeled samples for each model when lp 9 ddt 0 25 bdt 0 25 in fig 6 we present the accuracy of main decay direction predicted by the model trained with nine labeled samples when lp 9 ddt varies from 0 3 to 0 9 and bdt varies from 0 to 0 5 in fig 7 we present the accuracy of main decay direction predicted by the model trained with six labeled samples when lp 9 ddt varies from 0 3 to 0 9 and bdt varies from 0 to 0 5 in fig 8 we present the accuracy of main decay direction predicted by the model trained with three labeled samples when lp 9 ddt varies from 0 3 to 0 9 and bdt varies from 0 to 0 5 in table 3 we present the predicted result of main decay direction under different working conditions 5 discussion this section presents the discussion of the results described in section 4 from figs 3 and 4 we find that the overall decay degree estimated by the decision values and the actual overall decay degree trend determined by the decay coefficients are basically consistent under different working conditions in particular the pattern of decay degree reflected by decision values is more obvious in balanced decay and the more balanced the decay the more obvious the pattern is actually component decay is usually balanced or nearly balanced in many cases therefore it is reasonable for us to use decision values to estimate the decay degree of samples in term of misclassifications all samples of misclassification are concentrated in areas with low decay degree and all decay can be detected correctly as decay deepens as for the imbalanced decay compared with the same decay degree of gtc and gt the decision value disturbance caused by gtc decay is more obvious than that caused by gt decay that is to say gtc decay results in a greater variation in sensor parameters than gt decay does in practice in order to estimate the degree of decay a baseline needs to be determined which includes the upper limit and lower limit of the decay degree the most decayed sample being input the trained model can return a decision value which represents the upper limit of decay degree the non decayed sample being input the trained model can return a decision value which represents the lower limit of decay degree in general it is easy to get non decayed samples without any special labels therefore it is sufficient for us to estimate the decay degree with only one most decayed labeled sample in the prediction process we can obtain the decision value of each sample by normalizing these decision values we can estimate the decay degree of these samples even if the most decayed labeled sample is not available our method is still effective to some extent in this case we cannot determine the decay degree of the test sample but we can estimate the decay rate of the equipment from the changing rate of the decision values in general the faster the equipment decay the greater the changing rate of the decision value rapid decay of an equipment is often the precursor of some failures which requires the attention of marine engineers in practice we need not only to know whether the equipment has decayed but also to know which component has decayed more which is helpful for us to schedule the next maintenance and avoid unnecessary maintenance in our work we define this phenomenon of different decay degrees of each component as imbalanced decay in imbalanced decay our goal is to determine which component decayed more and to know the degree of imbalance the higher the degree of imbalance the higher the decay degree of the more decayed component and the lower decay degree of the other component in extremely imbalanced decay only the more decayed component need to overhaul in the decay of equilibrium or very low degree of imbalance each component needs to be maintained as we all know the model with high classification accuracy for training samples fits training samples well and the model with high classification accuracy for test samples has good generalization performance however as shown in fig 5 we can still get good prediction results even if the fitting or generalization performance of the model is not good enough which greatly reduces the requirement of model training as shown in figs 6 figs 7 and 8 it is obvious that the prediction accuracy does not change significantly as the number of training samples decreases so it is enough to train a detection model to predict the main decay direction with only three labeled samples in addition we also find that the prediction accuracy for main decay direction increases gradually with the increase of decay imbalance in particular the prediction accuracy of main decay direction of our model for the extreme imbalanced decay is high to nearly 100 usually samples with extreme imbalanced decay are more valuable for maintenance because in this case we only need to maintain the seriously decayed component which will greatly reduce the necessary workload as shown in table 3 the parameter lp has no significant effect on the main decay direction prediction except that the performance of the model declined slightly when lp 7 in fact decay detection decay degree estimation and main decay direction prediction are not completely independent but are used in conjunction with each other generally the decay detection is performed firstly but if no decay is detected the subsequent steps are not necessary and no labeled samples are needed in this process however if decay is detected an estimation of decay degree is required in which case a labeled sample is required in the process of decay degree estimation if deep decay is detected it is not necessary to perform main decay direction prediction and we should act maintenance directly if only minor decay is detected the equipment can continue to run without maintenance if the overall decay degree is in an intermediate state the main decay direction needs to be detected to determine which component needs to be maintained firstly in this process six labeled samples are required totally three for each model even without any labeled samples we can still complete the decay detection task and estimate the decay rate according to the changing rate of decision values to provide decision support for engineers compared with previous literature cipollini et al 2018b we separate the detection steps which not only enhances the interpretability of our method but also makes it more flexible and practical more importantly we implement more detection capabilities and the number of labeled samples used is reduced 6 conclusion maintenance of the ship main propulsion system is an important and arduous work requiring experienced engineers and effective procedures in condition based maintenance the primary work is to assess the decay status of the equipment accurately to determine whether it needs to be maintained which will help to reduce the requirement for the engineers experience and help to schedule the maintenance work in decay status assessment of a system containing multiple components we are not only interested in the overall decay status but also in the overall decay degree and the main decay direction in this study we present a methodology for the decay status assessment of a naval propulsion plant using a set of data generated by a real data validated simulator three models based on the one class svm algorithm are trained for the decay degree estimation and main decay direction prediction these models show good performance under different working conditions the main findings of the research conducted are as follows our approach can estimate the decay degree and main decay direction accurately with less labeled data compared with previous literature even without any labeled data we can still roughly estimate the decay rate of the equipment according to the changing rate of the decision values it can be used as a decision support tool for marine engineers in main decay direction prediction the classification accuracy of the detection models has little effect on the final prediction results which greatly reduces the requirement for models training the parameter lp has no significant effect on the decay degree estimation and main decay direction prediction since the proposed method does not contain many assumptions it has the potentiality to be used for decay status assessment of many other machines or other parts of the same machine the main disadvantage of our method is that it still requires a small amount of labeled data and cannot achieve completely unsupervised learning the acquisition of such labeled data is still challenging in practice in conclusion our method can achieve decay degree estimation and main decay direction prediction with a small amount of labeled samples which can be used as a decision support tool for condition based maintenance moreover it has the potentiality to be further extended to the decay status assessment of many other machinery declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement the work presented in this paper is the continuation of cipollini et al 2018b coraddu et al 2014

22337,maintenance of the main propulsion system is an important part of ship operation whose costs account for the most of the costs of ship machinery maintenance related literature has shown that condition based maintenance can minimize maintenance costs and machinery downtime in this respect we propose a one class support vector machine based approach for machinery decay status assessment which helps to achieve condition based maintenance the novelty of our work lies in the using of decision values returned by the trained models to estimate the decay degree and the main decay direction in particular only the normal data and a small amount of labeled decayed data is necessary in model training process which greatly reduces the requirement for labeled data consequently it can be used as a decision support tool for condition based maintenance not only on this plant but also on many other machinery keywords condition based maintenance one class svm decay detection decay degree main

occurs if the decay degree of one component in the equipment is deeper than that of other component we regard the decay of that component as the main decay direction of the equipment 1 introduction ships are the most important means of transport in global trade latest data show that more than ten billion tons of goods are transported by ships brooks and faust 2018 therefore ensuring the safe and efficient operation of ships can not only guarantee the smooth development of international trade but also bring huge economic benefits heij et al 2011 sufficient and efficient maintenance of machinery is an important aspect to guarantee the normal operation of ships cheliotis and lazakis 2018 it can not only reduce the failure rate of machinery but also prolong its service life liu and frangopol 2019 however maintenance is not always the more the better on one hand excessive maintenance will shorten continuous service time of machinery and inevitably lead to increased costs on the other hand it may bring some potential dangers caused by human factors how to balance under maintenance and over maintenance is an important research subject emovon et al 2015 at present there are three main maintenance strategies the first one is reactive maintenance the second one is time based maintenance and the third one is condition based maintenance ahmad and kamaruddin 2012 budai balke 2009 emovon et al 2015 reactive maintenance or called corrective maintenance is a remedial action taken after the machine breaks down coraddu et al 2014 kothamasu and huang 2007 undoubtedly reactive maintenance is a kind of under maintenance which can maximize the continuous service time of a system however due to the complexity of marine mechanical system a small fault may cause irreparable damage to the whole system under reactive maintenance strategy moreover reactive maintenance strategy requires to prepare a large number of spare parts and can only be used for non critical components with strong independence high redundancy and low cost lazakis et al 2018a although reactive maintenance reduces the cost in terms of maintenance times the cost in terms of spare parts preparation and accident consequences is often enormous coraddu et al 2014 time based maintenance is a kind of preventive maintenance performed before failure occurs which is a regular maintenance activity regardless of the machinery state cipollini et al 2018b coraddu et al 2014 lazakis et al 2018a the time interval of maintenance is determined by long term experience which has certain scientific basis this maintenance strategy can generally prevent most of the failures however time based maintenance is usually carried out under health machinery state which shortens the period of continuous running of machinery and has the problem of over maintenance besides it not only increases the maintenance costs but also may bring human errors into the maintenance process dhillon and liu 2006 moreover there is blindness in regular maintenance and it is impossible to maintain all parts of the machinery in an all round way the combination of reactive maintenance and time based maintenance is adopted in actual operation usually condition based maintenance also called predictive maintenance is such a maintenance strategy which detects the machinery state by means of intelligent analysis tools on the basis of data collected by sensors installed on the machines jardine et al 2006 it is based on condition monitoring of machinery lazakis et al 2018b which can maximize the period of continuous service and effectively prevent the occurrence of faults it is the main development direction of ship machinery maintenance in the future 1 1 related literatures although condition based maintenance has not yet been widely used in the maritime field some related attempts have been made by researchers an evolutionary neural networks model combining genetic algorithm and back propagation neural network has been proposed to predict the content of metal elements contained in lubricating oil of marine diesel engine wei and wang 2011 ahmad and kamaruddin 2012 presented an overview of time based and condition based maintenance in industrial application a numerical model of a naval vessel powered by a gas turbine as part of an innovative codlag system has been developed to predict the performance decay of the main components altosole et al 2014 two supervised machine learning algorithms such as regularized least squares and support vector regression have been applied to detect the decay of gas

lazakis et al 2018a investigated a one class svm driven approach to estimate ship systems condition with noon report data lazakis et al 2018b provided a systematic approach for identifying critical ship machinery systems components through the combination of fault tree analysis and failure mode and effects analysis and artificial neural networks were used to predict the main engine cylinders exhaust gas temperature of a panamax size container ship raptodimos and lazakis 2018 proposed a method of artificial neural network self organizing map for data clustering of marine engine condition monitoring cipollini et al 2019 exploited an unsupervised deep learning architecture for induction motor bearing fault detection through extracting a compact and expressive representation of the bearings state from the stator current signal coraddu et al 2019 used one class support vector machine and k nearest neighbor to predict the hull and propeller fouling condition based on data measured by the on board systems of the research vessel named princess royal 1 2 aim of this paper in order to explore the application of condition based maintenance in ship machinery maintenance we need to establish a method to assess the decay state and main decay direction of ship machinery firstly unlike many other industries it is difficult to obtain labeled decayed data due to safety considerations and closed environment in maritime field therefore supervised learning algorithm can only achieve good results in theory but it is almost impossible in maritime practical application although decayed data with labels is difficult to obtain in the field of maritime there are a lot of normal data collected by the automation system that has not been used yet considering this situation we propose a one class svm based approach inspired by cipollini et al 2018b lazakis et al 2018a to assess the decay state of a marine gas turbine system which mainly uses normal data to train the assessment model our work is the continuation of cipollini et al 2018b coraddu et al 2014 for the same ship we will further accomplish two additional tasks on the basis of previous literatures which have achieved decay detection one is to estimate the overall decay degree of the system and another one is to predict which component of the equipment is more decayed since we have to retrain the decay detection model when estimating the overall decay degree of the system we will also briefly introduce the decay detection process although this has been achieved by previous literature cipollini et al 2018b based on the above this paper aims to explore the application of a one class svm based approach on the overall decay degree estimation and main decay direction prediction of a naval propulsion plant using normal data and a small amount of labeled decayed data this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a general description of the vessel and dataset section 3 presents the proposed one class svm based approach for decay degree estimation and main decay direction prediction section 4 presents the experiment results discussion and conclusion are presented in section 5 and section 6 respectively 2 vessel and dataset description 2 1 vessel description the vessel studied in this paper is a frigate characterized by a combined diesel electric and gas propulsion plant the main propulsion system of the frigate consists of a lm2500 marine gas turbine a cross connected gear box four clutches two propulsion motors two controllable pitch propellers and four diesel generators overall the gas turbine mechanically drives the controllable pitch propellers through the gearbox clutches and a propulsion motor is installed on each thrust shaft the propulsion system can work by electric propulsion composed of diesel generator set propulsion motor and controllable pitch propeller or by gas turbine propulsion composed of gas turbine gear box and controllable pitch propeller the switching of the two propulsion modes is realized by the operation of the clutches this paper only considers the gas turbine propulsion system for details about the vessel please refer to the literature coraddu et al 2014 2 2 dataset description the dataset used in this paper is from a real data validated numerical simulator developed for the vessel described in section 2 1 we get the dataset freely from the uci website in this dataset the authors considered the decay processes of the gas turbine compressor gtc and the gas turbine gt the dataset contains 11934 samples each sample consisting of 18 attributes as shown in table 1 in the 18 attributes attribute 17 and attribute 18 are both labeled attributes while the other 16 attributes represent measurements that correspond to sensors installed on the vessel the decay state coefficients reflect the decay degree of the components the smaller the decay coefficient the higher the decay degree in the measurements attribute 1 attribute 2 attribute 9 and attribute 12 are all scenarios attributes corresponding to different working conditions and the other 12 attributes are behavioral attributes corresponding to the performance parameters of the system since attribute 9 attribute 12 are constants there is no need to consider without considering the transient process attribute 1 and attribute 2 are linearly related therefore it s enough to consider either of the first two attributes as the representative of the working condition in this paper we take attribute 1 with the symbol lp as the representative of the working condition in theory the completely normal data is the samples with both decay coefficients equal to one however this kind of data is very few which is not enough to train an accurate model therefore we think that the normal data contains not only absolutely normal samples but also slightly decayed samples we define the normal data range reflected by the decay coefficients as follows cipollini et al 2018b 1 gtc c o e f f i c i e n t 0 98 1 g t c n o t d e c a y e d gtc c o e f f i c i e n t 0 0 98 g t c d e c a y e d 2 gt c o e f f i c i e n t 0 99 1 g t n o t d e c a y e d gt c o e f f i c i e n t 0 0 99 g t d e c a y e d 3 methodology 3 1 proposed method in this paper we use the euclidean distance between samples to reflect the degree and direction of equipment decay as shown in fig 1 on this basis we can use distance based algorithm for our research for decay detection it only needs to train a decision boundary with normal samples which has been achieved in previous literature cipollini et al 2018b lazakis et al 2018a however in practical work we are not only concerned about whether the equipment has been decayed but also about the degree of equipment decay and which component is more decayed considering these requirements we propose a one class svm based approach to accomplish the above two additional tasks in this process we need to train three different models based on the same one class svm algorithm to achieve different detection objectives the differences between the three models are only reflected in the selection of training data besides the distance values returned by the models are considered and they play an important role in the estimation of decay degree and the prediction of main decay direction the first model corresponding to decision boundary 1 is used for the decay degree estimation in addition it also has the function of decay detection we use the distance value returned by decision boundary 1 as a measure of the decay degree if we only care about whether the equipment has decayed it is enough to train the model without any labeled data but only with normal data if we want to estimate the decay degree of the equipment according to the distance value we need a most decayed labeled data point to determine a lower limit of the distance value this labeled data point should meet the requirement that both gtc and gt are decayed to the upper limit if the required labeled data is not available we can focus on the changing rate of the distance values the sudden acceleration of the changing rate usually indicates that the decay is accelerating which often indicates that a fault is about to occur and needs special attention of the marine engineers the second model corresponding to decision boundary 2 is used to estimate the degree of test samples tending to the upper limit of gtc decay it is trained with a few decayed samples which satisfy the requirement that gtc reaches the decay upper limit but gt almost has no decay we use the distance values returned by the trained model to estimate the degree of test samples tending to the upper limit of gtc decay the third model corresponding to decision boundary 3 is used to estimate the degree of test samples tending to the upper limit of gt decay it is trained with a few decayed samples which satisfy the requirement that gt reaches the decay upper limit but gtc almost has no decay we use the distance values returned by the trained model to estimate the degree of test samples tending to the upper limit of gt decay we choose to oversample the two training datasets because the training datasets of the second model and the third model are too small to predict the main decay direction is to predict which component is more decayed it can be achieved through comparing the distances of test samples tending to decision boundary 2 and decision boundary 3 however it is impossible to predict the main decay direction by directly comparing the distance values returned by the second model and the third model because the parameters of the second model and the third model are different therefore we choose to normalize the two sets of distance values separately and take the normalized distance values as the confidence levels which indicate the percentage degree of the test samples tending to the two decision boundaries finally we predict the main decay direction by comparing the two sets of confidence levels the toolbox we used in this paper is the libsvm toolbox written by professor chih jen lin of taiwan university chang and lin 2011 3 2 data pre processing the dataset used in this paper is clean without noise missing values and non numerical items but data pre processing is still necessary firstly we need to remove some invariant and linearly related attributes to reduce the dimension of the dataset after this process only one scenario attribute with a symbol lp needs to be considered and there are only 12 behavioral attributes left in addition the attribute lp will be used as a hyperparameter in the detection models another purpose of data pre processing is data normalization which is generally regarded as the basic work of data mining tan 2018 the purpose of normalization is to avoid the influence of different dimension data on data analysis vafaei et al 2018 in addition data normalization is also helpful to improve the convergence rate of the model kohler et al 2019 the normalization method used in this paper is the built in mapminmax function in matlab in order to observe the data more intuitively we visualized the normalized data under different working conditions in fig 2 we find that the parameters that can reflect the decay of equipment are different under different working conditions although the previous literature cipollini et al 2018b has proved that the decay detection performance under different working conditions is similar different working conditions still need to be considered in order to confirm whether the decay degree estimation and the main decay direction prediction follow the same rule in addition we also find that the decay degree of the equipment is positively correlated with the distance between the decayed measurements and non decayed measurements thus it is possible to estimate the decay degree according to the distance relationship between samples 3 3 decay assessment model in our work the one class svm algorithm is used to train the decay assessment model which is one of the most popular algorithms for one class classification khan and madden 2009 it is a semi supervised learning algorithm developed from the theory of classical support vector machine which can train a decision boundary only by using normal samples to separate normal samples from decayed samples lazakis et al 2018a the classification hyperplane can be defined as schölkopf et al 2000 3 w t x b 0 where w is the weight vector perpendicular to the classification hyperplane x and b are the input vector and bias term respectively in one class support vector machines it cannot train a decision boundary according to the classical principle of maximizing the interval between the support vectors of two classes due to the absence of another class in fact it is assumed that the origin is the only negative sample in feature space the goal of learning is to find a decision boundary as far as possible from the origin as the best decision boundary which means that the decision boundary should be as close as possible to the normal training samples in original space khan and madden 2009 the feature space is a higher dimensional space than the original space it is mapped by mapping function whose aim is to make the indivisible samples in low dimensional space easier to separate in a high dimensional space the classification hyperplane in high dimensional space can be defined as 4 w t φ x ρ 0 where w is the normal vector of the hyperplane φ x is the mapping function ρ is the margin between the origin and the mapped samples in feature space the euclidean distance from the origin to the support vector point is ρ w therefore the original optimization problem of one class support vector machines is to maximize ρ w the final optimization problem of one class support vector machine can be transformed into schölkopf et al 2000 5 min w ρ ξ i 1 2 w 2 1 v n i 1 n ξ i ρ subject to w t φ x i ρ ξ i and ξ i 0 i where v 0 1 is the upper bound of classification error rate and the lower bound of the number of all support vectors wu and srihari 2003 n is the number of input samples ξ i are the slack variables in order to increase the robustness of the model ρ is the offset it is a convex quadratic programming problem with global optimal solution by introducing lagrange multiplier method to solve the problem the final decision function is obtained as follows 6 f x sgn i 1 n α i k x i x ρ where α i can be obtained by solving the dual problem 7 min α i 1 2 i 1 n j 1 n α i α j k x i x j subject to 0 α i 1 v n i 1 n α i 1 ρ can be obtained from any sample that satisfies the requirement that 0 α j 1 v n and that sample is a support vector 8 ρ j 1 n α j k x i x j where k x i x j is the kernel function that will be described in section 3 3 1 3 3 1 kernel function kernel function is the core content of svm algorithm it maps the indivisible samples in the original space to a dimensional feature space to make them linear separable schölkopf and smola 2001 let x i and x j be any two points of the input vector x in the original space then the expression of the kernel function can be defined as follows 9 k x i x j φ x i φ x j although there are a variety of kernel functions to choose rbf kernel functions can usually achieve better performance so generally as the first choice hsu et al 2003 in our work we select to use rbf kernel function which is defined as follows 10 k x i x j exp x i x j 2 σ 2 σ is the radial base radius let γ 1 σ 2 then formula 10 can be changed to k x i x j exp γ x i x j 2 it can also be called gaussian kernel function 3 3 2 decision value and distance one class svm is a classification algorithm based on boundary partition the trained model is actually a decision boundary since the decision boundary is determined by training samples the distance between the test sample and the decision boundary can reflect the proximity or similarity between the test sample and the training samples the absolute distance between test sample and decision boundary is defined as follows chang and lin 2011 11 d absolute de c i s i o n v a l u e w where the decision value is determined by the trained model and the input vector after the model is trained the decision value depends only on the input vector then the distance between test sample and decision boundary depends only on the test sample however according to the description in lazakis et al 2018a the distance of test sample to the hyperplane can also be positive negative and zero a positive distance indicates that the test sample is a normal sample a negative distance indicates that the test sample is outside the normal range and a distance of zero indicates that the sample falls on the hyperplane consequently the distance can also be defined as 12 d de c i s i o n v a l u e w in fact the absolute distance defined in formula 11 is easy to confuse normal and decayed samples thus affecting the estimation of the decay degree and the distance defined in formula 12 just can solve this problem therefore we choose the distance defined in formula 12 to estimate the decay degree of test samples since w is a constant after the model is trained we can also choose the decision value as a measure of the distance between the test sample and the decision boundary in our work we firstly consider using the distance value as a measure of decay degree then we find that using decision values which are more accessible can achieve the same results according to formula 12 therefore we finally choose the decision value as the index to measure the decay degree of the system however this method can only be used in the same svm model because they have the same model parameters among different models the model parameters are different and only the test sample are the same so that the decision values or distance values cannot be directly compared then we consider normalizing the distance values of all test samples as the confidence levels of the samples toward the decision boundary since w can be eliminated in the process of distance normalization the normalization of distances and the normalization of decision values are actually equivalent in the later work we will directly use the decision value as a measure of sample decay 3 3 3 hyperparameter optimization the performance of most algorithms depends heavily on the selection of hyperparameters in the one class svm with rbf kernel function there are two significant hyperparameters v and γ need to be optimized in our work we use k fold cross validation method to optimize the hyper parameters k fold cross validation is a statistical analysis method to verify the performance of classifiers it firstly divides the original training dataset into k subsets evenly then the dataset composed of k 1 subsets is used as training set to train the model and the remaining subset is used as a validation set to verify the performance of the classifier finally the classification accuracy of the validation set on the classifier is used as an index to evaluate the performance of the classifier since each subset needs to be used as a validation set k classifier models will be trained and the average classification accuracy of the validation set will be used as the comprehensive performance index to evaluate the classifier under k fold cross validation k fold cross validation can only evaluate the performance of the model under a certain combination of hyperparameters but cannot change the hyperparameters automatically selection of hyperparameters still depends on other search algorithms in our work we firstly tried to search the optimal parameters by using particle swarm optimization pso pso has a shorter search time but it is easy to fall into the local optimal solution therefore we finally choose the grid search algorithm 3 4 experiments in our experiments we train three one class svm models using different training datasets to achieve the tasks of decay degree estimation and main decay direction prediction under different working condition represented by lp in addition in order to characterize the decay degree and decay balance we introduce the concepts of aoddi bdt bddi and ddt actual overall decay degree index aoddi 13 aoddi n o r m a l i z e d n o r m a l i z e d g t c c o e f f i c i e n t n o r m a l i z e d g t c o e f f i c i e n t where aoddi 0 1 the lower the aoddi the deeper the overall decay balanced decay threshold bdt and balanced decay degree index bddi 14 bddi n o r m a l i z e d g t c c o e f f i c i e n t n o r m a l i z e d g t c c o e f f i c i e n t n o r m a l i z e d g t

have undergone serious decay and need to be maintained it is not necessary to analyze whether the decay is balanced or not our work of main decay direction prediction is to identify imbalanced decay in non deep decay samples 3 4 1 overall decay degree estimation we use the normalized decision values to estimate the decay degree all normal samples are used as training dataset and the remaining samples are used as test dataset since this training dataset contains all combinations of gtc and gt decay coefficients in normal ranges it is almost impossible in practice therefore we use nonparametric bootstrap method to resample with replacement for 1000 times to simulate the conditions in a real ship as much as possible at the same time as a classification problem the decay detection results will also be obtained in the process of decay degree estimation 3 4 2 main decay direction prediction the main decay direction prediction is to estimate which component is more decayed it can be transformed into a problem that which most decayed boundary the test sample tends to in our experiments a few amount of decayed samples are used to train the two models of decision boundary 2 and decision boundary 3 and all the decayed samples are used as test dataset the training dataset of the gtc most decayed model is composed of samples whose gtc decay reaches the upper limit and gt has almost no decay and the training dataset of the gt most decayed model is composed of samples whose gt decay reaches the upper limit and gtc has almost no decay each model is trained with three six nine samples respectively since each training dataset is too small to train an accurate model the oversampling method is adopted the training datasets are both oversampled to 50 times the original size and then the models are trained for 100 times respectively using datasets obtained by nonparametric bootstrap method with replacement finally we calculate the two sets of test samples confidence levels according to the decision values returned by the two trained models to predict which component is more decayed algorithm 1 prediction of main decay direction image 10229 3 5 validation 3 5 1 validation of the overall decay degree to validate the effectiveness of our method for overall decay degree estimation we need to select an indicator that can measure the actual overall decay degree of equipment in our work we take the actual overall decay degree index aoddi defined in formula 13 as the indicator therefore we can validate the effectiveness of our method by comparing the normalized decision values and the normalized sum of coefficients 3 5 2 validation of the main decay direction to validate the accuracy of our method for main decay direction prediction we need to select an indicator that can measure which component is more decayed in our work we take the difference symbols of the two sets of normalized decay state coefficients as the index of actual main decay direction by comparing the symbols of predicted main decay direction with that of the actual main decay direction we can obtain the prediction accuracy of our method algorithm 2 validation of main decay direction image 10171 considering that it is not necessary to predict the main decay direction for samples with deep decay or balanced decay two thresholds are used to filter out samples that are more necessary to detect as test dataset one is based on the contribution of single component decay to overall decay referring to the definition of balanced decay degree index bddi which can help to filter out severe imbalanced decayed samples another is based on the consideration of the depth of the overall decay referring to the definition of deep decay threshold ddt deep decay often means that both components are severely decayed and they both need to be maintained in this case it is not meaningful to distinguish which component is more decayed therefore we select the test samples according to the balanced decay threshold bdt and the deep decay threshold ddt to test our models ability to detect significant imbalanced decay algorithm 3 prediction of main decay direction considering thresholds image 10381 3 5 3 sensitivity analysis in the training of models for main decay direction prediction our goal is not to find the models with the highest classification accuracies but to find the decision boundaries that best represents the training samples however it is often not easy to obtain such accurate fitting models especially when there are few training samples in order to test the sensitivity of the final prediction of main decay direction to the classification accuracies of decision boundary 2 and decision boundary 3 several sets of experiments are conducted with decision boundary 2 and decision boundary 3 under a variety of classification accuracies the models of decision boundary 2 and decision boundary 3 are trained 100 times respectively all combinations of these two sets of models are used in the final main decay direction prediction 4 results in this section we present the results of experiments described in section 3 4 based on the dataset described in section 2 2 in table 2 the results of overall decay detection with only normal samples are presented and the results are the average of 1000 tests in fig 3 and fig 4 we present the estimation of decay degree based on decision values returned by the trained model we carried out 1000 tests under each working condition the results described in figs 3 and 4 are the intermediate results among the 1000 tests in addition we marked the balanced decay samples gtc more decayed samples and gt more decayed samples with different colors in fig 5 we present the accuracy of main decay direction predicted by the models trained with nine labeled samples for each model when lp 9 ddt 0 25 bdt 0 25 in fig 6 we present the accuracy of main decay direction predicted by the model trained with nine labeled samples when lp 9 ddt varies from 0 3 to 0 9 and bdt varies from 0 to 0 5 in fig 7 we present the accuracy of main decay direction predicted by the model trained with six labeled samples when lp 9 ddt varies from 0 3 to 0 9 and bdt varies from 0 to 0 5 in fig 8 we present the accuracy of main decay direction predicted by the model trained with three labeled samples when lp 9 ddt varies from 0 3 to 0 9 and bdt varies from 0 to 0 5 in table 3 we present the predicted result of main decay direction under different working conditions 5 discussion this section presents the discussion of the results described in section 4 from figs 3 and 4 we find that the overall decay degree estimated by the decision values and the actual overall decay degree trend determined by the decay coefficients are basically consistent under different working conditions in particular the pattern of decay degree reflected by decision values is more obvious in balanced decay and the more balanced the decay the more obvious the pattern is actually component decay is usually balanced or nearly balanced in many cases therefore it is reasonable for us to use decision values to estimate the decay degree of samples in term of misclassifications all samples of misclassification are concentrated in areas with low decay degree and all decay can be detected correctly as decay deepens as for the imbalanced decay compared with the same decay degree of gtc and gt the decision value disturbance caused by gtc decay is more obvious than that caused by gt decay that is to say gtc decay results in a greater variation in sensor parameters than gt decay does in practice in order to estimate the degree of decay a baseline needs to be determined which includes the upper limit and lower limit of the decay degree the most decayed sample being input the trained model can return a decision value which represents the upper limit of decay degree the non decayed sample being input the trained model can return a decision value which represents the lower limit of decay degree in general it is easy to get non decayed samples without any special labels therefore it is sufficient for us to estimate the decay degree with only one most decayed labeled sample in the prediction process we can obtain the decision value of each sample by normalizing these decision values we can estimate the decay degree of these samples even if the most decayed labeled sample is not available our method is still effective to some extent in this case we cannot determine the decay degree of the test sample but we can estimate the decay rate of the equipment from the changing rate of the decision values in general the faster the equipment decay the greater the changing rate of the decision value rapid decay of an equipment is often the precursor of some failures which requires the attention of marine engineers in practice we need not only to know whether the equipment has decayed but also to know which component has decayed more which is helpful for us to schedule the next maintenance and avoid unnecessary maintenance in our work we define this phenomenon of different decay degrees of each component as imbalanced decay in imbalanced decay our goal is to determine which component decayed more and to know the degree of imbalance the higher the degree of imbalance the higher the decay degree of the more decayed component and the lower decay degree of the other component in extremely imbalanced decay only the more decayed component need to overhaul in the decay of equilibrium or very low degree of imbalance each component needs to be maintained as we all know the model with high classification accuracy for training samples fits training samples well and the model with high classification accuracy for test samples has good generalization performance however as shown in fig 5 we can still get good prediction results even if the fitting or generalization performance of the model is not good enough which greatly reduces the requirement of model training as shown in figs 6 figs 7 and 8 it is obvious that the prediction accuracy does not change significantly as the number of training samples decreases so it is enough to train a detection model to predict the main decay direction with only three labeled samples in addition we also find that the prediction accuracy for main decay direction increases gradually with the increase of decay imbalance in particular the prediction accuracy of main decay direction of our model for the extreme imbalanced decay is high to nearly 100 usually samples with extreme imbalanced decay are more valuable for maintenance because in this case we only need to maintain the seriously decayed component which will greatly reduce the necessary workload as shown in table 3 the parameter lp has no significant effect on the main decay direction prediction except that the performance of the model declined slightly when lp 7 in fact decay detection decay degree estimation and main decay direction prediction are not completely independent but are used in conjunction with each other generally the decay detection is performed firstly but if no decay is detected the subsequent steps are not necessary and no labeled samples are needed in this process however if decay is detected an estimation of decay degree is required in which case a labeled sample is required in the process of decay degree estimation if deep decay is detected it is not necessary to perform main decay direction prediction and we should act maintenance directly if only minor decay is detected the equipment can continue to run without maintenance if the overall decay degree is in an intermediate state the main decay direction needs to be detected to determine which component needs to be maintained firstly in this process six labeled samples are required totally three for each model even without any labeled samples we can still complete the decay detection task and estimate the decay rate according to the changing rate of decision values to provide decision support for engineers compared with previous literature cipollini et al 2018b we separate the detection steps which not only enhances the interpretability of our method but also makes it more flexible and practical more importantly we implement more detection capabilities and the number of labeled samples used is reduced 6 conclusion maintenance of the ship main propulsion system is an important and arduous work requiring experienced engineers and effective procedures in condition based maintenance the primary work is to assess the decay status of the equipment accurately to determine whether it needs to be maintained which will help to reduce the requirement for the engineers experience and help to schedule the maintenance work in decay status assessment of a system containing multiple components we are not only interested in the overall decay status but also in the overall decay degree and the main decay direction in this study we present a methodology for the decay status assessment of a naval propulsion plant using a set of data generated by a real data validated simulator three models based on the one class svm algorithm are trained for the decay degree estimation and main decay direction prediction these models show good performance under different working conditions the main findings of the research conducted are as follows our approach can estimate the decay degree and main decay direction accurately with less labeled data compared with previous literature even without any labeled data we can still roughly estimate the decay rate of the equipment according to the changing rate of the decision values it can be used as a decision support tool for marine engineers in main decay direction prediction the classification accuracy of the detection models has little effect on the final prediction results which greatly reduces the requirement for models training the parameter lp has no significant effect on the decay degree estimation and main decay direction prediction since the proposed method does not contain many assumptions it has the potentiality to be used for decay status assessment of many other machines or other parts of the same machine the main disadvantage of our method is that it still requires a small amount of labeled data and cannot achieve completely unsupervised learning the acquisition of such labeled data is still challenging in practice in conclusion our method can achieve decay degree estimation and main decay direction prediction with a small amount of labeled samples which can be used as a decision support tool for condition based maintenance moreover it has the potentiality to be further extended to the decay status assessment of many other machinery declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement the work presented in this paper is the continuation of cipollini et al 2018b coraddu et al 2014

22338,the concrete made bucket foundations were employed as emerging solution to support the wind turbine or breakwater where the relatively large thicknesses of skirts and the strain softening effect related to the soil sensitivity and ductility were necessary to be explicitly accounted for however few of current study concerned this topic this paper therefore reported an extensive parametric investigation of penetrating behaviour for bucket foundation in nonhomogeneous clay to allow a better estimation of penetration resistance of bucket foundation the three dimensional 3d large deformation finite element ldfe analysis model incorporating the effect of strain softening on soil strength was set up and validated by comparing to the published centrifuge data then the evolution of soil flow mechanism and the distribution of soil strength softening were examined with the soil plug generated inside skirt assessed based on the numerical results a new analytical model was proposed to predict the penetration resistance of bucket foundation in clay accounting for a partially remoulded condition keywords penetration resistance bucket foundation strain softening large deformation partially remoulded condition 1 introduction bucket foundation is now a relatively mature product widely employed in offshore oil and gas industry hogervost 1980 bye et al 1995 tjelta 1995 randolph and house 2002 andersen et al 2005 randolph et al 2005 wang et al 2019 and more recently an emerging application for renewable energy development in particular for offshore wind energy sector houlsby and byrne 2000 feld 2001 ibsen 2008 the problem of installation for offshore bucket foundations has been an active topic of research through the last decades mainly because its penetration behaviour such as penetration resistance or under pressure governs the bucket foundation design of offshore installation and subsequently impacts the in service performance i e both short and long term capacity a large body of research related to installation of bucket foundation in clay has been conducted from numerical analyses physical model tests and field trails i e andersen and jostad 2002 2004 randolph and house 2002 houlsby et al 2005 jeanjean 2006 zhou and randolph 2006 chen and randolph 2007 westgate et al 2009 vásquez et al 2010 gaudin et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 koh et al 2017 these can be concluded with main contribution to well developing the multiple geotechnical principles covering the evolution of soil flow mechanism during the installation the development of key components including end bearing internal and external side friction in penetration resistance as well as the sensitivity of installation performance induced by a wide range of important influence parameters such as the mode of directly jacking or suction assisted installation the foundation geometry the soil plasticity the soil skirt interface property etc throughout the findings the design method to estimate the penetration resistance necessary for installation design of bucket foundation was proposed by andersen and jostad 1999 and houlsby and byrne 2005 and further developed by zhou et al 2016 and koh et al 2017 with the effect of inside ring stiffeners considered however achievements of previous research to address the installation problem of bucket foundation are mainly applied in the oil and gas industry and they are not fully applicable to those of offshore wind farm the very thin walled nature of bucket foundation was significant in the former scenario with the typical ratios t d of wall thickness t to bucket diameter d falling within 0 005 0 01 andersen et al 2005 but considerably larger thicknesses t d 0 02 to 0 06 can be found in the application of concrete made bucket foundation for offshore wind turbine even breakwater or sea walls xiao et al 2012 the significant challenges of installing foundation may occur as a thicker wall is adopted the soil flow mechanism during the installation might be therefore changed in particular the degree of both inward and outward flow of soil is of concern and might be varied with soil properties these would lead to the change in penetration resistance moreover the fully remoulded soil strength is generally used to control the side wall shearing resistance for convenience in practical design andersen and jostad 1999 houlsby and byrne 2005 api 2011 iso 2016 dnvgl 2017 the installation process of the bucket foundation normally contains two phases initial self weight penetration phase and suction assisted penetration phase the method with fully remoulded soil strength results in an overestimated self weight penetration depth and underestimated additionally required under pressure for bucket foundation installation since a large volume of soil is partially remoulded during the installation process therefore the current design method may be not conservative and leads to uncertainties in the installation of the foundation insight into the partially remoulded soil performance during the installation of bucket foundation would be important and beneficial for design practice as such consideration this paper aims to provide modified method for estimating the penetration resistance considering the partially remoulded soil condition through an extensive parametric investigation of penetrating behaviour for bucket foundation in clay the relatively large thicknesses of skirts are selected and the strain softening effect depending on soil sensitivity and ductility is considered the organisation of this paper is initialised with the establishment of three dimensional 3d large deformation finite element ldfe analysis model incorporating the effect of strain softening on soil strength a wide range of parametric analyses are then implemented for the identification of soil flow mechanism as well as the evolution of soil strength softening following a prudent validation of analysis model against the published centrifuge results based on the examinations a method with a suite of closed form expressions are finally proposed to assess the penetration resistance of bucket foundation and compared with the methods used in common practice design api and dnvgl design codes 2 finite element modelling the 3d ldfe analyses were undertaken using the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel approach with the commercially available software abaqus dassault systèmes 2010 since it is particularly well suited to simulate the scenario of dynamic installation in the geotechnical field 2 1 model description the bucket foundation was modelled as a rigid body e g undeformable with a diameter d of 10 m and wall thicknesses t of 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m corresponding thickness ratios t d of 0 02 0 04 and 0 06 respectively which was typical for concrete made bucket foundation tjelta et al 1990 the reference point rp for loads was taken at the top and along the centerline of the foundation as illustrated in fig 1 the three dimensional finite element mesh is demonstrated in fig 1 only a quarter model was used to increase the computational efficiency by taking advantage of the symmetry of the problem the soil domain had a radius of 3d and a depth of 5d ensuring a sufficiently large extension without any boundary effect through the entire penetration analysis a void layer i e material free was prescribed with the height of 0 8d above the surface of soil it was necessary for generation of soil heave by free flow into the empty eulerian elements in the excursion of bucket foundation the soil base was fixed while both side boundaries only allowed vertical displacements a very fine mesh zone shaped in a square column with width of 1 25d was set surrounding the bucket foundation with the minimum mesh size h min of t 6 the validation of adopted mesh sensitivity will be described later the entire soil domain was set as eulerian part comprising 3 584 000 first order reduced integration hexahedral eulerian elements ref type ec3d8r in the abaqus element library the general contact algorithm obeying a coulomb friction law was used to specify the bucket foundation soil interfaces with the inclusion of internal and external side walls and skirt tip soil interfaces the interface frictional coefficient was set as a high value of μ 1 ensuring the failure occurred within the soil rather than at the interface kim et al 2015 it allowed the evaluation of effect of partially remoulded softening on the penetration resistance and more detailed information was described in the next section 2 2 soil parameters this study considered undrained condition and the intact shear strength of soil s u0 was assumed to vary linearly with depth such that s u0 s um kz where s um was the shear strength at the mudline k the shear strength gradient and z the depth herein the values of s um and k were taken as 2 kpa and 1 2 respectively representing the typical values for marine soft deposit chen and randolph 2007 gaudin et al 2014 the tresca soil model was adopted through the analyses it performed a linearly elasto plastic behaviour and can be defined by undrained shear strength s u young s modulus e u and poisson s ratio υ 0 49 throughout the soil profile the submerged unit weight γ of 6 5 kn m3 was adopted over the soil depth in order to study the partially remoulded soil performance the effect of strain softening on soil strength was incorporated in the present study following a simple procedure set out by einav and randolph 2005 and zhou and randolph 2007 the tresca model was extended with the current undrained strength s u at the individual gauss points modified in terms of accumulated absolute plastic shear strain ξ given by 1 s u β s s u0 δ rem 1 δ rem e 3 ξ ξ 95 s u0 where βs is the coefficient of strain softening quantifying the exponential decay in soil strength linked to the accumulated plastic shear strain δrem is the inverse of the soil sensitivity s t denoting maximum reduction in soil strength relative to initial soil strength ξ95 is a parameter denoting the soil ductility and is the accumulated shear strain corresponding to the degradation of 95 in soil strength from intact to fully remoulded conditions however the measurement of intact shear strength usually involved the problem of strain rate dependency where a reference strain rate γ ref was adopted for instance a typical γ ref of 10 5 s 1 was taken to capture the intact shear strength in the laboratory soil element tests andersen 2015 while a larger nominal strain rate v d t v is the penetration velocity and d t is the diameter of t bar up to 0 1 s 1 in the t bar penetration tests zhou and randolph 2009 koh et al 2017 here γ ref was taken as 10 5 s 1 through the analysis and a coefficient βr representing strain rate dependency was used with the simple power law according to the maximum shear strain zhu and randolph 2011 kim et al 2015 expressed as 2 β r 1 η max γ γ ref γ ref β 1 η where 3 γ δ ε 1 δ ε 3 δ t where η is a parameter of viscous property and β is the shear thinning index with the typical values ranging from 0 1 to 0 2 and 0 05 0 15 boukpeti et al 2012 o loughlin et al 2013 chow et al 2014 respectively in this study the values of η and β were adopted as 0 1 and 0 1 separately δε1 and δε3 are the cumulative major and minor principal strains over the duration of δt combining eqs 1 and 2 s u can be expressed as 4 s u 1 η max γ γ ref γ ref β 1 η δ rem 1 δ rem e 3 ξ ξ 95 s u0 when the strain softening model was incorporated into the abaqus based tresca soil constitutive a user subroutine vusdfld was used with the state variables of soil strength being equivalent to temperature field associated with the coordinates of gauss points for the strain softening model validation the comparative analyses were implemented including a pure shearing test of soil element using subroutine in abaqus and a corresponding theoretical computation eq 4 noted the cyclic loading testes were implemented to allow the sufficiently large cumulative shear strain corresponding to the fully remoulded condition to be reached without significant distortion of element fig 2 a shows the comparison of results obtained from them where the parameters involved in the strain softening model were adopted with δrem 1 3 s t 3 and ξ95 10 as well as η 0 1 and β 0 1 it can be seen the identical performance can be found when the same shear strain rate was chosen in the computation also the variations of strain softening coefficient βs are presented in fig 2b following all same parameters except for two additional cases with δrem 1 2 and 1 3 the completely same results from both theoretical and numerical computations can be observed these proved the accuracy of implementation of strain softening model base on the previously described elementary set up the entire eulerian soil model starts from a definition of linear variation of s u0 with depth the temperature as a dummy variable is called in the vusdfld subroutine as an initial state variable to allow the variation of temperature identical to s u0 against depth in each time increment the strain components are called in the subroutine and transferred to principal strain components then stored as state variables then the value of ξ in eq 1 is calculated by the sum of accumulated absolute plastic shear strain δεp 1 δεp 3 where δεp 1 and δεp 3 are cumulative major and minor plastic shear strains respectively over a period of analysis and the value of γ in eq 2 is computed by eq 3 based on ξ and γ the values of βs and βr can be calculated using eqs 1 and 2 in the current incremental step in the subroutine finally the current undrained shear strength s u is updated by already known s u0 βs and βr in the subroutine by this mean the evolution of undrained shear strength induced by strain softening effect is achieved it was notable that the described strain rate effect in this study was only for the realistic and accurate estimation of the intact soil strength against laboratory soil element test with a γ ref for all simulation cases in reality a relative low penetration rate was generally found in the installation of bucket foundation i e 0 4 2 mm s applied in the centrifuge tests chen and randolph 2007 koh et al 2017 therefore the sensitivity study of effect of strain rate on soil strength will not be included in this study 2 3 summary of ldfe simulation analyses the total simulation cases to investigate the installation behaviour of bucket foundations are summarised in table 1 the first two cases were used to validate the model by comparing with the published centrifuge tests the rest of cases were parametric analysis with varying parameters focused to insight into the penetration behaviour of bucket foundation it started with a reference case study where the parameters see case 1 in table 1 involving the strain softening model i e ξ95 and s t or δrem soil property e g e s s u kd s um s um γ d and foundation geometry e g t d were taken with the intermediate value in their typical range described previously then the extensive parametric study was divided into the four sub groups a sub group 1 including case 1 2 and 3 and sub group 2 including case 1 4 and 5 for the examination of strain softening effect on the penetration resistance b sub group 3 including case 1 6 and 7 for the investigation of wall thickness effect on the penetration resistance and c sub group 4 including case 1 8 and 9 for the investigation of the effect of soil rigidity index e s s u this study comprised 11 cases in total with an average computational time of around 370 h per case using a workstation computer with 30 cpus frequency 3 00 ghz memory 100 gb 2 4 model validation mesh sensitivity is one of significant concerns in the cel analysis particular for the analyses with strain dependent soil model i e strain softening model in this study since the build up of soil resistance e g frictional resistance around bucket skirt during the penetration stage depends on the mobilisation of soil strength which is related to the shear band thickness denoted as the local element size fig 3 reports a group of comparisons in penetration responses of a bucket foundation with different mesh densities the information of foundation dimension and soil property related to strain softening effect follows the tabulated parameters of case 1 in table 1 five different element density in the specified region of concern in a penetration analysis as indicated as very fine mesh zone in fig 1b are selected with the minimum element size h min t 8 t 6 t 4 t 2 and t as evident in fig 3 when t 6 of h min was adopted the penetration pressure v a v is the applied vertical load and a is the cross sectional area of bucket foundation from top view against the normalised penetration depth d p d d p is the penetration depth of bucket foundation could be thought to be converged because of the negligible difference observed in the cases of t 6 and t 8 therefore h min is selected as t 6 through the entire analyses in this study the ldfe model was validated against the centrifuge results extrapolated from chen and randolph 2004 and westgate et al 2009 the key parameters for each case are listed in table 1 with the mesh strategy and boundary condition identical to those describe previously the dimensions of bucket foundations were the foundation length l of 14 4 m d of 3 6 m and t of 0 06 m for validation i and l of 6 m d of 11 3 m and t of 0 05 m for validation ii respectively the additional parameters of soil property were prescribed with s u0 1 25z kpa γ 6 86 kn m3 for validation i and s u0 10 2 8z kpa γ 5 9 kn m3 for validation ii separately the frictional coefficients of soil foundation interfaces were set as μ 0 32 and 0 2 for validation i and ii these were consistent with the description documented in the publications the jacked installation method was used in both tests in response the velocity controlled method was applied in the cel analysis in this study besides both centrifuge tests were controlled under undrained condition according to descriptions by chen and randolph 2004 and westgate et al 2009 the penetration rate v of 2 and 0 25 mm s were adopted with corresponding normalised penetration rate vt c v c v is the soil consolidation coefficient falling within largely or fully undrained range without significant rate effect the total stress based tresca soil model with strain softening effect incorporated can obviously attain a fully undrained simulation yet to eliminate dynamic effect in the cel analyses a penetration rate of 1 m s is adopted throughout analyses in this study to provide a good balance between accuracy and calculation efficiency the additional parameters necessary for the ldfe model followed η 1 and β 0 1 as shown in fig 4 from comparison of penetration pressure v a where a is the cross sectional area of bucket foundation equal to πd 2 4 using ldfe model with the published centrifuge data a good agreement was observed in general additionally westgate et al 2009 also examined the volume of inwards flowing soil as 9 85 m3 which was quite close to that calculated from ldfe modelling around 10 02 m3 with the discrepancy of only 1 7 more discussions relevant to the soil flow and soil plug is in the following section these above provided the validity of ldfe model in this study 3 numerical analysis results 3 1 evolution of the soil flow mechanism during installation fig 5 shows the evolution of soil flow mechanism during the process of installation in the reference case case 1 in table 1 with four selected soil flow patterns corresponding to penetration depths d p of 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 m respectively in the very beginning phase of penetration d p 0 5 m the shallow end bearing failure occurred with the soil around the skirt tip extending downwards and averagely moving inwards and outwards to accommodate the penetrating proportion of skirt in response the approximately symmetric soil berms appeared aside the skirt with the progress of penetration the round flow mechanism had been generated around the tip at d p 1 0 m corresponding to 0 1d and more soils seemed to start flowing inside the foundation with a slightly asymmetric soil berms aside the wall as a penetration depth d p up to 2 0 m the significant inward soil flow was observed accompanying by the negligible outward soil flow such inward soil flow was more profound with the further penetration d p 3 0 m leading to a considerable soil plug generated inside the bucket foundation to examine the soil plug volume inside the bucket foundation v in the operative volume ratio v plug was used in this study given by 5 v plug v in v skt π d p d 2 t 2 h plug 4 v skt where v skt is the volume of penetration depth of skirt and h plug is the average height of soil plug inside the bucket foundation the results of v plug calculated through the cases as tabulated in table 1 are reported in fig 6 from the variation of v plug against d p d t d s t ξ95 and e s u the following finds can be concluded with 1 the significantly large v plug was observed in general with minimum value around 65 in case 8 table 1 2 as evident from fig 6a v plug gave a similar tendency with varying d p d as well as s t 3 the apparent decrease in v plug was found with the increasing t d fig 6b or ξ95 fig 6c while the larger v plug the larger e s u fig 6d considering those the fitting process was implemented and v plug was expressed as 6 v plug 0 886 1 18 4 53 t d 0 16 ln e s u 0 05 1 31 ξ 95 0 08 correspondingly the average height of soil plug inside the bucket foundation h plug is 7 h plug 4 d p t d t d 2 1 2 t d 2 v plug noted three additional cases see fig 6d wherein e s u 300 400 and 800 and other parameters identical to those in case 8 were also illustrated here for a better curve fitting 3 2 strain softening effect on the penetration resistance the section compromises three parts with the softening behaviours of soil close to the inner and outer side wall and beneath the skirt tip investigated to characterise the magnitude of softening in soil strength the coefficient of strain softening βs was employed in this section fig 7 a demonstrates the contour of βs as the skirt penetrated at d p of 10 m in the case 1 the region of softened soil was mainly located in the vicinity of skirt the softened zone inside the skirt was considerably larger than outside except for the surficial soil this was consistent with the soil flow mechanism observed before more soils flowed inwards leading to more accumulation of plastic deformation and thus more severe softening in soil strength and the shallow bearing failure caused an average soil berm aside the skirt implying the similar accumulation in plastic shearing the softened zone beneath the skirt tip was found exceeding the depth of 2t to examining the softening magnitude a series of points aside the skirt at the five different levels were selected marked as points from a to e in fig 7a the corresponding responses of βs are shown in fig 7b as evident the maximum βs was at the tip level close to inner wall with the value of 0 5 the widths of softened zone x were approximately 0 062d 1 5t and 0 024d 0 6t for inside and outside the skirt respectively the further examinations focused on the sensitivity of softening magnitude considering the different influential parameters covering t d s t ξ95 and e s u a group of elements attached to both inner and outer side walls were chosen the corresponding results of βs extrapolated from the analysis of case 1 at d p 10 m and are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the magnitude of softening for the soil inside the skirt was generally lower than that for the outside soil when an identical influential parameter was given the changes in both t d or e s u gave almost same response of βs implying their negligible influences on the reduction of soil strength as s t increased or ξ95 decreased βs performed more remarkable reduction with the lower βs at the skirt tip level and relatively higher βs around 0 6 0 8 at the soil surface similarly a series of elements immediately beneath the skirt tip with the total depth d ele of up to 0 2d were selected with their responses of βs shown in fig 9 the softened region seemed to be around 0 14d 3 5t of depth where βs was close to 1 non softening the altering in e s u did not impact the tendency of βs and the similar response can also be found in the cases of larger s t see s t 4 and 6 or larger t d see t d 0 04 and 0 06 more significant reduction can be observed with the decreasing ξ95 3 3 expression of penetration resistance following the expression of penetration resistance proposed by andersen and jostad 1999 and houlsby and byrne 2005 the total resistance v can be divided into three main components of inner and outer side wall resistances f in and f out and the end bearing capacity v end and can be given by 8 v f in f out v end d p α in s u0 av π d in d p α out s u0 av π d γ d p n p s u0 tip n c π d t where αin and αout are inner and outer skin frictional coefficients d in is the inner diameter of bucket foundation s u0 av is the average intact undrained strength of soil over the penetration depth s u0 tip is the intact undrained strength of soil at the skirt tip level n p is taken as 1 for the undrained analysis and n c is the end bearing capacity factor for common practice in design the values of αin and αout were generally taken as the inverse of s t representing the fully remoulded condition for conservative estimation in the following sub sections the expression of eq 8 was further developed under the partially remoulded condition with the consideration of strain softening effect 3 4 end bearing capacity v end the end bearing capacity v end can be directly derived from the third term of eq 8 however from the previous observation the obvious soil berm was generated at the very beginning of penetration and such local soil heave could enhance the soil buoyancy effect randolph and white 2008 merifield et al 2009 considering this effect particularly on the shallow end bearing capacity the results of v end captured from analyses were processed by means of soil plug height with an additional term of 0 5γ h plug to eliminate the soil buoyancy effect n c therefore was expressed as follows 9 n c v end π d t γ d p 0 5 h plug s u0 tip the responses of n c obtained from nine cases as listed in table 1 are shown in fig 10 with a comparison of the relevant data published to date compared with the result of mana et al 2013 captured from small strain fe analysis considering a smooth skirt case 2 and case 8 gave lower n c when penetration depth was larger than 0 65d implying the strain softening effect on end bearing capacity might be significant when the soil ductility was weak i e ξ95 10 in case 2 and soil stiffness was low i e e s u 200 in case 8 compared with the result of zhou et al 2016 obtained from ldfe analysis all results in this study were almost localised at its left and right sides this is reasonable because a fully rough interface was adopted in this study rather that an interface frictional coefficient μ of 0 2 and without the consideration of strain softening zhou et al 2016 moreover the results from cone penetration tests lu et al 2004 liyanapathirana 2009 also fell within the similar region of skirt tip resistance it might be attributed to the similar cavity expansion failure mode between skirt tip and cone penetration when the results from case 2 and case 6 were chosen as to represent the lower and upper bounds for the end bearing capacities under the partially remoulded condition the response of n c can be estimated as follows 10 n c 7 15 m d p d 0 2 1 μ 0 2 when d p d 0 4 n c d p d 0 4 when d p d 0 4 where 7 15 for the bearing capacity factor of deeply embedded strip footing m is the coefficient with 6 08 and 3 32 for lower and upper bound respectively μ is taken as 0 2 here because the result of zhou et al 2016 approximately gives average response compared to the results of n c in this study regarding n c within the introduced boundaries eq 10 the values of n c at the depth of 0 4d were selected denoted as n c dp and summarised in table 2 it was because n c dp changed slightly at the large d p due to the local flow round failure being mobilised for convenience in design practice a fitting expression of n c dp within the selected ranges of t d s t ξ95 and e s u can be given as 11 n c dp 6 05 1 2 3 t d 1 0 02 s t ξ 95 0 11 e s u 0 074 fig 11 shows the comparison of results from ldfe analyses and calculated by eq 11 with a good agreement observed noted that the influence of e s u on n c dp was considered in eq 11 although the elements immediately beneath the skirt tip gave a similar softening responses see fig 9 the squeezing soil aside the skirt and below the skirt tip may experience more shearing and the lower e s u the more shearing deformation thus more heavily softening so the involvement of e s u in eq 11 was reasonable 3 5 inner side wall frictional resistance f in based on the previous observation of softening behaviour along the inner skin of bucket foundation the softening coefficient βs was insensitive to t d and e s u but susceptible to s t and ξ95 accordingly the operative frictional coefficient αin p for inner side wall under partially remoulded condition could be introduced to estimate the inner side wall frictional resistance f in expressed as 12 f in d p α in p s u0 av π d in where 13 α in p 0 2 s t 0 28 ξ 95 0 39 the results of αin p are illustrated in table 2 and the non dimensional inner side wall frictional resistances f in πd in 2 s u0 av using eq 12 are also reported in fig 12 from a comparison with the corresponding results obtained by ldfe analyses a reasonable estimation can be achieved 3 6 outer side wall frictional resistance f out considering the similarity of softening response between along the inner and outer skin of bucket foundation yet the magnitudes of strain softening were different estimate the outer side wall frictional resistance f out by using the operative frictional coefficient αout p could be given by 14 f out d p α out p s u0 av π d where 15 α out p 0 23 s t 0 28 ξ 95 0 39 again the results of αout p are also tabulated in table 2 the both results of the non dimensional outer side wall frictional resistances f out πd 2 s u0 av using eq 14 and obtained by ldfe analyses are shown in fig 13 good agreement between each other proved the reasonability of eq 14 3 7 total penetration resistance considering strain softening effect v p according to description above the total resistance during the penetration of bucket foundation accounting for the effect of strain softening v p can be derived by the sum of the introduced three components above 16 v p f in f out v end d p α in p s u0 av π d in d p α out p s u0 av π d γ d p n p 0 5 h plug s u0 tip n c dp π d t it was notable that only end bearing capacity at deep depth n c dp was adopted to calculate v end the validity of eq 16 can be proven from a comparison with the results captured from ldfe analyses as evident from fig 14 the general good fitting can be observed for five selected cases demonstrated here with maximum discrepancies lower than 8 note that s t and ξ95 are two key parameters representing the effect of strain softening both of them can be deduced from soil undrained shear strength s u and accumulated absolute plastic shear strain ξ by a strain controlled undrained cyclic soil element test or full flow penetrometers i e t bar or ball bar tests taking t bar testing for example s t is the ratio of intact and fully remoulded undrained strengths then ξ95 can be inversely calculated by substituting measured ξ and already computed s t into eq 1 4 discussion this section discussed the difference of the methods including theoretical method reported by houlsby and byrne 2005 current industry standards api and dnv gl methods and this study to assess the penetration resistance of bucket foundation to ensure a direct comparison among the methods the linearly increasing soil strength with soil depth was considered with s u0 1 2z 2 0 kpa and with the additional parameters necessary for calculations comprising d 10 m t 0 6 m d p 16 m γ 6 5 kn m3 s t 4 ξ95 10 firstly the non dimensional penetration resistance v as u0 tip was calculated by the dnv gl method dnvgl 2017 for installation of bucket foundation considering soil disturbance the penetration resistance is calculated as the sum of the side friction along the skirt walls f side and the bearing capacity at the skirt tip v end expressed as 17 v f side v end a wall α s u0 av n c s u0 tip γ z a tip where a wall is skirt wall area including inside and outside surfaces α is shear strength factor to define the soil disturbance due to the installation shearing normally assumed equal to the inverse of the soil sensitivity 1 s t a tip is the cross section area of skirt tip secondly v as u0 tip is estimated in accordance with usual practice in pile design api 2011 with the relevant equations listed as follows 18 v f in f out v end 2 π d 0 d p f d p d d p n c s u0 tip π d t where 19 f d p α s u0 tip 20 α 0 5 ψ 0 5 for ψ 1 0 α 0 5 ψ 0 25 for ψ 1 0 and 21 ψ s u0 tip γ d p when α 1 0 where f d p is the inner or outer side wall shear stress at the depth of d p α is the shaft friction factor for clay and ψ for a coefficient in computation of α in addition v as u0 tip was also computed by the theoretical method proposed by houlsby and byrne 2005 where αin and αout in eq 8 were taken as 1 s t considering soil disturbance or 1 without the soil disturbance the calculated profiles of v as u0 tip are present in fig 15 from comparison the dnv gl method and theoretical method houlsby and byrne 2005 gave the lowest estimation in v as u0 tip since the fully remoulded soil strength was used considering the soil disturbance induced by the side wall shearing the api and the theoretical methods with αin αout 1 presented the highest estimations where the profiles of v as u0 tip were almost coincided because of the intact soil strength used in the calculation the result of v as u0 tip estimated by eq 16 was between the upper and lower limits considering a partially remoulded condition as evident if the methods of dnv gl and houlsby and byrne 2005 were adopted in design lowest estimated penetration resistance considering fully remoulded soil strength may lead to a significantly overestimated initial penetration depth and unrealistic guidance for the foundation installation design therefore for relatively large skirt thickness especial for concrete made bucket foundation it was necessary to taken the proper magnitude of soil disturbance into account 5 conclusion this paper reported an extensive parametric investigation of penetration resistance for bucket foundation in clay with the strain softening effect explicitly accounted for from insight into soil flow mechanism during the penetration the phenomenon of soil plug inside the bucket foundation was significant with its magnitude evaluated by case by case examination from investigation of soil softening mechanism in the vicinity of skirt wall through the penetration the softening regions were examined with the typical widths of around 1 5t and 0 6t for inner and outer skirt wall resistances and the typical depth of around 3 5t for end bearing capacity based on the observation of the evolution of soil softening magnitude i e βs around skirt the inner and outer side wall resistances and the end bearing capacity were evaluated by considering a group of influential parameters of t d s t ξ95 and e s u finally a method to assess the penetration resistance of bucket foundation in clay was proposed and its competence of estimating the partially remoulded penetration resistance was discussed by comparing with other methods it is concluded that current design practice may overestimated the penetration depth of the bucket foundation but the proposed modified approach allows the rapid checking when the partially remoulded

22338,the concrete made bucket foundations were employed as emerging solution to support the wind turbine or breakwater where the relatively large thicknesses of skirts and the strain softening effect related to the soil sensitivity and ductility were necessary to be explicitly accounted for however few of current study concerned this topic this paper therefore reported an extensive parametric investigation of penetrating behaviour for bucket foundation in nonhomogeneous clay to allow a better estimation of penetration resistance of bucket foundation the three dimensional 3d large deformation finite element ldfe analysis model incorporating the effect of strain softening on soil strength was set up and validated by comparing to the published centrifuge data then the evolution of soil flow mechanism and the distribution of soil strength softening were examined with the soil plug generated inside skirt assessed based on the numerical results a new analytical model was proposed to predict the penetration resistance of bucket foundation in clay accounting for a partially remoulded condition keywords penetration resistance bucket foundation strain softening large deformation partially remoulded condition 1 introduction bucket foundation is now a relatively mature product widely employed in offshore oil and gas industry hogervost 1980 bye et al 1995 tjelta 1995 randolph and house 2002 andersen et al 2005 randolph et al 2005 wang et al 2019 and more recently an emerging application for renewable energy development in particular for offshore wind energy sector houlsby and byrne 2000 feld 2001 ibsen 2008 the problem of installation for offshore bucket foundations has been an active topic of research through the last decades mainly because its penetration behaviour such as penetration resistance or under pressure governs the bucket foundation design of offshore installation and subsequently impacts the in service performance i e both short and long term capacity a large body of research related to installation of bucket foundation in clay has been conducted from numerical analyses physical model tests and field trails i e andersen and jostad 2002 2004 randolph and house 2002 houlsby et al 2005 jeanjean 2006 zhou and randolph 2006 chen and randolph 2007 westgate et al 2009 vásquez et al 2010 gaudin et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 koh et al 2017 these can be concluded with main contribution to well developing the multiple geotechnical principles covering the evolution of soil flow mechanism during the installation the development of key components including end bearing internal and external side friction in penetration resistance as well as the sensitivity of installation performance induced by a wide range of important influence parameters such as the mode of directly jacking or suction assisted installation the foundation geometry the soil plasticity the soil skirt interface property etc throughout the findings the design method to estimate the penetration resistance necessary for installation design of bucket foundation was proposed by andersen and jostad 1999 and houlsby and byrne 2005 and further developed by zhou et al 2016 and koh et al 2017 with the effect of inside ring stiffeners considered however achievements of previous research to address the installation problem of bucket foundation are mainly applied in the oil and gas industry and they are not fully applicable to those of offshore wind farm the very thin walled nature of bucket foundation was significant in the former scenario with the typical ratios t d of wall thickness t to bucket diameter d falling within 0 005 0 01 andersen et al 2005 but considerably larger thicknesses t d 0 02 to 0 06 can be found in the application of concrete made bucket foundation for offshore wind turbine even breakwater or sea walls xiao et al 2012 the significant challenges of installing foundation may occur as a thicker wall is adopted the soil flow mechanism during the installation might be therefore changed in particular the degree of both inward and outward flow of soil is of concern and might be varied with soil properties these would lead to the change in penetration resistance moreover the fully remoulded soil strength is generally used to control the side wall shearing resistance for convenience in practical design andersen and jostad 1999 houlsby and byrne 2005 api 2011 iso 2016 dnvgl 2017 the installation process of the bucket foundation normally contains two phases initial self weight penetration phase and suction assisted penetration phase the method with fully remoulded soil strength results in an overestimated self weight penetration depth and underestimated additionally required under pressure for bucket foundation installation since a large volume of soil is partially remoulded during the installation process therefore the current design method may be not conservative and leads to uncertainties in the installation of the foundation insight into the partially remoulded soil performance during the installation of bucket foundation would be important and beneficial for design practice as such consideration this paper aims to provide modified method for estimating the penetration resistance considering the partially remoulded soil condition through an extensive parametric investigation of penetrating behaviour for bucket foundation in clay the relatively large thicknesses of skirts are selected and the strain softening effect depending on soil sensitivity and ductility is considered the organisation of this paper is initialised with the establishment of three dimensional 3d large deformation finite element ldfe analysis model incorporating the effect of strain softening on soil strength a wide range of parametric analyses are then implemented for the identification of soil flow mechanism as well as the evolution of soil strength softening following a prudent validation of analysis model against the published centrifuge results based on the examinations a method with a suite of closed form expressions are finally proposed to assess the penetration resistance of bucket foundation and compared with the methods used in common practice design api and dnvgl design codes 2 finite element modelling the 3d ldfe analyses were undertaken using the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel approach with the commercially available software abaqus dassault systèmes 2010 since it is particularly well suited to simulate the scenario of dynamic installation in the geotechnical field 2 1 model description the bucket foundation was modelled as a rigid body e g undeformable with a diameter d of 10 m and wall thicknesses t of 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m corresponding thickness ratios t d of 0 02 0 04 and 0 06 respectively which was typical for concrete made bucket foundation tjelta et al 1990 the reference point rp for loads was taken at the top and along the centerline of the foundation as illustrated in fig 1 the three dimensional finite element mesh is demonstrated in fig 1 only a quarter model was used to increase the computational efficiency by taking advantage of the symmetry of the problem the soil domain had a radius of 3d and a depth of 5d ensuring a sufficiently large extension without any boundary effect through the entire penetration analysis a void layer i e material free was prescribed with the height of 0 8d above the surface of soil it was necessary for generation of soil heave by free flow into the empty eulerian elements in the excursion of bucket foundation the soil base was fixed while both side boundaries only allowed vertical displacements a very fine mesh zone shaped in a square column with width of 1 25d was set surrounding the bucket foundation with the minimum mesh size h min of t 6 the validation of adopted mesh sensitivity will be described later the entire soil domain was set as eulerian part comprising 3 584 000 first order reduced integration hexahedral eulerian elements ref type ec3d8r in the abaqus element library the general contact algorithm obeying a coulomb friction law was used to specify the bucket foundation soil interfaces with the inclusion of internal and external side walls and skirt tip soil interfaces the interface frictional coefficient was set as a high value of μ 1 ensuring the failure occurred within the soil rather than at the interface kim et al 2015 it allowed the evaluation of effect of partially remoulded softening on the penetration resistance and more detailed information was described in the next section 2 2 soil parameters this study considered undrained condition and the intact shear strength of soil s u0 was assumed to vary linearly with depth such that s u0 s um kz where s um was the shear strength at the mudline k the shear strength gradient and z the depth herein the values of s um and k were taken as 2 kpa and 1 2 respectively representing the typical values for marine soft deposit chen and randolph 2007 gaudin et al 2014 the tresca soil model was adopted through the analyses it performed a linearly elasto plastic behaviour and can be defined by undrained shear strength s u young s modulus e u and poisson s ratio υ 0 49 throughout the soil profile the submerged unit weight γ of 6 5 kn m3 was adopted over the soil depth in order to study the partially remoulded soil performance the effect of strain softening on soil strength was incorporated in the present study following a simple procedure set out by einav and randolph 2005 and zhou and randolph 2007 the tresca model was extended with the current undrained strength s u at the individual gauss points modified in terms of accumulated absolute plastic shear strain ξ given by 1 s u β s s u0 δ rem 1 δ rem e 3 ξ ξ 95 s u0 where βs is the coefficient of strain softening quantifying the exponential decay in soil strength linked to the accumulated plastic shear strain δrem is the inverse of the soil sensitivity s t denoting maximum reduction in soil strength relative to initial soil strength ξ95 is a parameter denoting the soil ductility and is the accumulated shear strain corresponding to the degradation of 95 in soil strength from intact to fully remoulded conditions however the measurement of intact shear strength usually involved the problem of strain rate dependency where a reference strain rate γ ref was adopted for instance a typical γ ref of 10 5 s 1 was taken to capture the intact shear strength in the laboratory soil element tests andersen 2015 while a larger nominal strain rate v d t v is the penetration velocity and d t is the diameter of t bar up to 0 1 s 1 in the t bar penetration tests zhou and randolph 2009 koh et al 2017 here γ ref was taken as 10 5 s 1 through the analysis and a coefficient βr representing strain rate dependency was used with the simple power law according to the maximum shear strain zhu and randolph 2011 kim et al 2015 expressed as 2 β r 1 η max γ γ ref γ ref β 1 η where 3 γ δ ε 1 δ ε 3 δ t where η is a parameter of viscous property and β is the shear thinning index with the typical values ranging from 0 1 to 0 2 and 0 05 0 15 boukpeti et al 2012 o loughlin et al 2013 chow et al 2014 respectively in this study the values of η and β were adopted as 0 1 and 0 1 separately δε1 and δε3 are the cumulative major and minor principal strains over the duration of δt combining eqs 1 and 2 s u can be expressed as 4 s u 1 η max γ γ ref γ ref β 1 η δ rem 1 δ rem e 3 ξ ξ 95 s u0 when the strain softening model was incorporated into the abaqus based tresca soil constitutive a user subroutine vusdfld was used with the state variables of soil strength being equivalent to temperature field associated with the coordinates of gauss points for the strain softening model validation the comparative analyses were implemented including a pure shearing test of soil element using subroutine in abaqus and a corresponding theoretical computation eq 4 noted the cyclic loading testes were implemented to allow the sufficiently large cumulative shear strain corresponding to the fully remoulded condition to be reached without significant distortion of element fig 2 a shows the comparison of results obtained from them where the parameters involved in the strain softening model were adopted with δrem 1 3 s t 3 and ξ95 10 as well as η 0 1 and β 0 1 it can be seen the identical performance can be found when the same shear strain rate was chosen in the computation also the variations of strain softening coefficient βs are presented in fig 2b following all same parameters except for two additional cases with δrem 1 2 and 1 3 the completely same results from both theoretical and numerical computations can be observed these proved the accuracy of implementation of strain softening model base on the previously described elementary set up the entire eulerian soil model starts from a definition of linear variation of s u0 with depth the temperature as a dummy variable is called in the vusdfld subroutine as an initial state variable to allow the variation of temperature identical to s u0 against depth in each time increment the strain components are called in the subroutine and transferred to principal strain components then stored as state variables then the value of ξ in eq 1 is calculated by the sum of accumulated absolute plastic shear strain δεp 1 δεp 3 where δεp 1 and δεp 3 are cumulative major and minor plastic shear strains respectively over a period of analysis and the value of γ in eq 2 is computed by eq 3 based on ξ and γ the values of βs and βr can be calculated using eqs 1 and 2 in the current incremental step in the subroutine finally the current undrained shear strength s u is updated by already known s u0 βs and βr in the subroutine by this mean the evolution of undrained shear strength induced by strain softening effect is achieved it was notable that the described strain rate effect in this study was only for the realistic and accurate estimation of the intact soil strength against laboratory soil element test with a γ ref for all simulation cases in reality a relative low penetration rate was generally found in the installation of bucket foundation i e 0 4 2 mm s applied in the centrifuge tests chen and randolph 2007 koh et al 2017 therefore the sensitivity study of effect of strain rate on soil strength will not be included in this study 2 3 summary of ldfe simulation analyses the total simulation cases to investigate the installation behaviour of bucket foundations are summarised in table 1 the first two cases were used to validate the model by comparing with the published centrifuge tests the rest of cases were parametric analysis with varying parameters focused to insight into the penetration behaviour of bucket foundation it started with a reference case study where the parameters see case 1 in table 1 involving the strain softening model i e ξ95 and s t or δrem soil property e g e s s u kd s um s um γ d and foundation geometry e g t d were taken with the intermediate value in their typical range described previously then the extensive parametric study was divided into the four sub groups a sub group 1 including case 1 2 and 3 and sub group 2 including case 1 4 and 5 for the examination of strain softening effect on the penetration resistance b sub group 3 including case 1 6 and 7 for the investigation of wall thickness effect on the penetration resistance and c sub group 4 including case 1 8 and 9 for the investigation of the effect of soil rigidity index e s s u this study comprised 11 cases in total with an average computational time of around 370 h per case using a workstation computer with 30 cpus frequency 3 00 ghz memory 100 gb 2 4 model validation mesh sensitivity is one of significant concerns in the cel analysis particular for the analyses with strain dependent soil model i e strain softening model in this study since the build up of soil resistance e g frictional resistance around bucket skirt during the penetration stage depends on the mobilisation of soil strength which is related to the shear band thickness denoted as the local element size fig 3 reports a group of comparisons in penetration responses of a bucket foundation with different mesh densities the information of foundation dimension and soil property related to strain softening effect follows the tabulated parameters of case 1 in table 1 five different element density in the specified region of concern in a penetration analysis as indicated as very fine mesh zone in fig 1b are selected with the minimum element size h min t 8 t 6 t 4 t 2 and t as evident in fig 3 when t 6 of h min was adopted the penetration pressure v a v is the applied vertical load and a is the cross sectional area of bucket foundation from top view against the normalised penetration depth d p d d p is the penetration depth of bucket foundation could be thought to be converged because of the negligible difference observed in the cases of t 6 and t 8 therefore h min is selected as t 6 through the entire analyses in this study the ldfe model was validated against the centrifuge results extrapolated from chen and randolph 2004 and westgate et al 2009 the key parameters for each case are listed in table 1 with the mesh strategy and boundary condition identical to those describe previously the dimensions of bucket foundations were the foundation length l of 14 4 m d of 3 6 m and t of 0 06 m for validation i and l of 6 m d of 11 3 m and t of 0 05 m for validation ii respectively the additional parameters of soil property were prescribed with s u0 1 25z kpa γ 6 86 kn m3 for validation i and s u0 10 2 8z kpa γ 5 9 kn m3 for validation ii separately the frictional coefficients of soil foundation interfaces were set as μ 0 32 and 0 2 for validation i and ii these were consistent with the description documented in the publications the jacked installation method was used in both tests in response the velocity controlled method was applied in the cel analysis in this study besides both centrifuge tests were controlled under undrained condition according to descriptions by chen and randolph 2004 and westgate et al 2009 the penetration rate v of 2 and 0 25 mm s were adopted with corresponding normalised penetration rate vt c v c v is the soil consolidation coefficient falling within largely or fully undrained range without significant rate effect the total stress based tresca soil model with strain softening effect incorporated can obviously attain a fully undrained simulation yet to eliminate dynamic effect in the cel analyses a penetration rate of 1 m s is adopted throughout analyses in this study to provide a good balance between accuracy and calculation efficiency the additional parameters necessary for the ldfe model followed η 1 and β 0 1 as shown in fig 4 from comparison of penetration pressure v a where a is the cross sectional area of bucket foundation equal to πd 2 4 using ldfe model with the published centrifuge data a good agreement was observed in general additionally westgate et al 2009 also examined the volume of inwards flowing soil as 9 85 m3 which was quite close to that calculated from ldfe modelling around 10 02 m3 with the discrepancy of only 1 7 more discussions relevant to the soil flow and soil plug is in the following section these above provided the validity of ldfe model in this study 3 numerical analysis results 3 1 evolution of the soil flow mechanism during installation fig 5 shows the evolution of soil flow mechanism during the process of installation in the reference case case 1 in table 1 with four selected soil flow patterns corresponding to penetration depths d p of 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 m respectively in the very beginning phase of penetration d p 0 5 m the shallow end bearing failure occurred with the soil around the skirt tip extending downwards and averagely moving inwards and outwards to accommodate the penetrating proportion of skirt in response the approximately symmetric soil berms appeared aside the skirt with the progress of penetration the round flow mechanism had been generated around the tip at d p 1 0 m corresponding to 0 1d and more soils seemed to start flowing inside the foundation with a slightly asymmetric soil berms aside the wall as a penetration depth d p up to 2 0 m the significant inward soil flow was observed accompanying by the negligible outward soil flow such inward soil flow was more profound with the further penetration d p 3 0 m leading to a considerable soil plug generated inside the bucket foundation to examine the soil plug volume inside the bucket foundation v in the operative volume ratio v plug was used in this study given by 5 v plug v in v skt π d p d 2 t 2 h plug 4 v skt where v skt is the volume of penetration depth of skirt and h plug is the average height of soil plug inside the bucket foundation the results of v plug calculated through the cases as tabulated in table 1 are reported in fig 6 from the variation of v plug against d p d t d s t ξ95 and e s u the following finds can be concluded with 1 the significantly large v plug was observed in general with minimum value around 65 in case 8 table 1 2 as evident from fig 6a v plug gave a similar tendency with varying d p d as well as s t 3 the apparent decrease in v plug was found with the increasing t d fig 6b or ξ95 fig 6c while the larger v plug the larger e s u fig 6d considering those the fitting process was implemented and v plug was expressed as 6 v plug 0 886 1 18 4 53 t d 0 16 ln e s u 0 05 1 31 ξ 95 0 08 correspondingly the average height of soil plug inside the bucket foundation h plug is 7 h plug 4 d p t d t d 2 1 2 t d 2 v plug noted three additional cases see fig 6d wherein e s u 300 400 and 800 and other parameters identical to those in case 8 were also illustrated here for a better curve fitting 3 2 strain softening effect on the penetration resistance the section compromises three parts with the softening behaviours of soil close to the inner and outer side wall and beneath the skirt tip investigated to characterise the magnitude of softening in soil strength the coefficient of strain softening βs was employed in this section fig 7 a demonstrates the contour of βs as the skirt penetrated at d p of 10 m in the case 1 the region of softened soil was mainly located in the vicinity of skirt the softened zone inside the skirt was considerably larger than outside except for the surficial soil this was consistent with the soil flow mechanism observed before more soils flowed inwards leading to more accumulation of plastic deformation and thus more severe softening in soil strength and the shallow bearing failure caused an average soil berm aside the skirt implying the similar accumulation in plastic shearing the softened zone beneath the skirt tip was found exceeding the depth of 2t to examining the softening magnitude a series of points aside the skirt at the five different levels were selected marked as points from a to e in fig 7a the corresponding responses of βs are shown in fig 7b as evident the maximum βs was at the tip level close to inner wall with the value of 0 5 the widths of softened zone x were approximately 0 062d 1 5t and 0 024d 0 6t for inside and outside the skirt respectively the further examinations focused on the sensitivity of softening magnitude considering the different influential parameters covering t d s t ξ95 and e s u a group of elements attached to both inner and outer side walls were chosen the corresponding results of βs extrapolated from the analysis of case 1 at d p 10 m and are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the magnitude of softening for the soil inside the skirt was generally lower than that for the outside soil when an identical influential parameter was given the changes in both t d or e s u gave almost same response of βs implying their negligible influences on the reduction of soil strength as s t increased or ξ95 decreased βs performed more remarkable reduction with the lower βs at the skirt tip level and relatively higher βs around 0 6 0 8 at the soil surface similarly a series of elements immediately beneath the skirt tip with the total depth d ele of up to 0 2d were selected with their responses of βs shown in fig 9 the softened region seemed to be around 0 14d 3 5t of depth where βs was close to 1 non softening the altering in e s u did not impact the tendency of βs and the similar response can also be found in the cases of larger s t see s t 4 and 6 or larger t d see t d 0 04 and 0 06 more significant reduction can be observed with the decreasing ξ95 3 3 expression of penetration resistance following the expression of penetration resistance proposed by andersen and jostad 1999 and houlsby and byrne 2005 the total resistance v can be divided into three main components of inner and outer side wall resistances f in and f out and the end bearing capacity v end and can be given by 8 v f in f out v end d p α in s u0 av π d in d p α out s u0 av π d γ d p n p s u0 tip n c π d t where αin and αout are inner and outer skin frictional coefficients d in is the inner diameter of bucket foundation s u0 av is the average intact undrained strength of soil over the penetration depth s u0 tip is the intact undrained strength of soil at the skirt tip level n p is taken as 1 for the undrained analysis and n c is the end bearing capacity factor for common practice in design the values of αin and αout were generally taken as the inverse of s t representing the fully remoulded condition for conservative estimation in the following sub sections the expression of eq 8 was further developed under the partially remoulded condition with the consideration of strain softening effect 3 4 end bearing capacity v end the end bearing capacity v end can be directly derived from the third term of eq 8 however from the previous observation the obvious soil berm was generated at the very beginning of penetration and such local soil heave could enhance the soil buoyancy effect randolph and white 2008 merifield et al 2009 considering this effect particularly on the shallow end bearing capacity the results of v end captured from analyses were processed by means of soil plug height with an additional term of 0 5γ h plug to eliminate the soil buoyancy effect n c therefore was expressed as follows 9 n c v end π d t γ d p 0 5 h plug s u0 tip the responses of n c obtained from nine cases as listed in table 1 are shown in fig 10 with a comparison of the relevant data published to date compared with the result of mana et al 2013 captured from small strain fe analysis considering a smooth skirt case 2 and case 8 gave lower n c when penetration depth was larger than 0 65d implying the strain softening effect on end bearing capacity might be significant when the soil ductility was weak i e ξ95 10 in case 2 and soil stiffness was low i e e s u 200 in case 8 compared with the result of zhou et al 2016 obtained from ldfe analysis all results in this study were almost localised at its left and right sides this is reasonable because a fully rough interface was adopted in this study rather that an interface frictional coefficient μ of 0 2 and without the consideration of strain softening zhou et al 2016 moreover the results from cone penetration tests lu et al 2004 liyanapathirana 2009 also fell within the similar region of skirt tip resistance it might be attributed to the similar cavity expansion failure mode between skirt tip and cone penetration when the results from case 2 and case 6 were chosen as to represent the lower and upper bounds for the end bearing capacities under the partially remoulded condition the response of n c can be estimated as follows 10 n c 7 15 m d p d 0 2 1 μ 0 2 when d p d 0 4 n c d p d 0 4 when d p d 0 4 where 7 15 for the bearing capacity factor of deeply embedded strip footing m is the coefficient with 6 08 and 3 32 for lower and upper bound respectively μ is taken as 0 2 here because the result of zhou et al 2016 approximately gives average response compared to the results of n c in this study regarding n c within the introduced boundaries eq 10 the values of n c at the depth of 0 4d were selected denoted as n c dp and summarised in table 2 it was because n c dp changed slightly at the large d p due to the local flow round failure being mobilised for convenience in design practice a fitting expression of n c dp within the selected ranges of t d s t ξ95 and e s u can be given as 11 n c dp 6 05 1 2 3 t d 1 0 02 s t ξ 95 0 11 e s u 0 074 fig 11 shows the comparison of results from ldfe analyses and calculated by eq 11 with a good agreement observed noted that the influence of e s u on n c dp was considered in eq 11 although the elements immediately beneath the skirt tip gave a similar softening responses see fig 9 the squeezing soil aside the skirt and below the skirt tip may experience more shearing and the lower e s u the more shearing deformation thus more heavily softening so the involvement of e s u in eq 11 was reasonable 3 5 inner side wall frictional resistance f in based on the previous observation of softening behaviour along the inner skin of bucket foundation the softening coefficient βs was insensitive to t d and e s u but susceptible to s t and ξ95 accordingly the operative frictional coefficient αin p for inner side wall under partially remoulded condition could be introduced to estimate the inner side wall frictional resistance f in expressed as 12 f in d p α in p s u0 av π d in where 13 α in p 0 2 s t 0 28 ξ 95 0 39 the results of αin p are illustrated in table 2 and the non dimensional inner side wall frictional resistances f in πd in 2 s u0 av using eq 12 are also reported in fig 12 from a comparison with the corresponding results obtained by ldfe analyses a reasonable estimation can be achieved 3 6 outer side wall frictional resistance f out considering the similarity of softening response between along the inner and outer skin of bucket foundation yet the magnitudes of strain softening were different estimate the outer side wall frictional resistance f out by using the operative frictional coefficient αout p could be given by 14 f out d p α out p s u0 av π d where 15 α out p 0 23 s t 0 28 ξ 95 0 39 again the results of αout p are also tabulated in table 2 the both results of the non dimensional outer side wall frictional resistances f out πd 2 s u0 av using eq 14 and obtained by ldfe analyses are shown in fig 13 good agreement between each other proved the reasonability of eq 14 3 7 total penetration resistance considering strain softening effect v p according to description above the total resistance during the penetration of bucket foundation accounting for the effect of strain softening v p can be derived by the sum of the introduced three components above 16 v p f in f out v end d p α in p s u0 av π d in d p α out p s u0 av π d γ d p n p 0 5 h plug s u0 tip n c dp π d t it was notable that only end bearing capacity at deep depth n c dp was adopted to calculate v end the validity of eq 16 can be proven from a comparison with the results captured from ldfe analyses as evident from fig 14 the general good fitting can be observed for five selected cases demonstrated here with maximum discrepancies lower than 8 note that s t and ξ95 are two key parameters representing the effect of strain softening both of them can be deduced from soil undrained shear strength s u and accumulated absolute plastic shear strain ξ by a strain controlled undrained cyclic soil element test or full flow penetrometers i e t bar or ball bar tests taking t bar testing for example s t is the ratio of intact and fully remoulded undrained strengths then ξ95 can be inversely calculated by substituting measured ξ and already computed s t into eq 1 4 discussion this section discussed the difference of the methods including theoretical method reported by houlsby and byrne 2005 current industry standards api and dnv gl methods and this study to assess the penetration resistance of bucket foundation to ensure a direct comparison among the methods the linearly increasing soil strength with soil depth was considered with s u0 1 2z 2 0 kpa and with the additional parameters necessary for calculations comprising d 10 m t 0 6 m d p 16 m γ 6 5 kn m3 s t 4 ξ95 10 firstly the non dimensional penetration resistance v as u0 tip was calculated by the dnv gl method dnvgl 2017 for installation of bucket foundation considering soil disturbance the penetration resistance is calculated as the sum of the side friction along the skirt walls f side and the bearing capacity at the skirt tip v end expressed as 17 v f side v end a wall α s u0 av n c s u0 tip γ z a tip where a wall is skirt wall area including inside and outside surfaces α is shear strength factor to define the soil disturbance due to the installation shearing normally assumed equal to the inverse of the soil sensitivity 1 s t a tip is the cross section area of skirt tip secondly v as u0 tip is estimated in accordance with usual practice in pile design api 2011 with the relevant equations listed as follows 18 v f in f out v end 2 π d 0 d p f d p d d p n c s u0 tip π d t where 19 f d p α s u0 tip 20 α 0 5 ψ 0 5 for ψ 1 0 α 0 5 ψ 0 25 for ψ 1 0 and 21 ψ s u0 tip γ d p when α 1 0 where f d p is the inner or outer side wall shear stress at the depth of d p α is the shaft friction factor for clay and ψ for a coefficient in computation of α in addition v as u0 tip was also computed by the theoretical method proposed by houlsby and byrne 2005 where αin and αout in eq 8 were taken as 1 s t considering soil disturbance or 1 without the soil disturbance the calculated profiles of v as u0 tip are present in fig 15 from comparison the dnv gl method and theoretical method houlsby and byrne 2005 gave the lowest estimation in v as u0 tip since the fully remoulded soil strength was used considering the soil disturbance induced by the side wall shearing the api and the theoretical methods with αin αout 1 presented the highest estimations where the profiles of v as u0 tip were almost coincided because of the intact soil strength used in the calculation the result of v as u0 tip estimated by eq 16 was between the upper and lower limits considering a partially remoulded condition as evident if the methods of dnv gl and houlsby and byrne 2005 were adopted in design lowest estimated penetration resistance considering fully remoulded soil strength may lead to a significantly overestimated initial penetration depth and unrealistic guidance for the foundation installation design therefore for relatively large skirt thickness especial for concrete made bucket foundation it was necessary to taken the proper magnitude of soil disturbance into account 5 conclusion this paper reported an extensive parametric investigation of penetration resistance for bucket foundation in clay with the strain softening effect explicitly accounted for from insight into soil flow mechanism during the penetration the phenomenon of soil plug inside the bucket foundation was significant with its magnitude evaluated by case by case examination from investigation of soil softening mechanism in the vicinity of skirt wall through the penetration the softening regions were examined with the typical widths of around 1 5t and 0 6t for inner and outer skirt wall resistances and the typical depth of around 3 5t for end bearing capacity based on the observation of the evolution of soil softening magnitude i e βs around skirt the inner and outer side wall resistances and the end bearing capacity were evaluated by considering a group of influential parameters of t d s t ξ95 and e s u finally a method to assess the penetration resistance of bucket foundation in clay was proposed and its competence of estimating the partially remoulded penetration resistance was discussed by comparing with other methods it is concluded that current design practice may overestimated the penetration depth of the bucket foundation but the proposed modified approach allows the rapid checking when the partially remoulded

22339,current offshore engineering design codes for wave loading are based on pure water but wave impacts often involve aerated flow either as a result of air entrapment as the wave overturns or due to impact with a wave that is already broken therefore it is necessary to develop a new understanding of how design codes should incorporate water air mixture for wave impact this experimental study investigates aeration effects on wave impacts by means of slamming impacts of a square flat plate onto a pure and aerated water surface with zero degree dead rise angle the low aeration level between 0 and 1 6 was applied and the drop velocity varied from about 1 m s to 7 m s there was a significant reduction in the peak impact loads both pressure and force for impact in aerated water compared to that in pure water there was also a significant reduction in the first phase of the pressure and force impulse for aerated water the variation in impulsive loadings is less sensitive than peak loadings for impacts the implication for design is that maximum instantaneous loads may be conservative in the presence of aerated water keywords aeration effect slamming wave impact physical model 1 introduction hydrodynamic impact problems are frequently encountered in marine engineering faltinsen 1993 2000 kapsenberg 2011 water sports rubin 1999 and natural hazards kay 2014 rodgers and bryson 2014 slamming of high speed marine vessels on the water surface and ship bows subject to wave impact both require the loading to be taken into account for practical design of these structures in addition the ditching of an aircraft on the water surface is another problem of water slamming on a body which can lead to damage to the aircraft and potential loss of life hydrodynamic impact and slamming is a complicated process in which air cushion air bubbles compressibility of the water and hydroelasticity may be relevant faltinsen et al 2004 water slamming has been investigated over several decades using both theoretical and physical models von kármán 1929 developed the first theory to estimate pure water impact for a wedge and then for a horizontal plate in 1932 wagner 1932 developed theory for a wedge with very small dead rise angle small enough not to trap air under impact several experimental studies have been undertaken to investigate water slamming by dropping a wedge chuang 1966a zhu 1995 zhao et al 1996 a horizontal bottomed body chuang 1966b verhagen 1967 zhu 1995 faltinsen 2000 bullock et al 2001 kwon et al 2003 ermanyuk et al 2005 oh et al 2009 a horizontal circular cylinder lang and rung 2011 van nuffel and vepa 2013 and a pyramid onto a still pure water surface alaoui et al 2012 2015 furthermore smith et al 1998 conducted a series of drop tests of a horizontal plate onto waves of different steepness if water is assumed to be compressible then the peak pressure at the instant of impact of a horizontal plate onto still water is equal to the acoustic pressure von kármán 1929 p a ρcv where ρ is the fluid density c is the speed of sound in the fluid and v is the plate velocity just before impact also known as the impact velocity in practice the maximum acoustic pressure never occurs because an air layer is trapped between the flat plate and the water surface and this air acts as a cushion chuang 1966a b lewison and maclean 1968 in the experiment of chuang 1966a b the maximum impact pressure is found to be proportional to ρc a v where c a is the speed of sound in air rather than in water in the theory developed by chuang 1966a b the compressibility of both the air and water was considered in a general solution of the problem however because the maximum impact velocity was limited to 1 92 m s the finding in chuang s tests may not necessarily apply to higher impact velocities v 1 92 m s on the other hand the compressibility of the water is neglected by verhagen 1967 because the events of interest are expected to occur in a timescale of the order required by an acoustic wave in air to travel over a distance l i e δt l c a which is large compared with l c l is the half width of the flat plate verhagen s experiments indicated that this assumption is justified however the experiments were limited to small values of the mass of the body compared with the added mass verhagen 1967 found that the maximum impact pressure was proportional to the square of the impact velocity for small values of m ρl 2 0 5 but this relationship was linear if m ρl 2 1 m is the mass per unit length of the impact plate zhu 1995 found that the slamming pressure coefficient c p p max 0 5ρv increases with the weight of the model due to the added mass of water where p max is the peak slamming pressure the coefficient of weight has been defined at c m m a where m is the weight of the model and a is the flat impact area it was found that there was a considerable amount of scatter in the peak slamming pressures but the pressure impulses of the first positive phase the duration over which the pressure starts to rise up to the peak and then falls down to zero in the pressure time history under impact were more or less the same zhu 1995 in open oceans and seas bubbles are known to be created in the upper ocean through different mechanisms deane and stokes 1999 such as i the action of breaking gravity and capillary waves longuet higgins 1993 ii rain drop impact on the ocean surface franz 1959 pumphrey and elmore 1990 and iii melting snow blanchard and woodcock 1957 however most bubbles near the ocean surface are caused by breaking waves under moderate wind conditions medwin 1977 dean and stokes 1999 the entrained bubbles in both field and laboratory have diameters of the order of millimetres and the rise velocity of those bubbles is nearly constant for bubble diameters ranging from 0 5 to 50 mm chanson et al 2002 chanson 1997 wood 1991 a burst of sound is emitted at a frequency approximately given by minnaert s equation after a bubble is first formed deane and stokes 1999 minnaert 1933 bubbles produced by breaking waves are concentrated within a plume and this plume starts to dissipate through the processes of dissolution diffusion and degassing deane and stokes 1999 according to monahan 1993 there are different phases of a bubble plume s life cycle namely the α plume β plume and γ plume the α plume is the phase of a plume formed when most bubbles are created by breaking waves in the open ocean breaking waves may be caused by constructive interference wave wave wave current and wind wave interactions melville 1996 this α plume persists for seconds and is characterised by high void fractions of order 10 and a broadband spectrum of bubble sizes tens of microns to millimetres see monahan 1993 and deane and stokes 1999 once the momentum of the combination of the downward moving jet and breaking wave is dissipated the most diffuse bubbles aggregate and then form the β plume as time moves on the largest bubbles rise to the surface the remaining smaller bubbles are spread by turbulent diffusion over a greater volume which is represented by the γ plume monahan 1993 finally the influence of air in the water both entrapped pockets and entrained bubbles is known to lead to variability in wave impact pressures and forces there are limited experimental studies of slamming impact in aerated water bullock et al 2001 lang and rung 2011 and design codes for wave impact on offshore structures and ships are all based on pure water environments det norske veritas 2012 2014 2016 here we investigate the effects of aeration on wave impact and assess whether design practice needs to adapt to take these effects into account the effect of aeration on wave impact has been investigated through two linked experiments first by dropping a flat plate from various heights onto the surface of water aerated to various degrees presented in this paper second by generating wave impacts of different types on a truncated vertical wall representing a section of fpso floating production storage and offloading vessel hull in pure and aerated water which will be presented in a companion paper aeration effects on water structure impacts part 2 wave impacts on a truncated vertical wall 2 methodology 2 1 physical model of drop test the experimental work for the drop tests was carried out in the ocean basin at the university of plymouth coast lab the ocean basin is 35 m long by 15 5 m wide and has a movable floor that allows operation at different water depths up to 3 m for these tests the depth was set to 1m the falling block included a rigid impact plate connected to a carriage constructed from two driver plates with a total mass that could be varied from 32 kg to 52 kg the block dropped through a 4 m high vertical guide frame fixed on the gantry crossing over the basin see fig 1 a and b the impact plate was 0 25 m long 0 25 m wide and 0 012 m thick and the impact velocity varied between 1 m s and 7 m s depending on the drop height pressures on the bottom surface of the impact plate were measured by five miniature pressure transducers fgp sensors xpm10 with 8 mm head diameter and a measurement range of up to 100 bar installed at various locations on the impact plate fig 1c the impact velocity was integrated from accelerations obtained from an accelerometer model 4610 with a range of up to 200g in which g is the acceleration due to gravity mounted on the top surface of the impact plate the sampling frequency was 50 khz for pressure transducers accelerometer and displacement sensors table 1 lists the drop test conditions 2 2 evaluation of pure water in the ocean basin the assumption of pure water i e water in the absence of submerged air in the ocean basin was evaluated by measuring the speed of sound in the water using an acoustic systems trainer for sonar sound navigation and ranging the speed of sound in the water had a mean value of 1471 90 m s and standard deviation of 0 69 m s based on 14 measurements after the water surface was completely calm this measured speed of sound is about 99 74 of the theoretical estimation value of 1475 79 m s for pure water at 22 c according to wilson 1960 after each drop test in pure water 15 min was allowed for the water surface to become calm again before the next test according to stokes theory detsch and harris 1989 liger belair et al 2000 a bubble of diameter 0 05 mm needs about 12 26 min to rise through a water depth of 1 m as used in the drop test and this bubble is degassed at the water surface stokes theory and the experimental data obtained by leger belair et al 2000 show that the rise velocity is proportional to the bubble radius therefore after each test all bubbles of diameter larger than 0 05 mm would have risen to the water surface and the water degassed during the interval between tests 2 3 bubble generation and void fraction estimations in this study aerated water was achieved using a bubble generation system made of a clear perspex box with a perforated square top plate dimensions of 0 54 x 0 54 0 002 m placed at a depth of 1 m in the ocean basin holes of 0 2 mm diameter were created in the plate using a laser cutter the holes were uniformly distributed over a square area of 0 495 0 495 m2 with a hole spacing of 10 mm to generate aerated water air from a compressor was injected into the bubble generator via four inlets snapshots of the aerated water generated by different injection air pressures are presented by mai et al 2014 ma et al 2016 and mai 2017 which clearly show that the bubble density increases with injection pressure injecting air pressures of 0 065 bar 0 083 bar and 0 137 bar into the bubble generator produced void fractions of 0 8 0 31 1 0 39 and 1 6 0 07 which were calibrated by a volumetric method at a depth of 25 cm from the water surface fig 2 see mai 2017 for more details 3 results and discussion 3 1 slamming in pure water fig 3 presents motion time histories for impact of a 52 kg plate in pure water at 7 21 m s impact speed time t 0 s corresponds to the time of maximum force the maximum acceleration due to the impact was not captured by the 200g accelerometer as the signal was clipped from the moment that the plate hit the water surface fig 3a fig 3b shows that the velocity is zero at the start of the test and then increases linearly during the free fall of the impact plate until a maximum velocity is obtained at the instant of reaching its maximum velocity the impact plate starts to decelerate and this corresponds to first contact with the water surface the velocity of the impact plate fluctuates for about 30 ms then decreases smoothly to zero and changes its direction due to the safety rope which was connected to the carriage and used to stop the carriage from leaving the guide frame fig 3c shows the integrated displacement of the impact plate during the test fig 4 presents the measured pressures and the integrated force f during impact for the test case presented in fig 3 at impact pressures start to increase up to the maximum values the maximum pressure at the centre of the impact plate p1 is much higher than near the edges p2 p8 and slightly higher than the maximum pressures at locations p6 p7 located near the plate centre the maximum pressures are attained at time instants between 1 24 ms and 1 32 ms after first contact between the impact plate and water surface it is observed that the maximum pressure at location p8 is always attained earlier than the maximum pressure p1 at the centre of the plate by between about 0 08 ms under impact velocity v 7 21 m s and 0 38 ms under impact velocity v 1 33 m s this was also observed by lewison and maclean 1968 and is explained by a phenomenon called coalescence in which the air and water merge to form effectively a single phase coalescence occurs after the peak pressure at any location on the impact plate and it occurs later relative to the pressure peak at the edge of the plate than at the centre a second pressure peak is observed under high impact velocities v 5 5 m s to 7 21 m s at between 0 66 ms and 0 6 ms after the first peak see fig 4 the second pressure peak may be due to the propagation of an acoustic shock wave travelling either through air to the edge of the plate and back over a distance 2l where l is the half width of the impact plate or through water to the bottom of the basin and back over twice the tested water depth 2h the time scale associated with propagation of the shock wave in water namely 2h c w is 1 36 ms where the measured speed of sound in pure water is c w 1471 90 m s whereas the propagation time needed for the shock wave travelling in air 2l c a is 0 74 ms where the speed of sound in air is taken to be c a 340 m s based on these calculations the second scenario of the shock wave travelling through the air gap along the width of the plate and back seems most plausible because the time scale is comparable to the observations 0 6 ms 0 66 ms and the horizontal half size of the trapped air region is less than l unfortunately the trapped air region cannot be observed in sufficient resolution from the low frequency underwater cameras frame rate of 25 30 fps used in this experiment distinct post impact pressure oscillations have been observed and depicted in fig 5 for tests involving impact velocities of 1 33 m s 4 28 m s and 7 21 m s the left hand plots fig 5a c e are the time histories of pressures and the right hand plots fig 5b d f are the respective fast fourier transforms ffts the pressure oscillations at the central point p1 and near the plate centre p6 are much more obvious than near the edges of the plate p2 at all impact velocities the evolution of the impact pressure loading comprises distinct stages the first shock loading fluid expansion loadings under atmosphere pressures and re loadings this evolution of pressures due to impacts in pure water at high velocities v 5 5 m s to 7 m s was also observed in the numerical simulations by ma et al 2016 the natural frequency of the falling block carriage and support frame set up is about 500 hz and so is not likely to be the cause of the observed oscillation frequencies which vary from 139 9 hz to 319 7 hz these oscillations in pressure may be due to repeated compressions and expansions of the trapped air when the impact plate is about to hit the water surface verhagen 1967 lewison and maclean 1968 and or due to reflection of the acoustic shock wave from the bottom of the basin lang and rung 2011 the time required for pressure wave transmission through twice the water depth is about 1 35 ms as calculated above which corresponds to a frequency of 740 hz under an impact velocity of 1 33 m s the peak frequency of the oscillations is 319 7 hz under impact velocities of 4 28 m s and 7 21 m s the peak frequencies of oscillations are approximately the same at 139 9 hz these frequencies of oscillation are all much smaller than that calculated for the sound wave reflecting from the basin floor and so this is unlikely to be the cause of the oscillations in pressure table 2 presents the oscillation frequencies and their corresponding oscillation periods under different impact velocities in addition bubble sizes estimated from the oscillation frequencies applying minnaert s equation minnaert 1933 are also presented it is shown in fig 5 and table 2 that as the impact velocity is increased the frequency of these pressure oscillations reduces and the bubble size for a corresponding oscillation is increased this suggests that the trapped air bubble if this is indeed the effect being measured is larger for higher impact velocity as mentioned above it is not possible to observe the trapped air bubble clearly in the underwater camera footage but the size of trapped air bubble predicted by the theory is consistent being of the order of the size of the plate for structural design it is essential to understand the maximum environmental load condition by determining the distribution of maximum pressures on a plate the local loads and hence any requirement to strengthen parts of the plate can be established for applications such as the design of a hull of a ship the bow of a ship or the hull of an fpso spatial 2d distributions of the maximum pressures on the square plate have been obtained from the available measured pressure points p1 p8 on the plate using linear integration from the measured data points which are represented by the dots shown in fig 6 in fig 6 an 0xy plane coordinate system is applied on the surface of the impact plate with the plate centre at x a y a 0 0 and a is the half width of the plate the largest maximum pressure always occurs at the centre of the plate in fig 6b f the pressure distribution has similar characteristics whereby the pressure reduces to 80 of its maximum value at the mid point and 40 at the edge the lowest impact velocity of v 1 34 0 02 m s has a different distribution with more uniform pressure fig 6a fig 7 presents both the maximum pressure p1 measured at the centre of the impact plate and the maximum integrated force f plotted against the impact velocity for the tests in pure water with the plate mass of 32 kg and 52 kg in each plot of fig 7 the circles represent the experimental maximum pressures fig 7a c or maximum force fig 7b d and the solid line represents fitted curves with functions as follows for pressure 1 p max a p v 2 or force 2 f max a f v 2 where the empirical coefficients a p and a f are estimated by the non linear least squares algorithm in matlab to obtain the best curve fit to the experimental data empirical coefficients a p a f and the correlation coefficient r 2 are presented within fig 7 for the larger mass in particular fig 7c and d it is evident that the impact pressure and force are proportional to the square of the impact velocity for the present experiment with m ρl 2 8 2 for m 32 kg and 13 3 for m 52 kg this relationship of the impact pressure and impact velocity is expected to be linear according to the numerical investigation by verhagen 1967 for the case with m ρl 2 1 the theoretical formulae proposed by von kármán 1929 and chuang 1966a b are also included in fig 7 for comparison experimental results of the present study are much lower than the acoustic pressure estimation von kármán 1929 are similar to chuang s 1966a b theory at low velocities and much higher at high impact velocities this may be because chuang s theory was validated experimentally for impact velocities up to 1 92 m s only and so might not be appropriate to apply to the high impact velocities in the range of 2 m s and 7 m s tested in the present study the empirical coefficient a p is between 0 75 and 0 79 and can be converted into impact coefficient c p p max ρv 2 with a range of 75 79 the impact coefficient presented here is much higher than the range of 0 6 9 7 found in chuang et al 2017 and the range of 3 21 of chan 1994 3 2 slamming in aerated water fig 8 shows the measured acceleration the integrated velocity and displacement of a plate impact in aerated water with void fraction of 1 6 the impact velocity was 7 m s and the plate mass was 52 kg the plate acceleration in aerated water fig 8a is much less than in pure water fig 3a the velocity of the plate decreases smoothly after the plate makes contact with the water surface fig 8b and the velocity trace after impact is found to be less complex than the impact in pure water presented in fig 3b the displacement trace of the impact plate in aerated water fig 8c looks identical to the one for impact in pure water fig 3c the water surface becomes unstable as it is disturbed by the bubble generation and this is expected to affect the pressure traces the measured pressures p1 p5 and integrated force are presented in fig 9 peak pressures occur at different instances in time separated by a few milliseconds fig 9a in this case the impact pressure and force in aerated water are much lower than those in pure water in fig 4 i e peak pressure reduced from about 36 bar in pure water to 6 bar in aerated water about one order of magnitude reduction this reduction is due to the presence of air in water and may also be due to the water surface distortion which leads to the deadrise angle of the impact increasing similar reductions in impact pressure in aerated water were also found in experimental studies on drop tests of a circular plate by bullock et al 2001 and a cylinder at deadrise angle of 0 by lang and rung 2011 fig 10 presents the pressure traces after impact of the 52 kg plate in aerated water β 1 6 with impact velocities of 4 12 m s and 7 m s there is no distinct oscillation of pressures after the impact in aerated water fig 10a c as was observed from the impact in pure water fig 5a c e there seems to be only quasi hydrostatic pressure after the impact in aerated water the associated pressure amplitude spectra are presented in fig 10b d and there is no high frequency peak as was observed in pure water due to the trapped air between the plate and water surface 3 3 impact pressures and slamming force maximum pressures at the measured locations p1 p8 for impacts in pure and aerated water are presented in fig 11 a b for a 32 kg and b 52 kg plates respectively it is shown that the impact pressures in pure water the black circles in plots are much higher than those measured in aerated water of 0 8 1 and 1 6 void fraction with the presence of air in the water the impact pressure decreases significantly in comparison with that in pure water for example for an impact velocity of 7 m s and mass of 52 kg the impact pressure in pure water p1 max 33 23 bar is reduced to that of 4 45 bar when the water has an aeration level of 1 6 this shows that aeration plays an important role during impact and can reduce impact pressure significantly in addition the water surface distortion also affects the impact pressures for the tests in aerated water the water surface was disturbed by the bubble generation system and so the impacts in aerated water were not as perfectly uniform across the surface of the plate as they were in pure water this water surface distortion has a similar effect of reducing impact pressure in aerated water as found by others for plates with small deadrise angle chuang 1966a lewison 1969 van nuffel and vepa 2013 maximum forces in pure and aerated water are presented in fig 11c d for the tested plates m 32 kg and 52 kg there is a significant reduction in the impact force from tests conducted in pure water in comparison with those conducted in aerated water fig 12 shows the maximum force versus void fraction β of the water for the plates of mass 32 kg and 52 kg within the range of the experimental data in the present study the maximum force appears to be an exponential function of the void fraction given by 3 f max k f e n β in which coefficients k f and n are estimated using a nonlinear least squares fit to the experimental data the fitted curves and the coefficient values are presented in each plot of fig 12 for each impact velocity the curves in fig 12 show a similar tendency to the experimental results of bullock et al 2001 and simulations by ma et al 2016 in that there is significant reduction of the impact pressures due to a relatively small air content and that the effect of aeration increases with the violence of the impact the reduction of wave impact pressure due to aerated water can be also found in chuang et al 2018 for wall impingement event in their study where the wall impingement event is when a plunging breaking wave impinged on the frontal vertical wall of a fixed platform and aerated water was generated due to wave broken 3 4 impulses of pressure and slam force impulse values can be obtained by integrating force or pressure over the duration of the impact the first impulse i first of the impact is defined as the impulse of the first positive phase of the impact i e the area a1 in fig 13 and the total impulse i total is integrated from the start of the impact until the signal falls back to the noise level i e the sum of the areas a1 to a7 in fig 13 the total impulse for the drop tests is calculated for a duration from the start time of an impact until the time when the impact plate was restrained by the rope used to stop the plate falling onto the basin floor therefore the total impulse used in this analysis does not consider the entire motion of the object brought to rest and therefore there may be a difference between the total impulses for various impacts pressure impulses of the plate impact in pure and aerated water are presented in fig 14 the first pressure impulses i p first of the impact in pure water are much higher than those in aerated water and there is a linear relationship between the first impulse and the violence of the flow as described by the impact velocity fig 14a and b in pure water scatter of the first pressure impulse is much smaller than the scatter of the impact pressures p max presented in fig 11a b this smaller scatter of the first pressure impulse was also found from the experimental work by zhu 1995 in contrast variation of the first pressure impulse is still large for aerated water similar to the variation of the impact pressures fig 11a and b the total pressure impulses i p total are presented in fig 14c d and the variation of the total pressure impulse in pure water is as large as the variation in aerated water there is no reduction of the total pressure impulses from pure water to aerated water for impacts of both 32 kg and 52 kg plates fig 15 presents the first positive phase force impulse i f first and the total force impulse i f total similar to the first pressure impulses in pure water fig 14a and b the first force impulses are significantly larger than those in aerated water fig 15a and b in pure water the variation of the first force impulse is larger than the variation of the first pressure impulse especially at high impact velocities from 4 m s to 7 m s see fig 14a and b and fig 15a and b bullock et al 2007 also presented experimental data that exhibited large variation in the first force impulse wave impact the total force impulses in pure and aerated water are more or less the same except the impacts of the 52 kg plate show the total force impulses in aerated water are higher than those in pure water see fig 15d 4 conclusions this paper presents results of an experimental campaign on the role of aeration in slamming impacts such impacts can have both local and global effects on offshore structures and ships and may cause local damage and or structural vibrations the experiment was conducted by means of a free falling rigid flat plate onto pure and aerated water surfaces designed to represent severe slamming impacts with zero degree deadrise angle the following conclusions should be useful in the context of local and global loads on offshore structures and ships which need to be assessed as part of the marine structure design process currently design codes do not include the effect of aeration and here we make observations of the implications for design 4 1 impacts in pure water physical modelling of slamming impacts by freely dropping a flat plate onto a pure water surface has enabled characterisation of the spatial distribution of impact pressures and its variation with impact velocity the largest maximum pressure was found to occur at the centre of the plate while the maximum pressure at locations near the edges is about 80 of the pressure at the centre of the plate for v 2 m s and about 40 for v 2 m s in addition the impact loadings on the tested plate are proportional to the square of the impact velocity and the empirical factors of this relationship are found to depend on the body mass and the location on the plate these empirical coefficients may be considered as a reference for marine structure design if the effect of aeration is assessed for slamming impacts post impact high frequency oscillations of pressures were observed and these are due to repeated compression and expansion of the trapped air between the impact plate and water surface these high frequency oscillations may need to be assessed for the fatigue analysis of a section of the hull or whole ship structure 4 2 effects of aeration on impacts aeration has an important effect on slamming impacts there is a significant reduction in the hydrodynamic impact loadings pressure and force for those measured in aerated water compared to those in pure water this reduction is not only due to the presence of air in the body of water but also due to the water surface distortion in addition significant reductions in the pressure and force impulses of the first positive phase are also found from the slamming impacts in aerated water compared with pure water but there is almost no reduction of the total loading impulses the variation of impulsive loadings is less sensitive than the peak loadings for slamming impacts therefore the implication for design is that maximum instantaneous loads calculated for pure water may be conservative in the presence of aerated water this is particularly important for offshore structures where the wave impact often occurs in seas where wave breaking is commonplace and the water is likely to be considerably aerated before it impacts the structure this is not yet taken into account in standard design practice det norske veritas 2012 2016 but the loading amplitude and its spatial temporal evolution is fundamental to the analysis of structural response and thus it is recommended from the findings here that the aeration effects on slamming should be considered an exponential relationship of the maximum force and the void fraction has been empirically proposed with its coefficients found from the slamming impacts these empirical coefficients may be considered as a reference for marine structure design if the effect of aeration is assessed for slamming impacts

22339,current offshore engineering design codes for wave loading are based on pure water but wave impacts often involve aerated flow either as a result of air entrapment as the wave overturns or due to impact with a wave that is already broken therefore it is necessary to develop a new understanding of how design codes should incorporate water air mixture for wave impact this experimental study investigates aeration effects on wave impacts by means of slamming impacts of a square flat plate onto a pure and aerated water surface with zero degree dead rise angle the low aeration level between 0 and 1 6 was applied and the drop velocity varied from about 1 m s to 7 m s there was a significant reduction in the peak impact loads both pressure and force for impact in aerated water compared to that in pure water there was also a significant reduction in the first phase of the pressure and force impulse for aerated water the variation in impulsive loadings is less sensitive than peak loadings for impacts the implication for design is that maximum instantaneous loads may be conservative in the presence of aerated water keywords aeration effect slamming wave impact physical model 1 introduction hydrodynamic impact problems are frequently encountered in marine engineering faltinsen 1993 2000 kapsenberg 2011 water sports rubin 1999 and natural hazards kay 2014 rodgers and bryson 2014 slamming of high speed marine vessels on the water surface and ship bows subject to wave impact both require the loading to be taken into account for practical design of these structures in addition the ditching of an aircraft on the water surface is another problem of water slamming on a body which can lead to damage to the aircraft and potential loss of life hydrodynamic impact and slamming is a complicated process in which air cushion air bubbles compressibility of the water and hydroelasticity may be relevant faltinsen et al 2004 water slamming has been investigated over several decades using both theoretical and physical models von kármán 1929 developed the first theory to estimate pure water impact for a wedge and then for a horizontal plate in 1932 wagner 1932 developed theory for a wedge with very small dead rise angle small enough not to trap air under impact several experimental studies have been undertaken to investigate water slamming by dropping a wedge chuang 1966a zhu 1995 zhao et al 1996 a horizontal bottomed body chuang 1966b verhagen 1967 zhu 1995 faltinsen 2000 bullock et al 2001 kwon et al 2003 ermanyuk et al 2005 oh et al 2009 a horizontal circular cylinder lang and rung 2011 van nuffel and vepa 2013 and a pyramid onto a still pure water surface alaoui et al 2012 2015 furthermore smith et al 1998 conducted a series of drop tests of a horizontal plate onto waves of different steepness if water is assumed to be compressible then the peak pressure at the instant of impact of a horizontal plate onto still water is equal to the acoustic pressure von kármán 1929 p a ρcv where ρ is the fluid density c is the speed of sound in the fluid and v is the plate velocity just before impact also known as the impact velocity in practice the maximum acoustic pressure never occurs because an air layer is trapped between the flat plate and the water surface and this air acts as a cushion chuang 1966a b lewison and maclean 1968 in the experiment of chuang 1966a b the maximum impact pressure is found to be proportional to ρc a v where c a is the speed of sound in air rather than in water in the theory developed by chuang 1966a b the compressibility of both the air and water was considered in a general solution of the problem however because the maximum impact velocity was limited to 1 92 m s the finding in chuang s tests may not necessarily apply to higher impact velocities v 1 92 m s on the other hand the compressibility of the water is neglected by verhagen 1967 because the events of interest are expected to occur in a timescale of the order required by an acoustic wave in air to travel over a distance l i e δt l c a which is large compared with l c l is the half width of the flat plate verhagen s experiments indicated that this assumption is justified however the experiments were limited to small values of the mass of the body compared with the added mass verhagen 1967 found that the maximum impact pressure was proportional to the square of the impact velocity for small values of m ρl 2 0 5 but this relationship was linear if m ρl 2 1 m is the mass per unit length of the impact plate zhu 1995 found that the slamming pressure coefficient c p p max 0 5ρv increases with the weight of the model due to the added mass of water where p max is the peak slamming pressure the coefficient of weight has been defined at c m m a where m is the weight of the model and a is the flat impact area it was found that there was a considerable amount of scatter in the peak slamming pressures but the pressure impulses of the first positive phase the duration over which the pressure starts to rise up to the peak and then falls down to zero in the pressure time history under impact were more or less the same zhu 1995 in open oceans and seas bubbles are known to be created in the upper ocean through different mechanisms deane and stokes 1999 such as i the action of breaking gravity and capillary waves longuet higgins 1993 ii rain drop impact on the ocean surface franz 1959 pumphrey and elmore 1990 and iii melting snow blanchard and woodcock 1957 however most bubbles near the ocean surface are caused by breaking waves under moderate wind conditions medwin 1977 dean and stokes 1999 the entrained bubbles in both field and laboratory have diameters of the order of millimetres and the rise velocity of those bubbles is nearly constant for bubble diameters ranging from 0 5 to 50 mm chanson et al 2002 chanson 1997 wood 1991 a burst of sound is emitted at a frequency approximately given by minnaert s equation after a bubble is first formed deane and stokes 1999 minnaert 1933 bubbles produced by breaking waves are concentrated within a plume and this plume starts to dissipate through the processes of dissolution diffusion and degassing deane and stokes 1999 according to monahan 1993 there are different phases of a bubble plume s life cycle namely the α plume β plume and γ plume the α plume is the phase of a plume formed when most bubbles are created by breaking waves in the open ocean breaking waves may be caused by constructive interference wave wave wave current and wind wave interactions melville 1996 this α plume persists for seconds and is characterised by high void fractions of order 10 and a broadband spectrum of bubble sizes tens of microns to millimetres see monahan 1993 and deane and stokes 1999 once the momentum of the combination of the downward moving jet and breaking wave is dissipated the most diffuse bubbles aggregate and then form the β plume as time moves on the largest bubbles rise to the surface the remaining smaller bubbles are spread by turbulent diffusion over a greater volume which is represented by the γ plume monahan 1993 finally the influence of air in the water both entrapped pockets and entrained bubbles is known to lead to variability in wave impact pressures and forces there are limited experimental studies of slamming impact in aerated water bullock et al 2001 lang and rung 2011 and design codes for wave impact on offshore structures and ships are all based on pure water environments det norske veritas 2012 2014 2016 here we investigate the effects of aeration on wave impact and assess whether design practice needs to adapt to take these effects into account the effect of aeration on wave impact has been investigated through two linked experiments first by dropping a flat plate from various heights onto the surface of water aerated to various degrees presented in this paper second by generating wave impacts of different types on a truncated vertical wall representing a section of fpso floating production storage and offloading vessel hull in pure and aerated water which will be presented in a companion paper aeration effects on water structure impacts part 2 wave impacts on a truncated vertical wall 2 methodology 2 1 physical model of drop test the experimental work for the drop tests was carried out in the ocean basin at the university of plymouth coast lab the ocean basin is 35 m long by 15 5 m wide and has a movable floor that allows operation at different water depths up to 3 m for these tests the depth was set to 1m the falling block included a rigid impact plate connected to a carriage constructed from two driver plates with a total mass that could be varied from 32 kg to 52 kg the block dropped through a 4 m high vertical guide frame fixed on the gantry crossing over the basin see fig 1 a and b the impact plate was 0 25 m long 0 25 m wide and 0 012 m thick and the impact velocity varied between 1 m s and 7 m s depending on the drop height pressures on the bottom surface of the impact plate were measured by five miniature pressure transducers fgp sensors xpm10 with 8 mm head diameter and a measurement range of up to 100 bar installed at various locations on the impact plate fig 1c the impact velocity was integrated from accelerations obtained from an accelerometer model 4610 with a range of up to 200g in which g is the acceleration due to gravity mounted on the top surface of the impact plate the sampling frequency was 50 khz for pressure transducers accelerometer and displacement sensors table 1 lists the drop test conditions 2 2 evaluation of pure water in the ocean basin the assumption of pure water i e water in the absence of submerged air in the ocean basin was evaluated by measuring the speed of sound in the water using an acoustic systems trainer for sonar sound navigation and ranging the speed of sound in the water had a mean value of 1471 90 m s and standard deviation of 0 69 m s based on 14 measurements after the water surface was completely calm this measured speed of sound is about 99 74 of the theoretical estimation value of 1475 79 m s for pure water at 22 c according to wilson 1960 after each drop test in pure water 15 min was allowed for the water surface to become calm again before the next test according to stokes theory detsch and harris 1989 liger belair et al 2000 a bubble of diameter 0 05 mm needs about 12 26 min to rise through a water depth of 1 m as used in the drop test and this bubble is degassed at the water surface stokes theory and the experimental data obtained by leger belair et al 2000 show that the rise velocity is proportional to the bubble radius therefore after each test all bubbles of diameter larger than 0 05 mm would have risen to the water surface and the water degassed during the interval between tests 2 3 bubble generation and void fraction estimations in this study aerated water was achieved using a bubble generation system made of a clear perspex box with a perforated square top plate dimensions of 0 54 x 0 54 0 002 m placed at a depth of 1 m in the ocean basin holes of 0 2 mm diameter were created in the plate using a laser cutter the holes were uniformly distributed over a square area of 0 495 0 495 m2 with a hole spacing of 10 mm to generate aerated water air from a compressor was injected into the bubble generator via four inlets snapshots of the aerated water generated by different injection air pressures are presented by mai et al 2014 ma et al 2016 and mai 2017 which clearly show that the bubble density increases with injection pressure injecting air pressures of 0 065 bar 0 083 bar and 0 137 bar into the bubble generator produced void fractions of 0 8 0 31 1 0 39 and 1 6 0 07 which were calibrated by a volumetric method at a depth of 25 cm from the water surface fig 2 see mai 2017 for more details 3 results and discussion 3 1 slamming in pure water fig 3 presents motion time histories for impact of a 52 kg plate in pure water at 7 21 m s impact speed time t 0 s corresponds to the time of maximum force the maximum acceleration due to the impact was not captured by the 200g accelerometer as the signal was clipped from the moment that the plate hit the water surface fig 3a fig 3b shows that the velocity is zero at the start of the test and then increases linearly during the free fall of the impact plate until a maximum velocity is obtained at the instant of reaching its maximum velocity the impact plate starts to decelerate and this corresponds to first contact with the water surface the velocity of the impact plate fluctuates for about 30 ms then decreases smoothly to zero and changes its direction due to the safety rope which was connected to the carriage and used to stop the carriage from leaving the guide frame fig 3c shows the integrated displacement of the impact plate during the test fig 4 presents the measured pressures and the integrated force f during impact for the test case presented in fig 3 at impact pressures start to increase up to the maximum values the maximum pressure at the centre of the impact plate p1 is much higher than near the edges p2 p8 and slightly higher than the maximum pressures at locations p6 p7 located near the plate centre the maximum pressures are attained at time instants between 1 24 ms and 1 32 ms after first contact between the impact plate and water surface it is observed that the maximum pressure at location p8 is always attained earlier than the maximum pressure p1 at the centre of the plate by between about 0 08 ms under impact velocity v 7 21 m s and 0 38 ms under impact velocity v 1 33 m s this was also observed by lewison and maclean 1968 and is explained by a phenomenon called coalescence in which the air and water merge to form effectively a single phase coalescence occurs after the peak pressure at any location on the impact plate and it occurs later relative to the pressure peak at the edge of the plate than at the centre a second pressure peak is observed under high impact velocities v 5 5 m s to 7 21 m s at between 0 66 ms and 0 6 ms after the first peak see fig 4 the second pressure peak may be due to the propagation of an acoustic shock wave travelling either through air to the edge of the plate and back over a distance 2l where l is the half width of the impact plate or through water to the bottom of the basin and back over twice the tested water depth 2h the time scale associated with propagation of the shock wave in water namely 2h c w is 1 36 ms where the measured speed of sound in pure water is c w 1471 90 m s whereas the propagation time needed for the shock wave travelling in air 2l c a is 0 74 ms where the speed of sound in air is taken to be c a 340 m s based on these calculations the second scenario of the shock wave travelling through the air gap along the width of the plate and back seems most plausible because the time scale is comparable to the observations 0 6 ms 0 66 ms and the horizontal half size of the trapped air region is less than l unfortunately the trapped air region cannot be observed in sufficient resolution from the low frequency underwater cameras frame rate of 25 30 fps used in this experiment distinct post impact pressure oscillations have been observed and depicted in fig 5 for tests involving impact velocities of 1 33 m s 4 28 m s and 7 21 m s the left hand plots fig 5a c e are the time histories of pressures and the right hand plots fig 5b d f are the respective fast fourier transforms ffts the pressure oscillations at the central point p1 and near the plate centre p6 are much more obvious than near the edges of the plate p2 at all impact velocities the evolution of the impact pressure loading comprises distinct stages the first shock loading fluid expansion loadings under atmosphere pressures and re loadings this evolution of pressures due to impacts in pure water at high velocities v 5 5 m s to 7 m s was also observed in the numerical simulations by ma et al 2016 the natural frequency of the falling block carriage and support frame set up is about 500 hz and so is not likely to be the cause of the observed oscillation frequencies which vary from 139 9 hz to 319 7 hz these oscillations in pressure may be due to repeated compressions and expansions of the trapped air when the impact plate is about to hit the water surface verhagen 1967 lewison and maclean 1968 and or due to reflection of the acoustic shock wave from the bottom of the basin lang and rung 2011 the time required for pressure wave transmission through twice the water depth is about 1 35 ms as calculated above which corresponds to a frequency of 740 hz under an impact velocity of 1 33 m s the peak frequency of the oscillations is 319 7 hz under impact velocities of 4 28 m s and 7 21 m s the peak frequencies of oscillations are approximately the same at 139 9 hz these frequencies of oscillation are all much smaller than that calculated for the sound wave reflecting from the basin floor and so this is unlikely to be the cause of the oscillations in pressure table 2 presents the oscillation frequencies and their corresponding oscillation periods under different impact velocities in addition bubble sizes estimated from the oscillation frequencies applying minnaert s equation minnaert 1933 are also presented it is shown in fig 5 and table 2 that as the impact velocity is increased the frequency of these pressure oscillations reduces and the bubble size for a corresponding oscillation is increased this suggests that the trapped air bubble if this is indeed the effect being measured is larger for higher impact velocity as mentioned above it is not possible to observe the trapped air bubble clearly in the underwater camera footage but the size of trapped air bubble predicted by the theory is consistent being of the order of the size of the plate for structural design it is essential to understand the maximum environmental load condition by determining the distribution of maximum pressures on a plate the local loads and hence any requirement to strengthen parts of the plate can be established for applications such as the design of a hull of a ship the bow of a ship or the hull of an fpso spatial 2d distributions of the maximum pressures on the square plate have been obtained from the available measured pressure points p1 p8 on the plate using linear integration from the measured data points which are represented by the dots shown in fig 6 in fig 6 an 0xy plane coordinate system is applied on the surface of the impact plate with the plate centre at x a y a 0 0 and a is the half width of the plate the largest maximum pressure always occurs at the centre of the plate in fig 6b f the pressure distribution has similar characteristics whereby the pressure reduces to 80 of its maximum value at the mid point and 40 at the edge the lowest impact velocity of v 1 34 0 02 m s has a different distribution with more uniform pressure fig 6a fig 7 presents both the maximum pressure p1 measured at the centre of the impact plate and the maximum integrated force f plotted against the impact velocity for the tests in pure water with the plate mass of 32 kg and 52 kg in each plot of fig 7 the circles represent the experimental maximum pressures fig 7a c or maximum force fig 7b d and the solid line represents fitted curves with functions as follows for pressure 1 p max a p v 2 or force 2 f max a f v 2 where the empirical coefficients a p and a f are estimated by the non linear least squares algorithm in matlab to obtain the best curve fit to the experimental data empirical coefficients a p a f and the correlation coefficient r 2 are presented within fig 7 for the larger mass in particular fig 7c and d it is evident that the impact pressure and force are proportional to the square of the impact velocity for the present experiment with m ρl 2 8 2 for m 32 kg and 13 3 for m 52 kg this relationship of the impact pressure and impact velocity is expected to be linear according to the numerical investigation by verhagen 1967 for the case with m ρl 2 1 the theoretical formulae proposed by von kármán 1929 and chuang 1966a b are also included in fig 7 for comparison experimental results of the present study are much lower than the acoustic pressure estimation von kármán 1929 are similar to chuang s 1966a b theory at low velocities and much higher at high impact velocities this may be because chuang s theory was validated experimentally for impact velocities up to 1 92 m s only and so might not be appropriate to apply to the high impact velocities in the range of 2 m s and 7 m s tested in the present study the empirical coefficient a p is between 0 75 and 0 79 and can be converted into impact coefficient c p p max ρv 2 with a range of 75 79 the impact coefficient presented here is much higher than the range of 0 6 9 7 found in chuang et al 2017 and the range of 3 21 of chan 1994 3 2 slamming in aerated water fig 8 shows the measured acceleration the integrated velocity and displacement of a plate impact in aerated water with void fraction of 1 6 the impact velocity was 7 m s and the plate mass was 52 kg the plate acceleration in aerated water fig 8a is much less than in pure water fig 3a the velocity of the plate decreases smoothly after the plate makes contact with the water surface fig 8b and the velocity trace after impact is found to be less complex than the impact in pure water presented in fig 3b the displacement trace of the impact plate in aerated water fig 8c looks identical to the one for impact in pure water fig 3c the water surface becomes unstable as it is disturbed by the bubble generation and this is expected to affect the pressure traces the measured pressures p1 p5 and integrated force are presented in fig 9 peak pressures occur at different instances in time separated by a few milliseconds fig 9a in this case the impact pressure and force in aerated water are much lower than those in pure water in fig 4 i e peak pressure reduced from about 36 bar in pure water to 6 bar in aerated water about one order of magnitude reduction this reduction is due to the presence of air in water and may also be due to the water surface distortion which leads to the deadrise angle of the impact increasing similar reductions in impact pressure in aerated water were also found in experimental studies on drop tests of a circular plate by bullock et al 2001 and a cylinder at deadrise angle of 0 by lang and rung 2011 fig 10 presents the pressure traces after impact of the 52 kg plate in aerated water β 1 6 with impact velocities of 4 12 m s and 7 m s there is no distinct oscillation of pressures after the impact in aerated water fig 10a c as was observed from the impact in pure water fig 5a c e there seems to be only quasi hydrostatic pressure after the impact in aerated water the associated pressure amplitude spectra are presented in fig 10b d and there is no high frequency peak as was observed in pure water due to the trapped air between the plate and water surface 3 3 impact pressures and slamming force maximum pressures at the measured locations p1 p8 for impacts in pure and aerated water are presented in fig 11 a b for a 32 kg and b 52 kg plates respectively it is shown that the impact pressures in pure water the black circles in plots are much higher than those measured in aerated water of 0 8 1 and 1 6 void fraction with the presence of air in the water the impact pressure decreases significantly in comparison with that in pure water for example for an impact velocity of 7 m s and mass of 52 kg the impact pressure in pure water p1 max 33 23 bar is reduced to that of 4 45 bar when the water has an aeration level of 1 6 this shows that aeration plays an important role during impact and can reduce impact pressure significantly in addition the water surface distortion also affects the impact pressures for the tests in aerated water the water surface was disturbed by the bubble generation system and so the impacts in aerated water were not as perfectly uniform across the surface of the plate as they were in pure water this water surface distortion has a similar effect of reducing impact pressure in aerated water as found by others for plates with small deadrise angle chuang 1966a lewison 1969 van nuffel and vepa 2013 maximum forces in pure and aerated water are presented in fig 11c d for the tested plates m 32 kg and 52 kg there is a significant reduction in the impact force from tests conducted in pure water in comparison with those conducted in aerated water fig 12 shows the maximum force versus void fraction β of the water for the plates of mass 32 kg and 52 kg within the range of the experimental data in the present study the maximum force appears to be an exponential function of the void fraction given by 3 f max k f e n β in which coefficients k f and n are estimated using a nonlinear least squares fit to the experimental data the fitted curves and the coefficient values are presented in each plot of fig 12 for each impact velocity the curves in fig 12 show a similar tendency to the experimental results of bullock et al 2001 and simulations by ma et al 2016 in that there is significant reduction of the impact pressures due to a relatively small air content and that the effect of aeration increases with the violence of the impact the reduction of wave impact pressure due to aerated water can be also found in chuang et al 2018 for wall impingement event in their study where the wall impingement event is when a plunging breaking wave impinged on the frontal vertical wall of a fixed platform and aerated water was generated due to wave broken 3 4 impulses of pressure and slam force impulse values can be obtained by integrating force or pressure over the duration of the impact the first impulse i first of the impact is defined as the impulse of the first positive phase of the impact i e the area a1 in fig 13 and the total impulse i total is integrated from the start of the impact until the signal falls back to the noise level i e the sum of the areas a1 to a7 in fig 13 the total impulse for the drop tests is calculated for a duration from the start time of an impact until the time when the impact plate was restrained by the rope used to stop the plate falling onto the basin floor therefore the total impulse used in this analysis does not consider the entire motion of the object brought to rest and therefore there may be a difference between the total impulses for various impacts pressure impulses of the plate impact in pure and aerated water are presented in fig 14 the first pressure impulses i p first of the impact in pure water are much higher than those in aerated water and there is a linear relationship between the first impulse and the violence of the flow as described by the impact velocity fig 14a and b in pure water scatter of the first pressure impulse is much smaller than the scatter of the impact pressures p max presented in fig 11a b this smaller scatter of the first pressure impulse was also found from the experimental work by zhu 1995 in contrast variation of the first pressure impulse is still large for aerated water similar to the variation of the impact pressures fig 11a and b the total pressure impulses i p total are presented in fig 14c d and the variation of the total pressure impulse in pure water is as large as the variation in aerated water there is no reduction of the total pressure impulses from pure water to aerated water for impacts of both 32 kg and 52 kg plates fig 15 presents the first positive phase force impulse i f first and the total force impulse i f total similar to the first pressure impulses in pure water fig 14a and b the first force impulses are significantly larger than those in aerated water fig 15a and b in pure water the variation of the first force impulse is larger than the variation of the first pressure impulse especially at high impact velocities from 4 m s to 7 m s see fig 14a and b and fig 15a and b bullock et al 2007 also presented experimental data that exhibited large variation in the first force impulse wave impact the total force impulses in pure and aerated water are more or less the same except the impacts of the 52 kg plate show the total force impulses in aerated water are higher than those in pure water see fig 15d 4 conclusions this paper presents results of an experimental campaign on the role of aeration in slamming impacts such impacts can have both local and global effects on offshore structures and ships and may cause local damage and or structural vibrations the experiment was conducted by means of a free falling rigid flat plate onto pure and aerated water surfaces designed to represent severe slamming impacts with zero degree deadrise angle the following conclusions should be useful in the context of local and global loads on offshore structures and ships which need to be assessed as part of the marine structure design process currently design codes do not include the effect of aeration and here we make observations of the implications for design 4 1 impacts in pure water physical modelling of slamming impacts by freely dropping a flat plate onto a pure water surface has enabled characterisation of the spatial distribution of impact pressures and its variation with impact velocity the largest maximum pressure was found to occur at the centre of the plate while the maximum pressure at locations near the edges is about 80 of the pressure at the centre of the plate for v 2 m s and about 40 for v 2 m s in addition the impact loadings on the tested plate are proportional to the square of the impact velocity and the empirical factors of this relationship are found to depend on the body mass and the location on the plate these empirical coefficients may be considered as a reference for marine structure design if the effect of aeration is assessed for slamming impacts post impact high frequency oscillations of pressures were observed and these are due to repeated compression and expansion of the trapped air between the impact plate and water surface these high frequency oscillations may need to be assessed for the fatigue analysis of a section of the hull or whole ship structure 4 2 effects of aeration on impacts aeration has an important effect on slamming impacts there is a significant reduction in the hydrodynamic impact loadings pressure and force for those measured in aerated water compared to those in pure water this reduction is not only due to the presence of air in the body of water but also due to the water surface distortion in addition significant reductions in the pressure and force impulses of the first positive phase are also found from the slamming impacts in aerated water compared with pure water but there is almost no reduction of the total loading impulses the variation of impulsive loadings is less sensitive than the peak loadings for slamming impacts therefore the implication for design is that maximum instantaneous loads calculated for pure water may be conservative in the presence of aerated water this is particularly important for offshore structures where the wave impact often occurs in seas where wave breaking is commonplace and the water is likely to be considerably aerated before it impacts the structure this is not yet taken into account in standard design practice det norske veritas 2012 2016 but the loading amplitude and its spatial temporal evolution is fundamental to the analysis of structural response and thus it is recommended from the findings here that the aeration effects on slamming should be considered an exponential relationship of the maximum force and the void fraction has been empirically proposed with its coefficients found from the slamming impacts these empirical coefficients may be considered as a reference for marine structure design if the effect of aeration is assessed for slamming impacts
