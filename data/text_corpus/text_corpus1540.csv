7700,study region the guadalquivir basin in spain as a representative mediterranean basin study focus the aim of this study is to assess the adaptive capacity of mediterranean basins to long periods of severe drought to do so a hydro economic model has been developed that includes a spatial representation of the major economic uses of water and enables an analysis of the economic and environmental effects of alternative water management policies under a single event of water scarcity new hydrological insights for the region results highlight the trade offs among economic uses of water and environmental flow requirements since water resources in the guadalquivir are fully allocated moreover the increase of irrigated perennial crops area will aggravate vulnerability to drought by limiting the adaptive capacity of the basin survival irrigation is the first option for farmers to adapt to the simulated extreme drought 148 000 ha are shifted from normal irrigation to survival irrigation in the drought management protocol scenario these findings call for policy interventions to ensure greater management flexibility toward optimising water use while meeting environmental goals for instance enabling water trading among farmers would reallocate 22 more water to the upper basin reducing drought losses by 22 m eur the hydro economic model developed here can be adapted to basins elsewhere and the results show that it can be a useful tool to guide the design of efficient water management policies to address severe droughts in water stressed basins graphical abstract ga1 keywords hydro economic model water policy drought management drought mediterranean data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction structural water scarcity is common to all mediterranean river basins despite the uncertainty surrounding the impact of climate change on the frequency and intensity of droughts many researchers predict an increase in drought frequency intensity and duration due to rising global temperatures liu et al 2018 according to the european environment agency 2019 the consequences of climate change a temperature rise of 1 5 2 c is likely to increase drought risks in mediterranean europe this expected decrease in available water resources coupled with growing water use for economic and social activities could lead to more problems regarding water management these problems may result in social conflict if water resources need to be reallocated from historical uses e g irrigation to new societal preferences e g environmental or industrial uses the overexploitation of water resources has been identified as an outcome of the so called basin closure path molle et al 2010 a process that has been described for guadalquivir expósito and berbel 2019 in such cases demand continues to grow beyond the capacity to increase supply and generates a situation of overexploitation and overallocation of resources sustainable management of water resources requires scientific knowledge and sufficient relevant information to establish policies that balance the different uses of water various international institutions have called for the introduction of mechanisms that enable a more efficient allocation of water resources european commission 2019 gruère and boëdec 2019 oecd 2015 miteco ministerio para la transición ecológica y el reto demográfico 2020 underlines the need in spain for a more flexible allocation of rights that is better adapted both to the long term demands of society and to episodes of cyclical shortages e g frequent episodes of drought hydro economic models provide useful analytical tools for assessing the effectiveness of water resources management at basin level the advantage of hydro economic modelling is that it integrates the agronomic hydrological environmental and economic components of a water resource system which enables a more comprehensive evaluation of water policy options expósito et al 2020 and means it is well suited for the assessment of management and policy strategies for the adaptation to climate change arias montevechio et al 2023 harou et al 2009 ortiz et al 2023 sapino et al 2022 ward 2021 this integrated view allows a more realistic approach to resource allocation bekchanov et al 2017 eamen et al 2022 medellín azuara et al 2010 vichete et al 2023 pérez blanco et al 2022 show how the integration of hydro micro macro economic models can provide essential information in the efficient design of agricultural water policies many studies have addressed the issue of adaptation of irrigated agriculture to the impacts of drought farm level measures can contribute to this adaptation leclère et al 2013 reidsma et al 2010 ricart et al 2019 ward 2022 one of the key measures promoted by water authorities in recent years is the modernisation of agriculture improving water use efficiency both at the plot level and the overall irrigation system infrastructure this measure is a critical factor for rural development since it enhances high value cropping patterns and crop yields leading to an increase in the profitability of the irrigation water used pérez blanco et al 2020 however several studies call for a reconsideration of current water policies and the implementation of new institutional measures bhaduri et al 2021 hervás gámez and delgado ramos 2019 in the european union eu the water framework directive wfd calls for the use of economic instruments to manage water resources and achieve the good environmental status of water bodies in the eu member states european commission 2000 the wfd highlights the relevance of estimating the economic value of water uses the cost of associated water services and the level of cost recovery the wfd also encourages the use of water pricing as a tool to achieve efficient water use although some authors question the effectiveness of water pricing in water scarce basins berbel and expósito 2020 nevertheless there are other economic tools that could help mitigate the economic impact of droughts such as water markets the pros and cons of which have been extensively analysed in the literature bajaj et al 2022 montilla lópez et al 2016 palomo hierro et al 2015 however the studies conducted to date have tended to focus on small spatial areas and or specific uses without considering the relationship between uses and water flows at the basin level to our knowledge there is a lack of models that integrate both river water flows and agents behaviour while specifically analysing the effects on water use of farms and agricultural infrastructure modernisation water pricing policies and water markets at river basin scale where available water resources are already fully allocated this study aims to help fill this gap by analysing the economic and environmental impacts of droughts and water scarcity in the guadalquivir basin through an examination of alternative water allocation policies to this end a basin scale hydro economic model incorporating the main water uses has been developed reflecting the mutual relationships between social agents and the natural system the model can capture the response of the system to various management policies when faced with a severe long lasting drought with ongoing massive investment in perennial crops upstream another new development explored in this study is the widespread use of deficit irrigation which impacts resilience and vulnerability to droughts this study contributes to the literature by providing a detailed assessment of water allocation at the river basin level through hydro economic modelling the study not only analyses how to achieve a more sustainable management of the guadalquivir river basin but also adds to the scientific debate on policies and measures for sustainable water management worldwide a common response to closure and scarcity is modernisation investment in water saving measures which has opened an academic debate on the rebound effect of such measures some authors claim the rebound effect is inevitable perry and steduto 2017 while others defend the possibility of preventive actions berbel and mateos 2014 previous hydrological models of the guadalquivir basin only include subbasins hervás gámez and delgado ramos 2020 or specific irrigation districts reca et al 2001a 2001b or assume a fixed agricultural water demand as in aquatool model chg confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2021 our contribution in the case study is the use of positive mathematical programming pmp to simulate water demand at basin level this allows simulating the response of the agricultural sector to different situations of water availability or to different water policies this paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the guadalquivir basin section 3 explains the development of the hydro economic model of the guadalquivir basin section 4 introduces the simulated scenarios the results obtained are presented in section 5 finally section 6 outlines the main conclusions 2 case study area the guadalquivir basin the guadalquivir basin in southwestern europe has a surface area of 57 527 km2 and supports the economic activities of a population of more than 4 2 million people living in 476 municipalities fig 1 the guadalquivir basin has several particular features that make it an interesting basin for modelling water resources and analysing water management policies which can be applied to other semi arid areas with a mediterranean climate structural water scarcity espinosa tasón et al 2020 recurrent and severe droughts limited opportunities for increasing water supply widespread use of deficit irrigation use of water trading instruments palomo hierro et al 2015 and the relevance of guadalquivir basin as one of the main irrigated areas 25 of spain and orchards of europe the renewable resources available exceed 7000 hm3 year water abstractions total 3830 hm3 year of which 2903 hm3 comes from surface water and 927 hm3 from groundwater chg confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2021 these abstractions exceed 50 of renewable resources and agriculture is the largest user of water accounting for 87 of the water rights in the basin the river basin authority rba confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir is responsible for water management in the basin rainfall variability in the basin is high and hence the allocation of water to users is not fully guaranteed each farmer receives an amount of water allocated by the rba as an administrative concession or as water rights the water rights depend on the crop and location ranging from 1500 m3 ha year for olive groves to 10 450 m3 ha year for rice however farmers in the guadalquivir basin only receive their full allocation of water rights around 80 85 of the years the average water allocation during the drought in the period 2005 2008 was approximately 50 of the granted administrative water rights after this period there was a return to normality from 2008 to 2020 until the 2020 21 season when another drought protocol came into effect with a 50 reduction and further reduction to 20 for 2021 22 the location of crops follows a certain geographical distribution i in the upper basin irrigated olive trees occupy 98 of the irrigated area and are virtually a monocrop accounting for more than 85 of the total cultivated area in these zones ii herbaceous crops are more prevalent in the areas close to the guadalquivir estuary where olive groves become less predominant due to climatic reasons giving way to other crops such as rice 12 of the total cultivated area or extensive winter crops such as wheat sunflower and cotton 43 with perennial crops accounting for only 38 of the total cultivated area iii between both extremes there is a transition of crops in the middle basin left and right bank see fig 1 in terms of water use efficiency over the last 20 years the basin has undergone a technological transformation with traditional production systems being replaced by more intense systems based on efficient irrigation techniques encouraging an increase in perennial crops cultivation drip irrigation is the irrigation system in 78 of the cultivated area in the basin with this figure reaching 92 in the upper basin area see fig 1 moving further down the basin drip technology is gradually replaced by sprinkler technology to the point where it covers 61 of the cultivated area in the lower basin with the greatest use of flood irrigation found on rice farms 3 the hydro economic model the hydro economic model is used to evaluate drought scenarios and adaptation measures it combines two components hydrological and economic fig 2 shows the outline of the hydro economic modelling process 3 1 hydrological component the hydrological component is a reduced form hydrological model of the guadalquivir basin it has been calibrated with the observed flows applying the hydrological principles of mass balance and continuity of river flow based on the model developed by kahil et al 2016 2018 the model used in this study depicts a network of nodes and links with nodes representing the water supply and demand units in the basin and links indicating the flow relationships between them balances are defined for each flow i with the main flow variables in the model x i being headwater inflows abstractions return flows losses and flows measured at selected gauge points in the basin the information fed into the model is provided by the rba chg confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2021 2022 and is used to replicate the flow rates at each node and the spatial distribution of the available water between the different units fig 3 the headwater inflows are calculated as the total annual flows measured at the different headwater gauges with the inflows x h at each headwater gauge h a subset of i being equal to the total source supply the streamflow x v at each river gauge v a subset of i is equal to the sum of the flows at any upstream node i affecting said streamflow these nodes include headwater inflow river gauges diversion and surface return flow the flow at each river gauge must be a non negative value and is calculated as follows 1 x v i b i v x i v where b i v is a vector of coefficients linking flow nodes i to river gauge nodes v for non contributing nodes the coefficients have a value of 0 while those that increase the flow take a value of 1 and those that reduce flow 1 water diversions during drought events a restriction must be applied to surface water diversion to guarantee that the available flow at each diversion node d a subset of i is greater than the diverted flow x d 2 x d i b i d x i d where b i d is a vector of coefficients linking flow nodes i to diversion nodes d the right hand side term represents the sum of all contributions to flow at diversion nodes from upstream sources headwater inflow river gauge diversion and return flow for non contributing nodes the b coefficients have a value of 0 nodes that increase the flow have a value of 1 while those that reduce the flow have a value of 1 water application water applied at each application node a a subset of i is defined as follows 3 x a d b d a x d a where b d a is a vector of coefficients linking application nodes to diversions for application nodes that withdraw water from available sources the coefficients have a value of 1 while for those that do not the coefficients have a value of 0 total water applied for irrigation in each agricultural node is defined as follows 4 x a ag j k b a j k d b d a l d j k a according to eq 4 the irrigation water applied to crops x a ag is equal to the sum over crops j and irrigation technologies k of water application per ha b a j k multiplied by the irrigated area l d j k for each crop and irrigation technology l d j k is multiplied by a binary matrix b d a to set nodes water consumption x c at each consumption node c a subset of i is an empirically determined proportion of applied water x a for irrigation water consumption is the volume of water that goes to crop evapotranspiration et whereas for urban uses it is the share of the urban water supply that is not returned through the sewer system this use which cannot have a negative value is defined as follows 5 x c a b a c x a c where b a c are coefficients denoting the share of the applied water that is consumed in each consumption node for agricultural use nodes water consumed is measured as 6 x c ag j k b c j k l c j k c according to eq 6 the irrigation water consumed x c ag is equal to the sum over crops j and irrigation technologies k of empirically estimated et per ha b c j k multiplied by the irrigated area l c j k for each crop and irrigation technology return flows x r at each return flow node r a subset of i is the proportion of the water applied x a that returns to the river system return flows are defined as follows 7 x r a b a r x a r where b a r are coefficients indicating the proportion of total water applied that is returned to the river system for agricultural nodes returns flows are defined as follows 8 x r ag j k b r j k u b d r l d j k r according to eq 8 the irrigation return flows x r ag are equal to the sum over crops j and irrigation technologies k of the empirically estimated return flows per ha b r j k multiplied by the irrigated area l d j k for each crop and irrigation technology l d j k is multiplied by a binary matrix b d r to determine the nodes water applied must equal water consumed plus water returned the hydro economic model has been calibrated by establishing a set of slack variables for each river reach such that the model replicates the real observed flows the slack variables represent unobserved inflows and outflows e g groundwater flows evaporation and returns and are calculated as the difference between the initially estimated flows and the flows measured at the gauge points by including these variables in the model the mass balance can be balanced 3 2 economic component the economic component consists of an optimisation model for agricultural value the agricultural activity of the basin has been divided into ten irrigation demand areas idas based on the irrigation zones defined by the hydrological network according to current supply infrastructure as reported by the rba chg confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2021 farmers private gross margin on crop production subject to technical and resource constraints has been specifically determined for each ida that is our decision unit in the model it is assumed that factor and product prices are constant while yield functions decrease linearly with crop area expansion see eq 15 below a perennial land fallowing penalty has been included in the objective function to quantify the possible future yield losses if farmers decide to fallow perennial land the optimisation problem is formulated as follows 9 max tgm ag d j k gm d j k ag l d j k pty where the variable to maximise tgm ag is the total gross margin generated by the agricultural sector on all irrigated areas in the basin g m d j k ag is the gross margin achieved per hectare of crop j using irrigation technology k in the diversion node d l d j k is the irrigation area of crop j using irrigation technology k in the diversion node d and pty represents a perennial land fallowing penalty indicating possible future yield losses if farmers decide to fallow perennial crop lands 10 pty d per k pt af d per k where per is the subset of j of perennial crops pt is the penalty coefficient and af d per k is the area of perennial crops fallowed in the diversion node d subject to 11 j k l d j k ag tland d d 12 x d twater d 13 l d per k l d per k is l d per k d per k eq 11 includes a land constraint where the irrigated area variable at each node d cannot be greater than the observed area at that node tland d eq 12 links the farm activity optimisation model to the hydrological component by setting an available water constraint twater d finally eq 13 prevents the area allocated to normal and survival irrigation from exceeding the observed area of each perennial crop in the baseline scenario l d per k agricultural production is represented by 55 crops while economic indicators are based on the study of costs and incomes of agricultural farms ministry of agriculture fisheries and food mapa information on crop area is taken from the statistical yearbook mapa to convert the administrative information provincial scale to hydrological idas we have relied on the official common agricultural policy crop declarations municipality scale likewise crop yield sourced from the statistical yearbook has been adapted using the common agricultural policy regionalisation plan county scale table 1 shows the sources of the main model parameters the gross margin per hectare gm d j k ag is given by eq 14 14 gm d j k ag p j y d j k c d j k where p j is the price of the crop j y d j k is the yield of crop j under irrigation technology k in node d and c d j k are the variable costs of crop j under technology k in node d positive mathematical programming is used in the calibration of the crop model to obtain the observed water and land use solution in the baseline scenario howitt 1995 the main advantage offered by pmp is its ability to produce smooth changes as a result of the implementation new drought management policies while ensuring optimised results that match observed outcomes gohar and cashman 2016 the variant of pmp proposed by dagnino and ward 2012 is employed to calibrate the model with the parameters being estimated for a linear yield function from first order gross margin maximisation conditions the yield function used 15 is a linear function with diminishing returns it follows the ricardian rent principle in which the rents that are used first are those with the highest yields and therefore the yield of a crop decreases as the scale of production increases 15 y ijk b 0 i j k b 1 i j k l d j k urban and industrial water use has been calculated using the rba database chg confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2021 and defined as a constant parameter in the model both for supply and return flows 4 drought adaptation and water policy scenarios 4 1 baseline scenario the hydro economic model is employed to analyse the adaptive capacity of the guadalquivir basin to situations of severe water scarcity the baseline scenario represents the water flows recorded in the 2015 16 hydrological year with an average rainfall of 532 mm chg confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2021 the mean annual rainfall in the basin from 1980 to 2010 is 573 mm and ranges between 260 mm and 983 mm standard deviation of 161 mm the available water has been estimated to meet a business as usual situation in which all system water demands can be met table 2 shows the baseline cultivated area total and per irrigation method water use and gross margins per basin sector in the baseline scenario under normal climatic conditions the gross margin of the whole basin amounts to 1099 m eur the total agricultural water used is 3127 hm3 and irrigated crop land covers 856 429 ha with 68 of those crops being perennial mainly olive trees the financial outcomes of agricultural activity gross margin closely align with those of water use the upper basin accounts for 20 of the irrigation water used and 19 of the gross margin of the whole basin the middle and lower basin consume 28 and 53 respectively of the irrigation water used in the basin and account for 31 and 50 of the gross margin of the basin 4 2 drought management scenarios hydrological drought occurs when stream flows and reservoir storage fall below normal levels basins with a high level of storage such as the guadalquivir basin can cope with seasonal or annual droughts thus simulation of multi year droughts could be more relevant in this type of context guadalquivir basin is currently suffering a severe drought with 5 years below average precipitation that had impacted water reserves producing drastic reduction in water supply last severe drought occurred in the period 2005 2008 when precipitation decreased by 47 5 vs average precipitation 1940 2004 resulting a reduction to irrigation quotas to 50 of their water rights espinosa tasón et al 2022 in addition climate change scenarios projected by cedex centro de estudios y experimentación de obras públicas 2012 estimate impacts in the form of an average reduction in water resources of 36 for the guadalquivir basin with an increase in the frequency of droughts as the 21st century progresses this study aims to analyse the effect of alternative management policies and the adaptative capacity of the basin to a prolonged period of severe drought therefore based on the most pessimistic forecasts of cedex centro de estudios y experimentación de obras públicas 2012 a single event of water scarcity scenario is proposed with a 40 reduction in water available in the basin compared to the baseline scenario several alternative or complementary water policy measures will be studied a quotas proportional allocation b efficiency improvement c water reallocation and d pricing water rates a management scenario is defined as a collection of measures intended to contribute to drought adaptation the four alternative management scenarios are drought management protocol dmp the application of the dmp requires that the allocation of water to urban areas higher priority use and minimum environmental flows are maintained see current dmp at www chguadalquivir es plan de sequia vigente therefore faced with a hypothetical 40 reduction in water availability agricultural water allocations should be reduced by 35 to meet urban demand and comply with environmental flow constraints in such a scenario farmers response would be to allocate water to crops that maximise their gross margins while ensuring that perennial crops receive the minimum amount of water needed to guarantee their survival survival irrigation implies a minimum annual allocation of 600 m3 ha for olive trees and a 50 reduction of the baseline application for almond orchards with a water productivity of 0 25 kg m3 moldero et al 2021 while olive trees may be managed with lower doses the income would not cover the fixed cost of irrigated orchards increased efficiency this scenario combines the proportional allocation of the dmp with institutional and farm level adaptation measures that lead to an increase in water use efficiency estimated at 5 over current levels this improvement would result in higher water use at the farm level and a decrease in return flows of 5 optimal allocation this scenario does not follow the dmp and instead assumes that the system freely allocates water resources to maximise the total gross economic value of the basin as such this scenario does not involve the proportional rationing rule of the previous two but it does maintain the efficiency improvement it thus behaves similarly to a water market without transaction costs trading water resources from low value to high value uses water pricing water pricing involves a increase in water rates although this scenario also incorporates the drought conditions and irrigation efficiency improvement in this scenario the model is free to allocate the water resources released by the price increase so as to optimise the total gross margin the rates will be set at a level that leads to a reduction in water use similar to the dmp scenario however unlike the scenario with the proportional rationing rule the decrease in water use in this case is caused by the pricing 5 results firstly we present the distribution of land among the main crop groups per scenario and the water flows at each node per scenario along with the results for irrigated land water use and gross margin followed by a detailed analysis per scenario results for the water pricing scenario refer to a water rate of 0 039 eur m3 as this is the price level that achieves the amount of water savings closest to the 35 reduction proposed in the dmp scenario table 3 shows the main results for cultivated area water consumed and gross margin obtained in the simulated scenarios the absolute figures and the percent of variation with respect to the baseline situation average year no drought are shown for each one providing a breakdown of the four sub zones into which the basin has been divided fig 4 shows the distribution of the different crops for the four simulated scenarios and the four basin zones fig 5 shows the water flows through each of the main gauges checked in the basin listing the cubic hectometres per year in each simulated scenario and the percentage variation with respect to the baseline the number in brackets for each gauge corresponds to the label in fig 1 note that the water flowing through gauge no 9 alcalá de río equals the legally established minimum environmental flow in the optimal allocation and water pricing scenarios 5 1 dmp scenario adaptation to water scarcity requires a 33 decrease in irrigated cropland area farmers can apply survival irrigation to perennial crops to protect the plantation this measure does not prevent economic losses in the current season but it does prevent future losses that may be incurred due to the loss of the initial investment in the farm survival irrigation is particularly effective in the upper part of the basin which is cultivated almost exclusively with perennial crops survival irrigation provides farmers with a solution that prevents them from losing the investment in their farms this farmer response results in 148 000 ha fig 4 of perennial crops switched to survival irrigation 76 in the upper basin perennial crop survival irrigation means that the loss of irrigated area in the upper zone is only 8 compared to around 25 in the middle areas and 35 in the lower area regarding the economic results the upper basin again suffers the greatest losses compared to the baseline situation due to the difficulty of changing crops in farms relying on perennial crops survival irrigation allows farmers to prevent future losses but not in the current year table 3 and fig 4 5 2 increased efficiency scenario in the increased efficiency scenario the quantity of water used is the same as in the dmp scenario but all the available water that is saved by the improvement of on farm water use efficiency is used by farmers to increase their gross margin in the upper basin the increase in available water allows 13 464 ha of olive and almond trees to go from survival irrigation to full irrigation resulting in a 3 increase in the gross margin obtained in the area with the same amount of water as in the dmp scenario in the middle basin this shift to full irrigation mainly extensive winter crops allows an increase of 1 4 in the gross margin with respect to the dmp scenario in the lower basin there is an increase of 9147 ha of cultivated area mainly wheat and rice with respect to the previous scenario using the same volume of water which allows an improvement of 1 in the gross margin of the area table 3 and fig 4 a consequence of the improved water use efficiency is the reduction of the water flows due to reduced return flows to the system there is a 3 reduction in the average water flow in the representative gauges in the basin compared to the dmp scenario nevertheless fig 5 shows how in both scenarios average water flows at control points gauges remain above the minimum legal level 295 above the environmental flow on average 5 3 optimal allocation scenario the optimal allocation scenario removes the proportional allocation followed in the previous scenarios and allows the model to allocate the available resources to maximise the total basin gross margin this simulation allocates 22 more water to the upper basin thereby increasing the gross margin by 22 m eur with respect to the increased efficiency scenario in this area as a consequence there is a decrease of 9200 ha of irrigated area in the lower basin mainly cereals and winter crops wheat oat corn and sunflower 5 lower than the increased efficiency scenario this shows that when the model optimises water use it allocates more water to the upper part of the basin to maximise the number of crops returned to full irrigation after using survival irrigation a total of 59 618 ha of olive and almond trees return to full irrigation in this scenario the improvement in gross margin achieved in the upper basin is partly offset by the loss of 7 m eur of gross margin in the lower basin table 3 and fig 4 this management option allocates more water to the idas whose irrigation methods are more efficient thereby reducing irrigation return flows and resulting in an 8 average reduction in river flow with respect to the increased efficiency scenario fig 5 fig 6 shows a gross margin sensitivity analysis under the optimal allocation scenario to stepwise environmental flow reductions in the alcalá del río gauge reductions in the environmental flow result in increments in the gross margin of the basin the gross margin can be increased by up to 16 8 m eur if the environmental flow is reduced to zero this implies a shift in water use from the rice cultivating zone in lower basin with a marginal water productivity of 0 06 m3 to middle and upper basin which have higher productivities however this short term adjustment would be different in the long term if an increase in the most efficient crops were allowed in upstream areas 5 4 water pricing scenario if the rba decided to use water pricing as an instrument to encourage water savings a solution favoured by some academics and environmental groups a rate of 0 039 eur m3 would be necessary to achieve an amount of water savings like the 35 proposed in the dmp scenario the use of water pricing affects farmers income who suffer a gross margin loss of 12 vs baseline higher water pricing impacts low value crops e g rice cotton maize while perennials and horticultural crops can accommodate a rise in water rates due to their high gross margin per hectare the total revenue obtained by the authorities for water supply volume of water used multiplied by price is lower than the gross margin loss resulting from the abandonment of cultivated land in the sector a water tariff of 0 039 m3 generates revenues of 79 m eur while farmers gross margin decreases 134 m eur thereby resulting in an overall welfare loss in this scenario there is a 11 average reduction in water flows with respect to the dmp scenario fig 5 in terms of gauge measures this scenario is like that of optimal allocation water resources are allocated to the farms with the highest water use productivity and water use efficiency perennials drip irrigated crops reducing return flows to the basin all policies simulated in the scenarios satisfy the minimum environmental flow constraints established by the rba for the gauges of the main regulation facilities chg confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2021 the gauge at the alcalá del río dam last gauge before the estuary is binding all the system with 227 hm3 y under the optimal allocation and water pricing scenarios the environmental constraint of the last river gauge prevents the allocation of more water resources to higher value crops upstream and ensures that part of the rice low value crop is kept under cultivation since this is compatible with the minimum flow in transitional waters from alcalá del río gauge to the ocean 6 discussion the hydro economic model presented here provides insight into water scarce overallocated closed basins which have little room for manoeuvre in terms of policy measures to cope with a drought event results of this analysis show that increasing water use efficiency implies a reduction in return flows that should be accounted for when designing water saving policies the impact of market based water reallocation optimal allocation would have territorial effects as water moves from commodity production regions to more competitive areas meaning higher value crops capture more resources than commodities and low value crops another conclusion that emerges from our model is the impact of recent crop transformations characterised by an increase in perennials and high value crops e g olive almonds citrus at the expense of herbaceous commodity crops e g cotton maize which results in an agricultural system that is highly vulnerable to drought and offers little flexibility when it comes to policy options these are general conclusions that go beyond our specific case study indeed a similar result is reported by mall and herman 2019 our model is used to test some policy alternatives scenarios for reducing economic losses during droughts a feature they all have in common is that the minimum environmental flow constraint is binding meaning that environmental flow constraints are impacting farmers income this can be observed in fig 5 where the alternatives involving the free reallocation of water rights optimal allocation and water pricing scenarios are bounded by the minimum flow constraint at the alcalá del río gauge which puts limits on the reallocation of water to economic uses upstream the alcalá del río gauge is the last one before the estuary and the 80 km from this gauge to the sea requires a minimum flow to maintain low salinity and good environmental conditions as stated above in the last two scenarios the environmental flow constraint in alcalá del río limits the transfer from low value crops rice to higher value crops in middle and upper regions relaxing this environmental flow constraint in the short term would lead to increases in the gross margin of up to 16 8 m eur rightnar and dinar 2020 apply financial bankruptcy rules to water allocation in the case of scarcity and find that proportional allocation is less conducive to regional welfare although it presents a more politically feasible and robust option these bankruptcy rules are also described in the study of gómez limón et al 2020 which shows that other symmetric allocation methods other that proportional allocation such as the equal gains method also called uniform gains method or the equal loses method can improve water allocation without the need for asymmetric methods that rely on some form of priority allocation the water pricing scenario has a greater impact on the gross margin 82 compared to the baseline scenario than other scenarios based on quotas dmp and increased efficiency with 93 and 94 compared to the baseline scenario respectively this feeds into the long standing debate on quotas vs pricing instruments molle 2009 parrado et al 2020 in spain drought management protocol measures are linked to different stages of drought indicators pre alert alert and emergency the results of the model show that policies based on water pricing would be more advisable during the pre alert and alert periods applied as a proactive approach to drought management applying price increases at the stage of a drought when users are already affected by water scarcity has no effect due to the low demand elasticity of deficit irrigated crops in the context explained in expósito and berbel 2016 it should also be mentioned that most of the basin is irrigated using pressurised networks meaning energy is an important cost component this context is consistent with the evolution observed at spanish national level espinosa tasón et al 2020 describing an increase of energy consumption for irrigation from 0 03 kwh m3 1960 to 0 17 kwh m3 2017 explained by the energy consumption linked to modernization where energy cost accounts for 30 50 of total operating costs in water user associations berbel et al 2019 the behavioural impact of this component is relevant as the energy cost is linked directly to volumetric water consumption and can therefore lead to water saving behaviour compared with pre modernisation where water rates were applied per hectare with no volumetric component pronti and berbel 2023 our model assumes that volumetric pricing is applied in most of the basin this affects water demand as the flat rate per area basis has no direct impact on savings pronti and berbel 2023 optimal allocation and water pricing policies entail a shift in water rights away from historical holders commodities to the most dynamic perennial farming entrepreneurs this is illustrated by the fact that the upper region maintains 83 82 of water use while lower regions only use 57 55 compared to the baseline scenario fig 4 the water saving in the lower basin is mainly due to the partial halt in rice cultivation while other crops in the lower basin perennials vegetables are maintained according to our model simulations responses to future water scarcity may require flexibility and reallocation the transfer of water rights between regions can either be carried out by buying back water rights to compensate farmers who stop irrigating or it can be facilitated by trading water rights as in the australian market system the spanish legislative framework may present a barrier to the implementation of an extensive market berbel and esteban 2019 palomo hierro et al 2022 water trading has been shown to provide an effective tool for positive water allocation outcomes at both the level of the individual user and at the social and environmental levels grafton and wheeler 2018 nauges et al 2016 implementing water trading without the full implementation of the necessary laws institutional capacity and administrative systems in this basin will only increase transaction costs moreover it will fuel scepticism regarding the benefits of the market system one way to lower transaction costs and boost water transactions involves the establishment of a water bank acting as an intermediary between buyers and sellers regardless of whether those transfers are temporary annual water allocation or permanent water rights montilla lópez et al 2018 in cases where environmental flows are not met water banks can also act by buying back temporary or permanent rights from agriculture gutiérrez martín et al 2020 there is no work on previous hydro economic modelling in the guadalquivir basin at the basin scale reca et al 2001a and reca et al 2001b develop a hydro economic model for the bembezar irrigation district and hervás gámez and delgado ramos 2020 for the genil subbasin focusing mainly on the optimal irrigation quantities for crops and the supply capacity of the network in different climatic and economic scenarios our results are consistent with the findings of several previous hydro economic analyses applied to mediterranean river basins baccour et al 2021 escriva bou et al 2017 frija et al 2021 gohar et al 2021 kahil et al 2015 indicating that a combination of water trading and irrigation efficiency improvements could help improve the sustainability of water use in those river basins however the level of efficiency of those policy interventions varies across the different studies and depends on the characteristics of the basin including socio economic conditions crop mix spatial distribution of uses sources of water and infrastructure for the guadalquivir basin our results show that water trading could potentially constitute a valuable instrument for adaptation to water scarcity given the importance of perennial crops in the upstream area of the basin and the possibility of reallocating water from annual to perennial crops regarding the methodology applied it should be noted that other pmp techniques can also be used for the calibration and simulation of the economic component the advantage of the dagnino and ward 2012 approach is that it skips the first stage of calibration meaning there are no marginal crops that lack a shadow price however this methodology does not allow the addition of crops that were not observed in the reference year even if they have no quadratic component in the yield function if new crop alternatives are to be added the standard approximation of howitt 1995 can be used our methodology includes a penalty for future yield losses due to the fallowing of land dedicated to irrigated perennial crops connor et al 2009 performed a similar analysis by modelling the response of crop yields to water in the lower murray darling basin in australia 7 concluding remarks this work has added to the body of knowledge on the water resource management of the guadalquivir basin which is representative of mediterranean systems and constitutes one of the most important water basins in southern europe the study has involved analysing the availability of water and the capacity of the various agricultural activities in the guadalquivir basin to adapt to a severe drought situation to that end a hydro economic model has been developed to conduct an integrated analysis of different water allocation policies in the basin the results indicate that the economic uses agriculture are highly vulnerable to a reduction in the basin s water resources the fact that agricultural activity in the basin is largely based on perennial crops such as olive almond and citrus limits the capacity to deal with water scarcity and droughts this reliance on perennial crops makes it harder to adapt the system to drought which requires flexible management mechanisms to optimise the use of the water consumed perennials trees account for more than 80 of the cultivated area in the upper basin which makes agriculture highly inflexible and does not respond well to proportional allocation management scenarios based on historical water rights as proposed by the current dmp the optimal allocation scenario assigns more water resources to the upper basin where activity is overwhelmingly based on perennial crops thereby preventing future losses caused by the abandonment of this type of crop and consequent loss of the initial investment the transfer of rights between farmers and between locations can be carried out either with the support of market instruments that compensate herbaceous crop farmers for their losses or by using economic compensatory measures nevertheless it is not only the question of economic efficiency that should be considered but also that of social equity to attain a fair distribution of water rights the model has been used for the analysis of different water policies in an arid and semiarid basin in southern spain the guadalquivir basin is a good case to study policies related to water scarcity and drought impacts this is a common situation in many arid and semi arid basins around the world the hydro economic model proposed here can be used in any basin in the world to help decision makers address problems related to water scarcity we have tried to build a simplified digital twin of the complex guadalquivir river basin by developing a hydro economic model for a single drought event it enables the assessment of water management policies in simulated scenarios is user friendly includes economic instruments to analyse water demand and the option of deficit irrigation in perennial crops on the other hand reservoir stocks have not been included the time scale is annual and multiannual simulations are not available yet future research should incorporate a more complex hydrological model that includes an interannual and seasonal analysis studying the effect of drought across different months of the year and the buffering effect of reservoir storage use of non conventional water sources and other uses of water and jointly consider quantity and quality

7700,study region the guadalquivir basin in spain as a representative mediterranean basin study focus the aim of this study is to assess the adaptive capacity of mediterranean basins to long periods of severe drought to do so a hydro economic model has been developed that includes a spatial representation of the major economic uses of water and enables an analysis of the economic and environmental effects of alternative water management policies under a single event of water scarcity new hydrological insights for the region results highlight the trade offs among economic uses of water and environmental flow requirements since water resources in the guadalquivir are fully allocated moreover the increase of irrigated perennial crops area will aggravate vulnerability to drought by limiting the adaptive capacity of the basin survival irrigation is the first option for farmers to adapt to the simulated extreme drought 148 000 ha are shifted from normal irrigation to survival irrigation in the drought management protocol scenario these findings call for policy interventions to ensure greater management flexibility toward optimising water use while meeting environmental goals for instance enabling water trading among farmers would reallocate 22 more water to the upper basin reducing drought losses by 22 m eur the hydro economic model developed here can be adapted to basins elsewhere and the results show that it can be a useful tool to guide the design of efficient water management policies to address severe droughts in water stressed basins graphical abstract ga1 keywords hydro economic model water policy drought management drought mediterranean data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction structural water scarcity is common to all mediterranean river basins despite the uncertainty surrounding the impact of climate change on the frequency and intensity of droughts many researchers predict an increase in drought frequency intensity and duration due to rising global temperatures liu et al 2018 according to the european environment agency 2019 the consequences of climate change a temperature rise of 1 5 2 c is likely to increase drought risks in mediterranean europe this expected decrease in available water resources coupled with growing water use for economic and social activities could lead to more problems regarding water management these problems may result in social conflict if water resources need to be reallocated from historical uses e g irrigation to new societal preferences e g environmental or industrial uses the overexploitation of water resources has been identified as an outcome of the so called basin closure path molle et al 2010 a process that has been described for guadalquivir expósito and berbel 2019 in such cases demand continues to grow beyond the capacity to increase supply and generates a situation of overexploitation and overallocation of resources sustainable management of water resources requires scientific knowledge and sufficient relevant information to establish policies that balance the different uses of water various international institutions have called for the introduction of mechanisms that enable a more efficient allocation of water resources european commission 2019 gruère and boëdec 2019 oecd 2015 miteco ministerio para la transición ecológica y el reto demográfico 2020 underlines the need in spain for a more flexible allocation of rights that is better adapted both to the long term demands of society and to episodes of cyclical shortages e g frequent episodes of drought hydro economic models provide useful analytical tools for assessing the effectiveness of water resources management at basin level the advantage of hydro economic modelling is that it integrates the agronomic hydrological environmental and economic components of a water resource system which enables a more comprehensive evaluation of water policy options expósito et al 2020 and means it is well suited for the assessment of management and policy strategies for the adaptation to climate change arias montevechio et al 2023 harou et al 2009 ortiz et al 2023 sapino et al 2022 ward 2021 this integrated view allows a more realistic approach to resource allocation bekchanov et al 2017 eamen et al 2022 medellín azuara et al 2010 vichete et al 2023 pérez blanco et al 2022 show how the integration of hydro micro macro economic models can provide essential information in the efficient design of agricultural water policies many studies have addressed the issue of adaptation of irrigated agriculture to the impacts of drought farm level measures can contribute to this adaptation leclère et al 2013 reidsma et al 2010 ricart et al 2019 ward 2022 one of the key measures promoted by water authorities in recent years is the modernisation of agriculture improving water use efficiency both at the plot level and the overall irrigation system infrastructure this measure is a critical factor for rural development since it enhances high value cropping patterns and crop yields leading to an increase in the profitability of the irrigation water used pérez blanco et al 2020 however several studies call for a reconsideration of current water policies and the implementation of new institutional measures bhaduri et al 2021 hervás gámez and delgado ramos 2019 in the european union eu the water framework directive wfd calls for the use of economic instruments to manage water resources and achieve the good environmental status of water bodies in the eu member states european commission 2000 the wfd highlights the relevance of estimating the economic value of water uses the cost of associated water services and the level of cost recovery the wfd also encourages the use of water pricing as a tool to achieve efficient water use although some authors question the effectiveness of water pricing in water scarce basins berbel and expósito 2020 nevertheless there are other economic tools that could help mitigate the economic impact of droughts such as water markets the pros and cons of which have been extensively analysed in the literature bajaj et al 2022 montilla lópez et al 2016 palomo hierro et al 2015 however the studies conducted to date have tended to focus on small spatial areas and or specific uses without considering the relationship between uses and water flows at the basin level to our knowledge there is a lack of models that integrate both river water flows and agents behaviour while specifically analysing the effects on water use of farms and agricultural infrastructure modernisation water pricing policies and water markets at river basin scale where available water resources are already fully allocated this study aims to help fill this gap by analysing the economic and environmental impacts of droughts and water scarcity in the guadalquivir basin through an examination of alternative water allocation policies to this end a basin scale hydro economic model incorporating the main water uses has been developed reflecting the mutual relationships between social agents and the natural system the model can capture the response of the system to various management policies when faced with a severe long lasting drought with ongoing massive investment in perennial crops upstream another new development explored in this study is the widespread use of deficit irrigation which impacts resilience and vulnerability to droughts this study contributes to the literature by providing a detailed assessment of water allocation at the river basin level through hydro economic modelling the study not only analyses how to achieve a more sustainable management of the guadalquivir river basin but also adds to the scientific debate on policies and measures for sustainable water management worldwide a common response to closure and scarcity is modernisation investment in water saving measures which has opened an academic debate on the rebound effect of such measures some authors claim the rebound effect is inevitable perry and steduto 2017 while others defend the possibility of preventive actions berbel and mateos 2014 previous hydrological models of the guadalquivir basin only include subbasins hervás gámez and delgado ramos 2020 or specific irrigation districts reca et al 2001a 2001b or assume a fixed agricultural water demand as in aquatool model chg confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2021 our contribution in the case study is the use of positive mathematical programming pmp to simulate water demand at basin level this allows simulating the response of the agricultural sector to different situations of water availability or to different water policies this paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the guadalquivir basin section 3 explains the development of the hydro economic model of the guadalquivir basin section 4 introduces the simulated scenarios the results obtained are presented in section 5 finally section 6 outlines the main conclusions 2 case study area the guadalquivir basin the guadalquivir basin in southwestern europe has a surface area of 57 527 km2 and supports the economic activities of a population of more than 4 2 million people living in 476 municipalities fig 1 the guadalquivir basin has several particular features that make it an interesting basin for modelling water resources and analysing water management policies which can be applied to other semi arid areas with a mediterranean climate structural water scarcity espinosa tasón et al 2020 recurrent and severe droughts limited opportunities for increasing water supply widespread use of deficit irrigation use of water trading instruments palomo hierro et al 2015 and the relevance of guadalquivir basin as one of the main irrigated areas 25 of spain and orchards of europe the renewable resources available exceed 7000 hm3 year water abstractions total 3830 hm3 year of which 2903 hm3 comes from surface water and 927 hm3 from groundwater chg confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2021 these abstractions exceed 50 of renewable resources and agriculture is the largest user of water accounting for 87 of the water rights in the basin the river basin authority rba confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir is responsible for water management in the basin rainfall variability in the basin is high and hence the allocation of water to users is not fully guaranteed each farmer receives an amount of water allocated by the rba as an administrative concession or as water rights the water rights depend on the crop and location ranging from 1500 m3 ha year for olive groves to 10 450 m3 ha year for rice however farmers in the guadalquivir basin only receive their full allocation of water rights around 80 85 of the years the average water allocation during the drought in the period 2005 2008 was approximately 50 of the granted administrative water rights after this period there was a return to normality from 2008 to 2020 until the 2020 21 season when another drought protocol came into effect with a 50 reduction and further reduction to 20 for 2021 22 the location of crops follows a certain geographical distribution i in the upper basin irrigated olive trees occupy 98 of the irrigated area and are virtually a monocrop accounting for more than 85 of the total cultivated area in these zones ii herbaceous crops are more prevalent in the areas close to the guadalquivir estuary where olive groves become less predominant due to climatic reasons giving way to other crops such as rice 12 of the total cultivated area or extensive winter crops such as wheat sunflower and cotton 43 with perennial crops accounting for only 38 of the total cultivated area iii between both extremes there is a transition of crops in the middle basin left and right bank see fig 1 in terms of water use efficiency over the last 20 years the basin has undergone a technological transformation with traditional production systems being replaced by more intense systems based on efficient irrigation techniques encouraging an increase in perennial crops cultivation drip irrigation is the irrigation system in 78 of the cultivated area in the basin with this figure reaching 92 in the upper basin area see fig 1 moving further down the basin drip technology is gradually replaced by sprinkler technology to the point where it covers 61 of the cultivated area in the lower basin with the greatest use of flood irrigation found on rice farms 3 the hydro economic model the hydro economic model is used to evaluate drought scenarios and adaptation measures it combines two components hydrological and economic fig 2 shows the outline of the hydro economic modelling process 3 1 hydrological component the hydrological component is a reduced form hydrological model of the guadalquivir basin it has been calibrated with the observed flows applying the hydrological principles of mass balance and continuity of river flow based on the model developed by kahil et al 2016 2018 the model used in this study depicts a network of nodes and links with nodes representing the water supply and demand units in the basin and links indicating the flow relationships between them balances are defined for each flow i with the main flow variables in the model x i being headwater inflows abstractions return flows losses and flows measured at selected gauge points in the basin the information fed into the model is provided by the rba chg confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2021 2022 and is used to replicate the flow rates at each node and the spatial distribution of the available water between the different units fig 3 the headwater inflows are calculated as the total annual flows measured at the different headwater gauges with the inflows x h at each headwater gauge h a subset of i being equal to the total source supply the streamflow x v at each river gauge v a subset of i is equal to the sum of the flows at any upstream node i affecting said streamflow these nodes include headwater inflow river gauges diversion and surface return flow the flow at each river gauge must be a non negative value and is calculated as follows 1 x v i b i v x i v where b i v is a vector of coefficients linking flow nodes i to river gauge nodes v for non contributing nodes the coefficients have a value of 0 while those that increase the flow take a value of 1 and those that reduce flow 1 water diversions during drought events a restriction must be applied to surface water diversion to guarantee that the available flow at each diversion node d a subset of i is greater than the diverted flow x d 2 x d i b i d x i d where b i d is a vector of coefficients linking flow nodes i to diversion nodes d the right hand side term represents the sum of all contributions to flow at diversion nodes from upstream sources headwater inflow river gauge diversion and return flow for non contributing nodes the b coefficients have a value of 0 nodes that increase the flow have a value of 1 while those that reduce the flow have a value of 1 water application water applied at each application node a a subset of i is defined as follows 3 x a d b d a x d a where b d a is a vector of coefficients linking application nodes to diversions for application nodes that withdraw water from available sources the coefficients have a value of 1 while for those that do not the coefficients have a value of 0 total water applied for irrigation in each agricultural node is defined as follows 4 x a ag j k b a j k d b d a l d j k a according to eq 4 the irrigation water applied to crops x a ag is equal to the sum over crops j and irrigation technologies k of water application per ha b a j k multiplied by the irrigated area l d j k for each crop and irrigation technology l d j k is multiplied by a binary matrix b d a to set nodes water consumption x c at each consumption node c a subset of i is an empirically determined proportion of applied water x a for irrigation water consumption is the volume of water that goes to crop evapotranspiration et whereas for urban uses it is the share of the urban water supply that is not returned through the sewer system this use which cannot have a negative value is defined as follows 5 x c a b a c x a c where b a c are coefficients denoting the share of the applied water that is consumed in each consumption node for agricultural use nodes water consumed is measured as 6 x c ag j k b c j k l c j k c according to eq 6 the irrigation water consumed x c ag is equal to the sum over crops j and irrigation technologies k of empirically estimated et per ha b c j k multiplied by the irrigated area l c j k for each crop and irrigation technology return flows x r at each return flow node r a subset of i is the proportion of the water applied x a that returns to the river system return flows are defined as follows 7 x r a b a r x a r where b a r are coefficients indicating the proportion of total water applied that is returned to the river system for agricultural nodes returns flows are defined as follows 8 x r ag j k b r j k u b d r l d j k r according to eq 8 the irrigation return flows x r ag are equal to the sum over crops j and irrigation technologies k of the empirically estimated return flows per ha b r j k multiplied by the irrigated area l d j k for each crop and irrigation technology l d j k is multiplied by a binary matrix b d r to determine the nodes water applied must equal water consumed plus water returned the hydro economic model has been calibrated by establishing a set of slack variables for each river reach such that the model replicates the real observed flows the slack variables represent unobserved inflows and outflows e g groundwater flows evaporation and returns and are calculated as the difference between the initially estimated flows and the flows measured at the gauge points by including these variables in the model the mass balance can be balanced 3 2 economic component the economic component consists of an optimisation model for agricultural value the agricultural activity of the basin has been divided into ten irrigation demand areas idas based on the irrigation zones defined by the hydrological network according to current supply infrastructure as reported by the rba chg confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2021 farmers private gross margin on crop production subject to technical and resource constraints has been specifically determined for each ida that is our decision unit in the model it is assumed that factor and product prices are constant while yield functions decrease linearly with crop area expansion see eq 15 below a perennial land fallowing penalty has been included in the objective function to quantify the possible future yield losses if farmers decide to fallow perennial land the optimisation problem is formulated as follows 9 max tgm ag d j k gm d j k ag l d j k pty where the variable to maximise tgm ag is the total gross margin generated by the agricultural sector on all irrigated areas in the basin g m d j k ag is the gross margin achieved per hectare of crop j using irrigation technology k in the diversion node d l d j k is the irrigation area of crop j using irrigation technology k in the diversion node d and pty represents a perennial land fallowing penalty indicating possible future yield losses if farmers decide to fallow perennial crop lands 10 pty d per k pt af d per k where per is the subset of j of perennial crops pt is the penalty coefficient and af d per k is the area of perennial crops fallowed in the diversion node d subject to 11 j k l d j k ag tland d d 12 x d twater d 13 l d per k l d per k is l d per k d per k eq 11 includes a land constraint where the irrigated area variable at each node d cannot be greater than the observed area at that node tland d eq 12 links the farm activity optimisation model to the hydrological component by setting an available water constraint twater d finally eq 13 prevents the area allocated to normal and survival irrigation from exceeding the observed area of each perennial crop in the baseline scenario l d per k agricultural production is represented by 55 crops while economic indicators are based on the study of costs and incomes of agricultural farms ministry of agriculture fisheries and food mapa information on crop area is taken from the statistical yearbook mapa to convert the administrative information provincial scale to hydrological idas we have relied on the official common agricultural policy crop declarations municipality scale likewise crop yield sourced from the statistical yearbook has been adapted using the common agricultural policy regionalisation plan county scale table 1 shows the sources of the main model parameters the gross margin per hectare gm d j k ag is given by eq 14 14 gm d j k ag p j y d j k c d j k where p j is the price of the crop j y d j k is the yield of crop j under irrigation technology k in node d and c d j k are the variable costs of crop j under technology k in node d positive mathematical programming is used in the calibration of the crop model to obtain the observed water and land use solution in the baseline scenario howitt 1995 the main advantage offered by pmp is its ability to produce smooth changes as a result of the implementation new drought management policies while ensuring optimised results that match observed outcomes gohar and cashman 2016 the variant of pmp proposed by dagnino and ward 2012 is employed to calibrate the model with the parameters being estimated for a linear yield function from first order gross margin maximisation conditions the yield function used 15 is a linear function with diminishing returns it follows the ricardian rent principle in which the rents that are used first are those with the highest yields and therefore the yield of a crop decreases as the scale of production increases 15 y ijk b 0 i j k b 1 i j k l d j k urban and industrial water use has been calculated using the rba database chg confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2021 and defined as a constant parameter in the model both for supply and return flows 4 drought adaptation and water policy scenarios 4 1 baseline scenario the hydro economic model is employed to analyse the adaptive capacity of the guadalquivir basin to situations of severe water scarcity the baseline scenario represents the water flows recorded in the 2015 16 hydrological year with an average rainfall of 532 mm chg confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2021 the mean annual rainfall in the basin from 1980 to 2010 is 573 mm and ranges between 260 mm and 983 mm standard deviation of 161 mm the available water has been estimated to meet a business as usual situation in which all system water demands can be met table 2 shows the baseline cultivated area total and per irrigation method water use and gross margins per basin sector in the baseline scenario under normal climatic conditions the gross margin of the whole basin amounts to 1099 m eur the total agricultural water used is 3127 hm3 and irrigated crop land covers 856 429 ha with 68 of those crops being perennial mainly olive trees the financial outcomes of agricultural activity gross margin closely align with those of water use the upper basin accounts for 20 of the irrigation water used and 19 of the gross margin of the whole basin the middle and lower basin consume 28 and 53 respectively of the irrigation water used in the basin and account for 31 and 50 of the gross margin of the basin 4 2 drought management scenarios hydrological drought occurs when stream flows and reservoir storage fall below normal levels basins with a high level of storage such as the guadalquivir basin can cope with seasonal or annual droughts thus simulation of multi year droughts could be more relevant in this type of context guadalquivir basin is currently suffering a severe drought with 5 years below average precipitation that had impacted water reserves producing drastic reduction in water supply last severe drought occurred in the period 2005 2008 when precipitation decreased by 47 5 vs average precipitation 1940 2004 resulting a reduction to irrigation quotas to 50 of their water rights espinosa tasón et al 2022 in addition climate change scenarios projected by cedex centro de estudios y experimentación de obras públicas 2012 estimate impacts in the form of an average reduction in water resources of 36 for the guadalquivir basin with an increase in the frequency of droughts as the 21st century progresses this study aims to analyse the effect of alternative management policies and the adaptative capacity of the basin to a prolonged period of severe drought therefore based on the most pessimistic forecasts of cedex centro de estudios y experimentación de obras públicas 2012 a single event of water scarcity scenario is proposed with a 40 reduction in water available in the basin compared to the baseline scenario several alternative or complementary water policy measures will be studied a quotas proportional allocation b efficiency improvement c water reallocation and d pricing water rates a management scenario is defined as a collection of measures intended to contribute to drought adaptation the four alternative management scenarios are drought management protocol dmp the application of the dmp requires that the allocation of water to urban areas higher priority use and minimum environmental flows are maintained see current dmp at www chguadalquivir es plan de sequia vigente therefore faced with a hypothetical 40 reduction in water availability agricultural water allocations should be reduced by 35 to meet urban demand and comply with environmental flow constraints in such a scenario farmers response would be to allocate water to crops that maximise their gross margins while ensuring that perennial crops receive the minimum amount of water needed to guarantee their survival survival irrigation implies a minimum annual allocation of 600 m3 ha for olive trees and a 50 reduction of the baseline application for almond orchards with a water productivity of 0 25 kg m3 moldero et al 2021 while olive trees may be managed with lower doses the income would not cover the fixed cost of irrigated orchards increased efficiency this scenario combines the proportional allocation of the dmp with institutional and farm level adaptation measures that lead to an increase in water use efficiency estimated at 5 over current levels this improvement would result in higher water use at the farm level and a decrease in return flows of 5 optimal allocation this scenario does not follow the dmp and instead assumes that the system freely allocates water resources to maximise the total gross economic value of the basin as such this scenario does not involve the proportional rationing rule of the previous two but it does maintain the efficiency improvement it thus behaves similarly to a water market without transaction costs trading water resources from low value to high value uses water pricing water pricing involves a increase in water rates although this scenario also incorporates the drought conditions and irrigation efficiency improvement in this scenario the model is free to allocate the water resources released by the price increase so as to optimise the total gross margin the rates will be set at a level that leads to a reduction in water use similar to the dmp scenario however unlike the scenario with the proportional rationing rule the decrease in water use in this case is caused by the pricing 5 results firstly we present the distribution of land among the main crop groups per scenario and the water flows at each node per scenario along with the results for irrigated land water use and gross margin followed by a detailed analysis per scenario results for the water pricing scenario refer to a water rate of 0 039 eur m3 as this is the price level that achieves the amount of water savings closest to the 35 reduction proposed in the dmp scenario table 3 shows the main results for cultivated area water consumed and gross margin obtained in the simulated scenarios the absolute figures and the percent of variation with respect to the baseline situation average year no drought are shown for each one providing a breakdown of the four sub zones into which the basin has been divided fig 4 shows the distribution of the different crops for the four simulated scenarios and the four basin zones fig 5 shows the water flows through each of the main gauges checked in the basin listing the cubic hectometres per year in each simulated scenario and the percentage variation with respect to the baseline the number in brackets for each gauge corresponds to the label in fig 1 note that the water flowing through gauge no 9 alcalá de río equals the legally established minimum environmental flow in the optimal allocation and water pricing scenarios 5 1 dmp scenario adaptation to water scarcity requires a 33 decrease in irrigated cropland area farmers can apply survival irrigation to perennial crops to protect the plantation this measure does not prevent economic losses in the current season but it does prevent future losses that may be incurred due to the loss of the initial investment in the farm survival irrigation is particularly effective in the upper part of the basin which is cultivated almost exclusively with perennial crops survival irrigation provides farmers with a solution that prevents them from losing the investment in their farms this farmer response results in 148 000 ha fig 4 of perennial crops switched to survival irrigation 76 in the upper basin perennial crop survival irrigation means that the loss of irrigated area in the upper zone is only 8 compared to around 25 in the middle areas and 35 in the lower area regarding the economic results the upper basin again suffers the greatest losses compared to the baseline situation due to the difficulty of changing crops in farms relying on perennial crops survival irrigation allows farmers to prevent future losses but not in the current year table 3 and fig 4 5 2 increased efficiency scenario in the increased efficiency scenario the quantity of water used is the same as in the dmp scenario but all the available water that is saved by the improvement of on farm water use efficiency is used by farmers to increase their gross margin in the upper basin the increase in available water allows 13 464 ha of olive and almond trees to go from survival irrigation to full irrigation resulting in a 3 increase in the gross margin obtained in the area with the same amount of water as in the dmp scenario in the middle basin this shift to full irrigation mainly extensive winter crops allows an increase of 1 4 in the gross margin with respect to the dmp scenario in the lower basin there is an increase of 9147 ha of cultivated area mainly wheat and rice with respect to the previous scenario using the same volume of water which allows an improvement of 1 in the gross margin of the area table 3 and fig 4 a consequence of the improved water use efficiency is the reduction of the water flows due to reduced return flows to the system there is a 3 reduction in the average water flow in the representative gauges in the basin compared to the dmp scenario nevertheless fig 5 shows how in both scenarios average water flows at control points gauges remain above the minimum legal level 295 above the environmental flow on average 5 3 optimal allocation scenario the optimal allocation scenario removes the proportional allocation followed in the previous scenarios and allows the model to allocate the available resources to maximise the total basin gross margin this simulation allocates 22 more water to the upper basin thereby increasing the gross margin by 22 m eur with respect to the increased efficiency scenario in this area as a consequence there is a decrease of 9200 ha of irrigated area in the lower basin mainly cereals and winter crops wheat oat corn and sunflower 5 lower than the increased efficiency scenario this shows that when the model optimises water use it allocates more water to the upper part of the basin to maximise the number of crops returned to full irrigation after using survival irrigation a total of 59 618 ha of olive and almond trees return to full irrigation in this scenario the improvement in gross margin achieved in the upper basin is partly offset by the loss of 7 m eur of gross margin in the lower basin table 3 and fig 4 this management option allocates more water to the idas whose irrigation methods are more efficient thereby reducing irrigation return flows and resulting in an 8 average reduction in river flow with respect to the increased efficiency scenario fig 5 fig 6 shows a gross margin sensitivity analysis under the optimal allocation scenario to stepwise environmental flow reductions in the alcalá del río gauge reductions in the environmental flow result in increments in the gross margin of the basin the gross margin can be increased by up to 16 8 m eur if the environmental flow is reduced to zero this implies a shift in water use from the rice cultivating zone in lower basin with a marginal water productivity of 0 06 m3 to middle and upper basin which have higher productivities however this short term adjustment would be different in the long term if an increase in the most efficient crops were allowed in upstream areas 5 4 water pricing scenario if the rba decided to use water pricing as an instrument to encourage water savings a solution favoured by some academics and environmental groups a rate of 0 039 eur m3 would be necessary to achieve an amount of water savings like the 35 proposed in the dmp scenario the use of water pricing affects farmers income who suffer a gross margin loss of 12 vs baseline higher water pricing impacts low value crops e g rice cotton maize while perennials and horticultural crops can accommodate a rise in water rates due to their high gross margin per hectare the total revenue obtained by the authorities for water supply volume of water used multiplied by price is lower than the gross margin loss resulting from the abandonment of cultivated land in the sector a water tariff of 0 039 m3 generates revenues of 79 m eur while farmers gross margin decreases 134 m eur thereby resulting in an overall welfare loss in this scenario there is a 11 average reduction in water flows with respect to the dmp scenario fig 5 in terms of gauge measures this scenario is like that of optimal allocation water resources are allocated to the farms with the highest water use productivity and water use efficiency perennials drip irrigated crops reducing return flows to the basin all policies simulated in the scenarios satisfy the minimum environmental flow constraints established by the rba for the gauges of the main regulation facilities chg confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2021 the gauge at the alcalá del río dam last gauge before the estuary is binding all the system with 227 hm3 y under the optimal allocation and water pricing scenarios the environmental constraint of the last river gauge prevents the allocation of more water resources to higher value crops upstream and ensures that part of the rice low value crop is kept under cultivation since this is compatible with the minimum flow in transitional waters from alcalá del río gauge to the ocean 6 discussion the hydro economic model presented here provides insight into water scarce overallocated closed basins which have little room for manoeuvre in terms of policy measures to cope with a drought event results of this analysis show that increasing water use efficiency implies a reduction in return flows that should be accounted for when designing water saving policies the impact of market based water reallocation optimal allocation would have territorial effects as water moves from commodity production regions to more competitive areas meaning higher value crops capture more resources than commodities and low value crops another conclusion that emerges from our model is the impact of recent crop transformations characterised by an increase in perennials and high value crops e g olive almonds citrus at the expense of herbaceous commodity crops e g cotton maize which results in an agricultural system that is highly vulnerable to drought and offers little flexibility when it comes to policy options these are general conclusions that go beyond our specific case study indeed a similar result is reported by mall and herman 2019 our model is used to test some policy alternatives scenarios for reducing economic losses during droughts a feature they all have in common is that the minimum environmental flow constraint is binding meaning that environmental flow constraints are impacting farmers income this can be observed in fig 5 where the alternatives involving the free reallocation of water rights optimal allocation and water pricing scenarios are bounded by the minimum flow constraint at the alcalá del río gauge which puts limits on the reallocation of water to economic uses upstream the alcalá del río gauge is the last one before the estuary and the 80 km from this gauge to the sea requires a minimum flow to maintain low salinity and good environmental conditions as stated above in the last two scenarios the environmental flow constraint in alcalá del río limits the transfer from low value crops rice to higher value crops in middle and upper regions relaxing this environmental flow constraint in the short term would lead to increases in the gross margin of up to 16 8 m eur rightnar and dinar 2020 apply financial bankruptcy rules to water allocation in the case of scarcity and find that proportional allocation is less conducive to regional welfare although it presents a more politically feasible and robust option these bankruptcy rules are also described in the study of gómez limón et al 2020 which shows that other symmetric allocation methods other that proportional allocation such as the equal gains method also called uniform gains method or the equal loses method can improve water allocation without the need for asymmetric methods that rely on some form of priority allocation the water pricing scenario has a greater impact on the gross margin 82 compared to the baseline scenario than other scenarios based on quotas dmp and increased efficiency with 93 and 94 compared to the baseline scenario respectively this feeds into the long standing debate on quotas vs pricing instruments molle 2009 parrado et al 2020 in spain drought management protocol measures are linked to different stages of drought indicators pre alert alert and emergency the results of the model show that policies based on water pricing would be more advisable during the pre alert and alert periods applied as a proactive approach to drought management applying price increases at the stage of a drought when users are already affected by water scarcity has no effect due to the low demand elasticity of deficit irrigated crops in the context explained in expósito and berbel 2016 it should also be mentioned that most of the basin is irrigated using pressurised networks meaning energy is an important cost component this context is consistent with the evolution observed at spanish national level espinosa tasón et al 2020 describing an increase of energy consumption for irrigation from 0 03 kwh m3 1960 to 0 17 kwh m3 2017 explained by the energy consumption linked to modernization where energy cost accounts for 30 50 of total operating costs in water user associations berbel et al 2019 the behavioural impact of this component is relevant as the energy cost is linked directly to volumetric water consumption and can therefore lead to water saving behaviour compared with pre modernisation where water rates were applied per hectare with no volumetric component pronti and berbel 2023 our model assumes that volumetric pricing is applied in most of the basin this affects water demand as the flat rate per area basis has no direct impact on savings pronti and berbel 2023 optimal allocation and water pricing policies entail a shift in water rights away from historical holders commodities to the most dynamic perennial farming entrepreneurs this is illustrated by the fact that the upper region maintains 83 82 of water use while lower regions only use 57 55 compared to the baseline scenario fig 4 the water saving in the lower basin is mainly due to the partial halt in rice cultivation while other crops in the lower basin perennials vegetables are maintained according to our model simulations responses to future water scarcity may require flexibility and reallocation the transfer of water rights between regions can either be carried out by buying back water rights to compensate farmers who stop irrigating or it can be facilitated by trading water rights as in the australian market system the spanish legislative framework may present a barrier to the implementation of an extensive market berbel and esteban 2019 palomo hierro et al 2022 water trading has been shown to provide an effective tool for positive water allocation outcomes at both the level of the individual user and at the social and environmental levels grafton and wheeler 2018 nauges et al 2016 implementing water trading without the full implementation of the necessary laws institutional capacity and administrative systems in this basin will only increase transaction costs moreover it will fuel scepticism regarding the benefits of the market system one way to lower transaction costs and boost water transactions involves the establishment of a water bank acting as an intermediary between buyers and sellers regardless of whether those transfers are temporary annual water allocation or permanent water rights montilla lópez et al 2018 in cases where environmental flows are not met water banks can also act by buying back temporary or permanent rights from agriculture gutiérrez martín et al 2020 there is no work on previous hydro economic modelling in the guadalquivir basin at the basin scale reca et al 2001a and reca et al 2001b develop a hydro economic model for the bembezar irrigation district and hervás gámez and delgado ramos 2020 for the genil subbasin focusing mainly on the optimal irrigation quantities for crops and the supply capacity of the network in different climatic and economic scenarios our results are consistent with the findings of several previous hydro economic analyses applied to mediterranean river basins baccour et al 2021 escriva bou et al 2017 frija et al 2021 gohar et al 2021 kahil et al 2015 indicating that a combination of water trading and irrigation efficiency improvements could help improve the sustainability of water use in those river basins however the level of efficiency of those policy interventions varies across the different studies and depends on the characteristics of the basin including socio economic conditions crop mix spatial distribution of uses sources of water and infrastructure for the guadalquivir basin our results show that water trading could potentially constitute a valuable instrument for adaptation to water scarcity given the importance of perennial crops in the upstream area of the basin and the possibility of reallocating water from annual to perennial crops regarding the methodology applied it should be noted that other pmp techniques can also be used for the calibration and simulation of the economic component the advantage of the dagnino and ward 2012 approach is that it skips the first stage of calibration meaning there are no marginal crops that lack a shadow price however this methodology does not allow the addition of crops that were not observed in the reference year even if they have no quadratic component in the yield function if new crop alternatives are to be added the standard approximation of howitt 1995 can be used our methodology includes a penalty for future yield losses due to the fallowing of land dedicated to irrigated perennial crops connor et al 2009 performed a similar analysis by modelling the response of crop yields to water in the lower murray darling basin in australia 7 concluding remarks this work has added to the body of knowledge on the water resource management of the guadalquivir basin which is representative of mediterranean systems and constitutes one of the most important water basins in southern europe the study has involved analysing the availability of water and the capacity of the various agricultural activities in the guadalquivir basin to adapt to a severe drought situation to that end a hydro economic model has been developed to conduct an integrated analysis of different water allocation policies in the basin the results indicate that the economic uses agriculture are highly vulnerable to a reduction in the basin s water resources the fact that agricultural activity in the basin is largely based on perennial crops such as olive almond and citrus limits the capacity to deal with water scarcity and droughts this reliance on perennial crops makes it harder to adapt the system to drought which requires flexible management mechanisms to optimise the use of the water consumed perennials trees account for more than 80 of the cultivated area in the upper basin which makes agriculture highly inflexible and does not respond well to proportional allocation management scenarios based on historical water rights as proposed by the current dmp the optimal allocation scenario assigns more water resources to the upper basin where activity is overwhelmingly based on perennial crops thereby preventing future losses caused by the abandonment of this type of crop and consequent loss of the initial investment the transfer of rights between farmers and between locations can be carried out either with the support of market instruments that compensate herbaceous crop farmers for their losses or by using economic compensatory measures nevertheless it is not only the question of economic efficiency that should be considered but also that of social equity to attain a fair distribution of water rights the model has been used for the analysis of different water policies in an arid and semiarid basin in southern spain the guadalquivir basin is a good case to study policies related to water scarcity and drought impacts this is a common situation in many arid and semi arid basins around the world the hydro economic model proposed here can be used in any basin in the world to help decision makers address problems related to water scarcity we have tried to build a simplified digital twin of the complex guadalquivir river basin by developing a hydro economic model for a single drought event it enables the assessment of water management policies in simulated scenarios is user friendly includes economic instruments to analyse water demand and the option of deficit irrigation in perennial crops on the other hand reservoir stocks have not been included the time scale is annual and multiannual simulations are not available yet future research should incorporate a more complex hydrological model that includes an interannual and seasonal analysis studying the effect of drought across different months of the year and the buffering effect of reservoir storage use of non conventional water sources and other uses of water and jointly consider quantity and quality

7701,study region choushui river alluvial fan in central taiwan study focus groundwater contributes significantly to various socio economic developments worldwide unique hydrogeological characteristics at a wider spatial scale and unavailability of adequate hydro meteorological or pumping datasets have made its prediction a challenging prospect over regions this study proposes and evaluates a long short term memory lstm model to predict daily fluctuations of regional groundwater patterns using observations across multiple monitoring wells in choushui river alluvial fan located in central taiwan global models calibrated over all monitoring well data were compared with the local lstm models each trained on the local well data for regional groundwater sequential forecast the global lstm model can ensure great precision in groundwater forecasting however the global model may not quite be necessary if the piezometric observations have a nearly similar temporal autocorrelation in groundwater sequence in the study area new hydrological insights for the region the proposed local lstm models that were trained on local well data to predict groundwater over the rest of the wells exhibited nearly identical performance when compared to the global model however an in depth spatial assessment showed that the results from the local model were adversely affected when trained on data from coastal wells indicating that these areas require special attention for regional forecasting eventually a fine tuning through transfer learning tl scheme was further proposed to show considerable improvements in model performance and to highlight the potential advantages of synthesizing cross data information for model training when suffering from hydrogeological heterogeneity in fields graphical abstract ga1 keywords long short term memory lstm transfer learning groundwater forecasting choushui river alluvial fan data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction majority of the freshwater around the globe originates from groundwater over two billion people rely on groundwater as the primary water source for drinking famiglietti 2014 due to an exorbitant rise in demand and issues attributed to climate change groundwater has experienced significant depletions causing many environmental geological impacts such as land subsidence ali et al 2020 chu et al 2021a guzy and malinowska 2020 smith and majumdar 2020 seawater intrusion faunt et al 2016 liu et al 2003 and river flow reduction mukherjee et al 2018 hence monitoring and predicting groundwater fluctuations becomes a crucial step toward its sustainable operation solgi et al 2021 however complex hydrogeology significant disturbance in the water balance between natural recharge and discharge by excessive pumping and uncertainties associated with surface water interactions make groundwater prediction a challenging prospect with the advent of big data millions of sensors around the globe are intensively monitoring the groundwater fluctuations at daily to monthly scales over major aquifer systems opening up new avenues for implementing emerging data driven techniques like artificial intelligence ai and machine learning tao et al 2022 for instance recent studies have focused their implementation for groundwater time series reconstruction vu et al 2021 or simulating future scenarios through multi sensor data integration of various meteorological and land use and land cover variables rohde et al 2021 sahu et al 2020 wunsch et al 2021 various studies also proposed regional ai models by categorizing the groundwater basin based on hydrogeological zones sun et al 2022 or through soft computing techniques such as clustering jeihouni et al 2019 kardan moghaddam et al 2021 nourani et al 2015 sharghi et al 2022 furthermore studies have also explored popular ai models such as multi layered perceptron mlp kochhar et al 2021 artificial neuro fuzzy inference system anfis raghavendra and deka 2016 and gated recurrent unit gru lin et al 2022 for autoregressive modeling which only rely on past groundwater observations to simulate future behaviors proving their applicability over regions with scarce or no meteorological observations furthermore with the current technological advancements in groundwater monitoring sensors where the information is now being generated in real time policymakers and relevant water resource authorities have started imparting progressive delicacy management of the aquifer systems that require historical groundwater observations at a much smaller temporal scale sun et al 2022 under climate change government authorities dealing with water resources have started focusing on monitoring groundwater in real time few recent studies have focused and initiated groundwater forecasting at daily scale thereby demonstrating the power of ai technology for such near real time hydrogeological forecasting afan et al 2021 guzman et al 2019 2017 kisi and shiri 2012 kouziokas et al 2018 müller et al 2021 solgi et al 2021 long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is a modified version of recurrent neural network rnn with proven capabilities in capturing long term dependencies over large time series sequences for prediction in groundwater solgi et al 2021 sun et al 2022 vu et al 2021 wunsch et al 2021 however most studies did not show the ability of a local lstm model trained on a local representative well and predict groundwater over all the remaining wells in an autoregressive manner that are spread across a groundwater basin some regions still suffer from a lack of adequate groundwater monitoring stations or observations few of the advanced ai approaches still require a sizeable dataset to provide meaningful forecasts this data scarcity issue of ai models can be effectively alleviated with transfer learning tl pan and yang 2010 weiss et al 2016 which is a broad subject within the field of ai this technique essentially facilitates the transfer of knowledge learned by the model from one domain to the other which effectively reduces the data requirements at the target domain making the model converge relatively faster the tl is a popular technique in the ai community widely adopted for image classification with few instances in hydrological modeling kimura et al 2019 ma et al 2021 but its adoption in groundwater research was found to be relatively scarce with few exceptions such as the study from ma et al 2022 that showed its implementation in europe the current research proposes the computationally efficient local lstm model for near real time daily regional groundwater forecasting the primary objective of this work is to evaluate the performance of this local lstm model that was trained on local well data against the global lstm model where all the wells were given as inputs furthermore a case study of the fine tuning local lstm model through tl was also proposed to further improve their accuracy over multiple wells this work determines the importance of employing and testing various modelling scenarios for efficient daily regional groundwater predictions when few groundwater monitoring wells are available while only relying on its past observations without any other meteorological variables or subdivisions of the study area 2 study area the choushui river alluvial fan craf situated in the west central region of taiwan is an extensively irrigated area with aquaculture activities using groundwater while the area is engulfed between mount baguah and dulliu hill in the east and the taiwan strait towards the western coast there is a crucial river stream passing through the center of this area and acts as an administrative boundary between the two counties located here namely changhua yunlin county see fig 1 a the region covers approximately 1800 km2 with distinctive hydrogeological regions i e proximal fan mid fan and distal fan the unconsolidated sediments underlying the alluvial fan are teeming with groundwater since the late quaternary age jang et al 2008 liu et al 2002 the proximal fan in the far east mainly comprises of gravel and sand forming a thick unconfined aquifer which is also designated to be a major recharge zone jang et al 2008 tatas et al 2022 the confining units of the aquifer system thicken towards the mid fan which is usually composed of coarse sand and clay the distal fan is a coastal area along the west that largely includes high clayey materials where aquitards are most prevalent the study area experiences an elevation change of about 100 m from east to west with rock developments in the eastern upstream watershed having been composed of sandstone metamorphic quartzite slate mudstone and shale liu et al 2004 through various drilling and stratigraphic analyses of the subsurface geology conducted between 1992 and 1998 jang et al 2008 the choushui aquifer system was characterized into four discrete aquifers that are officially labeled as aquifer i aquifer ii aquifer iii and aquifer iv fig 1 c the aquitards separating these aquifers namely t1 t2 and t3 have semi permeable properties preventing significant levels of rainwater infiltration towards mid and distal fan areas the aquifer ii became the primary source of groundwater abstraction in the region due to its immense spatial extent a long term groundwater withdrawal survey showed that the pumping rate between 1970 and 1990 was about 1 02 billion m3 per year while recent figures indicated withdrawals to be crossing 3 billion cubic meters lee et al 2018 the region suffers from widespread implications of groundwater depletion ranging from droughts wang et al 2019 and aquifer salinization liu et al 2003 to land subsidence ali et al 2020 chu et al 2021a 2021b hung et al 2021 2010 wang et al 2015 owing to enormous pumping rates during drier periods this has further inflicted several socio economic issues related to water security the safety of critical infrastructure such as the taiwan high speed rail agriculture and industries additionally it was found that about 100 km2 of coastal land was submerged below sea level water resources bureau 2001 3 material and methods 3 1 data description a wide network of groundwater monitoring wells was established for the comprehensive assessment of the aquifer daily hydraulic heads were collected from 45 wells over a period of 8 and a half years 2013 2021 06 that are maintained calibrated and operated by the water resource agency of taiwan the well ids adopted for the analysis in this work are shown in fig 1 b these piezometric heads originated from the groundwater fluctuations in the confined aquifer ii the number of wells and the period were finalized based on the availability of consistent observations with minimal missing values however some missing values still remained in these time series data that were imputed through the time series missing value imputation package in r also known as the imputets moritz and bartz beielstein 2017 this package includes sophisticated imputation algorithms and functions to plot univariate time series missing data statistics for imputation the kalman smoothing and state space models algorithm was utilized with na seadec function in this approach the seasonal component of the time series data is first removed and then the missing values are imputed over the general trend later on the seasonal component is added back with the filled trend to generate uninterrupted time series data additionally the faulty readings were also identified and removed which were also imputed using the same approach this technique was found to be highly efficient for time series exhibiting seasonality such as groundwater müller et al 2021 sahu et al 2020 a series of statistical evaluations were conducted on the entire dataset for further analysis the augmented dickey fuller test was used on each well to check for non stationarity in the daily piezometric heads the results indicated that all 45 time series datasets are temporally stationary however the shapiro wilk test for normality revealed that the daily groundwater observations over the study area across all wells were following non gaussian distribution this makes it ideal for implementing deep learning models which are not significantly influenced by the skewed distribution data transformations were not conducted in any form due to their adverse impacts on the non linearity of the dataset faraway and chatfield 2008 which also greatly reduces its explainability the dataset was used separately after its segregation into training 2013 19 and testing 2020 21 06 subsets this was conducted as a preventive measure for the leakage of information from piezometric heads during 2020 21 06 so that the calibration of lstm models is only over 2013 19 causing the two periods to remain completely independent 3 2 long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 addressed the vanishing gradient problem while training on long sequences using the rnn for developing the lstm the lstm network extends the rnn model by including an exclusive memory cell with a gating mechanism that controls and regulates the flow of information across the network bandara et al 2020 three gates exist within an lstm memory cell namely the forget input and output gates each gate is designated for a specific task while the model is trained the change in state of the memory cell is stored in a conveyor belt like structure called the cell state that keeps track of the information that was retained or discarded these components ensure the preservation of relevant previous information with stable gradient calculation sequentially the first step is the forget gate which tests the relevance of information from the previous state a sigmoid function is applied over the information from the previous state and the resulting value ranges between 0 and 1 a value closer to 1 indicates retention and vice versa when closer to 0 then the input gate decides which portion of the new information is to be added to the cell state while the sigmoid function is again used to maintain the scale of the new information a hyperbolic tangent function is then utilized to rescale it between 1 1 if the computed value from the input gate is negative then the information would be subtracted from the cell state while a positive value indicates addition finally the output gate is used to compute predictions based on the cell state updated by the forget and input gates along with the input from the current time step a schematic diagram of an lstm memory cell is illustrated in fig 2 the aforementioned process inside a memory cell can be represented by the following recursive mathematical expressions bandara et al 2020 hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 vu et al 2021 1 f t σ w f s t 1 u f x t b f i t σ w i s t 1 u i x

biases over the corresponding gates c t denotes memory cell state while s t and s t 1 correspond to outputs at current and previous time steps respectively σ is the logistic sigmoid function

x e x all the aforementioned weights and biases are calibrated during the training process in this study the adam optimizer kingma and ba 2015 was utilized to reduce the model prediction errors this optimizer is computationally efficient and requires limited parameter tuning müller et al 2021 which made it the default optimizer for a majority of the applications the optimizer was utilized at its default settings in this research the lstm layer with sigmoid activation was followed by two fully connected hidden layers having relu activation functions after the architectural optimization on the current dataset the objective of the training process was to minimize the mean squared error of the predictions at each epoch the model architecture was implemented using the keras package with tensorflow backend joseph et al 2021 on python 3 9 the model development was carried out on a microsoft windows 11 home system pc coupled with intel core i9 12900 h 3 80 ghz processor and nvidia geforce rtx 3070ti laptop gpu 8 gb vram the lstm model was trained using the gpu due to its added computational advantage observed during the training process 3 3 research methodology a complete schematic diagram of the proposed framework adopted in this study for regional groundwater forecasting is provided in fig 3 herein the research framework primarily focuses on four stages a data acquisition preprocessing model development assessment of b global and c local model and finally d fine tuning through tl 3 3 1 data preprocessing firstly the uninterrupted daily piezometric heads after subsequent interpolation of missing and faulty values from over 45 monitoring wells between 2013 and 2021 06 were collected data normalization is required before the model development can takes place in this study the minmaxscaler in the scikit learn python package pedregosa et al 2011 was utilized to rescale the varying range of piezometric heads across all wells to a common scale of 0 1 3 3 2 lstm modelling approach the next step is the data driven deep learning model development only lstm was chosen as the primary model in this research due to its superior and proven capabilities in handling time series sequences especially in groundwater research solgi et al 2021 sun et al 2022 vu et al 2021 originally global lstm models were developed 1 global ms lstm where the entire normalized piezometric heads from across all 45 wells were parallelly fed as input columns where all of them were stacked as multi sequence ms and 2 global ss lstm model in which groundwater fluctuations from all wells were given as a single sequence ss here the time series were stacked as a single input column in local lstm models each model was trained on single well data firstly to predict daily groundwater fluctuations at all the remaining wells in the study area each local model is annotated as local lstm well id where well id refers to the single well data used for their training in this study short term groundwater forecasting was proposed in which the past three days piezometric heads were used to forecast the future three days this input output window size was used as a case study to investigate the efficacy of various versions of lstm for short term regional groundwater sequential forecasting the model architectures were designed as per the sequential forecasting requirements where the output dense layer equates to the intended forecasting horizon the mathematical expressions for the proposed modelling approaches are provided in eq 4 5 6 eq 4

improved over wells with high errors using tl in this study the model knowledge in fine training wells was transferred through the weight initialization scheme in poor training wells the process of its implementation in this work is described as follows firstly a local lstm a model trained on data only from well a was used to predict groundwater in the remaining wells after locally assessing its accuracy over each of the remaining wells the wells over which it obtained the rmse value greater than or equal to 0 4 m for the next day time step i e t 1 were considered for selection criteria in the tl for instance this model showed rmse t 1 0 4 m for the forecast in wells c d and e hence the weights for retraining the local lstm a were initialized through another local lstm b model which was trained on well b having a good correlation r 0 9 with wells c d and e in terms of hydraulic heads this tl approach essentially provides an indirect way of transferring information or knowledge from b to the newly trained local lstm a resulting in improved accuracy for groundwater predictions at well locations c d e this new model is referred to as local b lstm a whereas the knowledge in b was transferred to that in a 3 3 4 model validation its evaluation during model calibration process about 20 of the training data was used independently as a validation set to simultaneously assess and prevent overfitting underfitting issues the mean squared error was used as the primary objective function to monitor discrepancies between predicted and observed values during the training process the models were designated to be trained for 200 epochs with an early stopping criterion that terminated it if no improvement in mse was observed for the next 10 epochs in the validation set the weights and biases from the iteration with the best results are retained which were used for predictions on the testing set the predictive capabilities of the models over the testing set were assessed through statistical criteria namely root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and coefficient of determination r2 the mathematical equations for calculating the evaluation metrics over individual wells are provided in eq 7 eq 8 and eq 9 models were assessed by using the average of error values obtained over wells calculated using eqs 10 12 while an overall assessment was subsequently carried

provides an in depth comparison of all the developed models through three statistical evaluation metrics rmse mae and r2 and their average scores over craf for assessing the simulated piezometric heads however the location based assessment of all error metrics is reported except mae since its spatial distribution was identical to rmse firstly a detailed comparison of global models is presented with a corresponding discussion on their performance relative to local models finally a case study for the fine tuning of the local lstm model through tl is presented 4 1 model assessment tables 1 2 provide the average error scores eqs 10 12 obtained through both global lstm models and for three specific local lstm models each located in the upstream proximal well 13 central mid fan well 16 and downstream distal fan area well 30 see the black circle in fig 1 b respectively local models for all 45 wells were developed for the sake of brevity only three local models are discussed here each representing important locations within the groundwater basin the global ms lstm model performed poorly out of all the modeling approaches shown here there was almost over 60 drop in rmse mae and 5 increase in r2 when compared to the global ss lstm model during the testing phase the scores for the further ahead predictions t 2 and t 3 remained considerably superior from the ss model as well with rmse and mae improving by up to 53 and almost 40 while r2 by 5 respectively the global ss lstm network rendered a better forecast by up to 40 in terms of rmse and mae than the global ms lstm moreover the average scores witnessed for the three local lstm models are marginally different from the best global model ss especially the ones trained on wells from proximal well 13 and mid fan well 16 the local models produced better forecasts for next day t 1 predictions while slightly getting close to or worse than the global ss model for t 2 t 3 the average performance score of all the 45 local lstm models over craf can be evidenced through the spatial map for average rmse shown in fig 4 these maps indicate that the local models mostly trained on wells from the mid fan region produced the best regional forecasting results when compared to the ones from the upstream and downstream sides the accuracy got considerably worse when the training was conducted in a monitoring well near the coastline area e g well 30 the spatial error maps of rmse for global and local lstm models using proximal well 13 mid well 16 and distal fan well 30 are provided in figs 5 6 respectively a series of spatial error maps for rmse r2 were prepared to provide a location based model assessment additionally the spatial distribution of r2 obtained from both types of models is shown in fig a1 a2 firstly the global ss lstm model displayed great improvements over the wells located in the mid and distal fan areas in comparison to global ms for instance wells in the mid fan area especially the subsidence zone and the southwestern coast in the yunlin area attributing to high drawdown ali et al 2022 witnessed simulation errors of rmse ranging between 0 5 to well over 1 m see fig 5 a c from the global ms model while the global ss enhanced the simulations by dropping rmse to below 0 5 m over most of the wells fig 5 d f similarly the coastal locations in the center and northern changhua also observed commendable improvements with the global ss lstm model however the local lstm models trained especially only over wells 13 16 were found to have a marginally similar distribution of rmse fig 6 a f as the global ss model previously indicated through average scores tables 1 2 however the performance of the local lstm 30 model fig 6 g i from the coastal side got considerably affected due to serious complexities induced by marine forces and extensive human activities that cause infiltration from nearby fish ponds and pumping wells liu et al 2003 the rmse values here were found to be adversely impacted over the wells located on the southwest coast in yunlin with excessive pumping it is worth noting that all the models showed relatively identical rmse spatial distribution over some wells on the upstream the primary reason could be due to reduced human intervention that almost maintains the natural equilibrium of the groundwater system here and is well captured by the lstm architecture figs 7 8 and 9 display the time series visualizations of 3 day piezometric heads predicted by the two global and three local models for the three randomly selected wells located in the northern coast well 2 upstream well 8 and central subsidence zone well 35 in yunlin area see blue circles in fig 1 b all the plots demonstrated that the ss global model provided the best fit across the stipulated forecasting horizon when all the data was given as input to the lstm model its predictions were better reflected with the rapid daily fluctuations from the original piezometer wells than the ms based lstm model furthermore the prediction time series from local models are highly identical to the global ss especially the local lstm 13 and local lstm 16 however the local lstm 30 sometimes exhibited large errors while predicting extreme values particularly the depletion overall these findings indicate that to develop a regional ai model for groundwater forecasting it may not entirely be necessary to feed all the data into the models to obtain the most optimum prediction results in some areas as shown in this work a local lstm model with local well data can adequately provide short term daily sequential groundwater forecast in near real time scenarios over craf but as mentioned earlier the local models near the coastal side may induce large errors in forecasting hence a rigorous evaluation is required before reaching this conclusion over other aquifers in addition the time series plots for all the 45 local lstm models for predictions over wells 2 8 35 are provided in fig a 3 a 4 a 5 respectively figs 7 8 9 show time series plots for the predictions from the three local lstm models over wells 2 8 35 4 2 fine tuning of local lstm models using tl as described in the previous section few models trained on data from wells in the central coastal area such as the local lstm 30 fig 6 g i near the choushui river stream attained rmse values for t 1 larger than 0 4 m over wells located in the southwest coast i e wells 41 43 44 45 this was used as a case study to propose an effective measure to further fine tune this local model using tl firstly a piezometric well that was highly correlative with wells 41 43 44 45 was chosen as the source domain which was found to be well 34 having a correlation coefficient r of over 0 9 with each of them then the weight initialization scheme was adopted for tl to utilize the advantage of cross domain information the weights were initialized from local lstm 34 to recalibrate the target local model i e local lstm 30 since the weights are initialized from an established model the new local model at well 30 with tl would converge relatively faster and require less data this tl based model was retrained on only 2 years i e 2018 19 and its abbreviations is modified to local 34 lstm 30 based on the initial weights from the well 34 data the average performance of the tl based local lstm model i e local 34 lstm 30 at well 30 is also provided in table 2 the results indicate that tl with an effectively chosen source domain does provide considerable improvements in modeling performance over the target dataset with additional computational benefits for instance the local 34 lstm 30 offered almost 32 t 1 19 t 2 and 12 t 3 better average rmse over local lstm 30 for the testing phase the spatial distribution of the tl based model see fig 6 j l also showed significant improvements in rmse especially over southwest coastal wells well 41 43 44 45 which were the main selection criteria for tl the rmse here improved by at least 16 while the rmse t 1 enhanced by over 40 for some of them the spatial distribution of local 34 lstm 30 fig 6 j l has now become mostly aligned with the distribution from local lstm 13 local lstm 16 fig 6 a f than before fig 6 g i the time series plots for the predictions from the local 34 lstm 30 model are shown in figs 7 8 9 over the three chosen locations also point towards the good results the forecast during late may 2021 improved considerably here moreover the central well 16 and upstream side well 13 wells are still found to be slightly better for groundwater prediction over the entire craf as a whole these results highlight the overarching advantage of adopting tl in the field of ai based groundwater forecasting which is known to be highly suffering from hydrogeological complexity and heterogeneity in many regions around the globe 5 discussion 5 1 efficiency and uncertainty of local lstm for regional groundwater modeling the performance of local lstm models was relatively similar to that of the global ss lstm model at a regional scale even though it was trained only on the local well data while comparing the forecasting results despite the subtle distinction in the groundwater patterns across various monitoring wells over craf the overall trend of the time series was relatively stable especially during the training period while the testing period observed a linear decline during the drought event in early 2021 making them relatively similar furthermore an investigation of their autocorrelation through two additional spatial maps depicting the correlations between groundwater instances at current time step t with up to 2 lags i e t 1 t 2 see fig 10 also revealed that most of the groundwater measurements across wells have an autocorrelation of over 0 95 which means that the correlation between future and past groundwater measurements are considerably high over craf which is similar to the findings of several researches that focused on autoregressive daily groundwater modeling using ai techniques guzman et al 2017 kisi and shiri 2012 solgi et al 2021 this could be the primary reason why the local lstm models showed spatial distribution of rmse r2 scores nearly similar to the global ss lstm model since the overall correlations or the overall trends in the groundwater time series do not vary significantly over a majority of the wells traditionally the groundwater flow model was used in whole region and few data from anywhere were used to calibrate the model parameters in the same way this local model is the representative data driven model since few data from any location was used for training the structure of the input data greatly impacts the calibration of a deep learning model during the network optimization it was found that the model complexity gets severely accentuated in a ms approach since many trainable parameters are required to simultaneously generalize one model on a range of sequential data the global ms lstm model included a total of 16 551 parameters to generalize across several input piezometer wells at once making its hyperparameter tuning difficult the global ms model included 32 nodes each in the lstm layer and its two subsequent hidden layers equipped with sigmoid and relu activation functions respectively in contrast the global ss model consisted of 16 nodes lstm layer 8 nodes 1st hidden layer and 4 nodes 2nd hidden layer with the same layer activation function that needed only 1359 trainable parameters which is a significant drop from the ms approach similarly the local lstm models also included the same network architecture and the number of trainable parameters as the global ss lstm model with no relative compromise on the regional forecasting performance the global ss model posed a serious computational disadvantage since the model calibration took relatively longer due to a drastic increase in sequential size as a result of adding many wells in the single sequence instead of stacking them as separate columns thereby increasing the number of rows for the data by using a local lstm model the training time can be reduced by up to 9 times when compared to the global ss model even though the models had the same number of trainable parameters understanding uncertainties and limitations associated with the local lstm model is essential the local lstm model assumes uniform characteristics across all locations in the study area which may not hold true for other hydrological regions this assumption may lead to some uncertainties in groundwater predictions over far away located monitoring wells if the variations in geological properties and hydrological conditions have significantly impacted the local temporal correlation making it different from the temporal characteristics previously learned by the local model at the training well location moreover the accuracy of groundwater predictions by local lstm models may be affected by uncertainties arising from external factors that were not considered during the development such as the presence and pumping frequency of nearby pumping wells however we have attempted to address these uncertainties through tl approach in the coastal area that provided more stable information during the fine tuning of local model and ultimately led to acceptable improvements 5 2 groundwater forecasting with tl most recently conducted studies for regional groundwater forecasting over multiple wells jeihouni et al 2019 kardan moghaddam et al 2021 nourani et al 2015 sharghi et al 2022 highlighted the necessity of adopting a clustering algorithm for subdividing the groundwater basin with additional reliance on meteorological parameters for monthly forecasts and proceeded without considering subtle daily fluctuations in groundwater these studies did not show the performance of the local model to produce autoregressive groundwater forecasts on remaining wells in their study area to highlight the degree of necessity for a prior clustering scheme in addition the studies that showed the ability of deep learning models for autoregressive daily groundwater forecasting kisi and shiri 2012 solgi et al 2021 only utilized few wells without demonstrating the model s transferability to other larger number of well locations within their respective groundwater basin this work provides a comprehensive comparison of several modeling scenarios of global and local models including the implementation of tl for near real time groundwater sequential prediction at a regional scale which showed that few groundwater basins sometimes may not require such extensive clustering procedures prior to the deep learning model and can be transferred to other locations within the study area if the degree of similarity pertaining to temporal characteristics is preserved some groundwater measurements across wells in the coastal area have a slightly weak autocorrelation less than 0 95 the local models get occasionally affected in the coastal region well 30 which could also be attributed to uncertainties induced by infiltration from nearby fish ponds which is usually the case in coastal areas of craf especially in the yunlin area liu et al 2003 the current work also proposes an effective technique to tackle this phenomenon through the tl approach in deep learning this tl method allows for cross data knowledge transfer and fine tuning of the single well local model in coastal areas the overall improvements table 2 fig 6 j l obtained through this approach with limited data i e only 2 years in contrast to the local lstm model that was trained on 7 years of local well data in the coastal region showcases its superiority and advantages pertaining to fast model convergence for accurate groundwater modeling forecasting in data limited regions these findings were similar to the previous study that implemented tl for other hydrological modeling using lstm kimura et al 2019 ma et al 2021 furthermore it is worthy to point out that the model with data driven techniques did not consider regional pumping and rainfall the in situ data of regional pumping over groundwater basins are hard to be collected however the heads in past time are the responses from regional pumping and rainfall hence this approach based on the historical heads can act as an alternative for practical usage in the local model groundwater prediction relies solely on historical data specific to the local well the prediction of groundwater levels in coastal areas may be sensitive to uncertainties particularly when the temporal correlation of training data is low this can result in poor fitting particularly during periods of high or low peak levels the model potentially contributes towards providing useful information on groundwater patterns that can be used for fine tuning fine tuning is a looped process in the local model this study showed a demo case using fine tuning once in complex cases the fine tuning process is iterative and repeated for various locations 6 conclusion an efficient lstm was proposed to implement for daily regional groundwater sequential forecasting in central taiwan a comprehensive comparison was conducted between global lstm and local lstm to examine the relevance of groundwater sequential forecasting the assessment in this study revealed that the global ms model was the poorest among all the models in the prediction the proposed local lstm models provided marginally identical results to that of the global ss lstm model training time using local lstm model was reduced by up to 9 times when compared to using a global ss model moreover the local lstm models from the mid fan area are found to be the best choice for regional groundwater forecasting over craf results showed that one of the local models was adversely affected when trained on a well located closer to the coastline especially near the choushui river a case study was further proposed to fine tune the local model through a tl approach where the model weights of a highly correlative well from mid fan were utilized to initiate the calibration of this model results showed that the improvements of average rmse values were ranging between 12 to over 30 in the local model with tl the forecasting using lstm especially the local model with high computational efficiency was only achieved through groundwater observations without resorting to any other hydro meteorological or anthropogenic database the findings indicate that the autoregressive deep learning based forecasting over a larger spatial extent may not always require prior preprocessing and heavy training when the temporal autocorrelation does not have significant variance across several locations when the training dataset is located close to the coastline in local lstm the tl can be considered in the low autocorrelation area during the modeling process the tl scheme from a mid fan could be highly beneficial we recommended that the tl is conducted in the local lstm since the forecasting results are subjective to the hydrogeological condition and spatiotemporal relation of the groundwater dataset the model depicted in the future research can extend to long term predictions the tl could be further tested to improve accuracy for a longer forecasting horizon furthermore as this study did not overtly consider other physical characteristics from the groundwater basin or other hydrometeorological anthropogenic parameters a future study can incorporate the tl to further improve the modeling performance additionally the models developed in this work can be further supplemented for time series reconstruction prediction over data scarce regions through tl the extraction of spatio temporal features can be further assessed and enhanced by implementing cnn lstm which is a hybrid deep learning model the tl approach can be further investigated for multi layered aquifer modeling in a future study nonetheless a comprehensive comparison of various model implementation approaches provides useful insights into the modelling of aquifer systems at a much wider spatial range for near real time predictions this contributes to more effective decision making for the most suitable data driven modeling approach over the groundwater basin that is under investigation making it ample for robust water resources monitoring and management credit authorship contribution statement hone jay chu conceptualization writing review editing

7701,study region choushui river alluvial fan in central taiwan study focus groundwater contributes significantly to various socio economic developments worldwide unique hydrogeological characteristics at a wider spatial scale and unavailability of adequate hydro meteorological or pumping datasets have made its prediction a challenging prospect over regions this study proposes and evaluates a long short term memory lstm model to predict daily fluctuations of regional groundwater patterns using observations across multiple monitoring wells in choushui river alluvial fan located in central taiwan global models calibrated over all monitoring well data were compared with the local lstm models each trained on the local well data for regional groundwater sequential forecast the global lstm model can ensure great precision in groundwater forecasting however the global model may not quite be necessary if the piezometric observations have a nearly similar temporal autocorrelation in groundwater sequence in the study area new hydrological insights for the region the proposed local lstm models that were trained on local well data to predict groundwater over the rest of the wells exhibited nearly identical performance when compared to the global model however an in depth spatial assessment showed that the results from the local model were adversely affected when trained on data from coastal wells indicating that these areas require special attention for regional forecasting eventually a fine tuning through transfer learning tl scheme was further proposed to show considerable improvements in model performance and to highlight the potential advantages of synthesizing cross data information for model training when suffering from hydrogeological heterogeneity in fields graphical abstract ga1 keywords long short term memory lstm transfer learning groundwater forecasting choushui river alluvial fan data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction majority of the freshwater around the globe originates from groundwater over two billion people rely on groundwater as the primary water source for drinking famiglietti 2014 due to an exorbitant rise in demand and issues attributed to climate change groundwater has experienced significant depletions causing many environmental geological impacts such as land subsidence ali et al 2020 chu et al 2021a guzy and malinowska 2020 smith and majumdar 2020 seawater intrusion faunt et al 2016 liu et al 2003 and river flow reduction mukherjee et al 2018 hence monitoring and predicting groundwater fluctuations becomes a crucial step toward its sustainable operation solgi et al 2021 however complex hydrogeology significant disturbance in the water balance between natural recharge and discharge by excessive pumping and uncertainties associated with surface water interactions make groundwater prediction a challenging prospect with the advent of big data millions of sensors around the globe are intensively monitoring the groundwater fluctuations at daily to monthly scales over major aquifer systems opening up new avenues for implementing emerging data driven techniques like artificial intelligence ai and machine learning tao et al 2022 for instance recent studies have focused their implementation for groundwater time series reconstruction vu et al 2021 or simulating future scenarios through multi sensor data integration of various meteorological and land use and land cover variables rohde et al 2021 sahu et al 2020 wunsch et al 2021 various studies also proposed regional ai models by categorizing the groundwater basin based on hydrogeological zones sun et al 2022 or through soft computing techniques such as clustering jeihouni et al 2019 kardan moghaddam et al 2021 nourani et al 2015 sharghi et al 2022 furthermore studies have also explored popular ai models such as multi layered perceptron mlp kochhar et al 2021 artificial neuro fuzzy inference system anfis raghavendra and deka 2016 and gated recurrent unit gru lin et al 2022 for autoregressive modeling which only rely on past groundwater observations to simulate future behaviors proving their applicability over regions with scarce or no meteorological observations furthermore with the current technological advancements in groundwater monitoring sensors where the information is now being generated in real time policymakers and relevant water resource authorities have started imparting progressive delicacy management of the aquifer systems that require historical groundwater observations at a much smaller temporal scale sun et al 2022 under climate change government authorities dealing with water resources have started focusing on monitoring groundwater in real time few recent studies have focused and initiated groundwater forecasting at daily scale thereby demonstrating the power of ai technology for such near real time hydrogeological forecasting afan et al 2021 guzman et al 2019 2017 kisi and shiri 2012 kouziokas et al 2018 müller et al 2021 solgi et al 2021 long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is a modified version of recurrent neural network rnn with proven capabilities in capturing long term dependencies over large time series sequences for prediction in groundwater solgi et al 2021 sun et al 2022 vu et al 2021 wunsch et al 2021 however most studies did not show the ability of a local lstm model trained on a local representative well and predict groundwater over all the remaining wells in an autoregressive manner that are spread across a groundwater basin some regions still suffer from a lack of adequate groundwater monitoring stations or observations few of the advanced ai approaches still require a sizeable dataset to provide meaningful forecasts this data scarcity issue of ai models can be effectively alleviated with transfer learning tl pan and yang 2010 weiss et al 2016 which is a broad subject within the field of ai this technique essentially facilitates the transfer of knowledge learned by the model from one domain to the other which effectively reduces the data requirements at the target domain making the model converge relatively faster the tl is a popular technique in the ai community widely adopted for image classification with few instances in hydrological modeling kimura et al 2019 ma et al 2021 but its adoption in groundwater research was found to be relatively scarce with few exceptions such as the study from ma et al 2022 that showed its implementation in europe the current research proposes the computationally efficient local lstm model for near real time daily regional groundwater forecasting the primary objective of this work is to evaluate the performance of this local lstm model that was trained on local well data against the global lstm model where all the wells were given as inputs furthermore a case study of the fine tuning local lstm model through tl was also proposed to further improve their accuracy over multiple wells this work determines the importance of employing and testing various modelling scenarios for efficient daily regional groundwater predictions when few groundwater monitoring wells are available while only relying on its past observations without any other meteorological variables or subdivisions of the study area 2 study area the choushui river alluvial fan craf situated in the west central region of taiwan is an extensively irrigated area with aquaculture activities using groundwater while the area is engulfed between mount baguah and dulliu hill in the east and the taiwan strait towards the western coast there is a crucial river stream passing through the center of this area and acts as an administrative boundary between the two counties located here namely changhua yunlin county see fig 1 a the region covers approximately 1800 km2 with distinctive hydrogeological regions i e proximal fan mid fan and distal fan the unconsolidated sediments underlying the alluvial fan are teeming with groundwater since the late quaternary age jang et al 2008 liu et al 2002 the proximal fan in the far east mainly comprises of gravel and sand forming a thick unconfined aquifer which is also designated to be a major recharge zone jang et al 2008 tatas et al 2022 the confining units of the aquifer system thicken towards the mid fan which is usually composed of coarse sand and clay the distal fan is a coastal area along the west that largely includes high clayey materials where aquitards are most prevalent the study area experiences an elevation change of about 100 m from east to west with rock developments in the eastern upstream watershed having been composed of sandstone metamorphic quartzite slate mudstone and shale liu et al 2004 through various drilling and stratigraphic analyses of the subsurface geology conducted between 1992 and 1998 jang et al 2008 the choushui aquifer system was characterized into four discrete aquifers that are officially labeled as aquifer i aquifer ii aquifer iii and aquifer iv fig 1 c the aquitards separating these aquifers namely t1 t2 and t3 have semi permeable properties preventing significant levels of rainwater infiltration towards mid and distal fan areas the aquifer ii became the primary source of groundwater abstraction in the region due to its immense spatial extent a long term groundwater withdrawal survey showed that the pumping rate between 1970 and 1990 was about 1 02 billion m3 per year while recent figures indicated withdrawals to be crossing 3 billion cubic meters lee et al 2018 the region suffers from widespread implications of groundwater depletion ranging from droughts wang et al 2019 and aquifer salinization liu et al 2003 to land subsidence ali et al 2020 chu et al 2021a 2021b hung et al 2021 2010 wang et al 2015 owing to enormous pumping rates during drier periods this has further inflicted several socio economic issues related to water security the safety of critical infrastructure such as the taiwan high speed rail agriculture and industries additionally it was found that about 100 km2 of coastal land was submerged below sea level water resources bureau 2001 3 material and methods 3 1 data description a wide network of groundwater monitoring wells was established for the comprehensive assessment of the aquifer daily hydraulic heads were collected from 45 wells over a period of 8 and a half years 2013 2021 06 that are maintained calibrated and operated by the water resource agency of taiwan the well ids adopted for the analysis in this work are shown in fig 1 b these piezometric heads originated from the groundwater fluctuations in the confined aquifer ii the number of wells and the period were finalized based on the availability of consistent observations with minimal missing values however some missing values still remained in these time series data that were imputed through the time series missing value imputation package in r also known as the imputets moritz and bartz beielstein 2017 this package includes sophisticated imputation algorithms and functions to plot univariate time series missing data statistics for imputation the kalman smoothing and state space models algorithm was utilized with na seadec function in this approach the seasonal component of the time series data is first removed and then the missing values are imputed over the general trend later on the seasonal component is added back with the filled trend to generate uninterrupted time series data additionally the faulty readings were also identified and removed which were also imputed using the same approach this technique was found to be highly efficient for time series exhibiting seasonality such as groundwater müller et al 2021 sahu et al 2020 a series of statistical evaluations were conducted on the entire dataset for further analysis the augmented dickey fuller test was used on each well to check for non stationarity in the daily piezometric heads the results indicated that all 45 time series datasets are temporally stationary however the shapiro wilk test for normality revealed that the daily groundwater observations over the study area across all wells were following non gaussian distribution this makes it ideal for implementing deep learning models which are not significantly influenced by the skewed distribution data transformations were not conducted in any form due to their adverse impacts on the non linearity of the dataset faraway and chatfield 2008 which also greatly reduces its explainability the dataset was used separately after its segregation into training 2013 19 and testing 2020 21 06 subsets this was conducted as a preventive measure for the leakage of information from piezometric heads during 2020 21 06 so that the calibration of lstm models is only over 2013 19 causing the two periods to remain completely independent 3 2 long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 addressed the vanishing gradient problem while training on long sequences using the rnn for developing the lstm the lstm network extends the rnn model by including an exclusive memory cell with a gating mechanism that controls and regulates the flow of information across the network bandara et al 2020 three gates exist within an lstm memory cell namely the forget input and output gates each gate is designated for a specific task while the model is trained the change in state of the memory cell is stored in a conveyor belt like structure called the cell state that keeps track of the information that was retained or discarded these components ensure the preservation of relevant previous information with stable gradient calculation sequentially the first step is the forget gate which tests the relevance of information from the previous state a sigmoid function is applied over the information from the previous state and the resulting value ranges between 0 and 1 a value closer to 1 indicates retention and vice versa when closer to 0 then the input gate decides which portion of the new information is to be added to the cell state while the sigmoid function is again used to maintain the scale of the new information a hyperbolic tangent function is then utilized to rescale it between 1 1 if the computed value from the input gate is negative then the information would be subtracted from the cell state while a positive value indicates addition finally the output gate is used to compute predictions based on the cell state updated by the forget and input gates along with the input from the current time step a schematic diagram of an lstm memory cell is illustrated in fig 2 the aforementioned process inside a memory cell can be represented by the following recursive mathematical expressions bandara et al 2020 hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 vu et al 2021 1 f t σ w f s t 1 u f x t b f i t σ w i s t 1 u i x

biases over the corresponding gates c t denotes memory cell state while s t and s t 1 correspond to outputs at current and previous time steps respectively σ is the logistic sigmoid function additionally the mathematical equation for the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent tanh functions are provided in eq 2 eq 3 respectively bandara et al 2020 solgi et al 2021 2 σ x 1 1 e x 3 tanh x e x e x e x e x all the aforementioned weights and biases are calibrated during the training process in this study the adam optimizer kingma and ba 2015 was utilized to reduce the model prediction errors this optimizer is computationally efficient and requires limited parameter tuning müller et al 2021 which made it the default optimizer for a majority of the applications the optimizer was utilized at its default settings in this research the lstm layer with sigmoid activation was followed by two fully connected hidden layers having relu activation functions after the architectural optimization on the current dataset the objective of the training process was to minimize the mean squared error of the predictions at each epoch the model architecture was implemented using the keras package with tensorflow backend joseph et al 2021 on python 3 9 the model development was carried out on a microsoft windows 11 home system pc coupled with intel core i9 12900 h 3 80 ghz processor and nvidia geforce rtx 3070ti laptop gpu 8 gb vram the lstm model was trained using the gpu due to its added computational advantage observed during the training process 3 3 research methodology a complete

acquisition preprocessing model development assessment of b global and c local model and finally d fine tuning through tl 3 3 1 data preprocessing firstly the uninterrupted daily piezometric heads after subsequent interpolation of missing and faulty values from over 45 monitoring wells between 2013 and 2021 06 were collected data normalization is required before the model development can takes place in this study the minmaxscaler in the scikit learn python package pedregosa et al 2011 was utilized to rescale the varying range of piezometric heads across all wells to a common scale of 0 1 3 3 2 lstm modelling approach the next step is the data driven deep learning model development only lstm was chosen as the primary model in this research due to its superior and proven capabilities in handling time series sequences especially in groundwater research solgi et al 2021 sun et al 2022 vu et al 2021 originally global lstm models were developed 1 global ms lstm where the entire normalized piezometric heads from across all 45 wells were parallelly fed as input columns where all of them were stacked as multi sequence ms and 2 global ss lstm model in which groundwater fluctuations from all wells were given as a single sequence ss here the time series were stacked as a single input column in local lstm models each model was trained on single well data firstly to predict daily groundwater fluctuations at all the remaining wells in the study area each local model is annotated as local lstm well id where well id refers to the single well data used for their training in this study short term groundwater forecasting was proposed in which the past three days piezometric heads were used to forecast the future three days this input output window size was used as a case study to investigate the efficacy of various versions of lstm for short term regional groundwater sequential forecasting the model architectures were designed as per the sequential forecasting requirements where the output dense layer equates to the intended forecasting horizon the mathematical expressions for the proposed modelling approaches are provided in eq 4 5 6 eq 4

improved over wells with high errors using tl in this study the model knowledge in fine training wells was transferred through the weight initialization scheme in poor training wells the process of its implementation in this work is described as follows firstly a local lstm a model trained on data only from well a was used to predict groundwater in the remaining wells after locally assessing its accuracy over each of the remaining wells the wells over which it obtained the rmse value greater than or equal to 0 4 m for the next day time step i e t 1 were considered for selection criteria in the tl for instance this model showed rmse t 1 0 4 m for the forecast in wells c d and e hence the weights for retraining the local lstm a were initialized through another local lstm b model which was trained on well b having a good correlation r 0 9 with wells c d and e in terms of hydraulic heads this tl approach essentially provides an indirect way of transferring information or knowledge from b to the newly trained local lstm a resulting in improved accuracy for groundwater predictions at well locations c d e this new model is referred to as local b lstm a whereas the knowledge in b was transferred to that in a 3 3 4 model validation its evaluation during model calibration process about 20 of the training data was used independently as a validation set to simultaneously assess and prevent overfitting underfitting issues the mean squared error was used as the primary objective function to monitor discrepancies between predicted and observed values during the training process the models were designated to be trained for 200 epochs with an early stopping criterion that terminated it if no improvement in mse was observed for the next 10 epochs in the validation set the weights and biases from the iteration with the best results are retained which were used for predictions on the testing set the predictive capabilities of the models over the testing set were assessed through statistical criteria namely root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and coefficient of determination r2 the mathematical equations for calculating the evaluation metrics over individual wells are provided in eq 7 eq 8 and eq 9 models were assessed by using the average of error values obtained over wells calculated using eqs 10 12 while an overall assessment was subsequently carried out in the modeling 7 rms e i j 1 n h m j h e j 2 n 8 ma e i j 1 n h m j h e j n 9 r i 2 1 j 1 n h m j h e j 2 j 1 n h m j 2 j 1 n h e j 2 n 10 average rmse i 1 φ rms e i φ 11 average mae i 1 φ ma e i

provides an in depth comparison of all the developed models through three statistical evaluation metrics rmse mae and r2 and their average scores over craf for assessing the simulated piezometric heads however the location based assessment of all error metrics is reported except mae since its spatial distribution was identical to rmse firstly a detailed comparison of global models is presented with a corresponding discussion on their performance relative to local models finally a case study for the fine tuning of the local lstm model through tl is presented 4 1 model assessment tables 1 2 provide the average error scores eqs 10 12 obtained through both global lstm models and for three specific local lstm models each located in the upstream proximal well 13 central mid fan well 16 and downstream distal fan area well 30 see the black circle in fig 1 b respectively local models for all 45 wells were developed for the sake of brevity only three local models are discussed here each representing important locations within the groundwater basin the global ms lstm model performed poorly out of all the modeling approaches shown here there was almost over 60 drop in rmse mae and 5 increase in r2 when compared to the global ss lstm model during the testing phase the scores for the further ahead predictions t 2 and t 3 remained considerably superior from the ss model as well with rmse and mae improving by up to 53 and almost 40 while r2 by 5 respectively the global ss lstm network rendered a better forecast by up to 40 in terms of rmse and mae than the global ms lstm moreover the average scores witnessed for the three local lstm models are marginally different from the best global model ss especially the ones trained on wells from proximal well 13 and mid fan well 16 the local models produced better forecasts for next day t 1 predictions while slightly getting close to or worse than the global ss model for t 2 t 3 the average performance score of all the 45 local lstm models over craf can be evidenced through the spatial map for average rmse shown in fig 4 these maps indicate that the local models mostly trained on wells from the mid fan region produced the best regional forecasting results when compared to the ones from the upstream and downstream sides the accuracy got considerably worse when the training was conducted in a monitoring well near the coastline area e g well 30 the spatial error maps of rmse for global and local lstm models using proximal well 13 mid well 16 and distal fan well 30 are provided in figs 5 6 respectively a series of spatial error maps for rmse r2 were prepared to provide a location based model assessment additionally the spatial distribution of r2 obtained from both types of models is shown in fig a1 a2 firstly the global ss lstm model displayed great improvements over the wells located in the mid and distal fan areas in comparison to global ms for instance wells in the mid fan area especially the subsidence zone and the southwestern coast in the yunlin area attributing to high drawdown ali et al 2022 witnessed simulation errors of rmse ranging between 0 5 to well over 1 m see fig 5 a c from the global ms model while the global ss enhanced the simulations by dropping rmse to below 0 5 m over most of the wells fig 5 d f similarly the coastal locations in the center and northern changhua also observed commendable improvements with the global ss lstm model however the local lstm models trained especially only over wells 13 16 were found to have a marginally similar distribution of rmse fig 6 a f as the global ss model previously indicated through average scores tables 1 2 however the performance of the local lstm 30 model fig 6 g i from the coastal side got considerably affected due to serious complexities induced by marine forces and extensive human activities that cause infiltration from nearby fish ponds and pumping wells liu et al 2003 the rmse values here were found to be adversely impacted over the wells located on the southwest coast in yunlin with excessive pumping it is worth noting that all the models showed relatively identical rmse spatial distribution over some wells on the upstream the primary reason could be due to reduced human intervention that almost maintains the natural equilibrium of the groundwater system here and is well captured by the lstm architecture figs 7 8 and 9 display the time series visualizations of 3 day piezometric heads predicted by the two global and three local models for the three randomly selected wells located in the northern coast well 2 upstream well 8 and central subsidence zone well 35 in yunlin area see blue circles in fig 1 b all the plots demonstrated that the ss global model provided the best fit across the stipulated forecasting horizon when all the data was given as input to the lstm model its predictions were better reflected with the rapid daily fluctuations from the original piezometer wells than the ms based lstm model furthermore the prediction time series from local models are highly identical to the global ss especially the local lstm 13 and local lstm 16 however the local lstm 30 sometimes exhibited large errors while predicting extreme values particularly the depletion overall these findings indicate that to develop a regional ai model for groundwater forecasting it may not entirely be necessary to feed all the data into the models to obtain the most optimum prediction results in some areas as shown in this work a local lstm model with local well data can adequately provide short term daily sequential groundwater forecast in near real time scenarios over craf but as mentioned earlier the local models near the coastal side may induce large errors in forecasting hence a rigorous evaluation is required before reaching this conclusion over other aquifers in addition the time series plots for all the 45 local lstm models for predictions over wells 2 8 35 are provided in fig a 3 a 4 a 5 respectively figs 7 8 9 show time series plots for the predictions from the three local lstm models over wells 2 8 35 4 2 fine tuning of local lstm models using tl as described in the previous section few models trained on data from wells in the central coastal area such as the local lstm 30 fig 6 g i near the choushui river stream attained rmse values for t 1 larger than 0 4 m over wells located in the southwest coast i e wells 41 43 44 45 this was used as a case study to propose an effective measure to further fine tune this local model using tl firstly a piezometric well that was highly correlative with wells 41 43 44 45 was chosen as the source domain which was found to be well 34 having a correlation coefficient r of over 0 9 with each of them then the weight initialization scheme was adopted for tl to utilize the advantage of cross domain information the weights were initialized from local lstm 34 to recalibrate the target local model i e local lstm 30 since the weights are initialized from an established model the new local model at well 30 with tl would converge relatively faster and require less data this tl based model was retrained on only 2 years i e 2018 19 and its abbreviations is modified to local 34 lstm 30 based on the initial weights from the well 34 data the average performance of the tl based local lstm model i e local 34 lstm 30 at well 30 is also provided in table 2 the results indicate that tl with an effectively chosen source domain does provide considerable improvements in modeling performance over the target dataset with additional computational benefits for instance the local 34 lstm 30 offered almost 32 t 1 19 t 2 and 12 t 3 better average rmse over local lstm 30 for the testing phase the spatial distribution of the tl based model see fig 6 j l also showed significant improvements in rmse especially over southwest coastal wells well 41 43 44 45 which were the main selection criteria for tl the rmse here improved by at least 16 while the rmse t 1 enhanced by over 40 for some of them the spatial distribution of local 34 lstm 30 fig 6 j l has now become mostly aligned with the distribution from local lstm 13 local lstm 16 fig 6 a f than before fig 6 g i the time series plots for the predictions from the local 34 lstm 30 model are shown in figs 7 8 9 over the three chosen locations also point towards the good results the forecast during late may 2021 improved considerably here moreover the central well 16 and upstream side well 13 wells are still found to be slightly better for groundwater prediction over the entire craf as a whole these results highlight the overarching advantage of adopting tl in the field of ai based groundwater forecasting which is known to be highly suffering from hydrogeological complexity and heterogeneity in many regions around the globe 5 discussion 5 1 efficiency and uncertainty of local lstm for regional groundwater modeling the performance of local lstm models was relatively similar to that of the global ss lstm model at a regional scale even though it was trained only on the local well data while comparing the forecasting results despite the subtle distinction in the groundwater patterns across various monitoring wells over craf the overall trend of the time series was relatively stable especially during the training period while the testing period observed a linear decline during the drought event in early 2021 making them relatively similar furthermore an investigation of their autocorrelation through two additional spatial maps depicting the correlations between groundwater instances at current time step t with up to 2 lags i e t 1 t 2 see fig 10 also revealed that most of the groundwater measurements across wells have an autocorrelation of over 0 95 which means that the correlation between future and past groundwater measurements are considerably high over craf which is similar to the findings of several researches that focused on autoregressive daily groundwater modeling using ai techniques guzman et al 2017 kisi and shiri 2012 solgi et al 2021 this could be the primary reason why the local lstm models showed spatial distribution of rmse r2 scores nearly similar to the global ss lstm model since the overall correlations or the overall trends in the groundwater time series do not vary significantly over a majority of the wells traditionally the groundwater flow model was used in whole region and few data from anywhere were used to calibrate the model parameters in the same way this local model is the representative data driven model since few data from any location was used for training the structure of the input data greatly impacts the calibration of a deep learning model during the network optimization it was found that the model complexity gets severely accentuated in a ms approach since many trainable parameters are required to simultaneously generalize one model on a range of sequential data the global ms lstm model included a total of 16 551 parameters to generalize across several input piezometer wells at once making its hyperparameter tuning difficult the global ms model included 32 nodes each in the lstm layer and its two subsequent hidden layers equipped with sigmoid and relu activation functions respectively in contrast the global ss model consisted of 16 nodes lstm layer 8 nodes 1st hidden layer and 4 nodes 2nd hidden layer with the same layer activation function that needed only 1359 trainable parameters which is a significant drop from the ms approach similarly the local lstm models also included the same network architecture and the number of trainable parameters as the global ss lstm model with no relative compromise on the regional forecasting performance the global ss model posed a serious computational disadvantage since the model calibration took relatively longer due to a drastic increase in sequential size as a result of adding many wells in the single sequence instead of stacking them as separate columns thereby increasing the number of rows for the data by using a local lstm model the training time can be reduced by up to 9 times when compared to the global ss model even though the models had the same number of trainable parameters understanding uncertainties and limitations associated with the local lstm model is essential the local lstm model assumes uniform characteristics across all locations in the study area which may not hold true for other hydrological regions this assumption may lead to some uncertainties in groundwater predictions over far away located monitoring wells if the variations in geological properties and hydrological conditions have significantly impacted the local temporal correlation making it different from the temporal characteristics previously learned by the local model at the training well location moreover the accuracy of groundwater predictions by local lstm models may be affected by uncertainties arising from external factors that were not considered during the development such as the presence and pumping frequency of nearby pumping wells however we have attempted to address these uncertainties through tl approach in the coastal area that provided more stable information during the fine tuning of local model and ultimately led to acceptable improvements 5 2 groundwater forecasting with tl most recently conducted studies for regional groundwater forecasting over multiple wells jeihouni et al 2019 kardan moghaddam et al 2021 nourani et al 2015 sharghi et al 2022 highlighted the necessity of adopting a clustering algorithm for subdividing the groundwater basin with additional reliance on meteorological parameters for monthly forecasts and proceeded without considering subtle daily fluctuations in groundwater these studies did not show the performance of the local model to produce autoregressive groundwater forecasts on remaining wells in their study area to highlight the degree of necessity for a prior clustering scheme in addition the studies that showed the ability of deep learning models for autoregressive daily groundwater forecasting kisi and shiri 2012 solgi et al 2021 only utilized few wells without demonstrating the model s transferability to other larger number of well locations within their respective groundwater basin this work provides a comprehensive comparison of several modeling scenarios of global and local models including the implementation of tl for near real time groundwater sequential prediction at a regional scale which showed that few groundwater basins sometimes may not require such extensive clustering procedures prior to the deep learning model and can be transferred to other locations within the study area if the degree of similarity pertaining to temporal characteristics is preserved some groundwater measurements across wells in the coastal area have a slightly weak autocorrelation less than 0 95 the local models get occasionally affected in the coastal region well 30 which could also be attributed to uncertainties induced by infiltration from nearby fish ponds which is usually the case in coastal areas of craf especially in the yunlin area liu et al 2003 the current work also proposes an effective technique to tackle this phenomenon through the tl approach in deep learning this tl method allows for cross data knowledge transfer and fine tuning of the single well local model in coastal areas the overall improvements table 2 fig 6 j l obtained through this approach with limited data i e only 2 years in contrast to the local lstm model that was trained on 7 years of local well data in the coastal region showcases its superiority and advantages pertaining to fast model convergence for accurate groundwater modeling forecasting in data limited regions these findings were similar to the previous study that implemented tl for other hydrological modeling using lstm kimura et al 2019 ma et al 2021 furthermore it is worthy to point out that the model with data driven techniques did not consider regional pumping and rainfall the in situ data of regional pumping over groundwater basins are hard to be collected however the heads in past time are the responses from regional pumping and rainfall hence this approach based on the historical heads can act as an alternative for practical usage in the local model groundwater prediction relies solely on historical data specific to the local well the prediction of groundwater levels in coastal areas may be sensitive to uncertainties particularly when the temporal correlation of training data is low this can result in poor fitting particularly during periods of high or low peak levels the model potentially contributes towards providing useful information on groundwater patterns that can be used for fine tuning fine tuning is a looped process in the local model this study showed a demo case using fine tuning once in complex cases the fine tuning process is iterative and repeated for various locations 6 conclusion an efficient lstm was proposed to implement for daily regional groundwater sequential forecasting in central taiwan a comprehensive comparison was conducted between global lstm and local lstm to examine the relevance of groundwater sequential forecasting the assessment in this study revealed that the global ms model was the poorest among all the models in the prediction the proposed local lstm models provided marginally identical results to that of the global ss lstm model training time using local lstm model was reduced by up to 9 times when compared to using a global ss model moreover the local lstm models from the mid fan area are found to be the best choice for regional groundwater forecasting over craf results showed that one of the local models was adversely affected when trained on a well located closer to the coastline especially near the choushui river a case study was further proposed to fine tune the local model through a tl approach where the model weights of a highly correlative well from mid fan were utilized to initiate the calibration of this model results showed that the improvements of average rmse values were ranging between 12 to over 30 in the local model with tl the forecasting using lstm especially the local model with high computational efficiency was only achieved through groundwater observations without resorting to any other hydro meteorological or anthropogenic database the findings indicate that the autoregressive deep learning based forecasting over a larger spatial extent may not always require prior preprocessing and heavy training when the temporal autocorrelation does not have significant variance across several locations when the training dataset is located close to the coastline in local lstm the tl can be considered in the low autocorrelation area during the modeling process the tl scheme from a mid fan could be highly beneficial we recommended that the tl is conducted in the local lstm since the forecasting results are subjective to the hydrogeological condition and spatiotemporal relation of the groundwater dataset the model depicted in the future research can extend to long term predictions the tl could be further tested to improve accuracy for a longer forecasting horizon furthermore as this study did not overtly consider other physical characteristics from the groundwater basin or other hydrometeorological anthropogenic parameters a future study can incorporate the tl to further improve the modeling performance additionally the models developed in this work can be further supplemented for time series reconstruction prediction over data scarce regions through tl the extraction of spatio temporal features can be further assessed and enhanced by implementing cnn lstm which is a hybrid deep learning model the tl approach can be further investigated for multi layered aquifer modeling in a future study nonetheless a comprehensive comparison of various model implementation approaches provides useful insights into the modelling of aquifer systems at a much wider spatial range for near real time predictions this contributes to more effective decision making for the most suitable data driven modeling approach over the groundwater basin that is under investigation making it ample for robust water resources monitoring and management credit authorship contribution statement hone jay chu conceptualization writing review editing

7702,study region the source region of the yangtze river sryr study focus precipitation uncertainties significantly impact water resource management while the uncertainties of various precipitation products are not fully investigated due to the lack of observations especially in high altitudinal permafrost areas in this study we selected nine products representing three types of precipitation including gauge based satellite based and merged products and conducted a comprehensive evaluation using regional water balance method and hydrological model simulations new hydrological insights for the region our results indicate most precipitation products can replicate the observed precipitation decreasing trend with increasing elevation below 4500 m but trends vary at higher elevations the gauge based precipitation products with bias correction outperform others while most satellite based products underestimate precipitation the water balance based evaluation shows a merged product tphipr and two gauge based products perform best followed by a satellite based product mswep process based model simulations driven by selected precipitation products can reproduce daily runoff processes well in the entire sryr nse 0 68 0 86 but the performance degraded in the high altitudinal tuotuohe subbasin nse 0 08 0 76 the runoff coefficients comparisons in these two regions also indicate the possible deficiencies of precipitation products in the high altitudinal regions our results highlight the challenges of current precipitation products in characterizing the spatial and temporal precipitation changes in the high altitudinal permafrost regions and call for more accurate products in these areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords precipitation uncertainty tibetan plateau permafrost runoff simulation source region of yangtze river data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp is the source region for many large rivers in asia and is called the asia water tower yao et al 2019 due to the extremely high elevation about 40 and 56 of the areas in the tp are underlain by permafrost and seasonally frozen ground respectively zou et al 2017 rapid soil thawing and permafrost degradation have been found over the tp region under the fast warming trend with potentially large impact on the local hydrological and ecological processes cao et al 2018 cheng and wu 2007 zhao et al 2020 besides the temperature changes variations in the amount and frequency of precipitation can also alter the surface energy balance and soil water storage which can further impact the thermal and hydrological state of the frozen ground therefore accurate knowledge of the precipitation changes is critical for assessing the potential response of permafrost to climate change herold et al 2016 wang et al 2009 yamazaki et al 2006 however it is challenging to construct an accurate precipitation product especially for regions with complex orography such as the tp region many efforts have been made to construct global or regional precipitation datasets using data from ground based gauge observations satellite remote sensing measurements and atmospheric reanalysis products beck et al 2017 michaelides et al 2009 yong et al 2015 gridded precipitation products derived from a single source are usually associated with large uncertainties for example precipitation products constructed from the spatial interpolation of gauge observations are significantly impacted by the gauge distribution ma et al 2020a you et al 2012 satellite based precipitation products usually have a short time span and are subject to various uncertainties such as long revisit time and potential impact of atmospheric contamination on the observations bitew and gebremichael 2011 kidd and levizzani 2011 price et al 2014 on the other hand reanalysis data may not perform well in complex terrains such as the tp liu et al 2018b therefore it is a common practice to merge multi source data to provide precipitation estimates at regional or global scales for different applications such as the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2019 and the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 etc nevertheless the performance of such merged precipitation products may vary considerably especially in the areas with complex terrain and limited ground observations such as the tp permafrost region many studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of precipitation products over the tp region bai and liu 2018 he et al 2021 liu et al 2019 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 which include the characterization of extreme precipitation performance in cold season and capability of representing runoff production process etc as a representative merged product cmfd showed a better performance in detecting precipitation occurrences although it underestimated cold season precipitation zhang et al 2022 compared with gauge observations cmfd slightly underestimated most extreme precipitation indices whereas chirps overestimated most precipitation indices he et al 2021 liu et al 2019 showed that mswep is closer to gauge observations than chirps and both products underestimate low precipitation events but overestimate heavy precipitation events the evaluation results based on hydrological model simulations showed that most precipitation products were able to reproduce the observed runoff after model calibration or parameter adjustment and products constructed from gauge adjusted precipitation observations showed a better performance than the products constructed from unadjusted precipitation observation bai and liu 2018 tong et al 2014 nevertheless most existing studies focused on the overall performance of a few precipitation products over a large area and relatively few evaluations have been conducted in the high altitudinal permafrost watershed the existing evaluations for permafrost watersheds suffer from several limitations most currently available studies evaluated the gridded precipitation products using gauge based observations as the benchmark data however in cold regions with complex terrain the gauge based observations often contain substantial negative biases due to effects such as measurement under catch ma et al 2015 yang et al 2001 the extremely uneven distribution of precipitation gauges in the tp also limits a comprehensive precipitation assessment liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 for example there are very few rain gauges above 4000 m a s l in the tp region where the permafrost is widely distributed ran et al 2021 zou et al 2017 therefore there is still a lack of adequate evaluation of precipitation in the high altitudinal permafrost watersheds previous studies have also evaluated precipitation accuracy by comparing the runoff simulation results with river discharge data bai et al 2018 tong et al 2014 in the tp permafrost watershed the runoff production process is complicated due to the influence of the soil freezing thawing cycle and extremely variable topography therefore permafrost hydrology models that can represent the above processes are needed for such applications moreover some newly released precipitation products for the tp region such as msp multi source precipitation dataset hong et al 2021 and tphipr long term high resolution precipitation dataset jiang et al 2023 have not been fully evaluated therefore a comprehensive understanding of the accuracy of different types of precipitation products in the permafrost dominated watershed of the tp region is still needed in this study we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of various types of precipitation products in a permafrost watershed in the central tp the source region of the yangtze river basin sryr a total of 9 precipitation datasets including three representative types classified based on their construction methods gauge based products satellite based products and regional merged products are selected we first compared the spatial and temporal characteristics of all these products and their altitudinal changes against in situ data over the sryr we then evaluated the evapotranspiration et estimates derived from the precipitation products based on regional water balance and ancillary satellite products finally we used a process based permafrost hydrology model to assess how these precipitation products represent the runoff production process in different altitudinal zones by comparing the model simulated and gauge observed discharges at the outlets of sryr and a subbasin with higher elevation and more permafrost coverage our study aims to provide a detailed assessment of the accuracy of different types of precipitation products in the tp permafrost region 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the source region of the yangtze river basin sryr above the zhimenda station is selected as the study area fig 1 it is located in the central tp region covering an area of 13 78 104 km2 the elevation of sryr ranges from 3504 m a s l in the east to 6393 m a s l in the southwest with a mean elevation of 4752 210 m the climate of the sryr is cold and semi arid with wet and humid summers and cold and dry winters wang et al 2009 influenced by the westerlies and the south asian summer monsoon precipitation mainly occurs from june to august and generally decreases from southeast to northwest li et al 2020 due to the high elevation permafrost is widespread in the sryr permafrost covers 79 1 of the basin area mainly distributed in the high altitudinal regions while the seasonally frozen ground is mainly distributed in the valleys occupying about 20 9 of the total area zou et al 2017 the dominant vegetation types in the sryr are alpine meadow and steppe fig s1 accounting for 56 and 27 of the areas respectively and less than 2 are covered by shrub or coniferous forest mostly located in the southeastern valleys hou 2019 the entire sryr can be divided into four major subbasins i e chumaer in the north damqu in the southern part and tuotuohe and buqu in the west fig 1 in this study we selected the two subbasins with relatively long runoff records for the evaluation namely tuotuohe above tuotuohe station and buqu above yanshiping station the elevations of both the tuotuohe and buqu subbasins are above 4000 m a s l with average elevations of 4945 237 m and 5154 211 m a s l respectively the tuotuohe subbasin has a larger area than the buqu subbasin both the tuotuohe and buqu subbasins are mainly covered by permafrost and glaciers are scattered in the south of the tuotuohe subbasin and the east of the buqu subbasin liu et al 2018a fig 1b details about the two subbasins are provided in table 1 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 precipitation products nine precipitation products table 2 were selected for evaluation in this study which can be divided into three groups based on their construction methods including the gauge based datasets the satellite based datasets and the merged datasets it should be noted that some of the products are not independent of each other as one product may be merged into another one and some of the data sources may be used by different products the three merged products for the tp region including cmfd tphipr and msp are selected in this study although cmfd covers entire china cmfd precipitation is constructed through the fusion of remote sensing products reanalysis dataset and gauge observations including trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission and two gldas global land data assimilation system products he et al 2020 cmfd provides seven near surface meteorological variables including air temperature surface pressure specific humidity windspeed downward shortwave radiation downward longwave radiation and precipitation rate for the period of 1979 2018 cmfd is one of the most widely used meteorological forcing datasets in china chen et al 2015a sun et al 2021 both tphipr and msp are the newly released precipitation products for the tp region tphipr first downscales the era5 precipitation based on a short term wrf weather research and forecasting model simulation and convolutional neural network cnn based downscaling model the downscaled data were then merged with observations from more than 9000 rain gauges in the tp region using climatologically aided interpolation and random forest based method jiang et al 2023 tphipr provides hourly precipitation from 1979 to 2020 at 3 km spatial resolution tphipr has the highest spatial and temporal resolution among the datasets evaluated here msp merges satellite reanalysis and gauge precipitation data including worldclim cmorph trmm imerg etc with the weight of each source dataset determined using artificial neural networks through considering the effects of environmental variables such as elevation and wind speed the dataset provides daily precipitation at 0 1 resolution from 1998 to 2017 hong et al 2021 the satellite based precipitation products incorporate satellite precipitation information with gauge based observations as these products are global in scope they may use limited in situ data in china especially in the tp region imerg integrated multi satellite retrievals for the global precipitation measurement mission is a quasi global 60 s 60 n dataset here we used the final run of its latest version imerg v06 which fuses the early precipitation data collected during the operation of the trmm satellite with more recent precipitation data collected from the gpm global precipitation measurement satellite huffman et al 2015 the chirps and mswep combine reanalysis data with satellite based precipitation retrievals and cover a longer period than imerg final chirps is a quasi global dataset 50 s 50 n which includes multiple data sources including global cold cloud duration rainfall estimates trmm chpclim and in situ station data etc in this study we used the latest version chirps v2 0 which incorporates more stations funk et al 2015 mswep is a newly developed global precipitation dataset beck et al 2019 which merges satellite reanalysis and gauge precipitation data including worldclim cmorph trmm era interim etc different from other products mswep incorporates daily gauge observations and accounts for gauge reporting times minimizing the temporal mismatches between the satellite reanalysis estimates and the gauge observations the latest version mswep v2 8 incorporates new data sources improved weight maps less peaky precipitation estimates and a longer record 1979 2020 we also include three regional gauge based datasets cn05 capd and tps3d in the comparison the cn05 product is constructed using the anomaly approach during the interpolation based on the daily observations from 2416 stations all over china wu and gao 2013 different from cn05 the other two products correct the precipitation bias induced by measurement under catch effects and also try to reduce the influence of the uneven distribution of meteorological stations in the tp and a lack of stations in the extreme high elevation region the capd china alpine region month precipitation dataset includes observation data from the high elevation stations above 4000 m and determines precipitation forms using the in situ temperature and wind speed data chen et al 2015b capd currently only covers the high mountain regions including the qilian mountains tianshan mountains and most areas of the sryr the tps3d frequency distribution improved and wind induced under catch corrected gridded precipitation product employs the thin plate splines interpolation algorithm that considers altitude as a covariate during the spatial interpolation and also corrects the wind induced under catch effects ma et al 2020a 2 2 2 in situ data we collected the gauge observed daily precipitation and runoff data across the sryr region to fully evaluate the performance of selected precipitation datasets there are only four meteorological stations and three hydrological stations that have relatively long data records in the sryr fig 1 the hydrological stations including zhimenda tuotuohe and yanshiping are the outlet stations for the sryr basin the tuotuohe subbasin and the buqu subbasin respectively to facilitate the inter comparison among most precipitation products the period of 1979 2018 was chosen as our study period the availability of all datasets after 1979 is shown in fig 2 it should be noted that there are no discharge observations during the frozen period november to mid may at the tuotuohe and yanshiping stations after 1986 precipitation data measured at the four meteorological stations are from the china meteorological administration and the precipitation observations from 1983 to 1987 at the yanshiping hydrological station are also used to evaluate the altitudinal changes in the annual precipitation due to a lack of data 2 2 3 ancillary datasets we used four evapotranspiration et datasets and terrestrial water storage data from grace gravity recovery and climate experiment to evaluate the precipitation product from the perspective of regional water balance the et products used here include satellite based product modis et mod16a2 500 m running et al 2017 reanalysis product era5 land et 0 1 muñoz sabater et al 2021 and two model based data gleam global land evaporation amsterdam model et martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 and sebs surface energy balance system et han et al 2021 gleam et v3 6 0 25 is constructed using a process based methodology combined with multi satellite observations and sebs et 0 1 is constructed through the combination of meteorological data and satellite products martens et al 2017 all the et products are aggregated to the annual scale the grace product used in this study is from jet propulsion laboratory jpl grace and grace fo mascon ocean ice and hydrology equivalent water height coastal resolution improvement cri filtered datasets with the release 06 and version 02 jpl rl06 v02 it provides monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa at 0 5 from april 2002 to june 2020 to avoid missing data and ensure the continuity of the time series we only used the grace data from 2004 to 2010 in the annual et calculation 2 3 evaluation methods we first compared the spatial and temporal patterns of different precipitation products and examined their altitudinal changes against in situ data then we evaluated the et based on regional water balance and grace data finally we assessed the performance of the runoff simulations using a permafrost hydrology model driven by selected precipitation products 2 3 1 evaluation using gauge based observations the gauge based observations generally underestimate precipitation and should be adjusted before using it as the ground truth based on previous studies yang et al 2001 ye et al 2004 the daily precipitation data can be calculated as 1 p c k p g p w p e p t where pc is the true daily precipitation pg is the gauge observations p w is wetting loss of gauges and can be set as 0 23 mm 0 3 mm and 0 29 mm for rainfall snow and mixed precipitation respectively p e is evaporation loss and is set as 0 mm for rain and 0 1 mm for snow respectively p t is the trace precipitation which is assigned as 0 1 mm regardless the number of trace events in a day k is the adjustment coefficient k 1 for wind induced errors the detailed calculation method of k can be found in the previous studies yang et al 2001 ye et al 2004 the temperature thresholds for precipitation classification here are set as 2 and 2 that is precipitation is classified as snow mixed or rain when the air temperature is below 2 between 2 and 2 or above 2 respectively ye et al 2004 the precipitation data from the four meteorological sites were adjusted using the above method and the mean correction coefficient for the annual precipitation was approximately 1 4 the precipitation data from the hydrological site yanshiping were adjusted using the mean coefficient due to the lack of wind speed and air temperature observations at this site 2 3 2 evaluation based on regional water balance calculation we calculated the regional mean et from different precipitation datasets using the terrestrial water storage from grace and station discharge data based on regional water balance and then compared them with the selected et products to evaluate the precipitation performance the annual et is calculated based on the annual water balance equation 2 et p r s where p is precipitation mm from different datasets r is the observed runoff depth mm and s is the water storage change mm derived from the grace product the original grace data provide twsa between two consecutive months and not the change between the first and last days of each month therefore prior to the water balance calculation the monthly twsa is first converted to respective month change i e terrestrial water storage change twsc through a second order central differencing function mohanasundaram et al 2021 3 twsc n twsa n 1 twsa n 1 2 where twsc n represent the twsc value in month n combined with the runoff observation at the three hydrological stations we calculated the et for the sryr basin the tuotuohe and buqu subbasins and the remaining regions of sryr excluding the two subbasins the et in the buqu subbasin and the remaining region of sryr is only calculated from 2007 to 2010 due to lots of missing data at the yanshiping station the outlet of buqu basin the four et datasets used in this study exhibit distinct differences in the spatial patterns and amplitudes fig s2 therefore we used the ensemble mean of all et products as the reference et in the water balanced evaluation 2 3 3 evaluation based on hydrological model simulation the process based model used in this study is permafrost water balance model pwbm pwbm simulates the soil temperature evolution and soil water movement by solving the 1 d heat transfer equation with phase change and richard s equation respectively jiang et al 2020a rawlins et al 2019 yi et al 2022 model inputs include daily precipitation temperature windspeed shortwave radiation surface pressure and humidity and model outputs include daily soil temperature soil moisture and runoff components the precipitation inputs were provided by the selected products and the other meteorological variables were taken from cmfd the upper boundary for the model was set as the daily land surface temperature lst from the daily 1 km all weather land surface temperature lst dataset for western china zhang et al 2019 the lst prior to 2003 was calculated using cmfd air temperature based on the empirical equations derived using the lst data and air temperature at each grid during the period of 2003 2018 zero flux was set as the lower boundary at 50 m depth the model was spun up for 50 years followed by the transit runs additional details on the model description and model setup can be found in the supplementary a routing model rvic was employed in this study to convert the grid runoff components produced by pwbm to the outlet streamflow rvic is often used as a post processor of the variable infiltration capacity hydrology model it is a source to sink model that solves a linearized saint venant equation lohmann et al 1996 the parameters of rvic include grid based flow direction flow distance and watershed extent which were calculated from 1 km dem data using arcgis hydrology tool due to the limitation of data availability and coarser resolution of several products table 2 fig 2 we selected six out of the nine precipitation products with higher spatial 0 1 and temporal resolution at least daily representing the three types of precipitation products to simulate the daily discharge at zhimenda and tuotuohe outlet stations the yanshiping subbasin was excluded from the runoff simulation due to missing data during the period of 1993 2006 fig 2 the selected products include three merged products cmfd tphipr msp two satellite based products chirps mswep and one gauge based product tps3d the runoff was simulated at the daily time step with the same period as the precipitation inputs within the period from 1979 to 2018 to minimize the influence of parameter calibration on the runoff simulation and precipitation assessment we divided the forcing precipitation dataset into a high precipitation group tphipr and tps3d and a low precipitation group other four datasets for model calibration the most commonly used forcing data cmfd and the new dataset tphipr were used to calibrate selected model parameters in pwbm including the infiltration limit factor mm day root baseflow factor deep baseflow factor and surface flow factor then the same parameters were applied to the runoff simulation driven by the precipitation data from each calibration group all the calibrations are based on the daily runoff observations at the zhimenda site the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse pearson correlation coefficient r and relative bias rb were used for model evaluation defined as below 4 nse 1 i 1 n y sim i y obs i 2 i 1 n y obs i y obs 2 5 r i 1 n y sim i y sim y obs i y obs i 1 n y sim i y sim 2 y obs i y obs 2 6 rb i 1 n y sim i y obs i i 1 n y obs i 100 where the subscripts sim and obs denote the simulation and observation respectively and n is the sample size we also employed the flow duration curve fdc to evaluate the runoff simulation results the fdc is a cumulative frequency curve that shows the percent of time specified discharges equal or exceeded during a given period smakhtin 2001 song et al 2021 here we compared the fdcs calculated from observed and simulated daily runoffs from 1998 to 2009 during which the temporal coverages of the six selected products overlapped fouad and loáiciga 2020 the specific frequency flow associated with fdc qpi indicates the runoff at a given frequency of pi for example q10 represents the runoff occurring at the exceedance probability of 10 i e the peak flow that exceeds the 90th percentile correspondingly we calculated the extremely high precipitation during the same period represented by r90p i e the annual sum of daily precipitation over the 90th percentile from selected products he et al 2021 to evaluate the relations between the extreme precipitation and peak flow 3 results 3 1 regional performance of precipitation products significant differences exist among the precipitation products from different groups and the differences vary with regions fig 3 4 in the entire sryr basin all precipitation products exhibit similar temporal trends from 1979 2018 and show significant correlations with the observed runoff fig 3a and table 3 while the annual precipitation amount varies considerably among the datasets the differences in the annual precipitation mainly come from the warm season precipitation for the merged precipitation products tphipr has overall higher precipitation especially in the mid and lower sryr reaches fig 4b the comparisons of the spatial patterns of cold season nov to apr precipitation also show that tphipr has higher snowfall in the middle reach of sryr fig s3 cmfd and msp have similar precipitation amount however cmfd shows high precipitation in the two high altitudinal subbasins i e the buqu and tuotuohe subbasins and the msp product shows a regionally smoothed pattern with the actual resolution coarser than 0 1º fig 4a c among the satellite based precipitation products imerg final has the lowest amount of annual mean precipitation and chirps shows overall low annual precipitation in the entire sryr especially in the damqu area fig 4d the two gauge based datasets with bias correction capd and tps3d show similar spatial pattern and temporal trends and their regional mean precipitation is very close to each other and higher than the other products except for tphipr it should be noted that there is a small area not covered by capd fig 4 which may have some impact on its regional statistics the differences among these products are more obvious in the high altitudinal subbasins than in the entire sryr the selected precipitation products still show strong correlations with the observed runoff in the tuotuohe subbasin but the correlation coefficients are much lower in the buqu subbasin table 3 where a large number of missing data may lead to a lower temporal correspondence fig 2 the merged dataset tphipr also has the highest precipitation amount in the tuotuohe subbasin but the precipitation differences between tphipr and tps3d or cadp are smaller compared to the sryr basin fig 3a b in the buqu subbasin with higher elevation the gauge based products capd and tps3d show the highest precipitation amount fig 3c the regional mean precipitation from the satellite based products is generally lower than the merged and gauge based precipitation products although mswep has slightly higher precipitation than chirps and imerg final the comparisons of the spatial pattern of extreme precipitation represented by r90p fig s4 indicate that cmfd may overestimate the extremely high precipitation in the high altitudinal regions moreover cmfd shows a similar temporal trend as the other products before 1997 but with a large discrepancy afterwards which may be related to the changes in source data around 1997 he et al 2020 the spatial patterns of the annual and extreme precipitation from different precipitation datasets also show distinct differences in the high altitudinal regions most products show low precipitation in the tuotuohe and buqu subbasins except for capd tps3d tphipr and cmfd fig 4 compared with the gauge based product cn05 without bias correction the other two gauge based products capd and tps3d show relatively high precipitation amount in the south of the tuotuohe subbasin and the buqu subbasin fig 4g i the tphipr product also shows overall high precipitation in these areas fig 4b the above comparisons indicate that satellite based products cannot capture the precipitation variability well particularly in high altitudinal regions except for mswep which exhibits slightly high precipitation in the buqu subbasin fig 4d f 3 2 altitudinal changes in the annual precipitation the annual precipitation from the nine selected products is generally well correlated with bias adjusted gauge observations at the four meteorological sites fig 5 with correlation coefficients greater than 0 75 but with noticeable biases almost all the precipitation products underestimate the true precipitation at the four sites and the underestimation is generally more obvious at the high altitudinal sites e g wudaoliang than that at the low altitudinal sites e g yushu for the merged precipitation products cmfd and msp underestimate the annual precipitations at the four sites but cmfd has the highest correlation coefficients with the gauge data fig 5a this is likely because most of the gauge observed precipitation data shown here were included in the cmfd production process he et al 2020 tphipr shows the smallest relative bias of 7 4 fig 5b however it significantly overestimates the precipitation amount at the yushu site with the lowest elevation 3682 2 m a s l while slightly underestimates the precipitation at the other sites the satellite based products particularly the chirps and imerg final exhibit overall significant negative biases fig 5d e especially at the wudaoliang site 4614 2 m a s l mswep has a better performance with a relative bias of 18 0 and the negative bias mainly comes from the underestimation of precipitation at the wudaoliang site fig 5f compared with the other two groups the gauge based precipitation products exhibit the best performance especially capd and tps3d which are closest to the gauge based true precipitation with relative biases of 10 4 and 8 3 respectively fig 5h i the altitudinal changes of annual precipitation are similar between the selected products and gauge based observations fig 6 here we also included the observations from the hydrological site yanshiping 4690 m a s l both adjusted and original annual precipitation data from the gauges show the same altitudinal variations the annual precipitation decreases with increasing elevation below 4500 m a s l while above 4500 m precipitation slightly increases with elevation the precipitation products show overall similar altitudinal changes with gauge based observations below 4500 m but significant differences exist among these products above 4500 m particularly cmfd precipitation varies dramatically from year to year in regions above 5000 m the contrasting vertical gradients below and above 4500 m are not obvious in tphipr as the other products fig 6b and tphipr generally shows slightly higher precipitation amount than the adjusted gauge based observations especially at the mid and lower altitudinal regions different from other products msp and imerg final show a decreasing vertical gradient above 5600 m however the altitudinal changes of precipitation in the higher elevations above 4700 m remain unknown due to the lack of observations above this elevation satellite based datasets chirps and mswep show similar altitudinal changes but chirps shows a more pronounced negative bias as shown in fig 5 the gauge based products are closer to the gauge observations than other precipitation products except for cn05 3 3 precipitation evaluation using regional water balance calculation the ensemble mean of annual et derived from four selected et products modis era5 lnad sebs estimated and gleam was used as the benchmark dataset to evaluate the et estimates derived from different precipitation products using the regional water balance approach fig 7 the et estimates derived from tphipr and gauge based precipitation products capd and tps3d perform best followed by mswep while other satellite based products significantly underestimate the et except for the buqu subbasin indicating an overall underestimation of regional precipitation fig 7b for the gauge based precipitation products both tps3d et and capd et are closer to the et ensemble mean than the cn05 et in the entire sryr and the tuotuohe subbasin fig 7a b other products underestimate the precipitation in the high altitudinal zone except for cmfd and tphipr but the high cmfd et estimates may result from its overestimation of high altitudinal extreme precipitation as described in section 3 1 tphipr et shows a higher amount than the other estimates in the remaining regions of the sryr fig 6d which may also indicate its overestimation of precipitation in the mid and lower reaches of sryr it should be noted that the area of the buqu subbasin is only 4256 km2 considering the coarse spatial resolution of grace data the et estimates using the water balance approach and grace data may have a large uncertainty in this subbasin 3 4 precipitation evaluation using permafrost hydrology model simulations using a process based permafrost hydrology model and gauge observed discharge data we further assessed the accuracy of different precipitation products the results show that model simulations using the selected precipitation products can reproduce the runoff process well in the sryr region fig 8 the nses of daily runoff simulations from all the products are above 0 7 table 4 except for mswep nse 0 68 which is likely due to the overestimation of precipitation in 1992 fig 3a however model simulations show degraded performance in the tuotuohe subbasin which likely indicates larger uncertainties in the precipitation datasets in the high altitudinal regions almost all simulations underestimate the runoff in the tuotuohe subbasin mainly shown as an underestimation in the peak flow table 5 and fig s5 the simulations using msp product underestimate the runoff most severely with a negative bias of 76 cmfd shows the lowest nse which can be attributed to the extremely high precipitation amount in the high altitudinal zones resulting in extremely high discharge after the year 2000 table s1 tphipr and mswep show the best performance in the tuotuohe subbasin among all precipitation products which is consistent with the above precipitation evaluation using gauge based precipitation observations the flow duration curve can better reflect the bias between the discharge simulations and observations fig 9 the results show that most products overestimate the high flows q10 to q30 while slightly underestimate the medium flows q40 to q60 for the entire sryr basin fig 9a which however is not observed in the tuotuohe subbasin the comparisons of peak flow q10 also reveal the differences among the selected precipitation products the results show that simulations using most precipitation products overestimate the peak flow for the entire sryr but underestimate the peak flow in the tuotuohe subbasin except for the simulations based on the cmfd product this may imply that most products underestimate the precipitation in the high altitudinal region in general tps3d and mswep show better performance for peak flow simulation than the other products in the high altitudinal region probably because the orographic impacts are better captured in these two products the relations between extreme precipitation r90p and observed peak flow in the entire sryr and tuotuohe subbasin were also compared table 6 the results show that during the period of 1998 2008 r90p derived from most precipitation products shows a high correlation with the observed peak flow except for chirps and cmfd cmfd shows a very low correlation in the tuotuohe subbasin r 0 33 which may be because cmfd greatly overestimates precipitation in this region shown as extremely high precipitation as discussed above we further calculated the peak runoff coefficients by dividing the accumulated runoff depth corresponding to q10 by r90p within the same year and compared it with the annual runoff coefficients fig 10 the results show that annual runoff coefficients in the entire sryr and the tuotuohe subbasin are close with less interannual variability compared to the peak runoff coefficients fig 10b however all selected products exhibit higher peak runoff coefficients in the tuotuohe subbasin than in the entire sryr msp and chirps show higher runoff coefficients for the peak flow due to lower precipitation amount of these two products 4 discussion 4 1 the overall performance of different types of precipitation products we have evaluated nine precipitation products in the sryr region representing three types of products gauge based satellite based and merged precipitation products our results show that large discrepancies exist among these products particularly in the high altitudinal zones in general the gauge based precipitation products show better performance than the satellite based and merged precipitation products especially for the two gauge based products with bias correction i e capd and tps3d fig 3 4 a previous study also demonstrated that the capd performed well in a permafrost basin the upper reach of shule river basin with elevation ranges from 2081 m to 5764 m a s l wu et al 2021 in our study the annual precipitation from capd and tps3d is closer to the true precipitation derived from the gauge observations fig 5h i the annual et derived from capd and tps3d based on regional water balance is also more consistent with the ensemble mean of four commonly used et products fig 7 these results demonstrate that bias correction of rain gauge under catch can effectively enhance the accuracy of precipitation estimates the satellite based precipitation products generally underestimate the precipitation amount especially in the high altitudinal regions fig 5d f previous studies found that imerg significantly underestimates hourly precipitation rates in the tp ma et al 2018 and the overall performance declines in winter and with increasing elevations sui et al 2020 xu et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 our results also show that satellite based products do not capture the spatial variability of precipitation in the high altitudinal region well fig 4 and fig 6 and underestimate the cold season precipitation fig s3 d e nevertheless another satellite based product mswep shows relatively better performance compared with the other two consistent with previous studies bai and liu 2018 liu et al 2019 the performance of merged precipitation products varies depending on the region and temporal period evaluated among the three selected merged products msp has relatively lower precipitation values and shows less spatial variability compared with the other two products fig 4c msp show similar spatial pattern and altitudinal changes as imerg final fig 4c e fig 6c e but the gauge based comparisons fig 5 show that msp has improved performance cmfd is a widely used meteorological dataset in china and a number of studies have evaluated its performance in the tp region he et al 2021 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 these results generally show that cmfd outperforms other products including chirps and imerg our results also show that cmfd has the highest correlations with the bias corrected gauge observations however we found that in the high altitudinal regions where gauge data are missing cmfd may over adjust the precipitation amount especially for the extreme precipitation events represented by r90p in fig s4 the newly released merged product produced by the same group tphipr shows a good performance from the perspective of regional water balance and runoff simulations considering its high spatial 3 km and temporal hourly resolution tphipr would be recommended for future hydrologic studies in the tp region however our evaluation also indicates that tphipr likely overestimate the precipitation amount in the lower altitudinal regions of sryr figs 5 6 as an example tphipr shows a much higher amount of snow in the middle reach of sryr than other products fig s3 compared with modis snow cover data figs s3 s6 as a summary among the evaluated precipitation products tps3d and capd demonstrated better performance followed by tphipr and mswep the superior performance of the former two products might be attributed to the bias correction on rain gauge under catch especially in the high altitudinal regions as for the other two products tphipr includes more than 9000 gauges with measurement errors corrected using empirical methods moreover the climatologically aided interpolation methodology used in tphipr can help to capture spatial variability in the anomalies or ratios that may not be captured by the climatology data alone which may also improve its performance jiang et al 2023 mswep accounts for the influence of convective precipitation and frontal precipitation regimes and also minimizes the temporal mismatches between the satellite reanalysis estimates and gauge observations through considering gauge reporting times beck et al 2019 these factors may contribute to the improved performance of mswep there are some new precipitation products that are not evaluated here but may be also useful in tp hydrologic applications for example zhu et al 2022 proposed a new precipitation merging method that considers rain events during the merging process and merged multisource precipitation in southern china their results demonstrated that including rain events during the precipitation construction can improve the quality of the merging product further evaluation on the potential contribution of this process to precipitation data quality in the tibetan plateau is needed 4 2 altitudinal changes and permafrost hydrology applications of different precipitation products the examined precipitation products show inconsistent altitudinal changes and considerable uncertainties exist in the precipitation estimates at elevations above 4500 m precipitation in the mountain terrain shows strong variability and the variability is largely driven by altitudinal changes hughes et al 2009 kumari et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the altitudinal changes in the precipitation are complex and can vary substantially across different tp regions for instance lan et al 2015 analyzed gauge based data and found that the wet season precipitation decreased with elevation in the tp region above 4000 m a s l although the observations at higher elevations above 4500 m a s l are limited wu et al 2021 found that annual precipitation in the qilian mountains of northern tp increases with elevation from 2433 m to 4156 m a s l while li et al 2021 found that imerg annual precipitation gradually decreases with increasing elevation in the tanggula mountains overlapping with our study area in our study area annual precipitation decreases with increasing elevation for the elevation zone from 3700 4500 m a s l and most selected precipitation products show similar trends in this elevation zone however we found a turning point at around 4500 m a s l which is not shown in previous studies the gauge based annual precipitation slightly increases at the elevation zone above 4500 m while trends in the selected precipitation products vary fig 6 however since there are only two sites above 4500 m wudaoliang and yanshiping with very limited observations at yanshiping 1982 1987 the altitudinal changes of precipitation in the elevations above 4500 m remain largely unknown permafrost in the tp is mainly distributed in the areas above 4000 m ran et al 2021 zou et al 2017 therefore accurate precipitation data in the high altitudinal regions are important for understanding the underlying processes driving the changes in the tp permafrost thermal and hydrological state the pwbm model simulations usingselected precipitation products generally can reproduce the daily runoff in the sryr well table 4 but with degrading performance in the tuotuo subbasin where the elevation is higher and permafrost coverage is larger the selected precipitation products show similar annual runoff coefficients in the sryr basin and the tuotuohe subbasin but exhibit higher runoff coefficients for the peak runoff in the tuotuohe subbasin than in the sryr the annual mean and peak season runoff coefficients are mostly determined by the precipitation amount which may suggest that most products evaluated here especially chirps and msp underestimate the extreme precipitation in the high altitudinal zones nevertheless the runoff coefficients in the sryr and the tuotuohe subbasin are likely different due to their differences in topography and permafrost coverage which needs further investigation 4 3 uncertainties in the evaluation process we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation through combining gauge based comparison water balance calculation and process based model simulations to fully understand the uncertainties associated with different types of precipitation products however uncertainties may be still associated with the evaluation process gauge observations substantially underestimate the true precipitation in the mountain area due to effects such as measurement under catch and therefore need bias correction ma et al 2015 yang et al 2001 in this study a method proposed by yang et al 2001 was introduced to adjust the gauge based precipitation our results show that the correction factor of the annual mean precipitation is approximately 1 4 at the four meteorological sites in the sryr which is close to the findings in the previous study ma et al 2015 however the bias correction is based on a few assumptions including using mean values to represent daily trace and wetting losses and the values are likely conservative ye et al 2004 more reliable bias correction methods for gauge based precipitation are needed for high mountain regions the gauge based comparison results indicate that most products particularly satellite based products chirps and imerg final underestimate the precipitation however the precipitation observations in the sryr are extremely limited and the evaluation results at a single watershed may not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy of these datasets for instance two merged products aera5 asia a long term asian precipitation dataset and aimerg asian precipitation dataset with high quality and spatiotemporal resolution show similar performance to imerg final in our study area figs s7 s8 but previous studies indicated better performance of these two datasets than imerg final in other regions such as southern china ma et al 2022 2020b in addition the gauge observations from the cma stations should be already included in the construction process of most precipitation products such as cmfd and tps3d which therefore may not provide a completely independent evaluation the grace twsc and several et products were used to evaluate the precipitation products based on regional water balance the grace twsc was used to represent the water storage change in the water balance calculation however some errors may be non negligible in the grace data processing such as the leakage error especially for a small region chen et al 2021 the coarse resolution of the grace product native resolution 3º watkins et al 2015 is a limiting factor for regional water balance calculation in a small watershed particularly the buqu subbasin in addition the glaciers distributed in the south of the tuotuohe subbasin and the east of the buqu subbasin fig 1 may affect the twsc calculation to some extent which is not considered in our study on the other hand there are large differences in the magnitude and spatial patterns of the selected et products han et al 2021 and the accuracy of the et products will affect the evaluation results modis and era5 land et products show a similar regional mean of annual et while the annual et from gleam is much lower and sebs et is much higher resulting in the ensemble mean of annual et close to the estimates of modis and era5 land et products fig s2 more investigations are needed to evaluate the accuracy of different et products in the tp permafrost region and characterize their uncertainty in the tp permafrost region we also evaluated the precipitation uncertainties through comparing the runoff simulations using a process based permafrost hydrology model and gauge discharge data the rationale for this method is based on the assumption that the errors of precipitation can be propagated into the simulated runoff series bai et al 2018 su et al 2008 in this study we tried to minimize the influence of model parameter calibration on the precipitation evaluation process however the model calibration process likely corrects errors or biases in the precipitation products to some extent through parameter adjustment price et al 2014 although the runoff simulation results are overall acceptable the simulations of different water balance components driven by different products may differ bai and liu 2018 our simulations show that pwbm model driven by different precipitation products can reproduce the daily runoff in the sryr well while the runoff simulations in the tuotuohe subbasin are not as good as in the entire basin the discrepancies between the runoff observations and simulations in the tuotuohe subbasin may partly reflect the precipitation differences while other factors may also play a role hydrological simulation in the high altitudinal permafrost basins is challenging due to potential model structural deficiencies and data shortage jiang et al 2020b uncertainties in the model representation of the permafrost hydrologic processes including oversimplified parameterization of deep soil properties and insufficient characterization on the effects of soil freeze and thaw process on runoff production in high altitudinal region likely contribute to the above discrepancy the pwbm model used in this study has a detailed representation of soil heat transfer and soil water migration while the representation of groundwater movement is relatively simple rawlins et al 2019 yi et al 2022 moreover the impacts of glaciers in the southern tuotuohe basin and the influence of heterogeneous topography on the runoff production process are not fully considered in the pwbm model 5 conclusion in this study we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine selected precipitation products in a tibetan plateau permafrost basin i e the source region of the yangtze river the selected precipitation datasets represent three types of precipitation products including the tp merged products cmfd msp tphipr the satellite based products chirps imerg final mswep and gauge based products cn05 tps3d caps our results show that most products underestimate the precipitation in the high altitudinal regions and distinct differences exist among the products especially in the representation of extreme precipitation events the recently released merged product tphipr shows a good performance based on evaluation using regional water balance approach and hydrological model simulations but may slightly overestimate precipitation in the mid and lower reaches of sryr while the previously release merged product cmfd may have over adjusted the extreme precipitation amount at high elevations one satellite based product mswep has a better performance compared with the other satellite based products chirps and imerg final which significantly underestimate the regional precipitation two gauge based precipitation products with bias correction capd and tps3d also show overall improved performance than the other gauge based dataset cn05 without bias correction especially in the high altitudinal regions the hydrological simulations show that most selected precipitation products have overall acceptable performance in the entire sryr basin while the simulations in the tuotuohe subbasin with higher elevation and larger permafrost coverage are not as good as in the entire basin the runoff coefficients comparisons in these two regions reveal that most evaluated products underestimate the extreme precipitation in the high altitudinal zones in summary the two gauge based products with bias corrections i e capd and tps3d outperformed the other products the other two products tphipr and mswep perform reasonably well and show great potential in regional studies with their higher spatial and temporal resolutions as long as the bias issue can be addressed our results highlight the challenges of current products in characterizing precipitation variability for the high altitudinal permafrost regions we call for more gauge observations especially in the higher elevation zone e g above 4500 m a s l in our study area to better characterize the altitudinal changes in the precipitation and development of more accurate precipitation estimates to better understand permafrost hydrological responses to climate change credit authorship contribution statement huiru jiang formal analysis visualization

7702,study region the source region of the yangtze river sryr study focus precipitation uncertainties significantly impact water resource management while the uncertainties of various precipitation products are not fully investigated due to the lack of observations especially in high altitudinal permafrost areas in this study we selected nine products representing three types of precipitation including gauge based satellite based and merged products and conducted a comprehensive evaluation using regional water balance method and hydrological model simulations new hydrological insights for the region our results indicate most precipitation products can replicate the observed precipitation decreasing trend with increasing elevation below 4500 m but trends vary at higher elevations the gauge based precipitation products with bias correction outperform others while most satellite based products underestimate precipitation the water balance based evaluation shows a merged product tphipr and two gauge based products perform best followed by a satellite based product mswep process based model simulations driven by selected precipitation products can reproduce daily runoff processes well in the entire sryr nse 0 68 0 86 but the performance degraded in the high altitudinal tuotuohe subbasin nse 0 08 0 76 the runoff coefficients comparisons in these two regions also indicate the possible deficiencies of precipitation products in the high altitudinal regions our results highlight the challenges of current precipitation products in characterizing the spatial and temporal precipitation changes in the high altitudinal permafrost regions and call for more accurate products in these areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords precipitation uncertainty tibetan plateau permafrost runoff simulation source region of yangtze river data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp is the source region for many large rivers in asia and is called the asia water tower yao et al 2019 due to the extremely high elevation about 40 and 56 of the areas in the tp are underlain by permafrost and seasonally frozen ground respectively zou et al 2017 rapid soil thawing and permafrost degradation have been found over the tp region under the fast warming trend with potentially large impact on the local hydrological and ecological processes cao et al 2018 cheng and wu 2007 zhao et al 2020 besides the temperature changes variations in the amount and frequency of precipitation can also alter the surface energy balance and soil water storage which can further impact the thermal and hydrological state of the frozen ground therefore accurate knowledge of the precipitation changes is critical for assessing the potential response of permafrost to climate change herold et al 2016 wang et al 2009 yamazaki et al 2006 however it is challenging to construct an accurate precipitation product especially for regions with complex orography such as the tp region many efforts have been made to construct global or regional precipitation datasets using data from ground based gauge observations satellite remote sensing measurements and atmospheric reanalysis products beck et al 2017 michaelides et al 2009 yong et al 2015 gridded precipitation products derived from a single source are usually associated with large uncertainties for example precipitation products constructed from the spatial interpolation of gauge observations are significantly impacted by the gauge distribution ma et al 2020a you et al 2012 satellite based precipitation products usually have a short time span and are subject to various uncertainties such as long revisit time and potential impact of atmospheric contamination on the observations bitew and gebremichael 2011 kidd and levizzani 2011 price et al 2014 on the other hand reanalysis data may not perform well in complex terrains such as the tp liu et al 2018b therefore it is a common practice to merge multi source data to provide precipitation estimates at regional or global scales for different applications such as the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2019 and the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 etc nevertheless the performance of such merged precipitation products may vary considerably especially in the areas with complex terrain and limited ground observations such as the tp permafrost region many studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of precipitation products over the tp region bai and liu 2018 he et al 2021 liu et al 2019 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 which include the characterization of extreme precipitation performance in cold season and capability of representing runoff production process etc as a representative merged product cmfd showed a better performance in detecting precipitation occurrences although it underestimated cold season precipitation zhang et al 2022 compared with gauge observations cmfd slightly underestimated most extreme precipitation indices whereas chirps overestimated most precipitation indices he et al 2021 liu et al 2019 showed that mswep is closer to gauge observations than chirps and both products underestimate low precipitation events but overestimate heavy precipitation events the evaluation results based on hydrological model simulations showed that most precipitation products were able to reproduce the observed runoff after model calibration or parameter adjustment and products constructed from gauge adjusted precipitation observations showed a better performance than the products constructed from unadjusted precipitation observation bai and liu 2018 tong et al 2014 nevertheless most existing studies focused on the overall performance of a few precipitation products over a large area and relatively few evaluations have been conducted in the high altitudinal permafrost watershed the existing evaluations for permafrost watersheds suffer from several limitations most currently available studies evaluated the gridded precipitation products using gauge based observations as the benchmark data however in cold regions with complex terrain the gauge based observations often contain substantial negative biases due to effects such as measurement under catch ma et al 2015 yang et al 2001 the extremely uneven distribution of precipitation gauges in the tp also limits a comprehensive precipitation assessment liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 for example there are very few rain gauges above 4000 m a s l in the tp region where the permafrost is widely distributed ran et al 2021 zou et al 2017 therefore there is still a lack of adequate evaluation of precipitation in the high altitudinal permafrost watersheds previous studies have also evaluated precipitation accuracy by comparing the runoff simulation results with river discharge data bai et al 2018 tong et al 2014 in the tp permafrost watershed the runoff production process is complicated due to the influence of the soil freezing thawing cycle and extremely variable topography therefore permafrost hydrology models that can represent the above processes are needed for such applications moreover some newly released precipitation products for the tp region such as msp multi source precipitation dataset hong et al 2021 and tphipr long term high resolution precipitation dataset jiang et al 2023 have not been fully evaluated therefore a comprehensive understanding of the accuracy of different types of precipitation products in the permafrost dominated watershed of the tp region is still needed in this study we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of various types of precipitation products in a permafrost watershed in the central tp the source region of the yangtze river basin sryr a total of 9 precipitation datasets including three representative types classified based on their construction methods gauge based products satellite based products and regional merged products are selected we first compared the spatial and temporal characteristics of all these products and their altitudinal changes against in situ data over the sryr we then evaluated the evapotranspiration et estimates derived from the precipitation products based on regional water balance and ancillary satellite products finally we used a process based permafrost hydrology model to assess how these precipitation products represent the runoff production process in different altitudinal zones by comparing the model simulated and gauge observed discharges at the outlets of sryr and a subbasin with higher elevation and more permafrost coverage our study aims to provide a detailed assessment of the accuracy of different types of precipitation products in the tp permafrost region 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the source region of the yangtze river basin sryr above the zhimenda station is selected as the study area fig 1 it is located in the central tp region covering an area of 13 78 104 km2 the elevation of sryr ranges from 3504 m a s l in the east to 6393 m a s l in the southwest with a mean elevation of 4752 210 m the climate of the sryr is cold and semi arid with wet and humid summers and cold and dry winters wang et al 2009 influenced by the westerlies and the south asian summer monsoon precipitation mainly occurs from june to august and generally decreases from southeast to northwest li et al 2020 due to the high elevation permafrost is widespread in the sryr permafrost covers 79 1 of the basin area mainly distributed in the high altitudinal regions while the seasonally frozen ground is mainly distributed in the valleys occupying about 20 9 of the total area zou et al 2017 the dominant vegetation types in the sryr are alpine meadow and steppe fig s1 accounting for 56 and 27 of the areas respectively and less than 2 are covered by shrub or coniferous forest mostly located in the southeastern valleys hou 2019 the entire sryr can be divided into four major subbasins i e chumaer in the north damqu in the southern part and tuotuohe and buqu in the west fig 1 in this study we selected the two subbasins with relatively long runoff records for the evaluation namely tuotuohe above tuotuohe station and buqu above yanshiping station the elevations of both the tuotuohe and buqu subbasins are above 4000 m a s l with average elevations of 4945 237 m and 5154 211 m a s l respectively the tuotuohe subbasin has a larger area than the buqu subbasin both the tuotuohe and buqu subbasins are mainly covered by permafrost and glaciers are scattered in the south of the tuotuohe subbasin and the east of the buqu subbasin liu et al 2018a fig 1b details about the two subbasins are provided in table 1 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 precipitation products nine precipitation products table 2 were selected for evaluation in this study which can be divided into three groups based on their construction methods including the gauge based datasets the satellite based datasets and the merged datasets it should be noted that some of the products are not independent of each other as one product may be merged into another one and some of the data sources may be used by different products the three merged products for the tp region including cmfd tphipr and msp are selected in this study although cmfd covers entire china cmfd precipitation is constructed through the fusion of remote sensing products reanalysis dataset and gauge observations including trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission and two gldas global land data assimilation system products he et al 2020 cmfd provides seven near surface meteorological variables including air temperature surface pressure specific humidity windspeed downward shortwave radiation downward longwave radiation and precipitation rate for the period of 1979 2018 cmfd is one of the most widely used meteorological forcing datasets in china chen et al 2015a sun et al 2021 both tphipr and msp are the newly released precipitation products for the tp region tphipr first downscales the era5 precipitation based on a short term wrf weather research and forecasting model simulation and convolutional neural network cnn based downscaling model the downscaled data were then merged with observations from more than 9000 rain gauges in the tp region using climatologically aided interpolation and random forest based method jiang et al 2023 tphipr provides hourly precipitation from 1979 to 2020 at 3 km spatial resolution tphipr has the highest spatial and temporal resolution among the datasets evaluated here msp merges satellite reanalysis and gauge precipitation data including worldclim cmorph trmm imerg etc with the weight of each source dataset determined using artificial neural networks through considering the effects of environmental variables such as elevation and wind speed the dataset provides daily precipitation at 0 1 resolution from 1998 to 2017 hong et al 2021 the satellite based precipitation products incorporate satellite precipitation information with gauge based observations as these products are global in scope they may use limited in situ data in china especially in the tp region imerg integrated multi satellite retrievals for the global precipitation measurement mission is a quasi global 60 s 60 n dataset here we used the final run of its latest version imerg v06 which fuses the early precipitation data collected during the operation of the trmm satellite with more recent precipitation data collected from the gpm global precipitation measurement satellite huffman et al 2015 the chirps and mswep combine reanalysis data with satellite based precipitation retrievals and cover a longer period than imerg final chirps is a quasi global dataset 50 s 50 n which includes multiple data sources including global cold cloud duration rainfall estimates trmm chpclim and in situ station data etc in this study we used the latest version chirps v2 0 which incorporates more stations funk et al 2015 mswep is a newly developed global precipitation dataset beck et al 2019 which merges satellite reanalysis and gauge precipitation data including worldclim cmorph trmm era interim etc different from other products mswep incorporates daily gauge observations and accounts for gauge reporting times minimizing the temporal mismatches between the satellite reanalysis estimates and the gauge observations the latest version mswep v2 8 incorporates new data sources improved weight maps less peaky precipitation estimates and a longer record 1979 2020 we also include three regional gauge based datasets cn05 capd and tps3d in the comparison the cn05 product is constructed using the anomaly approach during the interpolation based on the daily observations from 2416 stations all over china wu and gao 2013 different from cn05 the other two products correct the precipitation bias induced by measurement under catch effects and also try to reduce the influence of the uneven distribution of meteorological stations in the tp and a lack of stations in the extreme high elevation region the capd china alpine region month precipitation dataset includes observation data from the high elevation stations above 4000 m and determines precipitation forms using the in situ temperature and wind speed data chen et al 2015b capd currently only covers the high mountain regions including the qilian mountains tianshan mountains and most areas of the sryr the tps3d frequency distribution improved and wind induced under catch corrected gridded precipitation product employs the thin plate splines interpolation algorithm that considers altitude as a covariate during the spatial interpolation and also corrects the wind induced under catch effects ma et al 2020a 2 2 2 in situ data we collected the gauge observed daily precipitation and runoff data across the sryr region to fully evaluate the performance of selected precipitation datasets there are only four meteorological stations and three hydrological stations that have relatively long data records in the sryr fig 1 the hydrological stations including zhimenda tuotuohe and yanshiping are the outlet stations for the sryr basin the tuotuohe subbasin and the buqu subbasin respectively to facilitate the inter comparison among most precipitation products the period of 1979 2018 was chosen as our study period the availability of all datasets after 1979 is shown in fig 2 it should be noted that there are no discharge observations during the frozen period november to mid may at the tuotuohe and yanshiping stations after 1986 precipitation data measured at the four meteorological stations are from the china meteorological administration and the precipitation observations from 1983 to 1987 at the yanshiping hydrological station are also used to evaluate the altitudinal changes in the annual precipitation due to a lack of data 2 2 3 ancillary datasets we used four evapotranspiration et datasets and terrestrial water storage data from grace gravity recovery and climate experiment to evaluate the precipitation product from the perspective of regional water balance the et products used here include satellite based product modis et mod16a2 500 m running et al 2017 reanalysis product era5 land et 0 1 muñoz sabater et al 2021 and two model based data gleam global land evaporation amsterdam model et martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 and sebs surface energy balance system et han et al 2021 gleam et v3 6 0 25 is constructed using a process based methodology combined with multi satellite observations and sebs et 0 1 is constructed through the combination of meteorological data and satellite products martens et al 2017 all the et products are aggregated to the annual scale the grace product used in this study is from jet propulsion laboratory jpl grace and grace fo mascon ocean ice and hydrology equivalent water height coastal resolution improvement cri filtered datasets with the release 06 and version 02 jpl rl06 v02 it provides monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa at 0 5 from april 2002 to june 2020 to avoid missing data and ensure the continuity of the time series we only used the grace data from 2004 to 2010 in the annual et calculation 2 3 evaluation methods we first compared the spatial and temporal patterns of different precipitation products and examined their altitudinal changes against in situ data then we evaluated the et based on regional water balance and grace data finally we assessed the performance of the runoff simulations using a permafrost hydrology model driven by selected precipitation products 2 3 1 evaluation using gauge based observations the gauge based observations generally underestimate precipitation and should be adjusted before using it as the ground truth based on previous studies yang et al 2001 ye et al 2004 the daily precipitation data can be calculated as 1 p c k p g p w p e p t where pc is the true daily precipitation pg is the gauge observations p w is wetting loss of gauges and can be set as 0 23 mm 0 3 mm and 0 29 mm for rainfall snow and mixed precipitation respectively p e is evaporation loss and is set as 0 mm for rain and 0 1 mm for snow respectively p t is the trace precipitation which is assigned as 0 1 mm regardless the number of trace events in a day k is the adjustment coefficient k 1 for wind induced errors the detailed calculation method of k can be found in the previous studies yang et al 2001 ye et al 2004 the temperature thresholds for precipitation classification here are set as 2 and 2 that is precipitation is classified as snow mixed or rain when the air temperature is below 2 between 2 and 2 or above 2 respectively ye et al 2004 the precipitation data from the four meteorological sites were adjusted using the above method and the mean correction coefficient for the annual precipitation was approximately 1 4 the precipitation data from the hydrological site yanshiping were adjusted using the mean coefficient due to the lack of wind speed and air temperature observations at this site 2 3 2 evaluation based on regional water balance calculation we calculated the regional mean et from different precipitation datasets using the terrestrial water storage from grace and station discharge data based on regional water balance and then compared them with the selected et products to evaluate the precipitation performance the annual et is calculated based on the annual water balance equation 2 et p r s where p is precipitation mm from different datasets r is the observed runoff depth mm and s is the water storage change mm derived from the grace product the original grace data provide twsa between two consecutive months and not the change between the first and last days of each month therefore prior to the water balance calculation the monthly twsa is first converted to respective month change i e terrestrial water storage change twsc through a second order central differencing function mohanasundaram et al 2021 3 twsc n twsa n 1 twsa n 1 2 where twsc n represent the twsc value in month n combined with the runoff observation at the three hydrological stations we calculated the et for the sryr basin the tuotuohe and buqu subbasins and the remaining regions of sryr excluding the two subbasins the et in the buqu subbasin and the remaining region of sryr is only calculated from 2007 to 2010 due to lots of missing data at the yanshiping station the outlet of buqu basin the four et datasets used in this study exhibit distinct differences in the spatial patterns and amplitudes fig s2 therefore we used the ensemble mean of all et products as the reference et in the water balanced evaluation 2 3 3 evaluation based on hydrological model simulation the process based model used in this study is permafrost water balance model pwbm pwbm simulates the soil temperature evolution and soil water movement by solving the 1 d heat transfer equation with phase change and richard s equation respectively jiang et al 2020a rawlins et al 2019 yi et al 2022 model inputs include daily precipitation temperature windspeed shortwave radiation surface pressure and humidity and model outputs include daily soil temperature soil moisture and runoff components the precipitation inputs were provided by the selected products and the other meteorological variables were taken from cmfd the upper boundary for the model was set as the daily land surface temperature lst from the daily 1 km all weather land surface temperature lst dataset for western china zhang et al 2019 the lst prior to 2003 was calculated using cmfd air temperature based on the empirical equations derived using the lst data and air temperature at each grid during the period of 2003 2018 zero flux was set as the lower boundary at 50 m depth the model was spun up for 50 years followed by the transit runs additional details on the model description and model setup can be found in the supplementary a routing model rvic was employed in this study to convert the grid runoff components produced by pwbm to the outlet streamflow rvic is often used as a post processor of the variable infiltration capacity hydrology model it is a source to sink model that solves a linearized saint venant equation lohmann et al 1996 the parameters of rvic include grid based flow direction flow distance and watershed extent which were calculated from 1 km dem data using arcgis hydrology tool due to the limitation of data availability and coarser resolution of several products table 2 fig 2 we selected six out of the nine precipitation products with higher spatial 0 1 and temporal resolution at least daily representing the three types of precipitation products to simulate the daily discharge at zhimenda and tuotuohe outlet stations the yanshiping subbasin was excluded from the runoff simulation due to missing data during the period of 1993 2006 fig 2 the selected products include three merged products cmfd tphipr msp two satellite based products chirps mswep and one gauge based product tps3d the runoff was simulated at the daily time step with the same period as the precipitation inputs within the period from 1979 to 2018 to minimize the influence of parameter calibration on the runoff simulation and precipitation assessment we divided the forcing precipitation dataset into a high precipitation group tphipr and tps3d and a low precipitation group other four datasets for model calibration the most commonly used forcing data cmfd and the new dataset tphipr were used to calibrate selected model parameters in pwbm including the infiltration limit factor mm day root baseflow factor deep baseflow factor and surface flow factor then the same parameters were applied to the runoff simulation driven by the precipitation data from each calibration group all the calibrations are based on the daily runoff observations at the zhimenda site the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse pearson correlation coefficient r and relative bias rb were used for model evaluation defined as below 4 nse 1 i 1 n y sim i y obs i 2 i 1 n y obs i y obs 2 5 r i 1 n y sim i y sim y obs i y obs i 1 n y sim i y sim 2 y obs i y obs 2 6 rb i 1 n y sim i y obs i i 1 n y obs i 100 where the subscripts sim and obs denote the simulation and observation respectively and n is the sample size we also employed the flow duration curve fdc to evaluate the runoff simulation results the fdc is a cumulative frequency curve that shows the percent of time specified discharges equal or exceeded during a given period smakhtin 2001 song et al 2021 here we compared the fdcs calculated from observed and simulated daily runoffs from 1998 to 2009 during which the temporal coverages of the six selected products overlapped fouad and loáiciga 2020 the specific frequency flow associated with fdc qpi indicates the runoff at a given frequency of pi for example q10 represents the runoff occurring at the exceedance probability of 10 i e the peak flow that exceeds the 90th percentile correspondingly we calculated the extremely high precipitation during the same period represented by r90p i e the annual sum of daily precipitation over the 90th percentile from selected products he et al 2021 to evaluate the relations between the extreme precipitation and peak flow 3 results 3 1 regional performance of precipitation products significant differences exist among the precipitation products from different groups and the differences vary with regions fig 3 4 in the entire sryr basin all precipitation products exhibit similar temporal trends from 1979 2018 and show significant correlations with the observed runoff fig 3a and table 3 while the annual precipitation amount varies considerably among the datasets the differences in the annual precipitation mainly come from the warm season precipitation for the merged precipitation products tphipr has overall higher precipitation especially in the mid and lower sryr reaches fig 4b the comparisons of the spatial patterns of cold season nov to apr precipitation also show that tphipr has higher snowfall in the middle reach of sryr fig s3 cmfd and msp have similar precipitation amount however cmfd shows high precipitation in the two high altitudinal subbasins i e the buqu and tuotuohe subbasins and the msp product shows a regionally smoothed pattern with the actual resolution coarser than 0 1º fig 4a c among the satellite based precipitation products imerg final has the lowest amount of annual mean precipitation and chirps shows overall low annual precipitation in the entire sryr especially in the damqu area fig 4d the two gauge based datasets with bias correction capd and tps3d show similar spatial pattern and temporal trends and their regional mean precipitation is very close to each other and higher than the other products except for tphipr it should be noted that there is a small area not covered by capd fig 4 which may have some impact on its regional statistics the differences among these products are more obvious in the high altitudinal subbasins than in the entire sryr the selected precipitation products still show strong correlations with the observed runoff in the tuotuohe subbasin but the correlation coefficients are much lower in the buqu subbasin table 3 where a large number of missing data may lead to a lower temporal correspondence fig 2 the merged dataset tphipr also has the highest precipitation amount in the tuotuohe subbasin but the precipitation differences between tphipr and tps3d or cadp are smaller compared to the sryr basin fig 3a b in the buqu subbasin with higher elevation the gauge based products capd and tps3d show the highest precipitation amount fig 3c the regional mean precipitation from the satellite based products is generally lower than the merged and gauge based precipitation products although mswep has slightly higher precipitation than chirps and imerg final the comparisons of the spatial pattern of extreme precipitation represented by r90p fig s4 indicate that cmfd may overestimate the extremely high precipitation in the high altitudinal regions moreover cmfd shows a similar temporal trend as the other products before 1997 but with a large discrepancy afterwards which may be related to the changes in source data around 1997 he et al 2020 the spatial patterns of the annual and extreme precipitation from different precipitation datasets also show distinct differences in the high altitudinal regions most products show low precipitation in the tuotuohe and buqu subbasins except for capd tps3d tphipr and cmfd fig 4 compared with the gauge based product cn05 without bias correction the other two gauge based products capd and tps3d show relatively high precipitation amount in the south of the tuotuohe subbasin and the buqu subbasin fig 4g i the tphipr product also shows overall high precipitation in these areas fig 4b the above comparisons indicate that satellite based products cannot capture the precipitation variability well particularly in high altitudinal regions except for mswep which exhibits slightly high precipitation in the buqu subbasin fig 4d f 3 2 altitudinal changes in the annual precipitation the annual precipitation from the nine selected products is generally well correlated with bias adjusted gauge observations at the four meteorological sites fig 5 with correlation coefficients greater than 0 75 but with noticeable biases almost all the precipitation products underestimate the true precipitation at the four sites and the underestimation is generally more obvious at the high altitudinal sites e g wudaoliang than that at the low altitudinal sites e g yushu for the merged precipitation products cmfd and msp underestimate the annual precipitations at the four sites but cmfd has the highest correlation coefficients with the gauge data fig 5a this is likely because most of the gauge observed precipitation data shown here were included in the cmfd production process he et al 2020 tphipr shows the smallest relative bias of 7 4 fig 5b however it significantly overestimates the precipitation amount at the yushu site with the lowest elevation 3682 2 m a s l while slightly underestimates the precipitation at the other sites the satellite based products particularly the chirps and imerg final exhibit overall significant negative biases fig 5d e especially at the wudaoliang site 4614 2 m a s l mswep has a better performance with a relative bias of 18 0 and the negative bias mainly comes from the underestimation of precipitation at the wudaoliang site fig 5f compared with the other two groups the gauge based precipitation products exhibit the best performance especially capd and tps3d which are closest to the gauge based true precipitation with relative biases of 10 4 and 8 3 respectively fig 5h i the altitudinal changes of annual precipitation are similar between the selected products and gauge based observations fig 6 here we also included the observations from the hydrological site yanshiping 4690 m a s l both adjusted and original annual precipitation data from the gauges show the same altitudinal variations the annual precipitation decreases with increasing elevation below 4500 m a s l while above 4500 m precipitation slightly increases with elevation the precipitation products show overall similar altitudinal changes with gauge based observations below 4500 m but significant differences exist among these products above 4500 m particularly cmfd precipitation varies dramatically from year to year in regions above 5000 m the contrasting vertical gradients below and above 4500 m are not obvious in tphipr as the other products fig 6b and tphipr generally shows slightly higher precipitation amount than the adjusted gauge based observations especially at the mid and lower altitudinal regions different from other products msp and imerg final show a decreasing vertical gradient above 5600 m however the altitudinal changes of precipitation in the higher elevations above 4700 m remain unknown due to the lack of observations above this elevation satellite based datasets chirps and mswep show similar altitudinal changes but chirps shows a more pronounced negative bias as shown in fig 5 the gauge based products are closer to the gauge observations than other precipitation products except for cn05 3 3 precipitation evaluation using regional water balance calculation the ensemble mean of annual et derived from four selected et products modis era5 lnad sebs estimated and gleam was used as the benchmark dataset to evaluate the et estimates derived from different precipitation products using the regional water balance approach fig 7 the et estimates derived from tphipr and gauge based precipitation products capd and tps3d perform best followed by mswep while other satellite based products significantly underestimate the et except for the buqu subbasin indicating an overall underestimation of regional precipitation fig 7b for the gauge based precipitation products both tps3d et and capd et are closer to the et ensemble mean than the cn05 et in the entire sryr and the tuotuohe subbasin fig 7a b other products underestimate the precipitation in the high altitudinal zone except for cmfd and tphipr but the high cmfd et estimates may result from its overestimation of high altitudinal extreme precipitation as described in section 3 1 tphipr et shows a higher amount than the other estimates in the remaining regions of the sryr fig 6d which may also indicate its overestimation of precipitation in the mid and lower reaches of sryr it should be noted that the area of the buqu subbasin is only 4256 km2 considering the coarse spatial resolution of grace data the et estimates using the water balance approach and grace data may have a large uncertainty in this subbasin 3 4 precipitation evaluation using permafrost hydrology model simulations using a process based permafrost hydrology model and gauge observed discharge data we further assessed the accuracy of different precipitation products the results show that model simulations using the selected precipitation products can reproduce the runoff process well in the sryr region fig 8 the nses of daily runoff simulations from all the products are above 0 7 table 4 except for mswep nse 0 68 which is likely due to the overestimation of precipitation in 1992 fig 3a however model simulations show degraded performance in the tuotuohe subbasin which likely indicates larger uncertainties in the precipitation datasets in the high altitudinal regions almost all simulations underestimate the runoff in the tuotuohe subbasin mainly shown as an underestimation in the peak flow table 5 and fig s5 the simulations using msp product underestimate the runoff most severely with a negative bias of 76 cmfd shows the lowest nse which can be attributed to the extremely high precipitation amount in the high altitudinal zones resulting in extremely high discharge after the year 2000 table s1 tphipr and mswep show the best performance in the tuotuohe subbasin among all precipitation products which is consistent with the above precipitation evaluation using gauge based precipitation observations the flow duration curve can better reflect the bias between the discharge simulations and observations fig 9 the results show that most products overestimate the high flows q10 to q30 while slightly underestimate the medium flows q40 to q60 for the entire sryr basin fig 9a which however is not observed in the tuotuohe subbasin the comparisons of peak flow q10 also reveal the differences among the selected precipitation products the results show that simulations using most precipitation products overestimate the peak flow for the entire sryr but underestimate the peak flow in the tuotuohe subbasin except for the simulations based on the cmfd product this may imply that most products underestimate the precipitation in the high altitudinal region in general tps3d and mswep show better performance for peak flow simulation than the other products in the high altitudinal region probably because the orographic impacts are better captured in these two products the relations between extreme precipitation r90p and observed peak flow in the entire sryr and tuotuohe subbasin were also compared table 6 the results show that during the period of 1998 2008 r90p derived from most precipitation products shows a high correlation with the observed peak flow except for chirps and cmfd cmfd shows a very low correlation in the tuotuohe subbasin r 0 33 which may be because cmfd greatly overestimates precipitation in this region shown as extremely high precipitation as discussed above we further calculated the peak runoff coefficients by dividing the accumulated runoff depth corresponding to q10 by r90p within the same year and compared it with the annual runoff coefficients fig 10 the results show that annual runoff coefficients in the entire sryr and the tuotuohe subbasin are close with less interannual variability compared to the peak runoff coefficients fig 10b however all selected products exhibit higher peak runoff coefficients in the tuotuohe subbasin than in the entire sryr msp and chirps show higher runoff coefficients for the peak flow due to lower precipitation amount of these two products 4 discussion 4 1 the overall performance of different types of precipitation products we have evaluated nine precipitation products in the sryr region representing three types of products gauge based satellite based and merged precipitation products our results show that large discrepancies exist among these products particularly in the high altitudinal zones in general the gauge based precipitation products show better performance than the satellite based and merged precipitation products especially for the two gauge based products with bias correction i e capd and tps3d fig 3 4 a previous study also demonstrated that the capd performed well in a permafrost basin the upper reach of shule river basin with elevation ranges from 2081 m to 5764 m a s l wu et al 2021 in our study the annual precipitation from capd and tps3d is closer to the true precipitation derived from the gauge observations fig 5h i the annual et derived from capd and tps3d based on regional water balance is also more consistent with the ensemble mean of four commonly used et products fig 7 these results demonstrate that bias correction of rain gauge under catch can effectively enhance the accuracy of precipitation estimates the satellite based precipitation products generally underestimate the precipitation amount especially in the high altitudinal regions fig 5d f previous studies found that imerg significantly underestimates hourly precipitation rates in the tp ma et al 2018 and the overall performance declines in winter and with increasing elevations sui et al 2020 xu et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 our results also show that satellite based products do not capture the spatial variability of precipitation in the high altitudinal region well fig 4 and fig 6 and underestimate the cold season precipitation fig s3 d e nevertheless another satellite based product mswep shows relatively better performance compared with the other two consistent with previous studies bai and liu 2018 liu et al 2019 the performance of merged precipitation products varies depending on the region and temporal period evaluated among the three selected merged products msp has relatively lower precipitation values and shows less spatial variability compared with the other two products fig 4c msp show similar spatial pattern and altitudinal changes as imerg final fig 4c e fig 6c e but the gauge based comparisons fig 5 show that msp has improved performance cmfd is a widely used meteorological dataset in china and a number of studies have evaluated its performance in the tp region he et al 2021 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 these results generally show that cmfd outperforms other products including chirps and imerg our results also show that cmfd has the highest correlations with the bias corrected gauge observations however we found that in the high altitudinal regions where gauge data are missing cmfd may over adjust the precipitation amount especially for the extreme precipitation events represented by r90p in fig s4 the newly released merged product produced by the same group tphipr shows a good performance from the perspective of regional water balance and runoff simulations considering its high spatial 3 km and temporal hourly resolution tphipr would be recommended for future hydrologic studies in the tp region however our evaluation also indicates that tphipr likely overestimate the precipitation amount in the lower altitudinal regions of sryr figs 5 6 as an example tphipr shows a much higher amount of snow in the middle reach of sryr than other products fig s3 compared with modis snow cover data figs s3 s6 as a summary among the evaluated precipitation products tps3d and capd demonstrated better performance followed by tphipr and mswep the superior performance of the former two products might be attributed to the bias correction on rain gauge under catch especially in the high altitudinal regions as for the other two products tphipr includes more than 9000 gauges with measurement errors corrected using empirical methods moreover the climatologically aided interpolation methodology used in tphipr can help to capture spatial variability in the anomalies or ratios that may not be captured by the climatology data alone which may also improve its performance jiang et al 2023 mswep accounts for the influence of convective precipitation and frontal precipitation regimes and also minimizes the temporal mismatches between the satellite reanalysis estimates and gauge observations through considering gauge reporting times beck et al 2019 these factors may contribute to the improved performance of mswep there are some new precipitation products that are not evaluated here but may be also useful in tp hydrologic applications for example zhu et al 2022 proposed a new precipitation merging method that considers rain events during the merging process and merged multisource precipitation in southern china their results demonstrated that including rain events during the precipitation construction can improve the quality of the merging product further evaluation on the potential contribution of this process to precipitation data quality in the tibetan plateau is needed 4 2 altitudinal changes and permafrost hydrology applications of different precipitation products the examined precipitation products show inconsistent altitudinal changes and considerable uncertainties exist in the precipitation estimates at elevations above 4500 m precipitation in the mountain terrain shows strong variability and the variability is largely driven by altitudinal changes hughes et al 2009 kumari et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the altitudinal changes in the precipitation are complex and can vary substantially across different tp regions for instance lan et al 2015 analyzed gauge based data and found that the wet season precipitation decreased with elevation in the tp region above 4000 m a s l although the observations at higher elevations above 4500 m a s l are limited wu et al 2021 found that annual precipitation in the qilian mountains of northern tp increases with elevation from 2433 m to 4156 m a s l while li et al 2021 found that imerg annual precipitation gradually decreases with increasing elevation in the tanggula mountains overlapping with our study area in our study area annual precipitation decreases with increasing elevation for the elevation zone from 3700 4500 m a s l and most selected precipitation products show similar trends in this elevation zone however we found a turning point at around 4500 m a s l which is not shown in previous studies the gauge based annual precipitation slightly increases at the elevation zone above 4500 m while trends in the selected precipitation products vary fig 6 however since there are only two sites above 4500 m wudaoliang and yanshiping with very limited observations at yanshiping 1982 1987 the altitudinal changes of precipitation in the elevations above 4500 m remain largely unknown permafrost in the tp is mainly distributed in the areas above 4000 m ran et al 2021 zou et al 2017 therefore accurate precipitation data in the high altitudinal regions are important for understanding the underlying processes driving the changes in the tp permafrost thermal and hydrological state the pwbm model simulations usingselected precipitation products generally can reproduce the daily runoff in the sryr well table 4 but with degrading performance in the tuotuo subbasin where the elevation is higher and permafrost coverage is larger the selected precipitation products show similar annual runoff coefficients in the sryr basin and the tuotuohe subbasin but exhibit higher runoff coefficients for the peak runoff in the tuotuohe subbasin than in the sryr the annual mean and peak season runoff coefficients are mostly determined by the precipitation amount which may suggest that most products evaluated here especially chirps and msp underestimate the extreme precipitation in the high altitudinal zones nevertheless the runoff coefficients in the sryr and the tuotuohe subbasin are likely different due to their differences in topography and permafrost coverage which needs further investigation 4 3 uncertainties in the evaluation process we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation through combining gauge based comparison water balance calculation and process based model simulations to fully understand the uncertainties associated with different types of precipitation products however uncertainties may be still associated with the evaluation process gauge observations substantially underestimate the true precipitation in the mountain area due to effects such as measurement under catch and therefore need bias correction ma et al 2015 yang et al 2001 in this study a method proposed by yang et al 2001 was introduced to adjust the gauge based precipitation our results show that the correction factor of the annual mean precipitation is approximately 1 4 at the four meteorological sites in the sryr which is close to the findings in the previous study ma et al 2015 however the bias correction is based on a few assumptions including using mean values to represent daily trace and wetting losses and the values are likely conservative ye et al 2004 more reliable bias correction methods for gauge based precipitation are needed for high mountain regions the gauge based comparison results indicate that most products particularly satellite based products chirps and imerg final underestimate the precipitation however the precipitation observations in the sryr are extremely limited and the evaluation results at a single watershed may not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy of these datasets for instance two merged products aera5 asia a long term asian precipitation dataset and aimerg asian precipitation dataset with high quality and spatiotemporal resolution show similar performance to imerg final in our study area figs s7 s8 but previous studies indicated better performance of these two datasets than imerg final in other regions such as southern china ma et al 2022 2020b in addition the gauge observations from the cma stations should be already included in the construction process of most precipitation products such as cmfd and tps3d which therefore may not provide a completely independent evaluation the grace twsc and several et products were used to evaluate the precipitation products based on regional water balance the grace twsc was used to represent the water storage change in the water balance calculation however some errors may be non negligible in the grace data processing such as the leakage error especially for a small region chen et al 2021 the coarse resolution of the grace product native resolution 3º watkins et al 2015 is a limiting factor for regional water balance calculation in a small watershed particularly the buqu subbasin in addition the glaciers distributed in the south of the tuotuohe subbasin and the east of the buqu subbasin fig 1 may affect the twsc calculation to some extent which is not considered in our study on the other hand there are large differences in the magnitude and spatial patterns of the selected et products han et al 2021 and the accuracy of the et products will affect the evaluation results modis and era5 land et products show a similar regional mean of annual et while the annual et from gleam is much lower and sebs et is much higher resulting in the ensemble mean of annual et close to the estimates of modis and era5 land et products fig s2 more investigations are needed to evaluate the accuracy of different et products in the tp permafrost region and characterize their uncertainty in the tp permafrost region we also evaluated the precipitation uncertainties through comparing the runoff simulations using a process based permafrost hydrology model and gauge discharge data the rationale for this method is based on the assumption that the errors of precipitation can be propagated into the simulated runoff series bai et al 2018 su et al 2008 in this study we tried to minimize the influence of model parameter calibration on the precipitation evaluation process however the model calibration process likely corrects errors or biases in the precipitation products to some extent through parameter adjustment price et al 2014 although the runoff simulation results are overall acceptable the simulations of different water balance components driven by different products may differ bai and liu 2018 our simulations show that pwbm model driven by different precipitation products can reproduce the daily runoff in the sryr well while the runoff simulations in the tuotuohe subbasin are not as good as in the entire basin the discrepancies between the runoff observations and simulations in the tuotuohe subbasin may partly reflect the precipitation differences while other factors may also play a role hydrological simulation in the high altitudinal permafrost basins is challenging due to potential model structural deficiencies and data shortage jiang et al 2020b uncertainties in the model representation of the permafrost hydrologic processes including oversimplified parameterization of deep soil properties and insufficient characterization on the effects of soil freeze and thaw process on runoff production in high altitudinal region likely contribute to the above discrepancy the pwbm model used in this study has a detailed representation of soil heat transfer and soil water migration while the representation of groundwater movement is relatively simple rawlins et al 2019 yi et al 2022 moreover the impacts of glaciers in the southern tuotuohe basin and the influence of heterogeneous topography on the runoff production process are not fully considered in the pwbm model 5 conclusion in this study we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine selected precipitation products in a tibetan plateau permafrost basin i e the source region of the yangtze river the selected precipitation datasets represent three types of precipitation products including the tp merged products cmfd msp tphipr the satellite based products chirps imerg final mswep and gauge based products cn05 tps3d caps our results show that most products underestimate the precipitation in the high altitudinal regions and distinct differences exist among the products especially in the representation of extreme precipitation events the recently released merged product tphipr shows a good performance based on evaluation using regional water balance approach and hydrological model simulations but may slightly overestimate precipitation in the mid and lower reaches of sryr while the previously release merged product cmfd may have over adjusted the extreme precipitation amount at high elevations one satellite based product mswep has a better performance compared with the other satellite based products chirps and imerg final which significantly underestimate the regional precipitation two gauge based precipitation products with bias correction capd and tps3d also show overall improved performance than the other gauge based dataset cn05 without bias correction especially in the high altitudinal regions the hydrological simulations show that most selected precipitation products have overall acceptable performance in the entire sryr basin while the simulations in the tuotuohe subbasin with higher elevation and larger permafrost coverage are not as good as in the entire basin the runoff coefficients comparisons in these two regions reveal that most evaluated products underestimate the extreme precipitation in the high altitudinal zones in summary the two gauge based products with bias corrections i e capd and tps3d outperformed the other products the other two products tphipr and mswep perform reasonably well and show great potential in regional studies with their higher spatial and temporal resolutions as long as the bias issue can be addressed our results highlight the challenges of current products in characterizing precipitation variability for the high altitudinal permafrost regions we call for more gauge observations especially in the higher elevation zone e g above 4500 m a s l in our study area to better characterize the altitudinal changes in the precipitation and development of more accurate precipitation estimates to better understand permafrost hydrological responses to climate change credit authorship contribution statement huiru jiang formal analysis visualization

7703,study region algal blooms abs often exacerbated by excess nutrients from anthropogenic activities can pose serious risks to public health fisheries and ecosystem structure and functions lake okeechobee is located in southcentral florida usa and with a surface area of 1730 km 2 it is the largest subtropical lake in the united states this lake is shallow nutrient rich and subject to frequent and intense blooms of cyanobacteria some of which are toxic study focus in this study a three dimensional 3d model was developed coupling long term monitoring data with complex physical chemical and ecological processes at fine spatial 15 1000 m horizontal mesh size and temporal 1 h resolution we used this model to understand the influence of environmental factors and nutrient management on abs dynamics in lake okeechobee new hydrological insights for the region the model showed that abs mostly developed in shallow nearshore regions near canal outlets and then spread over the lake as a result of prevailing winds and currents hypothetical scenario modeling showed that reducing both nitrogen and phosphorus inputs by 50 75 would be more effective at reducing abs in the lake than targeting a single nutrient the model could be used as a tool to assess the effectiveness of different nutrient management strategies in lake okeechobee and its watershed while the framework could be adopted to other large water bodies facing similar issues graphical abstract keywords numerical modeling algal blooms lake okeechobee management options legacy nutrients delft3d data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lakes and reservoirs provide water for a range of human demands such as drinking water irrigation recreation and tourism janssen et al 2019 accelerated rates of eutrophication associated with human development in many lake ecosystems around the world are creating water quality issues including algal blooms abs heisler et al 2008 o neil et al 2012 ab events in lakes are projected to worsen as a result of global warming and continued cultural eutrophication o neil et al 2012 paerl et al 2016 visser et al 2016 beusen et al 2016 certain algae types can release toxins that are harmful to human health and ecosystems anderson et al 2021 the inhalation or consumption of affected waters can be harmful to animals and humans and toxins can bioaccumulate in food chains berry et al 2011 comprehensive water quality management solutions are therefore needed to mitigate the potential for abs and the associated adverse impacts burford et al 2020 quantitative modeling has played an important role helping water managers define the drivers for abs and develop effective approaches to reduce the frequency and intensity of blooms models that define the relationship between environmental factors and abs have been developed for a number of lakes around the world burford et al 2020 ralston and moore 2020 for example bilaletdin et al 2011 applied a process based model aquatox developed by park et al 2008 to study the effect of excessive phosphorus loading on eutrophication in lake onega russia united states army corps of engineers usace developed the ce qual icm model to study eutrophication processes in chesapeake bay usa cerco and cole 1992 and concluded that eutrophication models must take into consideration nitrogen phosphorus silica and carbon cycles as well as sedimentation processes aldridge 1995 james and bierman jr 1995 james and havens 1996 havens and james 1999 james et al 2008 alluded to the importance of light extinction due to suspended sediment in addition to other processes with a particular emphasis on lake okeechobee in other modeling efforts the impacts of climate change on eutrophication and abs in lake taihu china have been investigated in tang et al 2015 2016 the modeling efforts revealed the dependency of abs on water temperature wind conditions and nutrient flux into the lake recent advances in remote sensing and environmental data science have facilitated the short term forecasting of algal bloom occurrences e g tang et al 2022 overall process based numerical models have become standard in evaluating the nexus of management solution and water quality but less attention has been focused on broader environmental drivers of abs in large lakes understanding the effect of environmental drivers on abs is important for identifying the best targets for management of eutrophication issues given its size and close relationships to wide range of regional water supply and water quality issues lake okeechobee is an example of a lake deserving of attention james and bierman jr 1995 james and pollman 2011 james 2016 used a mass balance model and a dynamic water quality model namely the internal loading phosphorus model ilpm and the lake okeechobee water quality model lowqm to evaluate nutrient management solutions e g large scale chemical treatment and dredging an open source model called lake operation optimization of nutrient exports loone was developed by tarabih et al 2022 to evaluate water quality control alternatives for the lake lumped models like this are important for uncertainty analyses or operational purposes i e gate operations for lake okeechobee since their processing time is relatively short dilks and james 2011 james 2016 however a spatially explicit three dimensional 3d hydrodynamic model is needed to represent critical hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes in this complex water system for instance although substances in the lake are well mixed in the vertical direction light penetration and algal growth occur predominantly in the top layer i e 30 cm to 1 2 m depending on the location phlips et al 1995 rodusky et al 2005 james 2016 jin et al 2007 developed the 3d lake okeechobee environment model loem and used it to study water quality processes in the lake loem was based on the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc hamrick 1992 which does not have 3d flexible computational mesh capabilities this limitation makes it difficult to simulate the littoral zone in detail especially those canals in the northern and western sites of lake okeechobee overall the lessons learned from decades of research in this lake are also relevant to other similar shallow large subtropical lakes in this study we explored the relationships among hydrodynamics nutrient fluxes and abs in large subtropical lakes within the context of a case study of lake okeechobee using a high spatial and temporal numerical model lake okeechobee is not only an important lake in florida but is also an interesting example of a highly engineered system with multiple regulated inflows and outflows through this study we aimed to answer three important management related questions 1 what are the main factors causing abs in lake okeechobee 2 how much of a reduction in nutrient imports and or legacy sediments is needed to reduce the occurrence of abs 3 what magnitude of nutrient input reduction would be required to reduce abs the open source delft3d flow module was used to simulate the hydrodynamic conditions of the lake hydrodynamic modeling results were used to drive a water quality ecological delft3d waq model to calculate algal production modeling results were compared against observed data for model calibration and validation we then tested several alternative solutions to investigate how phytoplankton concentrations change with regard to changes in nutrient concentrations using chlorophyll a chl a as a surrogate for phytoplankton biomass 2 study area lake okeechobee is located in southcentral florida usa center location at 26 9690 n 80 7976 w with a surface area of 1730 km 2 it is the largest freshwater lake in the u s outside of the great lakes fig 1 though of natural origin lake okeechobee has functioned as a reservoir since the construction of a dike that surrounds around 230 km of its perimeter among six main tributaries only fisheating creek is not diked and flow is not regulated the lake is an important source of water for nearby cities as well as for the everglades national park the loxahatchee national wildlife refuge and the everglades agricultural area the lake also plays a critical role in regional flood control water levels and outflows are controlled by a complex network of hydraulic structures i e culverts gates locks and pumps operated by the usace and the south florida water management district sfwmd guided by the lake okeechobee regulation schedule lors usace 2008 and the forthcoming lake okeechobee system operating manual losom usace 2022 it is well known that the lake has become progressively more eutrophic since the construction of the dike in the first half of the 20th century in part because of nutrient inputs from urban and agricultural development in the lake s watersheds khare et al 2019 tarabih and arias 2021 over time a thixotropic mud layer containing legacy nutrients has developed especially in the deeper zone of the lake fisher et al 2001 2005 vogel et al 2016 as a shallow lake during windy periods phosphorus attached to sediment particles is stirred up and becomes accessible to algae in the water column but too much sediment may cause an inverse relationship of phosphorus and algae owing to light limitation phlips et al 1995 søballe 1998 large scale algal blooms have continued to occur along with the accumulation of legacy phosphorus in this benthic mud layer missimer et al 2020 conducted a literature review and concluded that it would be very difficult to restore the lake without removing the legacy nutrients the rising tropic status of lake okeechobee has led to increasing incidents of intense harmful algal blooms dominated by cyanobacteria a trend that has been observed in many lakes in florida canfield et al 1989 part of the rising threats from cyanobacteria blooms has been prominence of the toxic species microcystis aeruginosa rosen et al 2017 paerl et al 2020 which is particularly noted for prolific production of the hepatoxin microcystin chorus and welker 2021 3 methods in order to simulate complex processes in lake okeechobee we relied on coupling delft3d flow and delft3d waq see deltares 2019 the hydrodynamic deflt3d flow module solves the momentum and continuity equations using an unstructured finite volume method and delft3d waq solves the advection diffusion equations together with an extensive water quality library for different biogeochemical processes for delft3d waq we simulated several biogeochemical cycles including oxygen nitrogen phosphorus sediment settling and resuspension algal growth and competition carbon components silica si and other ions i e fe 3 mn 2 and so 4 2 fig 2 shows the main biogeochemical processes considered more details on each process and data used in this study are described in the sub sections below 3 1 lake hydrodynamics inputs to delft3d flow include lake bathymetry data bottom surface roughness coefficient manning s n canal flows climatic forcings precipitation evaporation wind velocity wind direction air temperature and humidity and water temperature the most recent bathymetry data released in 2014 were downloaded from sfwmd s geospatial services section www sfwmd gov at 5 ft 1 52 m of horizontal spatial resolution the hebert hoover dike acted as a hard closed boundary surrounding the computational domain including 7623 flexible orthogonal and triangular mesh cells the mesh resolution ranged from 15 m for the near shore zones and southwest marshes to 1000 m for the off shore deeper water zones supplemental information fig s1 the range of mesh size was chosen based on balancing computational costs and level of details of the model domain the vertical dimension was subdivided into five layers using the sigma layer approach which scales the thickness of each layer proportional to the total water depth typically lake water balance was obtained by including inflows outflows rainfall and evapotranspiration from open water and wetland bilaletdin et al 2011 sporadic emergency water abstraction in the form of pumping activities in the southern part of the lake infiltration and leakage were not considered 3 2 oxygen cycle oxygen is a fundamental component of most aquatic biogeochemical cycles and was therefore included in this study in some of the previous lake okeechobee modeling studies oxygen cycling was ignored because the lake is shallow the average depth of the lake is approximately three meters and thus the lake was assumed to be primarily aerobic nonetheless historical data over the period 2008 2021 showed that the concentrations of no 2 plus no 3 from here on called no x were sometimes below 0 01 mg l suggesting either algal uptake or denitrification under anoxic conditions jin et al 2007 also considered dissolved oxygen d o in their model thus we explicitly considered oxygen cycling in the lake including chemical oxygen demand c o d biochemical oxygen demand b o d and sediment oxygen demand s o d in delft3d waq the reaeration of oxygen into water is dependent on water temperature salinity intrusion and wind speed see eq 1 deltares 2019 but biochemical processes in the lake are expected to have little effects on water temperature and salinity thus we added these two variables as time series data instead of simulating them directly 1 r r e a r k l r e a r c o x s c o x h k l r e a r a v b h c d w 2 c o x s f t s a l where r r e a r

kgm 3 3 3 phosphorus and nitrogen cycles atmospheric deposition nitrification denitrification nitrogen fixation ammonification and uptake by algae were assumed to be responsible for transformations among four nitrogen forms organic nitrogen ammonia nh 4 nitrite nitrate no x and nitrogen gas n 2 regarding the phosphorus cycle we considered organic phosphorus and ortho phosphate po 4 3 as well as the adsorption of po 4 3 to suspended solids and bed sediments beside atmospheric deposition in all of these nutrient related processes hydrolysis and algal dynamics contributed to chemical consumption transformation and decomposition atmospheric deposition values 23 3 kg of organic phosphorus 661 7 kg of ammonia 714 6 kg of nitrate nitrite and 2003 kg of organic nitrogen per day were

organisms in lake okeechobee grouped into cyanobacteria spp green algae and diatoms as reported in previous studies cichra et al 1995 havens et al 1996 phlips et al 2020 paerl et al 2020 tarabih and arias 2021 most major blooms in the lake are dominated by cyanobacteria with microcystis aeruginosa dolichospermum spp and aphanizomenon spp among the most prevalent cyanobacteria genera dominance of cyanobacteria in blooms is a common feature in eutrophic lakes in florida canfield et al 1989 the pattern of cyanobacterial dominance extends to many shallow eutrophics around the world dokulil and teubner 2000 overall we simulated algal growth respiration transport settling resuspension and mortality but grazing was not considered havens et al 1996 conducted mesocosm grazing experiments with samples collected from lake okeechobee and found that zooplankton grazing is not an important regular of phytoplankton biomass and productivity similar observations have been made for other sub tropical tropical lakes around the world saunders and lewis 1988 fernando 1994 magadza 1994 chen et al 2003 for example in the case of lake taihu de kluijver et al 2012 suggest that cyanobacteria blooms primarily provide carbon to higher tropic levels through bacterial decomposition of senescent bloom biomass although there is some lower level direct grazing on cyanobacteria which does not significantly impact bloom potential the basis for the lack of significant control of blooms by direct grazing in lake okeechobee may be related to a combination of the character of zooplankton community structure in the lake crisman et al 1995 havens et al 1996 and the resistance to grazing exhibited by the dominant bloom forming cyanobacteria species in the lake such as microcystis aeruginosa a number of factors have been linked to the resistance to grazing losses exhibited by bloom forming cyanobacteria including the production of toxins and other biologically active compounds and the morphology of filaments and colonies that represent a physical challenge to grazing capacity crisman et al 1995 wilson et al 2006 yang et al 2009 zhu et al 2013 vilar et al 2021 the bloom module within delft3d waq was used to account for the competition among the selected algal functional groups bloom was based on an assumption that each phytoplankton type would try to maximize the total net production of its community in each time step deltares 2019 the mass balance equation for phytoplankton is as follows 5 δ p h y t o p l a n k t o n δ t l o a d s t r a n s p o r t s e t t l

lake were modeled since suspended sediments and phytoplankton growth could change turbidity in the lake resulting in the reduction of light penetration sediment was assumed to be presented in the suspended form as well as high mobility particles of the thixotropic mud layers in the bottom of the lake the lake sediment zones were defined in sfwmd 2002 and ji and jin 2014 to quantify the effect of wind on sediment transport in the lake an important feature of the mud layer in the deep zone was a 10 cm deep layer of legacy phosphorus accumulating over 50 years which resulted in a volume of over 30 000 m 3 ji and jin 2014 adsorbed phosphate was simulated as a substance besides organic carbon and organic phosphate from detritus decomposition in summary sediment cycling includes transport settling resuspension burial and upward transport water quality and biological processes in the lake were not only driven by the aforementioned cycles in the water body but also atmospheric forcings and other elements solar radiation fraction of cloud coverage and penetration capacity of sunlight secchi depth were among additional atmospheric variables besides those used in delft3d flow in the west and north sides of the lake the effect of vegetation coverage which blocked light penetration was simulated by setting the length of days to 0 1 as electron acceptors i e o 2 no x fe 3 and so 4 2 and carbon dioxide co 2 were considered p h might have an important role and was therefore also simulated finally silicon si an important nutrient to build skeletal structures of phytoplankton especially diatoms was included 4 data and scenarios 4 1 data time series data were collected from the dbhydro database available at apps sfwmd gov accessed on march 2022 an online database maintained by sfwmd details described in tarabih and arias 2021 daily climate forcings air temperature wind speed etc were obtained from the same database at four locations l001 l005 l006 and lz40 sfwmd calculated flow rates through hydraulic structures from daily water levels which were measured by using automatic equipment such as solid state loggers and telemetry tarabih and arias 2021 flow rate data from 24 lake okeechobee inflow stations were used in the model development direct surface runoff beyond these stations was not considered since the dike and hydraulic infrastructure force most of the surface water through one of these stations monitoring data used in the model include total phosphorus t p po 4 3 p nh 4 n no x n total nitrogen t n total kjeldahl nitrogen t k n dissolved oxygen d o chl a carbon all forms turbidity salinity secchi disk depth si fe 3 and so 4 2 water quality data were collected monthly or biweekly by using either autosamplers or manual grab chl a data were mainly used in this study to calibrate and validate algal production in the lake 4 2 scenarios we ran the model for the period from january 2016 to december 2018 for calibration and from january 2019 to december 2021 for validation this period was chosen since algal blooms were prominent and monitoring datasets widely available and complete we then used the period from january 2016 to december 2018 for a baseline scenario besides r 2 the mean absolute error mae which was the average of the absolute difference between the observed and simulated values was used to evaluate model performance eq 6 6 m a e 1 n i 1 n y i y ˆ i where y ˆ i is the simulated daily value and y i is the observed daily value our simulation scenarios focused on efforts at the watershed scale that directly influence nutrient inflows into the lake in order to design best management practices for contributing watersheds it is necessary to study effective nutrient reduction targets thus we ran different combinations of po 4 3 and no x load reductions i e 25 50 75 and 100 additionally we also simulated a nutrient removal scenario as in james and pollman 2011 they suggested that about 500 km 2 10 cm of the offshore mud sediments in the deep zone fig 1 should be dredged alternatively james and pollman 2011 also evaluated chemical treatment as a solution for nutrient removal in this study we considered nutrient removal as a general term covering the two above approaches without considering their short term effects a fixed computational time step of 10 s s was adopted in the water quality model to ensure its stability the simulation results however were exported as hourly averaged time series initial conditions were obtained by interpolating data at the six stations fig 1 in the lake using the inverse distance weighting idw method the list of variables and their values for delft3d flow and delft3d waq is available in supplemental information tables s1 s2 and s3 the model was calibrated manually with the trial and error method owing to the expensive computational time of a three dimensional model 5 results and discussion 5 1 model calibration and validation for hydrodynamic modeling with delft3d flow the coefficient of determination r 2 between gauged and observed water levels at lz40 was 0 98 see section 1 in supplemental information for more details delft3d waq was calibrated and validated with respect to the concentration of d o no x po 4 3 and chl a using data observed at the six sites illustrated in fig 1 grab samples from 0 5 m below the water surface these six sites are distributed around the lake in locations with different hydrologic and biological characteristics calibration validation results showed that the model could reproduce the main multi annual and seasonal trends of key variables fig 3 shows results for two stations l007 and l008 and calibration validation results for the other stations are included in supplemental information table s4 and figure s4 most phytoplankton can use nh 4 and no x as nitrogen sources however the concentration of nh 4 was low in the lake in part because nitrification and algal uptake can both occur rapidly ambrose et al 1993 lee et al 2015 thus nh 4 was excluded in model calibration d o is a central component of any water quality model and it is among the most important indicators of the health of aquatic environments tang et al 2016 the mean absolute error mae values of simulated d o concentration were about 0 45 mg l during the calibration period and these values were from 0 36 to 0 87 mg l during the validation period the r 2 values ranged from 0 66 to 0 90 and from 0 67 to 0 88 for the calibration and validation periods respectively there was a clear seasonal pattern in d o which tended to be the opposite of temperature see figure s5 in supplemental information for correlations among variables we observed higher d o concentrations in the winter december march and lower concentration in the summer june september this was reasonable since d o depended on water temperature as shown in eq 1 in some other case studies e g bilaletdin et al 2011 salinity levels affected d o and limited algal growth but this was not the case for lake okeechobee since the concentration of chloride cl was relatively low and stable 70 mg l d o fluctuated slightly when abs occurred because of the presence of primary producers po 4 3 and no x are important nutrients for the growth of algae if nh 4 is limited for the calibration period the means of mae of modeled po 4 3 and no x were 0 02 mg l and 0 12 mg l respectively the averaged mae for the validation periods were 0 02 and 0 11 mg l for po 4 3 and no x respectively r 2 for po 4 3 calculated for the calibration and validation periods were 0 41 and 0 44 respectively r 2 for no x were 0 30 and 0 41 for the calibration and validation periods in general the model can capture well the observed po 4 3 data although it missed some peak points which may have been due to sample heterogeneity caused by local turbulence under external forces e g wind gusts or boat traffic causing random resuspension or consistent wind leading to large waves in the shallow lake the mae values of simulated po 4 3 and no x which was approximate 10 and 20 of the maximum concentration 0 11 and 0 59 mg l were acceptable considering the spatial coverage of the large computational domain and spatial 15 1000 m and temporal hourly resolutions of the model we used chl a as a surrogate for phytoplankton concentrations the mae value of modeled chl a was 8 92 μ g l and 9 10 μ g l for the calibration and validation periods respectively the corresponding r 2 values were 0 35 and 0 30 the values of chl a varied largely every day and had one annual peak in the summer observed chl a at l007 sometimes dropped below 5 μ g l lake okeechobee has been previously modeled at the same temporal resolution daily by using both empirical and process based models for example james et al 2005 used the lake okeechobee water quality model lowqm a deterministic and mass balance model to model p n and phytoplankton although the model calibration results seem equivalent to this study lowqm is unable to provide information on spatial dynamics lake okeechobee environment model loem a 3 d hydrodynamic water quality model developed by jin et al 2007 can provide more values in understanding spatial dynamics of the system but it was only calibrated for one station and is limited by its rectangular mesh which is unable to represent the canal rim around the lake and other non uniform spatial features an earlier model developed by jin et al 1998 for the lake called eutro was not calibrated environmental fluid dynamics code efdc gave negative nses in predicting the water quality variables in shin et al 2023 the performance of these models is summarized in table 1 5 2 temporal and spatial variations and drivers of algal blooms in this study we reported the temporal and spatial variations of abs over the period of three simulation years we performed the non parametric mann kendall trend test and found no statistically significant trend p value 0 35 in algal concentrations in the lake during the period 2016 2021 which is consistent with trend analyses based on observations tarabih and arias 2021 before 2001 the total phosphorus concentration in the lake increased rapidly from 40 to 120 μ g l which drove the florida department of environmental protection fdep to establish a total maximum daily load tmdl of 140 metric tons total phosphorus per year for the lake fdep 2001 this might result in the reduction of chl a concentrations after that and the trend during 2016 2021 became unclear fig 4 shows the annual average of d o po 4 3 no x and chl a in each year for the period 2016 2018 d o was low at the mouth of the kissimmee river and the sw bay whereas d o was quite high in the center of the lake this phenomenon might be a result of high cod near the canal mouths noting that the kissimmee river is the source of approximately 75 of organic matter into the lake phlips et al 2020 tarabih and arias 2021 meanwhile low do in the southwest of the lake may be caused by nearby agricultural activities the concentrations of po 4 3 no x and chl a tended to be higher in the center northwest and southeast of the lake phlips et al 1994 and james et al 2009 explained that phosphorus concentrations in the central region was high because of soft phosphorus rich sediments however we found high concentrations in the central lake likely reflected wind facilitated transport of blooms emanating from other regions rather than autochthonous production james et al 2009 found higher chl a in the western and northern nearshore regions of lake okeechobee compared to the central region these observations suggest the importance of nutrient inputs from tributaries in the north and west for ab formation as well as the shallower depths in these regions compared to the center of the lake which enhance light availability for photosynthesis there were several physical factors limiting algal growth in the model water temperature likely being the most important see fig 5 the principal bloom forming algae in lake okeechobee are cyanobacteria and it is widely recognized that many of these species favor temperatures above 25 c paerl and hussmann 2008 nelson et al 2018 high temperature and solar radiation in the summer clearly favor ab formation also see figure s5 for correlations between variables d o had a high inverse correlation with water temperature in this study we found that the relationship between water level and chl a was unclear because of the interplay effect of water level light availability in the water column wind turbidity and microbial processes phlips et al 1997 james et al 2009 for example if water levels increase because of inflows and precipitation water transparency will reduce because inflows bring nutrients and organic and inorganic materials in the case of lake okeechobee both observed data and simulation results showed a high concentration of phosphorus and nitrogen in the lake we observed an increase of chl a concentrations associated with the decrease of no x this is likely a result of large no x utilization by abs which is supported by in situ data analysis with phosphorus nitrogen and chl a that revealed high turbidity and nitrogen limited algal primary production aldridge 1995 phlips et al 1995 hansen et al 1997 havens and east 1997 adequate phosphorus supply throughout the years due to both canal inputs and legacy phosphorus might have resulted in the effective use of nitrogen in the form of no x in water for example almost all the points in which chl a values were above 40 μ g l no x dropped below 0 2 mg l the concentration of po 4 3 was sometimes below 0 02 mg l indicating seasonal minima in phosphorus and inorganic nitrogen were the limiting factors of abs aldridge 1995 schelske 1989 abs often occurred during the hurricane season when sediment was resuspended owing to high wind speed but there was a lag between an actual hurricane and an ab event this lag time could be dependent on physical conditions e g water temperature and solar radiation and existing conditions of the lake the summer season with increased rainfall and tropical hurricanes e g irma in september 2017 and increased water levels in the lake tended to dilute nutrients in a very short period since rainfall was among the main sources of water in the lake nonetheless both phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations increased again together with the increased turbidity jin et al 2011 and phlips et al 2020 suggested that high rainfall triggered by hurricanes might bring nutrient rich water to the lake from its watersheds despite the nutrient rich environment we did not observe major responses of the algal community because high turbidity in water prevented light penetration which was also mentioned in phlips et al 2020 the long residence time of water average turnover of 3 5 years according to james and pollman 2011 then partially aided high potential of algal blooms in the later periods or the next summer depending on how the lake is managed after the storms abs tend to start at the near shore areas near the outlet of taylor creek kissimmee river indian prairies canal harney pond canal and miami canal locations in fig 1 this can be explained by two phenomena first the zones near these points are quite shallow with high water transparency that warms up quickly this conclusion supported what phlips et al 1995 found by using observed data analysis second these rivers and canals drain large agricultural areas in this study we found that besides the bay in the western and southern sites of the lake abs also occurred near the outlet of the kissimmee river and the taylor creek which provide nutrient inputs from their watersheds that help drive cyanobacteria blooms abs originating in these nearshore regions can then spread and expand to other regions of the lake by wind driven circulation fig 6 figure s3 in supplemental information shows changes in current velocity and direction owing to wind the importance of wind in defining the distribution of abs has also been highlighted in other studies of lake okeechobee shin et al 2023 and other lakes subject to cyanobacteria blooms around the world such as lake taihu in china wu et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 5 3 potential management solutions we evaluated the reduction of both phosphorus and nitrogen inputs into the lake model by different proportions to test how incoming nutrients influence abs in the lake anova test showed significant differences p 0 01 among the simulated results for all the scenarios the chl a threshold of 40 μ g l was chosen as an indicator of ab events as in havens and walker jr 2002 and tarabih and arias 2021 simulations showed that either limiting phosphorus or nitrogen individually could have an effect but to a limited extent if nitrogen concentrations were reduced yielding tn tp ratios below 22 1 by mass n fixing cyanobacteria e g dolichospermum spp aphanizomenon spp would increase see smith 1995 and tarabih and arias 2021 potentially providing some nitrogen for non n fixing species e g microcystis aeruginosa if phosphorus concentrations were reduced the loss of phosphorus inflows might be compensated for legacy phosphorus so reducing phosphorus inflows to the lake would not prevent abs without addressing legacy loads a similar conclusion was made for lake taihu in china for which the authors concluded that a significant reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus of up to 80 and 30 respectively was required to reduce chl a by approximately 24 38 tang et al 2016 hellweger et al 2022 developed an agent based model to simulate microcystis growth in lake erie and concluded that nutrient control must include both phosphorus and nitrogen in this study we found that by reducing 75 of phosphorus and 75 of nitrogen the maximum chl a concentration would be halved fig 7 more importantly the number of hours in which chl a exceeded 40 μ g l was reduced to 0 see fig 7 the simultaneous reduction of phosphorus and nitrogen inputs seems the most rigorous solution for lake okeechobee in the long term a statement in agreement with the call for a paradigm shift in lake nutrient management outlined in paerl et al 2016 in the short term however it is difficult to apply a systematic approach to achieve such targets thus optimizing the location of existing and emerging nutrient management practices for upstream catchments should be an immediate action riparian buffers or filter strips may be attractive solutions due to their low establishment costs hashemi et al 2016 since nitrogen is more often the limited nutrient for phytoplankton production in lake okeechobee aldridge 1995 an initial focus on targeting reductions in nitrogen loads from local watersheds may help to reduce the intensity of blooms of non nitrogen fixing species of cyanobacteria such as microcystis aeruginosa which is currently viewed as the most prevalent toxin threat in the lake rosen et al 2017 paerl et al 2020 phlips et al 2020 lake nutrient removal has been proposed as an alternative to reduce abs using model derived estimates james and pollman 2011 suggested removing 51 458 ha or 70 of accessible phosphorus laden mud sediment over 15 years at a cost of 3 billion usd these estimates were derived from the internal loading phosphorus model ilpm and lake okeechobee water quality model lowqm lumped models which did not take into account spatial distribution of sediment when dredging was applied in this study we tested the case of removing lake legacy nutrients in combination with reducing input nutrients phosphorus and nitrogen up to 50 we found that there was a significant difference between scenarios with and without removing lake nutrients the difference in the mean chl a of the two time series datasets was only around 5 62 μ g l suggesting that nutrients from both canals and lakes are important nutrient sources that fueled abs indeed chl a dropped to almost 0 μ g l when lake legacy nutrients were removed model simulations still showed some comparatively small blooms in these events nitrogen inflows originated from atmospheric deposition may benefit microcystis aeruginosa paerl et al 2020 our model experiment revealed that reducing all phosphorus and nitrogen from the watershed cannot completely eliminate ab formation because the effects of the legacy nutrients and atmospheric deposition legacy phosphorus for example can maintain phosphorus concentrations in the lake to a certain level for over 50 to 75 years paerl et al 2020 overall long term modeling efforts with this high spatial resolution 3d model demonstrate the need for a portfolio approach to ab prevention in lake okeechobee and other eutrophic lakes in this study we did not include the effects of submerged vegetation on the biochemical model developed for lake okeechobee this limitation was due to the lack of current available data on submerged vegetation but it provides the opportunity to focus on specific aspects of interest i e abs and reduced the model s complexity future studies may consider incorporating submerged vegetation to further enhance the model s ecological representation as suggested in zhang et al 2015 6 conclusions in summary warm water temperature and a nutrient rich phosphorus and nitrogen environment favor frequent and persistent abs in lake okeechobee ab limiting factors depend on both temporal and spatial patterns from may to november high water temperature and solar radiation triggers ab events ab events tend to start in shallow regions especially near tributary inflows which are the source of nutrient loads for phytoplankton growth shallow nearshore regions are also characterized by high average light availability in the mixed layer which enhance rates of net photosynthesis in the water column compared to the deeper region of the lake abs which form in nearshore regions can then spread to other parts of the lake through wind driven circulation our simulations indicate however that it would be highly unlikely to prevent the occurrence of abs by reducing nitrogen or phosphorus alone instead due to the presence of legacy nutrients and the different algae functional groups reducing both phosphorus and nitrogen by a similar mass proportion could be more effective since excess nutrients mainly come from inflows of new nutrients from canals upstream watershed management plans are necessary to improve water quality and mitigate the ab problem in the lake and receiving canals and estuaries it is important to simulate different best management practices and technological options to reduce both nitrogen and phosphorus inflows to the lake lake okeechobee is an iconic example where abs are driven by complex physical and biogeochemical factors yet this study can provide useful insights and lessons for the increasing number of lakes

7703,study region algal blooms abs often exacerbated by excess nutrients from anthropogenic activities can pose serious risks to public health fisheries and ecosystem structure and functions lake okeechobee is located in southcentral florida usa and with a surface area of 1730 km 2 it is the largest subtropical lake in the united states this lake is shallow nutrient rich and subject to frequent and intense blooms of cyanobacteria some of which are toxic study focus in this study a three dimensional 3d model was developed coupling long term monitoring data with complex physical chemical and ecological processes at fine spatial 15 1000 m horizontal mesh size and temporal 1 h resolution we used this model to understand the influence of environmental factors and nutrient management on abs dynamics in lake okeechobee new hydrological insights for the region the model showed that abs mostly developed in shallow nearshore regions near canal outlets and then spread over the lake as a result of prevailing winds and currents hypothetical scenario modeling showed that reducing both nitrogen and phosphorus inputs by 50 75 would be more effective at reducing abs in the lake than targeting a single nutrient the model could be used as a tool to assess the effectiveness of different nutrient management strategies in lake okeechobee and its watershed while the framework could be adopted to other large water bodies facing similar issues graphical abstract keywords numerical modeling algal blooms lake okeechobee management options legacy nutrients delft3d data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lakes and reservoirs provide water for a range of human demands such as drinking water irrigation recreation and tourism janssen et al 2019 accelerated rates of eutrophication associated with human development in many lake ecosystems around the world are creating water quality issues including algal blooms abs heisler et al 2008 o neil et al 2012 ab events in lakes are projected to worsen as a result of global warming and continued cultural eutrophication o neil et al 2012 paerl et al 2016 visser et al 2016 beusen et al 2016 certain algae types can release toxins that are harmful to human health and ecosystems anderson et al 2021 the inhalation or consumption of affected waters can be harmful to animals and humans and toxins can bioaccumulate in food chains berry et al 2011 comprehensive water quality management solutions are therefore needed to mitigate the potential for abs and the associated adverse impacts burford et al 2020 quantitative modeling has played an important role helping water managers define the drivers for abs and develop effective approaches to reduce the frequency and intensity of blooms models that define the relationship between environmental factors and abs have been developed for a number of lakes around the world burford et al 2020 ralston and moore 2020 for example bilaletdin et al 2011 applied a process based model aquatox developed by park et al 2008 to study the effect of excessive phosphorus loading on eutrophication in lake onega russia united states army corps of engineers usace developed the ce qual icm model to study eutrophication processes in chesapeake bay usa cerco and cole 1992 and concluded that eutrophication models must take into consideration nitrogen phosphorus silica and carbon cycles as well as sedimentation processes aldridge 1995 james and bierman jr 1995 james and havens 1996 havens and james 1999 james et al 2008 alluded to the importance of light extinction due to suspended sediment in addition to other processes with a particular emphasis on lake okeechobee in other modeling efforts the impacts of climate change on eutrophication and abs in lake taihu china have been investigated in tang et al 2015 2016 the modeling efforts revealed the dependency of abs on water temperature wind conditions and nutrient flux into the lake recent advances in remote sensing and environmental data science have facilitated the short term forecasting of algal bloom occurrences e g tang et al 2022 overall process based numerical models have become standard in evaluating the nexus of management solution and water quality but less attention has been focused on broader environmental drivers of abs in large lakes understanding the effect of environmental drivers on abs is important for identifying the best targets for management of eutrophication issues given its size and close relationships to wide range of regional water supply and water quality issues lake okeechobee is an example of a lake deserving of attention james and bierman jr 1995 james and pollman 2011 james 2016 used a mass balance model and a dynamic water quality model namely the internal loading phosphorus model ilpm and the lake okeechobee water quality model lowqm to evaluate nutrient management solutions e g large scale chemical treatment and dredging an open source model called lake operation optimization of nutrient exports loone was developed by tarabih et al 2022 to evaluate water quality control alternatives for the lake lumped models like this are important for uncertainty analyses or operational purposes i e gate operations for lake okeechobee since their processing time is relatively short dilks and james 2011 james 2016 however a spatially explicit three dimensional 3d hydrodynamic model is needed to represent critical hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes in this complex water system for instance although substances in the lake are well mixed in the vertical direction light penetration and algal growth occur predominantly in the top layer i e 30 cm to 1 2 m depending on the location phlips et al 1995 rodusky et al 2005 james 2016 jin et al 2007 developed the 3d lake okeechobee environment model loem and used it to study water quality processes in the lake loem was based on the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc hamrick 1992 which does not have 3d flexible computational mesh capabilities this limitation makes it difficult to simulate the littoral zone in detail especially those canals in the northern and western sites of lake okeechobee overall the lessons learned from decades of research in this lake are also relevant to other similar shallow large subtropical lakes in this study we explored the relationships among hydrodynamics nutrient fluxes and abs in large subtropical lakes within the context of a case study of lake okeechobee using a high spatial and temporal numerical model lake okeechobee is not only an important lake in florida but is also an interesting example of a highly engineered system with multiple regulated inflows and outflows through this study we aimed to answer three important management related questions 1 what are the main factors causing abs in lake okeechobee 2 how much of a reduction in nutrient imports and or legacy sediments is needed to reduce the occurrence of abs 3 what magnitude of nutrient input reduction would be required to reduce abs the open source delft3d flow module was used to simulate the hydrodynamic conditions of the lake hydrodynamic modeling results were used to drive a water quality ecological delft3d waq model to calculate algal production modeling results were compared against observed data for model calibration and validation we then tested several alternative solutions to investigate how phytoplankton concentrations change with regard to changes in nutrient concentrations using chlorophyll a chl a as a surrogate for phytoplankton biomass 2 study area lake okeechobee is located in southcentral florida usa center location at 26 9690 n 80 7976 w with a surface area of 1730 km 2 it is the largest freshwater lake in the u s outside of the great lakes fig 1 though of natural origin lake okeechobee has functioned as a reservoir since the construction of a dike that surrounds around 230 km of its perimeter among six main tributaries only fisheating creek is not diked and flow is not regulated the lake is an important source of water for nearby cities as well as for the everglades national park the loxahatchee national wildlife refuge and the everglades agricultural area the lake also plays a critical role in regional flood control water levels and outflows are controlled by a complex network of hydraulic structures i e culverts gates locks and pumps operated by the usace and the south florida water management district sfwmd guided by the lake okeechobee regulation schedule lors usace 2008 and the forthcoming lake okeechobee system operating manual losom usace 2022 it is well known that the lake has become progressively more eutrophic since the construction of the dike in the first half of the 20th century in part because of nutrient inputs from urban and agricultural development in the lake s watersheds khare et al 2019 tarabih and arias 2021 over time a thixotropic mud layer containing legacy nutrients has developed especially in the deeper zone of the lake fisher et al 2001 2005 vogel et al 2016 as a shallow lake during windy periods phosphorus attached to sediment particles is stirred up and becomes accessible to algae in the water column but too much sediment may cause an inverse relationship of phosphorus and algae owing to light limitation phlips et al 1995 søballe 1998 large scale algal blooms have continued to occur along with the accumulation of legacy phosphorus in this benthic mud layer missimer et al 2020 conducted a literature review and concluded that it would be very difficult to restore the lake without removing the legacy nutrients the rising tropic status of lake okeechobee has led to increasing incidents of intense harmful algal blooms dominated by cyanobacteria a trend that has been observed in many lakes in florida canfield et al 1989 part of the rising threats from cyanobacteria blooms has been prominence of the toxic species microcystis aeruginosa rosen et al 2017 paerl et al 2020 which is particularly noted for prolific production of the hepatoxin microcystin chorus and welker 2021 3 methods in order to simulate complex processes in lake okeechobee we relied on coupling delft3d flow and delft3d waq see deltares 2019 the hydrodynamic deflt3d flow module solves the momentum and continuity equations using an unstructured finite volume method and delft3d waq solves the advection diffusion equations together with an extensive water quality library for different biogeochemical processes for delft3d waq we simulated several biogeochemical cycles including oxygen nitrogen phosphorus sediment settling and resuspension algal growth and competition carbon components silica si and other ions i e fe 3 mn 2 and so 4 2 fig 2 shows the main biogeochemical processes considered more details on each process and data used in this study are described in the sub

mesh resolution ranged from 15 m for the near shore zones and southwest marshes to 1000 m for the off shore deeper water zones supplemental information fig s1 the range of mesh size was chosen based on balancing computational costs and level of details of the model domain the vertical dimension was subdivided into five layers using the sigma layer approach which scales the thickness of each layer proportional to the total water depth typically lake water balance was obtained by including inflows outflows rainfall and evapotranspiration from open water and wetland bilaletdin et al 2011 sporadic emergency water abstraction in the form of pumping activities in the southern part of the lake infiltration and leakage were not considered 3 2 oxygen cycle oxygen is a fundamental component of most aquatic biogeochemical cycles and was therefore included in this study in some of the previous lake okeechobee modeling studies oxygen cycling was ignored because the lake is shallow the average depth of the lake is approximately three meters and thus the lake was assumed to be primarily aerobic nonetheless historical data over the period 2008 2021 showed that the concentrations of no 2 plus no 3 from here on called no x were sometimes below 0 01 mg l suggesting either algal uptake or denitrification under anoxic conditions jin et al 2007 also considered dissolved oxygen d o in their model thus we explicitly considered oxygen cycling in the lake including chemical oxygen demand c o d biochemical oxygen demand b o d and sediment oxygen demand s o d in delft3d waq the reaeration of oxygen into water is dependent on water temperature salinity intrusion and wind speed see eq 1 deltares 2019 but biochemical processes in the lake are expected to have little effects on water temperature and salinity thus we added these two variables as time series data instead of simulating them directly 1 r r e a r k l r e a r c o x s c o x h k l r e a r a v b h c d w 2 c o x s f t s a l where r r e a r

kgm 3 3 3 phosphorus and nitrogen cycles atmospheric deposition nitrification denitrification nitrogen fixation ammonification and uptake by algae were assumed to be responsible for transformations among four nitrogen forms organic nitrogen ammonia nh 4 nitrite nitrate no x and nitrogen gas n 2 regarding the phosphorus cycle we considered organic phosphorus and ortho phosphate po 4 3 as well as the adsorption of po 4 3 to suspended solids and bed sediments beside atmospheric deposition in all of these nutrient related processes hydrolysis and algal dynamics contributed to chemical consumption transformation and decomposition atmospheric deposition values 23 3 kg of organic phosphorus 661 7 kg of ammonia 714 6 kg of nitrate nitrite and 2003 kg of organic nitrogen per day were taken from james 2016 overall the mass balances for dissolved po 4 3 no x and nh 4 in the water column are calculated as follows 2 δ po 4 3 δ t l o a d s t r a n s p o r t s o r p t i o n m i n e r a

organisms in lake okeechobee grouped into cyanobacteria spp green algae and diatoms as reported in previous studies cichra et al 1995 havens et al 1996 phlips et al 2020 paerl et al 2020 tarabih and arias 2021 most major blooms in the lake are dominated by cyanobacteria with microcystis aeruginosa dolichospermum spp and aphanizomenon spp among the most prevalent cyanobacteria genera dominance of cyanobacteria in blooms is a common feature in eutrophic lakes in florida canfield et al 1989 the pattern of cyanobacterial dominance extends to many shallow eutrophics around the world dokulil and teubner 2000 overall we simulated algal growth respiration transport settling resuspension and mortality but grazing was not considered havens et al 1996 conducted mesocosm grazing experiments with samples collected from lake okeechobee and found that zooplankton grazing is not an important regular of phytoplankton biomass and productivity similar observations have been made for other sub tropical tropical lakes around the world saunders and lewis 1988 fernando 1994 magadza 1994 chen et al 2003 for example in the case of lake taihu de kluijver et al 2012 suggest that cyanobacteria blooms primarily provide carbon to higher tropic levels through bacterial decomposition of senescent bloom biomass although there is some lower level direct grazing on cyanobacteria which does not significantly impact bloom potential the basis for the lack of significant control of blooms by direct grazing in lake okeechobee may be related to a combination of the character of zooplankton community structure in the lake crisman et al 1995 havens et al 1996 and the resistance to grazing exhibited by the dominant bloom forming cyanobacteria species in the lake such as microcystis aeruginosa a number of factors have been linked to the resistance to grazing losses exhibited by bloom forming cyanobacteria including the production of toxins and other biologically active compounds and the morphology of filaments and colonies that represent a physical challenge to grazing capacity crisman et al 1995 wilson et al 2006 yang et al 2009 zhu et al 2013 vilar et al 2021 the bloom module within delft3d waq was used to account for the competition among the selected algal functional groups bloom was based on an assumption that each phytoplankton type would try to maximize the total net production of its community in each time step deltares 2019 the mass balance equation for phytoplankton is as follows 5 δ p h y t o p l a n k t o n δ t l o a d s t r a n s p o r t s e t t l

lake were modeled since suspended sediments and phytoplankton growth could change turbidity in the lake resulting in the reduction of light penetration sediment was assumed to be presented in the suspended form as well as high mobility particles of the thixotropic mud layers in the bottom of the lake the lake sediment zones were defined in sfwmd 2002 and ji and jin 2014 to quantify the effect of wind on sediment transport in the lake an important feature of the mud layer in the deep zone was a 10 cm deep layer of legacy phosphorus accumulating over 50 years which resulted in a volume of over 30 000 m 3 ji and jin 2014 adsorbed phosphate was simulated as a substance besides organic carbon and organic phosphate from detritus decomposition in summary sediment cycling includes transport settling resuspension burial and upward transport water quality and biological processes in the lake were not only driven by the aforementioned cycles in the water body but also atmospheric forcings and other elements solar radiation fraction of cloud coverage and penetration capacity of sunlight secchi depth were among additional atmospheric variables besides those used in delft3d flow in the west and north sides of the lake the effect of vegetation coverage which blocked light penetration was simulated by setting the length of days to 0 1 as electron acceptors i e o 2 no x fe 3 and so 4 2 and carbon dioxide co 2 were considered p h might have an important role and was therefore also simulated finally silicon si an important nutrient to build skeletal structures of phytoplankton especially diatoms was included 4 data and scenarios 4 1 data time series data were collected from the dbhydro database available at apps sfwmd gov accessed on march 2022 an online database maintained by sfwmd details described in tarabih and arias 2021 daily climate forcings air temperature wind speed etc were obtained from the same database at four locations l001 l005 l006 and lz40 sfwmd calculated flow rates through hydraulic structures from daily water levels which were measured by using automatic equipment such as solid state loggers and telemetry tarabih and arias 2021 flow rate data from 24 lake okeechobee inflow stations were used in the model development direct surface runoff beyond these stations was not considered since the dike and hydraulic infrastructure force most of the surface water through one of these stations monitoring data used in the model include total phosphorus t p po 4 3 p nh 4 n no x n total nitrogen t n total kjeldahl nitrogen t k n dissolved oxygen d o chl a carbon all forms turbidity salinity secchi disk depth si fe 3 and so 4 2 water quality data were collected monthly or biweekly by using either autosamplers or manual grab chl a data were mainly used in this study to calibrate and validate algal production in the lake 4 2 scenarios we ran the model for the period from january 2016 to december 2018 for calibration and from january 2019 to december 2021 for validation this period was chosen since algal blooms were prominent and monitoring datasets widely available and complete we then used the period from january 2016 to december 2018 for a baseline scenario besides r 2 the mean absolute error mae which was the average of the absolute difference between the observed and simulated values was used to evaluate model performance eq 6 6 m a e 1 n i 1 n y i y ˆ i where y ˆ i is the simulated daily value and y i is the observed daily value our simulation scenarios focused on efforts at the watershed scale that directly influence nutrient inflows into the lake in order to design best management practices for contributing watersheds it is necessary to study effective nutrient reduction targets thus we ran different combinations of po 4 3 and no x load reductions i e 25 50 75 and 100 additionally we also simulated a nutrient removal scenario as in james and pollman 2011 they suggested that about 500 km 2 10 cm of the offshore mud sediments in the deep zone fig 1 should be dredged alternatively james and pollman 2011 also evaluated chemical treatment as a solution for nutrient removal in this study we considered nutrient removal as a general term covering the two above approaches without considering their short term effects a fixed computational time step of 10 s s was adopted in the water quality model to ensure its stability the simulation results however were exported as hourly averaged time series initial conditions were obtained by interpolating data at the six stations fig 1 in the lake using the inverse distance weighting idw method the list of variables and their values for delft3d flow and delft3d waq is available in supplemental information tables s1 s2 and s3 the model was calibrated manually with the trial and error method owing to the expensive computational time of a three dimensional model 5 results and discussion 5 1 model calibration and validation for hydrodynamic modeling with delft3d flow the coefficient of determination r 2 between gauged and observed water levels at lz40 was 0 98 see section 1 in supplemental information for more details delft3d waq was calibrated and validated with respect to the concentration of d o no x po 4 3 and chl a using data observed at the six sites illustrated in fig 1 grab samples from 0 5 m below the water surface these six sites are distributed around the lake in locations with different hydrologic and biological characteristics calibration validation results showed that the model could reproduce the main multi annual and seasonal trends of key variables fig 3 shows results for two stations l007 and l008 and calibration validation results for the other stations are included in supplemental information table s4 and figure s4 most phytoplankton can use nh 4 and no x as nitrogen sources however the concentration of nh 4 was low in the lake in part because nitrification and algal uptake can both occur rapidly ambrose et al 1993 lee et al 2015 thus nh 4 was excluded in model calibration d o is a central component of any water quality model and it is among the most important indicators of the health of aquatic environments tang et al 2016 the mean absolute error mae values of simulated d o concentration were about 0 45 mg l during the calibration period and these values were from 0 36 to 0 87 mg l during the validation period the r 2 values ranged from 0 66 to 0 90 and from 0 67 to 0 88 for the calibration and validation periods respectively there was a clear seasonal pattern in d o which tended to be the opposite of temperature see figure s5 in supplemental information for correlations among variables we observed higher d o concentrations in the winter december march and lower concentration in the summer june september this was reasonable since d o depended on water temperature as shown in eq 1 in some other case studies e g bilaletdin et al 2011 salinity levels affected d o and limited algal growth but this was not the case for lake okeechobee since the concentration of chloride cl was relatively low and stable 70 mg l d o fluctuated slightly when abs occurred because of the presence of primary producers po 4 3 and no x are important nutrients for the growth of algae if nh 4 is limited for the calibration period the means of mae of modeled po 4 3 and no x were 0 02 mg l and 0 12 mg l respectively the averaged mae for the validation periods were 0 02 and 0 11 mg l for po 4 3 and no x respectively r 2 for po 4 3 calculated for the calibration and validation periods were 0 41 and 0 44 respectively r 2 for no x were 0 30 and 0 41 for the calibration and validation periods in general the model can capture well the observed po 4 3 data although it missed some peak points which may have been due to sample heterogeneity caused by local turbulence under external forces e g wind gusts or boat traffic causing random resuspension or consistent wind leading to large waves in the shallow lake the mae values of simulated po 4 3 and no x which was approximate 10 and 20 of the maximum concentration 0 11 and 0 59 mg l were acceptable considering the spatial coverage of the large computational domain and spatial 15 1000 m and temporal hourly resolutions of the model we used chl a as a surrogate for phytoplankton concentrations the mae value of modeled chl a was 8 92 μ g l and 9 10 μ g l for the calibration and validation periods respectively the corresponding r 2 values were 0 35 and 0 30 the values of chl a varied largely every day and had one annual peak in the summer observed chl a at l007 sometimes dropped below 5 μ g l lake okeechobee has been previously modeled at the same temporal resolution daily by using both empirical and process based models for example james et al 2005 used the lake okeechobee water quality model lowqm a deterministic and mass balance model to model p n and phytoplankton although the model calibration results seem equivalent to this study lowqm is unable to provide information on spatial dynamics lake okeechobee environment model loem a 3 d hydrodynamic water quality model developed by jin et al 2007 can provide more values in understanding spatial dynamics of the system but it was only calibrated for one station and is limited by its rectangular mesh which is unable to represent the canal rim around the lake and other non uniform spatial features an earlier model developed by jin et al 1998 for the lake called eutro was not calibrated environmental fluid dynamics code efdc gave negative nses in predicting the water quality variables in shin et al 2023 the performance of these models is summarized in table 1 5 2 temporal and spatial variations and drivers of algal blooms in this study we reported the temporal and spatial variations of abs over the period of three simulation years we performed the non parametric mann kendall trend test and found no statistically significant trend p value 0 35 in algal concentrations in the lake during the period 2016 2021 which is consistent with trend analyses based on observations tarabih and arias 2021 before 2001 the total phosphorus concentration in the lake increased rapidly from 40 to 120 μ g l which drove the florida department of environmental protection fdep to establish a total maximum daily load tmdl of 140 metric tons total phosphorus per year for the lake fdep 2001 this might result in the reduction of chl a concentrations after that and the trend during 2016 2021 became unclear fig 4 shows the annual average of d o po 4 3 no x and chl a in each year for the period 2016 2018 d o was low at the mouth of the kissimmee river and the sw bay whereas d o was quite high in the center of the lake this phenomenon might be a result of high cod near the canal mouths noting that the kissimmee river is the source of approximately 75 of organic matter into the lake phlips et al 2020 tarabih and arias 2021 meanwhile low do in the southwest of the lake may be caused by nearby agricultural activities the concentrations of po 4 3 no x and chl a tended to be higher in the center northwest and southeast of the lake phlips et al 1994 and james et al 2009 explained that phosphorus concentrations in the central region was high because of soft phosphorus rich sediments however we found high concentrations in the central lake likely reflected wind facilitated transport of blooms emanating from other regions rather than autochthonous production james et al 2009 found higher chl a in the western and northern nearshore regions of lake okeechobee compared to the central region these observations suggest the importance of nutrient inputs from tributaries in the north and west for ab formation as well as the shallower depths in these regions compared to the center of the lake which enhance light availability for photosynthesis there were several physical factors limiting algal growth in the model water temperature likely being the most important see fig 5 the principal bloom forming algae in lake okeechobee are cyanobacteria and it is widely recognized that many of these species favor temperatures above 25 c paerl and hussmann 2008 nelson et al 2018 high temperature and solar radiation in the summer clearly favor ab formation also see figure s5 for correlations between variables d o had a high inverse correlation with water temperature in this study we found that the relationship between water level and chl a was unclear because of the interplay effect of water level light availability in the water column wind turbidity and microbial processes phlips et al 1997 james et al 2009 for example if water levels increase because of inflows and precipitation water transparency will reduce because inflows bring nutrients and organic and inorganic materials in the case of lake okeechobee both observed data and simulation results showed a high concentration of phosphorus and nitrogen in the lake we observed an increase of chl a concentrations associated with the decrease of no x this is likely a result of large no x utilization by abs which is supported by in situ data analysis with phosphorus nitrogen and chl a that revealed high turbidity and nitrogen limited algal primary production aldridge 1995 phlips et al 1995 hansen et al 1997 havens and east 1997 adequate phosphorus supply throughout the years due to both canal inputs and legacy phosphorus might have resulted in the effective use of nitrogen in the form of no x in water for example almost all the points in which chl a values were above 40 μ g l no x dropped below 0 2 mg l the concentration of po 4 3 was sometimes below 0 02 mg l indicating seasonal minima in phosphorus and inorganic nitrogen were the limiting factors of abs aldridge 1995 schelske 1989 abs often occurred during the hurricane season when sediment was resuspended owing to high wind speed but there was a lag between an actual hurricane and an ab event this lag time could be dependent on physical conditions e g water temperature and solar radiation and existing conditions of the lake the summer season with increased rainfall and tropical hurricanes e g irma in september 2017 and increased water levels in the lake tended to dilute nutrients in a very short period since rainfall was among the main sources of water in the lake nonetheless both phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations increased again together with the increased turbidity jin et al 2011 and phlips et al 2020 suggested that high rainfall triggered by hurricanes might bring nutrient rich water to the lake from its watersheds despite the nutrient rich environment we did not observe major responses of the algal community because high turbidity in water prevented light penetration which was also mentioned in phlips et al 2020 the long residence time of water average turnover of 3 5 years according to james and pollman 2011 then partially aided high potential of algal blooms in the later periods or the next summer depending on how the lake is managed after the storms abs tend to start at the near shore areas near the outlet of taylor creek kissimmee river indian prairies canal harney pond canal and miami canal locations in fig 1 this can be explained by two phenomena first the zones near these points are quite shallow with high water transparency that warms up quickly this conclusion supported what phlips et al 1995 found by using observed data analysis second these rivers and canals drain large agricultural areas in this study we found that besides the bay in the western and southern sites of the lake abs also occurred near the outlet of the kissimmee river and the taylor creek which provide nutrient inputs from their watersheds that help drive cyanobacteria blooms abs originating in these nearshore regions can then spread and expand to other regions of the lake by wind driven circulation fig 6 figure s3 in supplemental information shows changes in current velocity and direction owing to wind the importance of wind in defining the distribution of abs has also been highlighted in other studies of lake okeechobee shin et al 2023 and other lakes subject to cyanobacteria blooms around the world such as lake taihu in china wu et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 5 3 potential management solutions we evaluated the reduction of both phosphorus and nitrogen inputs into the lake model by different proportions to test how incoming nutrients influence abs in the lake anova test showed significant differences p 0 01 among the simulated results for all the scenarios the chl a threshold of 40 μ g l was chosen as an indicator of ab events as in havens and walker jr 2002 and tarabih and arias 2021 simulations showed that either limiting phosphorus or nitrogen individually could have an effect but to a limited extent if nitrogen concentrations were reduced yielding tn tp ratios below 22 1 by mass n fixing cyanobacteria e g dolichospermum spp aphanizomenon spp would increase see smith 1995 and tarabih and arias 2021 potentially providing some nitrogen for non n fixing species e g microcystis aeruginosa if phosphorus concentrations were reduced the loss of phosphorus inflows might be compensated for legacy phosphorus so reducing phosphorus inflows to the lake would not prevent abs without addressing legacy loads a similar conclusion was made for lake taihu in china for which the authors concluded that a significant reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus of up to 80 and 30 respectively was required to reduce chl a by approximately 24 38 tang et al 2016 hellweger et al 2022 developed an agent based model to simulate microcystis growth in lake erie and concluded that nutrient control must include both phosphorus and nitrogen in this study we found that by reducing 75 of phosphorus and 75 of nitrogen the maximum chl a concentration would be halved fig 7 more importantly the number of hours in which chl a exceeded 40 μ g l was reduced to 0 see fig 7 the simultaneous reduction of phosphorus and nitrogen inputs seems the most rigorous solution for lake okeechobee in the long term a statement in agreement with the call for a paradigm shift in lake nutrient management outlined in paerl et al 2016 in the short term however it is difficult to apply a systematic approach to achieve such targets thus optimizing the location of existing and emerging nutrient management practices for upstream catchments should be an immediate action riparian buffers or filter strips may be attractive solutions due to their low establishment costs hashemi et al 2016 since nitrogen is more often the limited nutrient for phytoplankton production in lake okeechobee aldridge 1995 an initial focus on targeting reductions in nitrogen loads from local watersheds may help to reduce the intensity of blooms of non nitrogen fixing species of cyanobacteria such as microcystis aeruginosa which is currently viewed as the most prevalent toxin threat in the lake rosen et al 2017 paerl et al 2020 phlips et al 2020 lake nutrient removal has been proposed as an alternative to reduce abs using model derived estimates james and pollman 2011 suggested removing 51 458 ha or 70 of accessible phosphorus laden mud sediment over 15 years at a cost of 3 billion usd these estimates were derived from the internal loading phosphorus model ilpm and lake okeechobee water quality model lowqm lumped models which did not take into account spatial distribution of sediment when dredging was applied in this study we tested the case of removing lake legacy nutrients in combination with reducing input nutrients phosphorus and nitrogen up to 50 we found that there was a significant difference between scenarios with and without removing lake nutrients the difference in the mean chl a of the two time series datasets was only around 5 62 μ g l suggesting that nutrients from both canals and lakes are important nutrient sources that fueled abs indeed chl a dropped to almost 0 μ g l when lake legacy nutrients were removed model simulations still showed some comparatively small blooms in these events nitrogen inflows originated from atmospheric deposition may benefit microcystis aeruginosa paerl et al 2020 our model experiment revealed that reducing all phosphorus and nitrogen from the watershed cannot completely eliminate ab formation because the effects of the legacy nutrients and atmospheric deposition legacy phosphorus for example can maintain phosphorus concentrations in the lake to a certain level for over 50 to 75 years paerl et al 2020 overall long term modeling efforts with this high spatial resolution 3d model demonstrate the need for a portfolio approach to ab prevention in lake okeechobee and other eutrophic lakes in this study we did not include the effects of submerged vegetation on the biochemical model developed for lake okeechobee this limitation was due to the lack of current available data on submerged vegetation but it provides the opportunity to focus on specific aspects of interest i e abs and reduced the model s complexity future studies may consider incorporating submerged vegetation to further enhance the model s ecological representation as suggested in zhang et al 2015 6 conclusions in summary warm water temperature and a nutrient rich phosphorus and nitrogen environment favor frequent and persistent abs in lake okeechobee ab limiting factors depend on both temporal and spatial patterns from may to november high water temperature and solar radiation triggers ab events ab events tend to start in shallow regions especially near tributary inflows which are the source of nutrient loads for phytoplankton growth shallow nearshore regions are also characterized by high average light availability in the mixed layer which enhance rates of net photosynthesis in the water column compared to the deeper region of the lake abs which form in nearshore regions can then spread to other parts of the lake through wind driven circulation our simulations indicate however that it would be highly unlikely to prevent the occurrence of abs by reducing nitrogen or phosphorus alone instead due to the presence of legacy nutrients and the different algae functional groups reducing both phosphorus and nitrogen by a similar mass proportion could be more effective since excess nutrients mainly come from inflows of new nutrients from canals upstream watershed management plans are necessary to improve water quality and mitigate the ab problem in the lake and receiving canals and estuaries it is important to simulate different best management practices and technological options to reduce both nitrogen and phosphorus inflows to the lake lake okeechobee is an iconic example where abs are driven by complex physical and biogeochemical factors yet this study can provide useful insights and lessons for the increasing number of lakes

an acceptable level of water related risks to human beings and ecosystems combined with an adequate quantity of clean water to support human livelihoods ecological health and national security bakker 2012 cook and bakker 2012 has aroused extensive attention worldwide it has been estimated that almost 80 of the population around the globe is faced with a serious challenge to water security he et al 2021 as an important indicator of water security the stress index on water resources continues to rise in pace with the growth of population and gdp due to the increment of food and energy needs the advancement of living conditions and the difficulty in the administration of regional water resources over the last century global water withdrawals by humans have grown sixfold which is more than twice the population increment rate shiklomanov 2000 wada et al 2013 in china the total amount of freshwater resources ranks sixth globally while per capita freshwater resources only account for a quarter of the global average level sun et al 2017 driven by agriculture manufacturing and industries during the last few decades china has experienced nearly double digit gdp growth satoh et al 2017 resulting in water withdrawals in many river tributaries for instance the hai river yellow river yer and huai river exceeding available renewable freshwater resources yin et al 2020 the yellow river

the severe water scarcity in the upper and middle regions of the yerb the western route of the south to north water diversion project snwd w has been presented and is under the planning and design phases now mwrc 2022 according to the recent planning water will be diverted from the tongtian river dadu river and yalong river into the source area of the yer flowing to the six northwestern provinces containing qinghai gansu ningxia inner mongolia shanxi and shaanxi prc 2016 the water intakes of the above three water diversion schemes belong to different basins and the relevance between these schemes is weak besides the amount of water diversion varies with different schemes which will be implemented by stages in the future huang et al 2015 investigated the streamflow characteristics and trends in both water diverting and water receiving areas over the past 50 years ning et al 2022 explored the effects of future climate change on water resources in water diverting areas yin et al 2020 quantified the water stress in water receiving areas under future climatic and societal changes with the snwd w project given that the snwd w project is in the planning stages and the water diversion will inevitably harm the water supply and further impact hydropower generation in the water diverting area it is thus necessary to quantify the degree of the impact and assess whether it can be accepted in this study the scheme in which the water is only diverted from the yalong river was considered for the snwd w project to explore its impacts on water and energy security in the yalong river basin fig 1 the yalong river basin ylrb situated on the southeastern edge of the qinghai tibet plateau is the source water diverting area of the snwd w project as well as china s third largest hydropower base with a theoretical hydropower reserve of 38 4 million kw the upper region of the ylrb belongs to the plateau subtropical semi humid climate zone with a sparse population and little human interference while the middle and lower streams of the ylrb belong to the humid climate zone with denser population prosperous industry developed agriculture and abundant hydro energy resources it has been reported that due to the comprehensive effects of climate change and aggravating human activities over the last few decades the ylrb has experienced a significant decline in annual runoff and severe drought events occurred more frequently which seriously threatens regional water and energy security zhang et al 2021a shi et al 2022 so far limited research has mainly concentrated on the effects of future climate change on runoff and hydropower generation in the ylrb cao et al 2021 zhao et al 2021a zhao et al 2022 and a few studies have investigated the spatiotemporal variation pattern of future water withdrawals and water stress at a national or global scale chen et al 2021 hanasaki et al 2013a zhai et al 2022 while combined with the regional reality the analysis for the temporal variation of water stress and its dominant factor in the study area was weak to the best of our knowledge there exists no literature that investigated the effects of the snwd w project on future water stress and hydropower generation in this water diverting area therefore taking the ylrb as the typical study region this study firstly explores the comprehensive impacts of future climatic and societal changes i e social economic development and snwd w on water and energy security from the perspective of the water diverting area specifically the objectives of the study were to a quantify future water supply water withdrawals and water stress index b quantify future hydropower generation c evaluate the impacts of the snwd w project on the water and energy security in the ylrb the results will provide a valuable reference for the water resources administration in the ylrb and the planning of the snwd w project 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area originating from the southern foothills of the bayankara mountains the yalong river ylr is the major tributary of the jinsha river zhang et al 2021a the drainage area and natural drop are 1 36 105 km2 and 3830 m respectively fig 1 the upper stream of the ylr belongs to the plateau subtropical semi humid climate zone with sparse population and little human interference while the middle and lower streams of the ylr belong to the humid climate zone with denser population prosperous industry developed agriculture and abundant hydro energy resources the dry and rainy seasons of the ylrb are distinct and the annual average precipitation and runoff depth are 600 800 mm and 300 400 mm respectively huang et al 2020 the runoff of ylrb is primarily contributed by direct precipitation while the remainder is supplemented by melting snow and groundwater according to the reservoir construction scheme for the ylrb twenty two cascade hydropower stations have been planned among which jinping i and ertan were built before 2006 and jinping ii guandi tongzilin and lianghekou have been built in sequence since 2006 table 1 based on the recent scheme the lianghekou reservoir was set as the only water diverting reservoir in the ylrb considering that the snwd w project is still in the planning stage thus 2006 2020 was chosen as the baseline period without water diversion and 2021 2099 was selected as the future period with different water diversion scenarios 2 2 data the simulated runoff data and agricultural water withdrawal during 1981 2099 were obtained from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip https data isimip org search with 0 5 spatial resolution the second stage of isimip contains two parts where isimip 2a and 2b concentrate on model validation during 1971 2010 and global warming impact projections during 1850 2099 respectively the global gridded hydrological model gghm watergap 2 2c müller schmied et al 2016 and h08 hanasaki et al 2008 were chosen to simulate water supply and agricultural water withdrawal respectively the gghms were forced with watch wfd meteorological variables i e humidity temperature precipitation wind pressure and radiation in the historic period best et al 2011 and with the statistical bias corrected meteorological variables from the outputs of global climate models gcms in the future period haerter et al 2011 piani et al 2010 in this study all four types of gcms in isimip2b namely gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr and miroc5 were chosen and two typical representative concentration pathways scenarios namely rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 which denote the lowest and highest radiative forcing scenarios in the future and have been extensively adopted in climate change research were selected on behalf of future climate conditions in the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 the future domestic and industrial water withdrawals are closely relevant to the growth of population and gdp respectively the shared socio economic pathways ssps provide a way to quantitatively describe future sectoral water withdrawals under different socio economic development conditions where ssp1 5 represent the sustainable business as usual global regional competing unequal and fossil fueled development scenario respectively beusen et al 2022 kriegler et al 2012 the population and gdp projections in china under different ssp scenarios in 2010 2099 were obtained from science data bank https cstr cn 31253 11 sciencedb 01683 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 which had already been bias corrected huang et al 2019 jing et al 2022 to quantitatively assess future water security five representative ssp rcp combined scenarios namely ssp1 rcp2 6 ssp2 rcp2 6 ssp3 rcp8 5 ssp4 rcp2 6 and ssp5 rcp8 5 were selected elkouk et al 2022 hanasaki et al 2013a the settings are on the basis of a clear interpretation of the mitigation challenge of ssps since ssp1 ssp2 and ssp4 are easier to alleviate the rcp2 6 was selected by contrast ssp3 and ssp5 are considered more challenging the rcp8 5 was selected four water diversion scenarios s0 s3 were designed for the ylrb in the snwd w project and the amount of water diversion is 0 m3 4 billion m3 7 billion m3 and maximum respectively table 2 zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2008 under the maximum scenario with only ecological flow left the ecological flow was set as 10 and 30 of the mean monthly flow in wet and dry seasons respectively tennant 1976 yu et al 2021 the observed runoff data in xiaodeshi hydrological station during the historic period 1981 2000 was obtained from the hydrological yearbook of the yangtze river basin the historical actual irrigation industrial and domestic water withdrawals in 2010 were gained from the water resources bulletin of the yangtze river basin and were used to correct the corresponding water withdrawals in the future period 2 3 methods to quantify the future water and energy security of ylrb five ssp rcp scenarios and eight rcp water diversion scenarios have been set respectively the evaluation framework is presented in fig 2 to verify the applicability of the watergap 2 2c hydrological model in the ylrb the runoff in the historic period 1981 2000 was simulated with the input of historic watch meteorological data based on the future bias corrected gcm meteorological data the future runoff and agricultural water withdrawal were estimated using watergap and h08 hydrological models respectively with the addition of downscaled population and gdp total water withdrawals could be calculated then the water stress index wsi chen et al 2021 satoh et al 2017 was used to assess future water security finally based on the future runoff and hydropower optimization model the hydropower generation of six cascade reservoirs was calculated to evaluate future energy security 2 3 1 water supply calculation the history and future runoff were simulated by watergap a distributed global hydrological model wghm taking the net abstractions into account it estimates variations in water storage cells and water flows between the cells by water balance equations containing river runoff evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge müller schmied et al 2016 this model consists of six primary modules namely canopy snow soil groundwater surface water bodies and lateral routing müller schmied et al 2014 previous researchers have verified that wghm performs well in quantifying global or regional scale water resources and water stress with the nash sutcliffe efficiency higher than 0 7 in the ylrb indicating that this model is well adapted in this region hu et al 2021 müller schmied et al 2021 wan et al 2021 given that the ylrb lies in the tibetan plateau an ecologically vulnerable region on earth wang et al 2022b the ecological flow here couldn t be ignored the ecological flow was considered as 30 of the mean annual and monthly flow on the annual and monthly scale respectively tennant 1976 yu et al 2021 the available water supply was calculated by eq 1 1 w a v a w r e n w e c o w i b t where w ren denotes renewable water resources namely total amount of annual runoff w ava w eco and w iibt are available water supply ecological flow requirements and inter basin water transfer respectively 2 3 2 water withdrawal and water stress index calculation the water withdrawals of three primary water consuming sectors i e agriculture industry and domestic were estimated owing to its outstanding ability to capture irrigation water withdrawal and its widespread application in global or regional water security assessment satoh et al 2017 hanasaki et al 2018 the global hydrological model h08 was adopted to calculate agricultural water withdrawal which was determined by the soil moisture deficit to force this model five variables are required the effective precipitation p eff the crop specific potential evaporation e pot the crop intensity i irg the irrigation efficiency e irg and the irrigated area a irg among these variables p eff and e pot are estimated using hydrological models under different climate scenarios more information about h08 was characterized by hanasaki et al 2013b and hanasaki et al 2018 supporting materials method s1 the instructions and code of h08 are accessible at http h08 nies go jp the projected 0 5 gridded gdp and population were aggregated to the scale of the whole basin the future industrial and domestic water withdrawals were calculated using eqs 2 3 and eqs 4 5 respectively as follows hanasaki et al 2013b wada et al 2016 yin et al 2020 2 i i n d t i i n d t 0 1 s i n d c a t t t 0 3 w i n d t g d p i n d t i i n d t where i ind t0 and i ind t are the intensity of the industrial water withdrawal in the base year t 0 2010 in this study and the year t respectively s ind cat is the change of the industrial water withdrawal intensity depending on the ssp technology scenario eq 2 the s ind cat was set to 1 1 0 6 0 3 0 6 and 1 1 under ssp1 5 respectively wada et al 2016 supporting materials method s2 in eq 3 w ind t and gdp ind t denote water withdrawal in the industry sector and the value added of the industry sector in the year t

supporting materials method s2 in eq 5 w dom t and pop t represent domestic water withdrawal and population in the year t respectively the historical actual irrigation industrial and domestic water withdrawals in 2010 were regarded as the benchmark to linearly correct the corresponding predicted water withdrawals the total water withdrawals w wit tot was estimated as the summation of agricultural industrial and domestic water withdrawals eq 6 6 w w i t t o t w a g r w i n d w d o m to quantitatively evaluate water scarcity within a watershed the wsi was adopted it was introduced by falkenmark and lindh 1974 for the first time and improved by considering the ecological flow in recent years damkjaer and taylor 2017 smakhtin et al 2004 xie et al 2022 the wsi was calculated by eq 7 7 w s i w w i t t o t w a v a the higher wsi value denotes a more severe water stress status regions are considered water secure when the wsi is lower than 0 2 mildly water scarce when the wsi is between 0 2 and 0 4 and severely water scarce when the wsi is higher than 0 4 raskin et al 1997 satoh et al 2017 2 3 3 hydropower optimization model considering that the ylrb is china s third largest hydropower base following previous studies zhao et al 2021a zhong et al 2020 the optimal operation model is constructed with the objective function of maximizing the annual hydropower generation of the six cascade hydropower reservoirs in the ylrb the future runoff projected by wghm under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 combined with four water diversion scenarios s0 s3 was adopted as the model inputs in the routing module of the wghm the inflow of the downstream reservoir initially the natural runoff at the reservoir was substituted for the outflow of the upstream reservoir after confluence to optimize hydropower output particle swarm optimization pso was employed as a classical method in high dimensional optimization pso is extensively applied to the optimization of reservoir operation due to its simple structure rapid seeking speed and easy implementation bai et al 2019 jin et al 2021 koutsoyiannis and economou 2003 2 3 3 1 the optimization objective function the objective function is maximizing the annual hydropower generation which has been widely adopted in the optimal operation model shown as follows 8 max e m 1 s k 1 t n m k δ t n m k a m h m k q m k n where e denotes the total annual hydropower generation s and t represent the number of cascade reservoirs and periods respectively n m k represents the hydropower output of the reservoir m at the time k δt denotes the duration of an operation stage a m represents the hydropower production efficiency of the reservoir m h m k and q m k n are the available net head and the discharge for hydropower generation of the reservoir m at the time k respectively 2 3 3 2 constraint conditions the constraint conditions of water level discharge hydropower generation output and water balance are shown as follows 1 water level constraint 9 z m min z m k z m max where z m k represents the water level of the reservoir m at the time k z m min and z m max are the dead water level and the maximum water level of the reservoir m respectively 2 reservoir discharge constraint 10 q m min q m k q m max where q m k represents the discharge for hydropower generation of the reservoir m at the time k q m min and q m max denote the minimum and maximum discharges of the reservoir m respectively 3 hydropower generation output constraint 11 n m min n m k n m max where n m k represents the hydropower output of the reservoir m at the time k n m min and n m max denote the minimum and maximum hydropower output of the reservoir m respectively 4 water balance constraint 12 v m k 1 v m k i m k q m k w m k δ t where v m k and v m k 1 denote the storage of the reservoir m at the start time k and the end time k 1 respectively i m k and w m k represent the inflow discharge and transferred discharge by inner basin water diversion of the reservoir m at the time k respectively since the water diversion is only at the first cascade reservoir lianghekou the m in w m k is taken as 1 3 results 3 1 projection of future runoff to assess the applicability of the watergap global hydrological model in ylrb natural runoff during the historic period 1981 2000 was simulated as shown in fig 3 the model can accurately reflect the variations in monthly runoff at xiaodeshi station with the values of nse and r 2 higher than 0 9 indicating that it can be further applied to project future runoff under climate change scenarios the natural annual runoff during the future period 2021 2099 is presented in fig 4 it is notable that under rcp2 6 the average annual runoff of four gcms displays a significant decreasing trend with a rate of 1 44 m3 s per year p 0 01 in comparison with the baseline period 2006 2020 the runoff in ylrb is projected to change by 4 0 6 2 0 8 and 1 0 during the 2030 s 2050 s 2070 s and 2090 s respectively table s4 in contrast the average annual runoff displays a significant increasing trend under rcp8 5 with a rate of 1 96 m3 s per year p 0 01 in comparison with the baseline period the runoff in ylrb is estimated to change by 2 2 3 4 6 3 and 9 2 during the 2030 s 2050 s 2070 s and 2090 s respectively table s4 3 2 projections of future water withdrawals and water stress five classical ssp rcp scenarios have been designed to project future water withdrawals the water withdrawals of three primary water consuming sectors during 2021 2099 were presented in fig 5 the total water withdrawal displays significant increasing trends p 0 01 before the 2050 s under all scenarios and decreasing trends p 0 01 after 2050 s under ssp1 rcp2 6 ssp4 rcp2 6 and ssp5 rcp8 5 the mean annual total water withdrawal for ylrb during the baseline period is 1 67 billion m3 with 1 14 billion m3 for the agriculture sector accounting for 68 2 of the total water withdrawal 0 37 billion m3 the for the industry sector 22 2 and 0 16 billion m3 the for the domestic sector 9 6 unlike the baseline period the summation of industrial and domestic water withdrawals in future periods reaches quite close to the agricultural water withdrawal implying that irrigation may no longer be the dominant factor for the total water withdrawals and much attention ought to be attracted of the reasonable management of industrial and domestic water withdrawals in the future the variation rates of water withdrawals in three main water consumptive sectors are shown in table s6 for the agriculture sector the annual water withdrawal increases significantly at a rate of 0 86 10 3 billion m3 year p 0 05 during 2021 2099 under rcp8 5 and increases significantly at a rate of 2 16 10 3 billion m3 year p 0 01 during 2061 2099 under rcp2 6 for the industry sector the annual water withdrawal shows a significant increasing trend p 0 01 during 2021 2060 under all ssps with a rate of 6 82 10 3 billion m3 year 5 68 10 3 billion m3 year 5 53 10 3 billion m3 year 3 65 10 3 billion m3 year and 10 31 10 3 billion m3 year for ssp1 ssp5 respectively during 2061 2099 the annual industrial water withdrawal shows a significant decreasing trend p 0 01 under all ssps except for ssp3 with a rate of 8 45 10 3 billion m3 year 2 58 10 3 billion m3 year 10 68 10 3 billion m3 year and 3 15 10 3 billion m3 year under ssp1 ssp2 ssp4 and ssp5 respectively for the domestic sector the annual water withdrawal shows a significant decreasing trend p 0 01 during 2021 2099 under all ssps except for ssp3 with a rate of 1 47 10 3 billion m3 year 1 09 10 3 billion m3 year 1 01 10 3 billion m3 year and 1 83 10 3 billion m3 year under ssp1 ssp2 ssp4 and ssp5 respectively and a significant increasing trend p 0 01 during 2021 2099 with a rate of 1 22 10 3 billion m3 year under ssp3 future wsi values under five rcp ssp scenarios during 2021 2099 are illustrated in fig 6a the ensemble mean value of wsi displays a significant increasing trend during the 2030 s 5 51 10 4 year p 0 01 a significant decreasing trend during 2050 s 4 43 10 4 year p 0 01 and insignificant decreasing trends during 2070 s and 2090 s in comparison with the baseline period 2006 2020 the variation ratios of wsi in the future four periods are 26 4 31 2 27 5 and 22 5 respectively indicating that the wsi is projected to change more greatly during the 2050 s and 2070 s than other periods table 3 it has been illustrated that the runoff displays a significant increasing trend under rcp8 5 which may mitigate the future water stress to some degree however among all five rcp ssp scenarios ssp3 rcp8 5 and ssp5 rcp8 5 present higher change ratios during the whole future period suggesting that water withdrawals especially in the industry sector dominate the changes of wsi thus close attention is supposed to be paid to the effects of societal changes on water scarcity nevertheless the values of wsi among all the scenarios are lower than 0 1 meaning that despite the large increase in wsi the water stress in ylrb is still quite low in the future and abundant available water can fully meet local water withdrawals in addition given that the snwd w project will be applied in ylrb the ensemble mean value of wsi under five rcp ssps under different water diversion scenarios has been calculated fig 6b the results show that the water diversion projects will aggravate the water stress of ylrb but the wsi is still lower than 0 2 which means relatively low water stress satoh et al 2017 3 3 projection of future hydropower generation based on the projection of future runoff the annual hydropower generation of the six cascade reservoirs along the ylrb under various rcp water diversion scenarios has been further projected fig 7 during the baseline period 2006 2020 the average annual hydropower generation was 92 1 billion kw h for the baseline scenario s0 without water diversion the projected average hydropower generation during the whole future period shows a significant decreasing trend 0 072 billion kw h year p 0 05 under rcp2 6 and a significant increasing trend 0 089 billion kw h year p 0 01 under rcp8 5 which shows the same variation trend as the future runoff specifically for rcp2 6 the average hydropower generation is predicted to change by 34 63 billion to 3 07 billion kw h 37 62 to 3 33 34 11 billion to 4 37 billion kw h 37 06 to 4 75 36 62 billion to 1 01 billion kw h 39 79 to 1 10 and 38 22 billion to 0 80 billion kw h 41 53 to 0 87 versus the baseline period during the 2030 s 2050 s 2070 s and 2090 s respectively figs 7a and 8 for rcp8 5 the average hydropower generation is predicted to change by 38 51 billion kw h to 0 40 billion kw h 41 80 to 0 44 38 47 billion to 2 25 billion kw h 41 77 to 2 44 36 71 billion to 3 44 billion kw h 39 85 to 3 74 and 35 88 billion to 5 62 billion kw h 38 95 to 6 10 during the 2030 s 2050 s 2070 s and 2090 s respectively figs 7b and 8 as illustrated in fig 8 relative to the baseline period climate change results in a slight increase in future hydropower generation while inter basin water diversion leads to an obvious decrease in future hydropower generation in addition under different water diversion scenarios the future hydropower generation displays the same variation trend i e a decreasing trend in rcp2 6 and an increasing trend in rcp8 5 due to the relatively independent effect between climate change and water diversion on future hydropower generation the future hydropower generation without the water diversion project s0 is more than that during the baseline period except for the 2090 s under rcp2 6 however with the inner basin water diversion taken into consideration s1 s3 the future hydropower generation turns to be less than that during the baseline period indicating that compared with climate change the water diversion has a greater impact on hydropower generation in future periods and the positive impact of climate change can t offset the negative effect of water diversion interestingly under the high carbon emission scenario combined with the 4 billion m3 water diversion scenario rcp8 5 s1 the hydropower generation is projected to change by 1 75 billion kw h 1 89 during the 2090 s which means the impacts of climate change and water diversion can achieve a relative balance additionally fig 9 illustrates the impact of the snwd w on the hydropower generation of six reservoirs in the ylrb the hydropower generation of lianghekou displays the greatest reduction because it is the only water diverting reservoir for the snwd w in the ylrb and the other reservoirs could combine reservoir regulation with the inflow between the upper and lower reservoirs to weaken the effect of water diversion the hydropower generation of lianghekou is projected to decrease by about 15 and 28 under water diversion s1 and s2 respectively yet under the water diversion s3 with only ecological flow left in the lianghekou reservoir the hydropower generation will decrease by nearly 70 here and by about 35 in the other reservoirs posing a serious challenge to the energy security of the ylrb 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with previous studies to verify the rationality of the future projections we further compared our results with previous research the future runoff of the ylrb displays decreasing and increasing trends under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 respectively which is consistent with cao et al 2021 and zhao et al 2021a due to the close relationship between runoff and hydropower they show the same variation trend in the future period zhong et al 2020 zhao et al 2021a and qin et al 2022 projected the future hydropower of cascade reservoirs in ylrb under rcp8 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively liu et al 2020 estimated the future hydropower of the cascade reservoirs along the whole jinsha river containing the ylr in rcp8 5 their results indicate that the future hydropower will increase by 6 8 2 6 15 2 and 3 78 11 02 which is similar to our findings in ylrb under rcp8 5 without water diversion s0 the water withdrawals in three main water consumptive sectors during the baseline period are compatible with zhao et al 2021b and huang et al 2018 with agricultural water withdrawal occupying the largest proportion furthermore the ylrb will keep relatively low water stress in the coming decades which is congruent with the results of chen et al 2021 therefore our results are reliable and can supply beneficial suggestions on regional water resources administration for ylrb in addition most previous studies either concentrated on the effects of future climate change on runoff and hydropower generation li et al 2020 paltán et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 or only considered the impact of inter basin water diversion on hydropower generation during the historical period linh and chou 2020 yin et al 2022a while we chose the ylrb as a typical study area simultaneously considering the impact of both future climate change and inter basin water diversion on hydropower generation of the cascade reservoirs furthermore in terms of water diversion previous research mainly concentrated on the mitigation of water stress in the water receiving area neglecting the negative effects on the water diverting area long et al 2020 yang et al 2022 yin et al 2020 while in our study we systematically evaluated the impacts of the snwd w on water and energy security of the water diverting area regarding the assessment of water stress most previous studies took total renewable water resources as the available water supply daneshi et al 2021 pfister et al 2009 yin et al 2020 however considering the ecological vulnerability of the ylrb the available water supply was calculated as total renewable water resources minus ecological flow requirements which means the ecological water demand must be guaranteed first smakhtin et al 2004 besides most previous studies assessed the future water security at a national or global scale which focused more on the spatial variation pattern of water stress chen et al 2021 hanasaki et al 2013a zhai et al 2022 while the analysis for the temporal variation of water stress and its dominant factor in the specific basin was weak by contrast we corrected the simulated water withdrawals in each sector by the corresponding actual water withdrawals and then systematically analyzed the future water withdrawals and water stress of the ylrb associated with the regional reality to summarize taking the ylrb as the typical basin this study is combined with the snwd w and explores the impacts of climatic and societal changes i e social economic development and inter basin water diversion on water and energy security from a perspective of the water diverting area for the first time 4 2 impacts of water diversion on water and energy security in ylrb as the receiving area of the snwd the yellow river basin yerb is a dreadfully water scarce but densely populated region with annual available water resources per capita of 473 m3 mwrc 2022 which is far below the recommended global baseline 1700 m3 the issue of water scarcity in the yerb will be more serious with the rapid expansion of agriculture and urbanization in the coming decades and the wsi is expected to stay higher than 0 8 under the current water diversion plan chen et al 2021 yin et al 2020 according to the overall snwd w planning with the 8 and 17 billion m3 total water diversion per year the original annual water diversion scheme of 4 billion s1 and 7 billion s2 for the ylrb was designed zhang et al 2021b however due to the increased water scarcity issues of the yerb the maximum amount of water diversion scenario s3 was established with only ecological flow left despite the large increase in wsi versus the baseline period table 3 it is still lower than 0 2 in the future even combined with different water diversion scenarios fig 6b suggesting that the increase in the water stress for the water diverting area of the snwd w is acceptable and the water supply will fully suffice the requirements of the water withdrawals nevertheless a shift in hydroclimate extremes under a warming climate has altered the hydrological cycle around the globe and droughts are estimated to be more frequent and severe in the future wu et al 2022 yin et al 2022b that means extreme drought events such as the once in a century drought that occurred in 2022 across the whole yangtze river basin might happen more frequently in the future posing a potential challenge to future water security in the ylrb liang et al 2023 in addition it should be noted that future hydropower generation decreased substantially with different water diversions the loss in the hydropower generation for the ylrb reaches approximately 10 20 and 40 under water diversion s1 s2 and s3 respectively fig 8 besides under the water diversion s3 with only ecological flow left in the lianghekou reservoir the hydropower generation will decrease by nearly 70 here and by about 35 in the other reservoirs fig 9 which severely threatens the energy security in the ylrb the snwd project is a significant infrastructure aimed at optimizing china s water resources allocation it is of great importance to lessen the extreme water scarcity in northern china ensure the security of water supply and promote sustainable socio economic development prc 2016 it is reported that until the end of 2022 the total amount of transferred water in the constructed snwd m middle route and snwd e east route had reached 57 6 billion m3 benefiting more than 280 counties along the seven provinces with the directly benefiting people of 150 million niu 2022 however the source area of snwd w includes the ylrb which is not only china s third largest hydropower base but also a significant energy base for china s west east power transmission project zhu et al 2020 according to the information from the yalong river hydropower company the hydropower of the ylrb was transmitted to chongqing sichuan and jiangsu with the proportion of approximately 20 35 and 45 respectively zhao et al 2022 therefore the effect of the snwd w on energy security of the ylrb needs to be highly concerned besides except for the snwd other major water diversion projects like the dadu river to min river project han river to wei river project and yangtze river to han river project are under planning or construction yang et al 2023 ma et al 2021 wu et al 2020 the effects of water diversion projects on water diverting areas ought to be cautiously assessed in summary our findings suggest the necessity for decision makers to balance the mitigation of water stress in the water receiving area against the loss of hydropower generation in the water diverting area 4 3 uncertainties and limitations the main uncertainty in our projections of future water and energy security comes from the climate and hydrological models all four global climate models in isimip2b were selected to predict future runoff in the ylrb the future runoff shows a considerable variation range due to the differences between climate models fig 4 multi model ensemble mean was adopted to diminish the uncertainty induced by various climate models giuntoli et al 2021 wolski et al 2012 additionally similar to other research in the projections of future runoff and hydropower zhong et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 merely one hydrological model was adopted to estimate future runoff in our study which results in the potential uncertainty in the model structure troin et al 2022 yet according to the recent studies the uncertainty in hydrological models is lower than that in climate models dams et al 2015 wang et al 2020 besides our findings in the variation trends of runoff are consistent with previous studies which used other hydrological models swat and vic cao et al 2021 zhao et al 2021a therefore despite the uncertainty to some extent our results can be regarded as a reliable projection for runoff and hydropower moreover the future agricultural water withdrawal is highly correlated with future climate and the uncertainty in climate models will inevitably spread to the estimation of the irrigation water withdrawal additionally in terms of future societal changes we only focused on social economic development and inter basin water diversion while the future variations in land use and cover which might affect water and energy security indirectly daneshi et al 2021 were not considered in our study meanwhile given that the population is concentrated in the lower region of the ylrb and the total water consumption is relatively low the effects of water consumption changes on the hydropower generation of the entire basin were ignored also in the assessment the water security we took the ylrb as a whole without specifically considering the connection of water resources between upper and lower reaches duan et al 2019 smolenaars et al 2022 due to the similar change directions of precipitation and temperature between cmip5 and cmip6 hamed et al 2022 su et al 2022 our results are not expected to differ substantially when evaluated using cmip6 outputs 5 conclusions taking the ylrb as the case region this study systematically evaluates the impacts of future climatic and societal changes on water and energy security in the water diverting area of the snwd w for the first time the future runoff and hydropower generation were estimated using watergap hydrological model under different rcp scenarios and water withdrawals were predicted based on the ssp scenarios the future runoff in the ylrb displays significant increasing and decreasing trends p 0 01 under rcp8 5 1 96 m3 s per year and rcp2 6 1 44 m3 s per year respectively the total water withdrawals show significant increasing trends p 0 01 before the 2050 s under all rcp ssp scenarios and decreasing trends p 0 01 after the 2050 s under most scenarios relative to the baseline period the wsi in the 2030 s 2050 s 2070 s and 2090 s is projected to increase by 26 4 31 2 27 5 and 22 5 respectively which is dominated by water withdrawals especially in the industry sector nevertheless the values of wsi among all the scenarios are lower than 0 2 even combined with the snwd w project suggesting that abundant available water resources will fully suffice water withdrawals the future hydropower generation displays the same variation trend as the future runoff during the four future periods the hydropower generation is projected to change by 0 87 6 10 without water diversion and by 41 80 to 1 89 under different water diversion scenarios the slight increment caused by climate change cannot offset the substantial decrement caused by water diversion especially in the maximum transfer amount scenario s3 which emphasizes the tradeoffs between the mitigation of water stress in the water receiving area and the loss of hydropower generation in the water diverting area yet there exist several limitations in this study such as the lack of consideration for future variations in land use cover and water consumption which need further research besides given that the cmip6 dataset has been developed and progressively applied in recent years further work may explore the effects of climate change and snwd w projects on water and energy security in the whole jinsha river basin combined with the new cmip6 scenarios moreover the seasonal variation of hydropower generation can be further discussed with the combination of reservoir scheduling and water diversion rules taken together our findings are expected to serve as a beneficial reference for water resources administration in the ylrb and the design of the water diversion scheme for the snwd w project as well as the other inter basin water diversion projects around the world credit authorship contribution statement hanxu liang

7704,study region yalong river basin ylrb china study focus the ylrb was selected to investigate the impacts of climatic and societal changes on water and energy security in the water diverting area of china s south to north water diversion project snwd w the future runoff and hydropower generation were projected using watergap hydrological model wghm under different representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios and water withdrawals were predicted based on the shared socio economic pathways ssps new hydrological insights for the region the results show that the future runoff and hydropower generation in the ylrb display significant increasing and decreasing trends under rcp8 5 and rcp2 6 respectively the water stress index wsi is projected to increase by about 30 but it is still lower than 0 2 even combined with the snwd w project the future hydropower generation is projected to change by 0 87 4 75 and 0 44 6 10 under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 without water diversion respectively the slight increment caused by climate change cannot offset the substantial decrement caused by water diversion especially in the maximum transfer amount scenario which highlights the tradeoffs between the mitigation of water stress in the water receiving area and the loss of hydropower generation in the water diverting area our results provide a valuable reference for the water

diversion project water security hydropower generation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2021 stated in its sixth assessment report that human activities have warmed the climate at an unprecedented speed in the past few years the rapid global warming with increasing climate variability and frequency of drought events is predicted to impact the available water resources significantly aghakouchak et al 2020 peterson et al 2013 wang et al 2022a in some sensitive areas like qinghai tibet plateau warming rates are twice the global average yao et al 2019 and precipitation regimes have been altered the changes in spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation and the increase in evapotranspiration have led to the melting of glaciers variations in the distribution and area of plateau lakes zhang et al 2017 and shifts in river runoff wang et al 2021 which will further impact the reservoir operation and hydropower generation wasti et al 2022 yalew et al 2020 in other words the climate change induced variations in water resources will inevitably affect the interdependence of water and energy generally named the water energy nexus stucki and sojamo 2012 van vliet et al 2016 and pose serious threats to water and energy security cáceres et al 2022 hu et al 2020 meanwhile along with the fast expansion of the population and economy human induced societal changes play an increasingly significant role in the global water cycle abbott et al 2019 konar et al 2019 the issue of water security which means an acceptable level of water related risks to human beings and ecosystems combined with an adequate quantity of clean water to support human livelihoods ecological health and national security bakker 2012 cook and bakker 2012 has aroused extensive attention worldwide it has been estimated that almost 80 of the population around the globe is faced with a serious challenge to water security he et al 2021 as an important indicator of water security the stress index on water resources continues to rise in pace with the growth of population and gdp due to the increment of food and energy needs the advancement of living conditions and the difficulty in the administration of regional water resources over the last century global water withdrawals by humans have grown sixfold which is more than twice the population increment rate shiklomanov 2000 wada et al 2013 in china the total amount of freshwater resources ranks sixth globally while per capita freshwater resources only account for a quarter of the global average level sun et al 2017 driven by agriculture manufacturing and industries during the last few decades china has experienced nearly double digit gdp growth satoh et al 2017 resulting in water withdrawals in many river tributaries for instance the hai river yellow river yer and huai river exceeding available renewable freshwater resources yin et al 2020 the yellow river basin yerb is one of the most highly populated and water scarce areas in china specifically with merely 2 of china s total water resources the yerb feeds nearly 10 of the population and contributes approximately 13 of the gdp guo et al 2022 yin et al 2017 the imbalance between water withdrawals and surface water supply in the yerb inevitably leads to the overdraft of groundwater and further results in the issues of land subsidence drying up of wetlands and desertification yang et al 2022 according to recent studies chen et al 2021 satoh et al 2017 wada et al 2016 with the increment of population and development of social economic water withdrawals in china are predicted to increase rapidly over the next few decades which will exacerbate the challenges to water security to relieve the severe water scarcity in the upper and middle regions of the yerb the western route of the south to north water diversion project snwd w has been presented and is under the planning and design phases now mwrc 2022 according to the recent planning water will be diverted from the tongtian river dadu river and yalong river into the source area of the yer flowing to the six northwestern provinces containing qinghai gansu ningxia inner mongolia shanxi and shaanxi prc 2016 the water intakes of the above three water diversion schemes belong to different basins and the relevance between these schemes is weak besides the amount of water diversion varies with different schemes which will be implemented by stages in the future huang et al 2015 investigated the streamflow characteristics and trends in both water diverting and water receiving areas over the past 50 years ning et al 2022 explored the effects of future climate change on water resources in water diverting areas yin et al 2020 quantified the water stress in water receiving areas under future climatic and societal changes with the snwd w project given that the snwd w project is in the planning stages and the water diversion will inevitably harm the water supply and further impact hydropower generation in the water diverting area it is thus necessary to quantify the degree of the impact and assess whether it can be accepted in this study the scheme in which the water is only diverted from the yalong river was considered for the snwd w project to explore its impacts on water and energy security in the yalong river basin fig 1 the yalong river basin ylrb situated on the southeastern edge of the qinghai tibet plateau is the source water diverting area of the snwd w project as well as china s third largest hydropower base with a theoretical hydropower reserve of 38 4 million kw the upper region of the ylrb belongs to the plateau subtropical semi humid climate zone with a sparse population and little human interference while the middle and lower streams of the ylrb belong to the humid climate zone with denser population prosperous industry developed agriculture and abundant hydro energy resources it has been reported that due to the comprehensive effects of climate change and aggravating human activities over the last few decades the ylrb has experienced a significant decline in annual runoff and severe drought events occurred more frequently which seriously threatens regional water and energy security zhang et al 2021a shi et al 2022 so far limited research has mainly concentrated on the effects of future climate change on runoff and hydropower generation in the ylrb cao et al 2021 zhao et al 2021a zhao et al 2022 and a few studies have investigated the spatiotemporal variation pattern of future water withdrawals and water stress at a national or global scale chen et al 2021 hanasaki et al 2013a zhai et al 2022 while combined with the regional reality the analysis for the temporal variation of water stress and its dominant factor in the study area was weak to the best of our knowledge there exists no literature that investigated the effects of the snwd w project on future water stress and hydropower generation in this water diverting area therefore taking the ylrb as the typical study region this study firstly explores the comprehensive impacts of future climatic and societal changes i e social economic development and snwd w on water and energy security from the perspective of the water diverting area specifically the objectives of the study were to a quantify future water supply water withdrawals and water stress index b quantify future hydropower generation c evaluate the impacts of the snwd w project on the water and energy security in the ylrb the results will provide a valuable reference for the water resources administration in the ylrb and the planning of the snwd w project 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area originating from the southern foothills of the bayankara mountains the yalong river ylr is the major tributary of the jinsha river zhang et al 2021a the drainage area and natural drop are 1 36 105 km2 and 3830 m respectively fig 1 the upper stream of the ylr belongs to the plateau subtropical semi humid climate zone with sparse population and little human interference while the middle and lower streams of the ylr belong to the humid climate zone with denser population prosperous industry developed agriculture and abundant hydro energy resources the dry and rainy seasons of the ylrb are distinct and the annual average precipitation and runoff depth are 600 800 mm and 300 400 mm respectively huang et al 2020 the runoff of ylrb is primarily contributed by direct precipitation while the remainder is supplemented by melting snow and groundwater according to the reservoir construction scheme for the ylrb twenty two cascade hydropower stations have been planned among which jinping i and ertan were built before 2006 and jinping ii guandi tongzilin and lianghekou have been built in sequence since 2006 table 1 based on the recent scheme the lianghekou reservoir was set as the only water diverting reservoir in the ylrb considering that the snwd w project is still in the planning stage thus 2006 2020 was chosen as the baseline period without water diversion and 2021 2099 was selected as the future period with different water diversion scenarios 2 2 data the simulated runoff data and agricultural water withdrawal during 1981 2099 were obtained from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip https data isimip org search with 0 5 spatial resolution the second stage of isimip contains two parts where isimip 2a and 2b concentrate on model validation during 1971 2010 and global warming impact projections during 1850 2099 respectively the global gridded hydrological model gghm watergap 2 2c müller schmied et al 2016 and h08 hanasaki et al 2008 were chosen to simulate water supply and agricultural water withdrawal respectively the gghms were forced with watch wfd meteorological variables i e humidity temperature precipitation wind pressure and radiation in the historic period best et al 2011 and with the statistical bias corrected meteorological variables from the outputs of global climate models gcms in the future period haerter et al 2011 piani et al 2010 in this study all four types of gcms in isimip2b namely gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr and miroc5 were chosen and two typical representative concentration pathways scenarios namely rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 which denote the lowest and highest radiative forcing scenarios in the future and have been extensively adopted in climate change research were selected on behalf of future climate conditions in the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 the future domestic and industrial water withdrawals are closely relevant to the growth of population and gdp respectively the shared socio economic pathways ssps provide a way to quantitatively describe future sectoral water withdrawals under different socio economic development conditions where ssp1 5 represent the sustainable business as usual global regional competing unequal and fossil fueled development scenario respectively beusen et al 2022 kriegler et al 2012 the population and gdp projections in china under different ssp scenarios in 2010 2099 were obtained from science data bank https cstr cn 31253 11 sciencedb 01683 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 which had already been bias corrected huang et al 2019 jing et al 2022 to quantitatively assess future water security five representative ssp rcp combined scenarios namely ssp1 rcp2 6 ssp2 rcp2 6 ssp3 rcp8 5 ssp4 rcp2 6 and ssp5 rcp8 5 were selected elkouk et al 2022 hanasaki et al 2013a the settings are on the basis of a clear interpretation of the mitigation challenge of ssps since ssp1 ssp2 and ssp4 are easier to alleviate the rcp2 6 was selected by contrast ssp3 and ssp5 are considered more challenging the rcp8 5 was selected four water diversion scenarios s0 s3 were designed for the ylrb in the snwd w project and the amount of water diversion is 0 m3 4 billion m3 7 billion m3 and maximum respectively table 2 zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2008 under the maximum scenario with only ecological flow left the ecological flow was set as 10 and 30 of the mean monthly flow in wet and dry seasons respectively tennant 1976 yu et al 2021 the observed runoff data in xiaodeshi hydrological station during the historic period 1981 2000 was obtained from the hydrological yearbook of the yangtze river basin the historical actual irrigation industrial and domestic water withdrawals in 2010 were gained from the water resources bulletin of the yangtze river basin and were used to correct the corresponding water withdrawals in the future period 2 3 methods to quantify the future water and energy security of ylrb five ssp rcp scenarios and eight rcp water diversion scenarios have been set respectively the evaluation framework is presented in fig 2 to verify the applicability of the watergap 2 2c hydrological model in the ylrb the runoff in the historic period 1981 2000 was simulated with the input of historic watch meteorological data based on the future bias corrected gcm meteorological data the future runoff and agricultural water withdrawal were estimated using watergap and h08 hydrological models respectively with the addition of downscaled population and gdp total water withdrawals could be calculated then the water stress index wsi chen et al 2021 satoh et al 2017 was used to assess future water security finally based on the future runoff and hydropower optimization model the hydropower generation of six cascade reservoirs was calculated to evaluate future energy security 2 3 1 water supply calculation the history and future runoff were simulated by watergap a distributed global hydrological model wghm taking the net abstractions into account it estimates variations in water storage cells and water flows between the cells by water balance equations containing river runoff evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge müller schmied et al 2016 this model consists of six primary modules namely canopy snow soil groundwater surface water bodies and lateral routing müller schmied et al 2014 previous researchers have verified that wghm performs well in quantifying global or regional scale water resources and water stress with the nash sutcliffe efficiency higher than 0 7 in the ylrb indicating that this model is well adapted in this region hu et al 2021 müller schmied et al 2021 wan et al 2021 given that the ylrb lies in the tibetan plateau an ecologically vulnerable region on earth wang et al 2022b the ecological flow here couldn t be ignored the ecological flow was considered as 30 of the mean annual and monthly flow on the annual and monthly scale respectively tennant 1976 yu et al 2021 the available water supply was calculated by eq 1 1 w a v a w r e n w e c o w i b t where w ren denotes renewable water resources namely total amount of annual runoff w ava w eco and w iibt are available water supply ecological flow requirements and inter basin water transfer respectively 2 3 2 water withdrawal and water stress index calculation the water withdrawals of three primary water consuming sectors i e agriculture industry and domestic were estimated owing to its outstanding ability to capture irrigation water withdrawal and its widespread application in global or regional water security assessment satoh et al 2017 hanasaki et al 2018 the global hydrological model h08 was adopted to calculate agricultural water withdrawal which was determined by the soil moisture deficit to force this model five variables are required the effective precipitation p eff the crop specific potential evaporation e pot the crop intensity i irg the irrigation efficiency e irg and the irrigated area a irg among these variables p eff and e pot are estimated using hydrological models under different climate scenarios more information about h08 was characterized by hanasaki et al 2013b and hanasaki et al 2018 supporting materials method s1 the instructions and code of h08 are accessible at http h08 nies go jp the projected 0 5 gridded gdp and population were aggregated to the scale of the whole basin the future industrial and domestic water withdrawals were calculated using eqs 2 3 and eqs 4 5 respectively as follows hanasaki et al 2013b wada et al 2016 yin et al 2020 2 i i n d t i i n d t 0 1 s i n d c a t t t 0 3 w i n d t g d p i n d t i i n d t where i ind t0 and i ind t are the intensity of the industrial water withdrawal in the base year t 0 2010 in this study and the year t respectively s ind cat is the change of the industrial water withdrawal intensity depending on the ssp technology scenario eq 2 the s ind cat was set to 1 1 0 6 0 3 0 6 and 1 1 under ssp1 5 respectively wada et al 2016 supporting materials method s2 in eq 3 w ind t and gdp ind t denote water withdrawal in the industry sector and the value added of the industry sector in the year t respectively 4 i d o m t i d o m t 0 s d o m c a t t t 0 5 w d o m t p o p t i d o m t where i dom t and i dom t0 are the intensity of the domestic water withdrawal in the base year t 0 2010 in this

supporting materials method s2 in eq 5 w dom t and pop t represent domestic water withdrawal and population in the year t respectively the historical actual irrigation industrial and domestic water withdrawals in 2010 were regarded as the benchmark to linearly correct the corresponding predicted water withdrawals the total water withdrawals w wit tot was estimated as the summation of agricultural industrial and domestic water withdrawals eq 6 6 w w i t t o t w a g r w i n d w d o m to quantitatively evaluate water scarcity within a watershed the wsi was adopted it was introduced by falkenmark and lindh 1974 for the first time and improved by considering the ecological flow in recent years damkjaer and taylor 2017 smakhtin et al 2004 xie et al 2022 the wsi was calculated by eq 7 7 w s i w w i t t o t w a v a the higher wsi value denotes a more severe water stress status regions are considered water secure when the wsi is lower than 0 2 mildly water scarce when the wsi is between 0 2 and 0 4 and severely water scarce when the wsi is higher than 0 4 raskin et al 1997 satoh et al 2017 2 3 3 hydropower optimization model considering that the ylrb is china s third largest hydropower base following previous studies zhao et al 2021a zhong et al 2020 the optimal operation model is constructed with the objective function of maximizing the annual hydropower generation of the six cascade hydropower reservoirs in the ylrb the future runoff projected by wghm under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 combined with four water diversion scenarios s0 s3 was adopted as the model inputs in the routing module of the wghm the inflow of the downstream reservoir initially the natural runoff at the reservoir was substituted for the outflow of the upstream reservoir after confluence to optimize hydropower output particle swarm optimization pso was employed as a classical method in high dimensional optimization pso is extensively applied to the optimization of reservoir operation due to its simple structure rapid seeking speed and easy implementation bai et al 2019 jin et al 2021 koutsoyiannis and economou 2003 2 3 3 1 the optimization objective function the objective function is maximizing the annual hydropower generation which has been widely adopted in the optimal operation model shown as follows 8 max e m 1 s k 1 t n m k δ t n m k a m h m k q m k n where e denotes the total annual hydropower generation s and t represent the number of cascade reservoirs and periods respectively n m k represents the hydropower output of the reservoir m at the time k δt denotes the duration of an operation stage a m represents the hydropower production efficiency of the reservoir m h m k and q m k n are the available net head and the discharge for hydropower generation of the reservoir m at the time k respectively 2 3 3 2 constraint conditions the constraint conditions of water level discharge hydropower generation output and water balance are shown as follows 1 water level constraint 9 z m min z m k z m max where z m k represents the water level of the reservoir m at the time k z m min and z m max are the dead water level and the maximum water level of the reservoir m respectively 2 reservoir discharge constraint 10 q m min q m k q m max where q m k represents the discharge for hydropower generation of the reservoir m at the time k q m min and q m max denote the minimum and maximum discharges of the reservoir m respectively 3 hydropower generation output constraint 11 n m min n m k n m max where n m k represents the hydropower output of the reservoir m at the time k n m min and n m max denote the minimum and maximum hydropower output of the reservoir m respectively 4 water balance constraint 12 v m k 1 v m k i m k q m k w m k δ t where v m k and v m k 1 denote the storage of the reservoir m at the start time k and the end time k 1 respectively i m k and w m k represent the inflow discharge and transferred discharge by inner basin water diversion of the reservoir m at the time k respectively since the water diversion is only at the first cascade reservoir lianghekou the m in w m k is taken as 1 3 results 3 1 projection of future runoff to assess the applicability of the watergap global hydrological model in ylrb natural runoff during the historic period 1981 2000 was simulated as shown in fig 3 the model can accurately reflect the variations in monthly runoff at xiaodeshi station with the values of nse and r 2 higher than 0 9 indicating that it can be further applied to project future runoff under climate change scenarios the natural annual runoff during the future period 2021 2099 is presented in fig 4 it is notable that under rcp2 6 the average annual runoff of four gcms displays a significant decreasing trend with a rate of 1 44 m3 s per year p 0 01 in comparison with the baseline period 2006 2020 the runoff in ylrb is projected to change by 4 0 6 2 0 8 and 1 0 during the 2030 s 2050 s 2070 s and 2090 s respectively table s4 in contrast the average annual runoff displays a significant increasing trend under rcp8 5 with a rate of 1 96 m3 s per year p 0 01 in comparison with the baseline period the runoff in ylrb is estimated to change by 2 2 3 4 6 3 and 9 2 during the 2030 s 2050 s 2070 s and 2090 s respectively table s4 3 2 projections of future water withdrawals and water stress five classical ssp rcp scenarios have been designed to project future water withdrawals the water withdrawals of three primary water consuming sectors during 2021 2099 were presented in fig 5 the total water withdrawal displays significant increasing trends p 0 01 before the 2050 s under all scenarios and decreasing trends p 0 01 after 2050 s under ssp1 rcp2 6 ssp4 rcp2 6 and ssp5 rcp8 5 the mean annual total water withdrawal for ylrb during the baseline period is 1 67 billion m3 with 1 14 billion m3 for the agriculture sector accounting for 68 2 of the total water withdrawal 0 37 billion m3 the for the industry sector 22 2 and 0 16 billion m3 the for the domestic sector 9 6 unlike the baseline period the summation of industrial and domestic water withdrawals in future periods reaches quite close to the agricultural water withdrawal implying that irrigation may no longer be the dominant factor for the total water withdrawals and much attention ought to be attracted of the reasonable management of industrial and domestic water withdrawals in the future the variation rates of water withdrawals in three main water consumptive sectors are shown in table s6 for the agriculture sector the annual water withdrawal increases significantly at a rate of 0 86 10 3 billion m3 year p 0 05 during 2021 2099 under rcp8 5 and increases significantly at a rate of 2 16 10 3 billion m3 year p 0 01 during 2061 2099 under rcp2 6 for the industry sector the annual water withdrawal shows a significant increasing trend p 0 01 during 2021 2060 under all ssps with a rate of 6 82 10 3 billion m3 year 5 68 10 3 billion m3 year 5 53 10 3 billion m3 year 3 65 10 3 billion m3 year and 10 31 10 3 billion m3 year for ssp1 ssp5 respectively during 2061 2099 the annual industrial water withdrawal shows a significant decreasing trend p 0 01 under all ssps except for ssp3 with a rate of 8 45 10 3 billion m3 year 2 58 10 3 billion m3 year 10 68 10 3 billion m3 year and 3 15 10 3 billion m3 year under ssp1 ssp2 ssp4 and ssp5 respectively for the domestic sector the annual water withdrawal shows a significant decreasing trend p 0 01 during 2021 2099 under all ssps except for ssp3 with a rate of 1 47 10 3 billion m3 year 1 09 10 3 billion m3 year 1 01 10 3 billion m3 year and 1 83 10 3 billion m3 year under ssp1 ssp2 ssp4 and ssp5 respectively and a significant increasing trend p 0 01 during 2021 2099 with a rate of 1 22 10 3 billion m3 year under ssp3 future wsi values under five rcp ssp scenarios during 2021 2099 are illustrated in fig 6a the ensemble mean value of wsi displays a significant increasing trend during the 2030 s 5 51 10 4 year p 0 01 a significant decreasing trend during 2050 s 4 43 10 4 year p 0 01 and insignificant decreasing trends during 2070 s and 2090 s in comparison with the baseline period 2006 2020 the variation ratios of wsi in the future four periods are 26 4 31 2 27 5 and 22 5 respectively indicating that the wsi is projected to change more greatly during the 2050 s and 2070 s than other periods table 3 it has been illustrated that the runoff displays a significant increasing trend under rcp8 5 which may mitigate the future water stress to some degree however among all five rcp ssp scenarios ssp3 rcp8 5 and ssp5 rcp8 5 present higher change ratios during the whole future period suggesting that water withdrawals especially in the industry sector dominate the changes of wsi thus close attention is supposed to be paid to the effects of societal changes on water scarcity nevertheless the values of wsi among all the scenarios are lower than 0 1 meaning that despite the large increase in wsi the water stress in ylrb is still quite low in the future and abundant available water can fully meet local water withdrawals in addition given that the snwd w project will be applied in ylrb the ensemble mean value of wsi under five rcp ssps under different water diversion scenarios has been calculated fig 6b the results show that the water diversion projects will aggravate the water stress of ylrb but the wsi is still lower than 0 2 which means relatively low water stress satoh et al 2017 3 3 projection of future hydropower generation based on the projection of future runoff the annual hydropower generation of the six cascade reservoirs along the ylrb under various rcp water diversion scenarios has been further projected fig 7 during the baseline period 2006 2020 the average annual hydropower generation was 92 1 billion kw h for the baseline scenario s0 without water diversion the projected average hydropower generation during the whole future period shows a significant decreasing trend 0 072 billion kw h year p 0 05 under rcp2 6 and a significant increasing trend 0 089 billion kw h year p 0 01 under rcp8 5 which shows the same variation trend as the future runoff specifically for rcp2 6 the average hydropower generation is predicted to change by 34 63 billion to 3 07 billion kw h 37 62 to 3 33 34 11 billion to 4 37 billion kw h 37 06 to 4 75 36 62 billion to 1 01 billion kw h 39 79 to 1 10 and 38 22 billion to 0 80 billion kw h 41 53 to 0 87 versus the baseline period during the 2030 s 2050 s 2070 s and 2090 s respectively figs 7a and 8 for rcp8 5 the average hydropower generation is predicted to change by 38 51 billion kw h to 0 40 billion kw h 41 80 to 0 44 38 47 billion to 2 25 billion kw h 41 77 to 2 44 36 71 billion to 3 44 billion kw h 39 85 to 3 74 and 35 88 billion to 5 62 billion kw h 38 95 to 6 10 during the 2030 s 2050 s 2070 s and 2090 s respectively figs 7b and 8 as illustrated in fig 8 relative to the baseline period climate change results in a slight increase in future hydropower generation while inter basin water diversion leads to an obvious decrease in future hydropower generation in addition under different water diversion scenarios the future hydropower generation displays the same variation trend i e a decreasing trend in rcp2 6 and an increasing trend in rcp8 5 due to the relatively independent effect between climate change and water diversion on future hydropower generation the future hydropower generation without the water diversion project s0 is more than that during the baseline period except for the 2090 s under rcp2 6 however with the inner basin water diversion taken into consideration s1 s3 the future hydropower generation turns to be less than that during the baseline period indicating that compared with climate change the water diversion has a greater impact on hydropower generation in future periods and the positive impact of climate change can t offset the negative effect of water diversion interestingly under the high carbon emission scenario combined with the 4 billion m3 water diversion scenario rcp8 5 s1 the hydropower generation is projected to change by 1 75 billion kw h 1 89 during the 2090 s which means the impacts of climate change and water diversion can achieve a relative balance additionally fig 9 illustrates the impact of the snwd w on the hydropower generation of six reservoirs in the ylrb the hydropower generation of lianghekou displays the greatest reduction because it is the only water diverting reservoir for the snwd w in the ylrb and the other reservoirs could combine reservoir regulation with the inflow between the upper and lower reservoirs to weaken the effect of water diversion the hydropower generation of lianghekou is projected to decrease by about 15 and 28 under water diversion s1 and s2 respectively yet under the water diversion s3 with only ecological flow left in the lianghekou reservoir the hydropower generation will decrease by nearly 70 here and by about 35 in the other reservoirs posing a serious challenge to the energy security of the ylrb 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with previous studies to verify the rationality of the future projections we further compared our results with previous research the future runoff of the ylrb displays decreasing and increasing trends under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 respectively which is consistent with cao et al 2021 and zhao et al 2021a due to the close relationship between runoff and hydropower they show the same variation trend in the future period zhong et al 2020 zhao et al 2021a and qin et al 2022 projected the future hydropower of cascade reservoirs in ylrb under rcp8 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively liu et al 2020 estimated the future hydropower of the cascade reservoirs along the whole jinsha river containing the ylr in rcp8 5 their results indicate that the future hydropower will increase by 6 8 2 6 15 2 and 3 78 11 02 which is similar to our findings in ylrb under rcp8 5 without water diversion s0 the water withdrawals in three main water consumptive sectors during the baseline period are compatible with zhao et al 2021b and huang et al 2018 with agricultural water withdrawal occupying the largest proportion furthermore the ylrb will keep relatively low water stress in the coming decades which is congruent with the results of chen et al 2021 therefore our results are reliable and can supply beneficial suggestions on regional water resources administration for ylrb in addition most previous studies either concentrated on the effects of future climate change on runoff and hydropower generation li et al 2020 paltán et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 or only considered the impact of inter basin water diversion on hydropower generation during the historical period linh and chou 2020 yin et al 2022a while we chose the ylrb as a typical study area simultaneously considering the impact of both future climate change and inter basin water diversion on hydropower generation of the cascade reservoirs furthermore in terms of water diversion previous research mainly concentrated on the mitigation of water stress in the water receiving area neglecting the negative effects on the water diverting area long et al 2020 yang et al 2022 yin et al 2020 while in our study we systematically evaluated the impacts of the snwd w on water and energy security of the water diverting area regarding the assessment of water stress most previous studies took total renewable water resources as the available water supply daneshi et al 2021 pfister et al 2009 yin et al 2020 however considering the ecological vulnerability of the ylrb the available water supply was calculated as total renewable water resources minus ecological flow requirements which means the ecological water demand must be guaranteed first smakhtin et al 2004 besides most previous studies assessed the future water security at a national or global scale which focused more on the spatial variation pattern of water stress chen et al 2021 hanasaki et al 2013a zhai et al 2022 while the analysis for the temporal variation of water stress and its dominant factor in the specific basin was weak by contrast we corrected the simulated water withdrawals in each sector by the corresponding actual water withdrawals and then systematically analyzed the future water withdrawals and water stress of the ylrb associated with the regional reality to summarize taking the ylrb as the typical basin this study is combined with the snwd w and explores the impacts of climatic and societal changes i e social economic development and inter basin water diversion on water and energy security from a perspective of the water diverting area for the first time 4 2 impacts of water diversion on water and energy security in ylrb as the receiving area of the snwd the yellow river basin yerb is a dreadfully water scarce but densely populated region with annual available water resources per capita of 473 m3 mwrc 2022 which is far below the recommended global baseline 1700 m3 the issue of water scarcity in the yerb will be more serious with the rapid expansion of agriculture and urbanization in the coming decades and the wsi is expected to stay higher than 0 8 under the current water diversion plan chen et al 2021 yin et al 2020 according to the overall snwd w planning with the 8 and 17 billion m3 total water diversion per year the original annual water diversion scheme of 4 billion s1 and 7 billion s2 for the ylrb was designed zhang et al 2021b however due to the increased water scarcity issues of the yerb the maximum amount of water diversion scenario s3 was established with only ecological flow left despite the large increase in wsi versus the baseline period table 3 it is still lower than 0 2 in the future even combined with different water diversion scenarios fig 6b suggesting that the increase in the water stress for the water diverting area of the snwd w is acceptable and the water supply will fully suffice the requirements of the water withdrawals nevertheless a shift in hydroclimate extremes under a warming climate has altered the hydrological cycle around the globe and droughts are estimated to be more frequent and severe in the future wu et al 2022 yin et al 2022b that means extreme drought events such as the once in a century drought that occurred in 2022 across the whole yangtze river basin might happen more frequently in the future posing a potential challenge to future water security in the ylrb liang et al 2023 in addition it should be noted that future hydropower generation decreased substantially with different water diversions the loss in the hydropower generation for the ylrb reaches approximately 10 20 and 40 under water diversion s1 s2 and s3 respectively fig 8 besides under the water diversion s3 with only ecological flow left in the lianghekou reservoir the hydropower generation will decrease by nearly 70 here and by about 35 in the other reservoirs fig 9 which severely threatens the energy security in the ylrb the snwd project is a significant infrastructure aimed at optimizing china s water resources allocation it is of great importance to lessen the extreme water scarcity in northern china ensure the security of water supply and promote sustainable socio economic development prc 2016 it is reported that until the end of 2022 the total amount of transferred water in the constructed snwd m middle route and snwd e east route had reached 57 6 billion m3 benefiting more than 280 counties along the seven provinces with the directly benefiting people of 150 million niu 2022 however the source area of snwd w includes the ylrb which is not only china s third largest hydropower base but also a significant energy base for china s west east power transmission project zhu et al 2020 according to the information from the yalong river hydropower company the hydropower of the ylrb was transmitted to chongqing sichuan and jiangsu with the proportion of approximately 20 35 and 45 respectively zhao et al 2022 therefore the effect of the snwd w on energy security of the ylrb needs to be highly concerned besides except for the snwd other major water diversion projects like the dadu river to min river project han river to wei river project and yangtze river to han river project are under planning or construction yang et al 2023 ma et al 2021 wu et al 2020 the effects of water diversion projects on water diverting areas ought to be cautiously assessed in summary our findings suggest the necessity for decision makers to balance the mitigation of water stress in the water receiving area against the loss of hydropower generation in the water diverting area 4 3 uncertainties and limitations the main uncertainty in our projections of future water and energy security comes from the climate and hydrological models all four global climate models in isimip2b were selected to predict future runoff in the ylrb the future runoff shows a considerable variation range due to the differences between climate models fig 4 multi model ensemble mean was adopted to diminish the uncertainty induced by various climate models giuntoli et al 2021 wolski et al 2012 additionally similar to other research in the projections of future runoff and hydropower zhong et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 merely one hydrological model was adopted to estimate future runoff in our study which results in the potential uncertainty in the model structure troin et al 2022 yet according to the recent studies the uncertainty in hydrological models is lower than that in climate models dams et al 2015 wang et al 2020 besides our findings in the variation trends of runoff are consistent with previous studies which used other hydrological models swat and vic cao et al 2021 zhao et al 2021a therefore despite the uncertainty to some extent our results can be regarded as a reliable projection for runoff and hydropower moreover the future agricultural water withdrawal is highly correlated with future climate and the uncertainty in climate models will inevitably spread to the estimation of the irrigation water withdrawal additionally in terms of future societal changes we only focused on social economic development and inter basin water diversion while the future variations in land use and cover which might affect water and energy security indirectly daneshi et al 2021 were not considered in our study meanwhile given that the population is concentrated in the lower region of the ylrb and the total water consumption is relatively low the effects of water consumption changes on the hydropower generation of the entire basin were ignored also in the assessment the water security we took the ylrb as a whole without specifically considering the connection of water resources between upper and lower reaches duan et al 2019 smolenaars et al 2022 due to the similar change directions of precipitation and temperature between cmip5 and cmip6 hamed et al 2022 su et al 2022 our results are not expected to differ substantially when evaluated using cmip6 outputs 5 conclusions taking the ylrb as the case region this study systematically evaluates the impacts of future climatic and societal changes on water and energy security in the water diverting area of the snwd w for the first time the future runoff and hydropower generation were estimated using watergap hydrological model under different rcp scenarios and water withdrawals were predicted based on the ssp scenarios the future runoff in the ylrb displays significant increasing and decreasing trends p 0 01 under rcp8 5 1 96 m3 s per year and rcp2 6 1 44 m3 s per year respectively the total water withdrawals show significant increasing trends p 0 01 before the 2050 s under all rcp ssp scenarios and decreasing trends p 0 01 after the 2050 s under most scenarios relative to the baseline period the wsi in the 2030 s 2050 s 2070 s and 2090 s is projected to increase by 26 4 31 2 27 5 and 22 5 respectively which is dominated by water withdrawals especially in the industry sector nevertheless the values of wsi among all the scenarios are lower than 0 2 even combined with the snwd w project suggesting that abundant available water resources will fully suffice water withdrawals the future hydropower generation displays the same variation trend as the future runoff during the four future periods the hydropower generation is projected to change by 0 87 6 10 without water diversion and by 41 80 to 1 89 under different water diversion scenarios the slight increment caused by climate change cannot offset the substantial decrement caused by water diversion especially in the maximum transfer amount scenario s3 which emphasizes the tradeoffs between the mitigation of water stress in the water receiving area and the loss of hydropower generation in the water diverting area yet there exist several limitations in this study such as the lack of consideration for future variations in land use cover and water consumption which need further research besides given that the cmip6 dataset has been developed and progressively applied in recent years further work may explore the effects of climate change and snwd w projects on water and energy security in the whole jinsha river basin combined with the new cmip6 scenarios moreover the seasonal variation of hydropower generation can be further discussed with the combination of reservoir scheduling and water diversion rules taken together our findings are expected to serve as a beneficial reference for water resources administration in the ylrb and the design of the water diversion scheme for the snwd w project as well as the other inter basin water diversion projects around the world credit authorship contribution statement hanxu liang
