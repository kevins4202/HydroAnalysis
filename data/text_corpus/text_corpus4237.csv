21185,the static pushover analysis can be employed to check the adequate ductility of jacket type offshore platforms jtops under the abnormal level earthquake ale in the design phase the conventional pushover analysis suffers from different inherent limitations such as disregarding the higher mode effects in this paper it is intended to develop an advanced pushover procedure for the seismic design of jtops to this end a multi mode n2 mn2 pushover procedure is proposed that modifies the srss modal combination rule in the extended n2 procedure the proposed procedure utilizes several modes of vibration to increase the accuracy of the method the presented procedure is applied to two case study jtop structures for the ductility level seismic performance evaluation the seismic demands obtained by the mn2 procedure is compared with the average results of the benchmark nonlinear response history nrh analyses conducted using a suite of far field ground motion records scaled to the ale design response spectrum the results of a statistical study show that there is a strong correlation between the spectral values of the records at the shorter periods of jtops and the responses of the foundation and the lower braced story levels of the jacket which emphasize the important effects of the higher modes on the seismic demands of jtops if considering soil pile structure interaction the utilized formulation for the modal combination is shown to improve the accuracy of the mn2 method at the pile foundation and at the lower braced story levels of the jacket moreover the seismic drift demands predicted by the proposed mn2 method are in excellent agreement with the benchmark nrh results along the height of the platforms considering the simplicity and ease of application this method can be utilized as a useful tool for checking the design ductility level earthquake keywords earthquake design check modal response seismic demands soil pile structure interaction extended n2 pushover 1 introduction the nonlinear static procedure nsp has gained prominence in recent years as an alternative tool for estimating the seismic demands of structures responding in the nonlinear range the simplicity ease of use and the low computational efforts make the pushover procedure more popular among the structural engineers nevertheless the primary versions of the pushover procedure lack the ability to take the higher modes effect into account krawinkler and seneviratna 1998 chopra and goel 2002 according to api rp 2eq iso 19901 2 2004 e 2014 the nsp analysis can be utilized to evaluate that jacket type offshore platforms jtops has adequate reserve strength and ductility capacity under the abnormal level earthquake ale loads the utilization of the pushover analysis for evaluating the ductility and energy capacity of jacket offshore platforms abdel raheem 2014 was firstly described by kallaby and millan 1975 where a modal lateral load pattern representing the strength level earthquake shear forces is monotonically increased to push the structure into the inelastic ranges of response golafshani et al 2009 applied the fema 2000 based seismic performance assessments of a case study fixed platform using the pushover analysis they utilized a uniform distribution of the earthquake loads elsayed et al 2014 computed a case study fixed offshore platform ultimate base shear resistance via using the static pushover analysis to derive a resistance variable for reliability analysis the first mode loads were applied progressively until the platform failure was reached el din and kim 2015 carried out the pushover and incremental dynamic analyses to evaluate the seismic performance of a typical fixed base jacket structure to compare the various bracing configurations yang et al 2017 proposed some simplified procedures using the static pushover analysis to perform a rapid assessment of the seismic collapse resistance of jacket offshore platforms in terms of the collapse margin ratio in bea 1991 sharifian et al 2015 abyani et al 2017 asgarian et al 2018 the nonlinear static or dynamic analyses revealed that the failure of the platform is initiated from the foundation part according to this literature survey almost all of these studies utilized the first mode lateral load pattern or the uniform load pattern in the pushover analysis neglecting the effects of the higher modes in the demands predicted in order to overcome the foregoing shortcomings of the conventional pushover procedure several research endeavors have been conducted to develop enhanced pushover procedures chopra and goel 2002 sucuoglu and selim gunay 2011 fragiadakis and vamvatsikos 2010 the modal pushover analysis mpa proposed by chopra and goel 2002 is one of the most famous pushover procedures which is based on the structural dynamics theory in this method some pushover analyses with an invariant lateral load distribution according to the elastic mode shapes of the structure are performed separately then the final seismic demands are determined by combining the peak modal response quantities using the quadratic modal combination rules such as the square root of sum of squares srss or the complete quadratic combination cqc the extended n2 method proposed by kreslin and fajfar 2011 is one of the conceptually robust enhanced pushover procedures which takes into account the effects of higher modes on the responses in the extended n2 method it is assumed that the building remains elastic when vibrating in the higher modes this method is successful in appropriately predicting the seismic demands several other research studies have also been carried out in recent years to take the higher modes effect into account jan et al 2004 poursha et al 2009 khoshnoudian et al 2012 poursha and amini 2015 vafaee and saffari 2017 apart from the force based pushover procedures mentioned above some attempts have also been done in recent years to propose the displacement based pushover approaches sahraei and behnamfar 2014 behnamfar et al 2016 amini and poursha 2016 jalilkhani et al 2020 in these procedures the lateral load patterns are based on the deformations rather than the forces in order to consider the higher mode effect and changes in the modal properties of the structure in the nonlinear region several adaptive pushover procedures were also developed antoniou and pinho 2004a 2004b shakeri et al 2010 abbasnia et al 2013 amini and poursha 2018 since the lateral load pattern must be updated instantly an adaptive solution requires an eigenvalue analysis at each loading increment this process brings about an additional computational effort which reduces the attractiveness of adaptive pushover methods consequently the non adaptive pushover algorithm is more practical than the adaptive one and can be easily used in practice as highlighted above the conventional pushover analysis has only been utilized for the preliminary response evaluation of jacket offshore structures in the previous research studies which has some inherent limitations in light of this limitation the main purpose of this paper is to develop an enhanced pushover procedure for the seismic design of jtops to this end a multi mode n2 mn2 pushover procedure is proposed that modifies the srss modal combination rule in the extended n2 procedure kreslin and fajfar 2011 the proposed procedure utilizes several modes of vibration to increase the accuracy of the method the main advantages of the proposed pushover procedure are classified as 1 the effects of higher modes in estimating the seismic demands of jtops can be taken into consideration using the presented modal formulation for computing the drifts 2 the mn2 pushover method is capable of considering the algebraic sign sign reversal of the higher modes contrary to the extended n2 method 3 the proposed procedure only requires one conventional pushover analysis along with the standard modal analysis which requires less computational effort and analysis time than the other enhanced adaptive and non adaptive pushover procedures 4 the basic concept of the mn2 pushover is based on the common response spectrum analysis which is familiar for both the civil engineers and the researchers moreover the response spectrum tool is available in many civil engineering software used in practice to show the accuracy of the presented procedure it is applied to two case study jtop structures for the ductility level seismic performance evaluation the seismic demands obtained by the mn2 procedure is compared with the average results of the benchmark nonlinear response history analyses conducted using a suite of far field ground motion records these records are scaled to the ale design response spectrum also a comprehensive statistical study is presented to investigate the effects of higher modes on the seismic responses of the jtop structures the mn2 pushover method can be employed during the design phase to check the ductility adequacy of jtop structures under ale this method may be utilized to check whether a special demand limit state has been exceeded an acceptance criterion or not under the ductility level earthquake moreover the distribution of the drift demands along the platform height can be obtained by this method to determine the week links in order to rectify the strength and stiffness irregularities and more uniformly distribute the nonlinear demands along the platform height 2 the algorithm of the proposed approach in the extended n2 method kreslin and fajfar 2011 the effects of higher modes are taken into consideration assuming that the structure remains in the elastic range when vibrating in the higher modes and a standard modal analysis is performed for this purpose the srss rule for the combination of different modes is applied in the extended n2 method therefore the effects of sign inversion in the story displacements due to the contribution of higher modes are ignored the application of the srss modal combination rule has some limitations because there are instances in the dynamic response analysis where the inversion of the sign of story forces does occur antoniou and pinho 2004b in the current study the modal combination rule in the extended n2 procedure is modified to improve the accuracy of the predicted seismic demands thus the maximum story displacements corresponding to the nth mode is calculated according to the following equation 1 d n γ n φ n sd n ξ n t n where φ n is the nth mode shape vector γ n is the corresponding modal participating factor sd n is the spectral displacement for a given earthquake ground motion and t n and ζ n are the vibration period of the structure and the damping ratio associated with the nth mode respectively using sd n the effects of the frequency content of the earthquake records can be considered in the demand evaluation indeed this is a weighting factor to determine the contribution factor of each mode to the total response in this paper in order to surpass the shortcomings of the quadratic modal combination technique the displacements are combined by algebraically adding the modal displacements therefore the combined story displacements d k are computed as 2 d k i 1 k d i i 1 k γ i φ i sd i ξ i t i where k is the number of modes considered in the elastic response spectrum analysis to take the higher mode effects into consideration it should be noted that the absolute value of the modal participation factor is used in this equation to achieve the appropriate contribution of each mode to the displacement demands vector this assumption makes the highest level component in the displacement vectors of different modes be in the same direction therefore the combined displacement at the control node cn where the mode shapes are normalized with reference to is computed using the following equation 3 d k cn i 1 k d i cn i 1 k γ i sd i ζ i t i according to eq 1 the story drift of the nth mode at the story level j is determined as 4 dr n j γ n φ n j φ n j 1 h j sd n ζ n t n the combined story drifts using the first k modes are computed using the following expression 5 dr k j i 1 k γ i φ i j φ i j 1 h j sd i ζ i t i where h j is the height of story level j it is worth noting that the sign of γ n is retained in this equation to ensure that the drift components at the story levels where the higher modes control the responses be in the positive direction this assumption is shown in the next sections to improve the accuracy of the proposed pushover analysis at the pile foundation part and the lower story levels of the jacket however the sign reversal of the higher modes is still captured and affects the drift demands in the mid story levels of the jtop the absolute value of γ n in eq 5 is recommended to be used for the application of the mn2 method for building frames herein in order to determine the number of modes participating in the seismic demands it is suggested to use several modes such that the sum of their effective modal participating mass ratios α n is at least 90 since several modes are considered in the derivation of the seismic demands the method proposed in this study using the n2 approach is named the multi mode n2 mn2 method a detailed step by step implementation of the mn2 procedure is presented as follows 1 perform the eigen analysis of the linearly elastic structure of the jtop to obtain the natural periods of vibration tn mode shapes n and other required modal properties the mode shapes are normalized in such a way that n at the control node equals unity m 1 the uppermost node of the deck or the top of the jacket node may be considered as the control node 2 determine the total target displacement at the control node δ t using the mean of the nonlinear response history analyses the capacity spectrum method the displacement coefficient method or the other proposed approaches in the previous research studies amini and poursha 2016 abbasnia et al 2013 3 perform a conventional pushover analysis with an appropriate invariant load pattern until the control node reaches δ t this can be done using the basic n2 pushover method fajfar and fischinger 1998 or the pushover analysis based on the first mode of vibration 4 determine the number of required modes k using the following equation 6 i 1 k α i 0 9 5 carry out the standard elastic response spectrum analysis and compute the combined displacement at the control node d k c n using eq 3 then calculate the normalization factor nf disp as 7 nf disp δ t d k c n 6 calculate the story drift ratios at each story level using eq 5 and multiply the results by nf disp 7 to derive the final story drift profile envelope the drift ratios obtained in step 3 conventional pushover analysis results and step 6 the normalized elastic modal analysis results 8 to obtain the other local response quantities compute a correction factor for each story level cf drift via dividing the drift of that story level determined from step 7 by that of the pushover analysis in step 3 the cf drift values can be applied to all the local deformation quantities e g rotations obtained from the pushover analysis of step 3 the correction factors cf drift for story drifts are also used in computing the internal forces of members in the condition that the internal forces are lower than the load carrying capacity of the corresponding element in a case that the internal force demands exceed the capacity the internal forces can be determined using deformations considering the associated force deformation relationship kreslin and fajfar 2011 3 description of the case study platforms in order to investigate the accuracy of the proposed pushover analysis the spq1 and spd19c platforms in the persian gulf at water depths of 65 3 m and 77 5 m respectively are considered the platforms have four legs supported by 8 skirt piles and 4 pile through legs driven to 61 m and 103 m depths in the spq1 and spd19c platforms respectively the utilized lateral resisting systems of the jacket are chevron bracing and x bracing types for these platforms see fig 1 the diameter of the piles is 1 52 m and their wall thickness equal to 0 089 m at the upper parts of the pile for the spd19c platform whereas the pile diameter and its wall thickness are 1 52 m and 0 076 m for the spq1 platform respectively the spd19c platform has a typical configuration which represents many jtops installed in the persian gulf asgarian and agheshlui 2009 asgarian and lesani 2009 golafshani et al 2011 zeinoddini et al 2012 vazirizade et al 2020 or in other offshore regions of the world elsayed et al 2014 bai et al 2015 the same configuration as the spq1 platform has also been utilized in the previous research studies bazzurro and cornell 1994 golafshani and gholizad 2009 the overall mass of the deck is 6230 ton and 5822 ton for spd19c and spq1 platforms respectively which comprised of the dead weight of the topside and all the relevant equipment as well as twenty percent of the live loads all the primary secondary and the nonstructural masses of the jacket structure along with the entrapped water of the flooded members and added mass for all the members below the sea level are assigned as lumped masses to the nearest joint in the created numerical model this helps to achieve an accurate distribution of jacket masses the platforms are designed in compliance with the requirements of iso 19902 2007 e 2007 and api rp 2eq iso 19901 2 2004 e 2014 for seismic performance also some additional guidelines are considered in agreement with the 22nd edition of api 2a wsd 2014 according to iso 19902 2007 e 2007 the design procedure is based on the lrfd structural design criteria the ele earthquake event is satisfied during the design phase using the linear response spectrum analysis method to ensure that the platforms have adequate strength the three orthogonal components of the earthquake ground motions are combined linearly such that one component is at its maximum value whereas the other two components are at 40 percent of their respective maximum values api rp 2eq iso 19901 2 2004 e 2014 generic seismic maps of the spectral accelerations for offshore areas of the world presented in api 2eq iso 19901 2 2004 e 2014 are used to construct the ele and ale response spectra to this end the site ale acceleration response spectrum for 2500 years return period is derived by multiplying the site 1000 years spectrum by a scale factor nale equal to 1 6 for the l1 structure exposure level in order to obtain the site ele response spectrum the ale spectrum is divided by a seismic reserve capacity factor cr equal to 1 85 for both of the platforms this factor represents a structure s ability to sustain ground vibrations severe than the ele the adopted value is lower than 2 8 limit for the l1 platforms and 2 limit for the non ductile design defined in iso 19902 2007 e 2007 the full description of the design procedure for the case study models is presented in zarrin et al 2020 these platforms are selected for evaluation purposes of the proposed advanced pushover method because they utilize different bracing types and the height of the platforms are different whereas their other properties are approximately the same moreover the skirt piles have been utilized in the spq1 platform instead of the pile through leg scheme in the spd19c platform hence the effects of the bracing type the structural height and foundation type on the accuracy of the proposed mn2 procedure can be assessed 4 details of the numerical model an elaborated 2d numerical model of the two case study platforms is developed in opensees finite element software mazzoni et al 2007 see fig 2 the same modeling procedures as comprehensively described in the previous research studies of the first author sharifian et al 2015 zarrin et al 2018 2020 asgarian et al 2018 abyani et al 2019a b are utilized in the current study herein only a brief description of the numerical model is discussed a 2d model is utilized in this study for the ease of simplicity and interpretation the size of the horizontal members in the jacket and deck part of the utilized 2d model is defined based on the half of the equivalent stiffness of the whole horizontal framings in the 3d model the legs braces and piles are the same in both the 2d and 3d models the periods of vibration of the 2d model is consistent with that of the 3d model the pile jacket and topside structural members are modeled using a very well formulated distributed plasticity beam column element based on the force formulation spacone et al 1996 the cross section of the members is modeled using the fiber discretization approach the menegotto pinto steel material model menegotto and pinto 1973 is utilized to simulate the stress strain behavior of the fibers which considers the baushinger effects the large displacement effects are incorporated into the numerical model using the efficient co rotational formulation de souza 2000 an initial imperfection equal to 1 1000 of brace length is introduced to the mid span node of the braces to include the buckling capability of the braces every brace segment leg and horizontal frame member is modeled with 10 force based elements the efficiency of the force based elements in simulating the buckling post buckling and hysteretic behavior of tubular members has been verified with experimental tests in many research endeavors asgarian et al 2005 alangari et al 2009 vaezi and zarrin 2020 the soil pile structure interaction problem is simulated utilizing the beam on nonlinear winkler foundation bnwf method the pysimple1 tzsimple1 and qzsimple1 uniaxial materials boulanger et al 1999 are used to model the near field soil lateral bearing skin friction and end bearing the pysimple1 material can take into account the opened gap radiation damping and the stiffness deterioration of the soil hysteretic response boulanger et al 1999 the procedure of modeling the soil pile structure interaction in the current study is verified with available experimental tests in the previous research works of the first author zarrin et al 2017 asgarian et al 2013 5 ensemble of the ground motions 20 far field ground motion records are selected from a 40 record ensemble prepared for the pacific earthquake engineering research center s peer transportation research program baker et al 2011 the original peer record ensemble has a wide variety of spectral shapes which introduces a large and uniform standard deviation over a wide period range of interest the later feature guarantees that the record suite excites a structure in different ways capturing the inherent randomness of the earthquake ground vibrations the median and log standard deviations of the horizontal response spectra of the selected suite match a scenario earthquake with magnitude 7 strike slip earthquake at a distance of 10 km recorded on the soil sites the average shear wave velocity in the top portion of the soil vs30 in the selected records is in agreement with the soil site of the case study jtops the geomean zarrin et al 2019 abyani et al 2019a b and the log standard deviation of the selected 20 records are in close agreement with those of the original 40 record ensemble see fig 3 the nga record sequence numbers rsn of the record set are tabulated in table 1 the fault normal components of the records are used baker et al 2011 6 results and discussion 6 1 conventional pushover analysis results in order to shed light on the response characteristics of the platforms the results obtained by the pushover analysis with the load patterns of the first two modes are presented first depicted in fig 4 a and b are the first and second mode pushover curves for the spq1 platform the deflected shape of the platform corresponding to some key points of the response is also illustrated in this figure as seen several strength losses are observed in the first mode pushover curve corresponding to the buckling of the upper two braced story levels whereas the buckling of the lowermost braced story level leads to sudden drop in the strength in the second mode pushover curve fig 4 c and d show the first and second mode pushover curves of the spd19c platform similar to the spq1 behavior the buckling of the braces at the upper two braced story levels changes the slope of the first mode pushover curve while the second mode pushover curve becomes inelastic when the first braced story level buckles according to this figure it is apparent that the spq1 platform shows a brittle behavior in which some sudden drops in the force displacement curves are observed the reasons behind this behavior can be due to the chevron bracing type of the spq1 jacket rather than the x type bracing of the spd19c platform along with the battered leg in the spd19c platform similar results have been reported in the previous research studies that the failure of the platform is initiated from the upper part of the jacket gates et al 1977 bazzurro and cornell 1994 asgarian and agheshlui 2009 golafshani et al 2009 el din and kim 2015 when subjecting the platform to the first mode load pattern gates et al 1977 asgarian and agheshlui 2009 sharifian et al 2015 elsayed et al 2014 yang et al 2017 or to the uniform load distribution golafshani et al 2009 6 2 modal characteristics of the platforms in this section it is intended to compare the fundamental modal features of the fixed jacket offshore platforms in order to gain some insights into the major dynamic response characteristics the modal properties of the two case study platforms are tabulated in table 2 according to this table the values of α n for the first two modes of the spq1 platform are lower than those for the spd19c platform implying that more modes are required for α n in the case of the spq1 to achieve 90 of the total seismic mass of the structure see eq 6 according to this table 5 and 4 modes should be considered for the spq1 and spd19c platforms respectively to achieve 90 of the total seismic mass of the structure in table 2 the values of γ i are presented for two different cases with regard to the node considered as the control node that is the reference node to which the mode shapes are normalized that is the values of γ i are once determined by taking the top most node of the topside as the control node and they are computed once again by considering the top node of the jacket as the control node as seen the values of the modal participation factor are different for these two cases because they are dependent on how the modes are normalized chopra 2001 fig 5 a and b show the first six mode shapes over the height of the spq1 platform for the two control node cases as seen in fig 5 a the mode shape values of modes 2 and 6 at the pile head elevation 78 5 m where the higher modes significantly influence the maximum responses are negative similarly the mode shape values of modes 3 and 5 at this region are negative when the mode shapes are normalized with respect to the top of the jacket node see fig 5 b moreover the values of γ i are negative for modes 2 and 6 when the mode shapes are normalized with respect to the topside node and are negative for modes 3 and 5 in the case of normalizing the mode shapes with respect to the top of the jacket node in order to improve the accuracy of the seismic demand evaluation for the proposed pushover at the pile foundation and the lower story levels of the jacket the sign of γ i for these modes is retained in eq 4 for the drift evaluation therefore regarding fig 5 a and b and table 2 the drifts derived by this equation for all the considered modes at the pile foundation have a positive sign which lead to the absolutely additive nature of the drifts predicted using eq 5 for the k number of modes considered in other words the multiplication of the negative mode shape values by the negative values of γ i at the pile foundation in the mentioned modes in eq 4 leads to the positive modal drifts note to the positive value of the modal story drifts at the pile foundation of the spq1 platform in fig 6 a and b for all the considered modes also the modal drift values are positive only for the first three modes at the first braced story level of the jacket on the other hand the modal drift values for modes 3 and 4 at the second braced story level are negative effect of sign reversal leading to the improvement of the accuracy of the proposed method as is discussed in section 8 3 the comparison of fig 6 a and b demonstrates that the modal drift values computed based on eq 4 are independent of how the mode shapes are normalized similar modal results as reported for the spq1 platform are observed for the spd19c platform depicted in fig 7 a and b are the mode shapes when they are normalized to the top of the jacket node and the modal drift ratios of this platform respectively as seen in fig 7 b positive drift ratios are predicted at the pile foundation for all the considered modes also the drift values in some of the higher modes are negative at the first and second braced storey levels of the jacket implying the effects of the sign reversal phenomenon in eq 4 6 3 investigation on the higher mode effects via a statistical study in this section it is intended to comprehensively investigate the effects of higher modes on the seismic responses of the jtop structures the nrh analysis is performed for the two platforms using the ground motion suite described earlier for each of the records the desired peak responses are obtained from the results of the nrh analyses in this study the main response quantity is the story like drift ratio over the platform height the drift ratio has been considered as a measure of damage in many research endeavors of fixed offshore platforms golafshani et al 2009 el din and kim 2014 2015 sharifian et al 2015 abyani et al 2017 zarrin et al 2018 limiting the drift ratio in the jacket story levels reduces the structural damages such as brace buckling horizontal frame element buckling pile yielding and non structural damages such as damage to the j tubes conductors and conductor framings fig 8 depicts the height wise variation of the maximum drift ratios obtained from the benchmark nrh analysis for all the 20 records as seen a notable dispersion in the seismic demands is observed in both of the platforms for instance the drift ratio at the upper part of the foundation changes from 0 62 to 2 17 and from 0 41 to 1 51 for the spd19c and spq1 platforms respectively these variations indicate the effects of the inherent randomness aleatoric uncertainty of the earthquake ground motions on the seismic responses of the jtops in order to explore the relation between the drift demands in the various parts of the platform and the characteristics of the response spectra of the selected record suite the seismic demands under the effects of several specific records are investigated in detail fig 9 a illustrates the response spectra of records 1 2 6 11 18 and 19 scaled to the spectral acceleration pseudo acceleration value at the first mode period s a t1 of the spd19c platform moreover fig 10 a shows the height wise variation of the drift ratios for this platform subjected to these records according to fig 9 a the spectral values s a for records 1 and 6 are larger than those of the geometric mean of the 20 record set at the period range between the first and third mode periods the range of the higher mode periods on the other hand the s a values are almost smaller and equal to the geometric mean spectrum in the periods longer than the first mode period t1 for records 1 and 6 respectively it is worth mentioning that when the nonlinear excursions occur in structures the lateral stiffness decrease thus resulting effectively in period elongation of structures as seen in fig 10 a the drift ratios for these records are relatively large at the foundation which are greater than those at the unbraced story level beneath the deck from elevation 5 75 m 13 75 m this finding implies that the records with large spectral values at the higher mode periods excite the lower braced story level of the jacket and the foundation part more significantly note that because the spectral values of record 6 are greater than those of record 1 at periods larger than 2t1 its drift demand is higher at the unbraced story level beneath the deck according to fig 9 a the spectral values of records 2 and 11 at the higher mode periods range and the periods longer than t1 are larger than the geometric mean spectrum in other words the response spectra of these records have a valley in t1 implying that these records have a negative epsilon ε value at t1 ε measures the difference between s a for an as recorded earthquake and the geometric mean s a computed using an attenuation relationship at a specific period baker and jayaram 2008 the ε parameter is a characteristic of an earthquake record and has been identified as an indicator of spectral shape near t1 records with positive ε tend to have a peak spectral shape records 18 and 19 in fig 9 a whereas records with negative ε tend to have a valley spectral shape records 2 and 11 in fig 9 a as seen in fig 10 a records 2 and 11 with negative ε value significantly excite the platform at both the upper part of the jacket and the foundation whereas records 18 and 19 with positive ε value less strongly excite all the platform levels the similar results are observed for the spq1 platform according to fig 10 b the platform does not experience significant nonlinearities under the effects of records 10 and 18 with positive ε values while record 11 with negative ε value leads to the most severe responses among all the records note to record 9 with the s a values lower than the geometric mean spectrum at periods shorter than t1 and higher than the geometric mean spectrum at periods longer than t1 this record excites the upper story levels of the jacket while it does not excite the foundation part significantly the opposite results are obtained for records 3 and 6 see figs 9 b and 10 b from the above discussion it can be concluded that the larger s a values at shorter periods near the second and third mode periods denoted by t2 and t3 respectively more strongly excite the lower braced story levels of the jacket and the foundation part this indicates the effects of the higher mode responses on jacket offshore platforms in contrast the larger s a values at the periods longer than t1 cause stronger inelastic responses of the jtops at the upper story levels of the jacket in order to systematically explore the above presented conclusions in the following a detailed statistical study is presented to investigate the effects of the first mode and the higher modes on the dynamic responses of the jtops the first step is to pursue whether the responses follow a systematic distribution type or not to this end it is intended to determine the appropriate probability density function pd for the drift values utilizing two statistical procedures as discussed in more details in the following two different one component probability distributions i e normal and lognormal ones are evaluated using a goodness of fit test and a non parametric model anderson darling ad test is one of the most powerful goodness of fit tests anderson and darling 1954 based on the empirical distribution function edf the ad test is more sensitive to deviations in the tails of distributions consequently the ad test statistic or correspondingly its p value could be considered as a strong criterion for comparing the hypothesized distributions with a significant emphasis on the distribution tails the ad p values are tabulated in table 3 for the two cases of the drift values i e at the unbraced story level beneath the deck and at the pile head for the spd19c model and at the uppermost braced story level of the jacket and at the pile head for the spq1 model considering the significance level α 0 05 since all the p values are greater than α none of the hypothesized distributions is rejected by ad goodness of fit test generally the greater ad test p values or equally the smaller ad test statistics can show smaller average differences of the hypothesized cdf and the empirical cdf over the whole range of data as seen in table 3 the lognormal p values are larger than those of the normal distribution in all the considered cases moreover kernel density function as a non parametric approach is used to compare the efficiency of each aforementioned pdf for an arbitrary random variable x with the sample values x 1 x 2 x 3 x n the kernel density estimator f ˆ is defined as 8 f ˆ x h 1 n h i 1 n k x x i h in this equation k and h represent the kernel function and the bandwidth parameter respectively the considered kernel function for this study is the so called gaussian function defined by the following equation 9 k x x i h 1 2 π exp x x i 2 2 h 2 in this regard finding the optimal value for the bandwidth parameter is a challenging problem as it controls the smoothness of the density function ouarda et al 2015 to this end the mean integrated squared error mise could be used to derive the optimal value of h 10 m i s e h e f ˆ x h f x 2 d x where f x is the analytical pdf and e is the expected value operator the qualitative comparison between the analytical pdfs and the kernel functions is illustrated in fig 11 as seen the lognormal distribution fits well with the kernel density function at both the upper part of the jacket where the first mode mainly controls the maximum responses and at the foundation where the higher modes dominate the seismic drifts the seismic drifts were shown to follow a lognormal distribution for the frame buildings in the previous research studies romao et al 2013 the observed lognormal distribution for the seismic demands of the jtops is a result of a carefully selected earthquake records based on an approach which matches the selected records with a target response spectrum mean and variance as it is not much easy to qualitatively compare these pdf fits the root mean square error rmse between the kernel function and each estimated pdf r m s e p d f can be computed by eq 11 and is tabulated in table 4 11 r m s e p d f i 1 n f ˆ x i h f x i 2 n where n is the number of data points n 20 in this paper according to this table the lognormal distribution better fits the data because of showing lower r m s e p d f values as another step to investigate the effects of higher modes the correlation between the s a values at the second and third mode periods and the seismic demands is investigated fig 12 a and b show the line fitted to the data obtained from a linear regression between 20 values of s a t 2 and once the drifts at the pile head and the other time the drifts at the unbraced story level beneath the deck respectively for the spd19c model also the equation of the fitted line and the correlation coefficient cc between these two data points are demonstrated on each subplot as is evident the s a t 2 values are somewhat linearly correlated with the drift demands at the foundation while both the cc and the line slope values significantly decrease in the case of the drifts at the unbraced story level beneath the deck moreover fig 12 c and d indicate that a high correlation coefficient is also observed between the s a t 3 values and the foundation drifts whereas they do not have any correlation with the upper part of the jacket drifts similar observations can be deduced from fig 13 for the spq1 platform these findings provide strong statistical evidences that the higher modes have distinct effects on the jtop responses moreover this statistical study approves the above mentioned discussion in the conventional pushover section and the discussion presented at the beginning of this section that the higher modes of vibration mainly affect the seismic drifts at the foundation and the lower braced story levels of the jacket 6 4 the proposed mn2 procedure results the mean values of nrh responses over all the records are considered as the benchmark responses therefore the results of the proposed pushover procedure are compared with the benchmark results moreover the results of some pushover procedures such as the first mode pushover and the extended n2 method are also compared for evaluation purposes in the conventional first mode pushover the structural models are pushed to the average displacements computed from the nrh results which are equal to 0 42 m and 0 634 m for the spd19c and spq1 platforms respectively as emphasized in the conventional pushover analysis results the lower average dynamic displacement of the spd19c is attributed to the more ductile bracing type of this platform together with the battered legs in this model figs 14 16 compare the height wise variation of the maximum drift ratios obtained from the first mode and the enhanced pushover analyses with the results of the benchmark nrh analysis refer to fig 2 for the platform height profile and the elevations of the story levels as mentioned earlier the maximum demands at the upper story levels of the jacket are mainly controlled by the first mode pushover analysis in both of the platforms according to these figures a fairly good agreement is observed between the first mode pushover and the nrh results at the upper three stories of the jacket in both of the platforms the results for the spq1 platform are presented for the two cases of the control node it is noteworthy that the benchmark nrh displacements are also recorded in these control nodes a comparison of fig 14 a and b indicates that when the top of the jacket node is used as the node for controlling the displacements the accuracy of the first mode pushover in estimating the seismic responses increases the reason lies in the fact that the topside in the jtops mainly responds linearly and the nonlinear deformations are mostly concentrated in the jacket and foundation parts therefore transferring the control node from the uppermost node of the topside to the top of the jacket node may lead to a more realistic estimation of the seismic demands at the upper story levels of the jacket considering this finding further discussions are only presented for the case that the displacement is controlled at the top of the jacket node for both of the platforms the results of the elastic modal analysis in the mn2 and the extended n2 methods are presented in figs 14 16 considering 2 to 6 modes for the spq1 platform and 2 to 5 modes for the spd19c platform as seen in figs 14 and 16 a considering more modes in the mn2 method incrementally improves the prediction of the seismic demands at the pile foundation for both of the models due to the additive nature of eq 5 for the pile part as highlighted previously at the second braced story level elevations 32 m and 13 m in the spq1 and spd19c platforms respectively considering only 2 modes overestimates the drift demands in both of the platforms however when considering more than 2 modes in the mn2 method the sign reversal of the higher modes in this story decreases the drift demand leading to the best accuracy in the case of considering 6 and 5 modes for the spq1 and spd19c platforms respectively this can be deduced referring to figs 6 b and 7 b and observing that the modal drift ratios of modes 3 and 4 calculated based on eq 4 are negative in this story level it is interesting to note that considering more than 2 modes at the first braced story level of the jacket does not notably change the drift prediction because the modal drifts for the higher modes is very small relative to those of the first two modes on the other hand according to figs 15 and 16 b considering more than 2 modes in the elastic modal analysis of the extended n2 method does not improve the seismic demand estimations at all the final results of the mn2 and the extended n2 methods calculated via enveloping the results obtained by the multi mode analysis and the first mode pushover analysis are depicted in fig 17 as seen the mn2 pushover method provides excellent estimation of the seismic drift demands over the whole platforms height whereas the extended n2 method significantly underestimates the results at the foundation part of the jacket in both of the platforms furthermore the accuracy of the mn2 method is more than the extended n2 method at the third and second braced story levels of the spq1 and spd19c platforms respectively 7 conclusion a multi mode n2 mn2 procedure was proposed to revise the srss modal combination rule in the extended n2 method so that the sign reversal is considered in the modal combination the relevant modes are selected such that the sum of their effective modal participating mass ratios is at least 90 to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed pushover procedure two case study fixed jacket offshore platforms were modeled in the opensees finite element software a comprehensive statistical study was conducted to investigate the effects of the higher modes then the results of the proposed pushover analysis were compared with the average seismic demands obtained from the nonlinear time history analysis the nrh analyses were performed using an ensemble of ground motion records scaled to the ductility level earthquake the conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the conventional pushover results revealed that the first mode leads to the buckling of the upper story levels the jacket whereas the second mode causes the lower story levels to buckle in both of the considered platforms this observation is in contrast to the common responses of the frame buildings 2 a careful investigation on the response spectra of some specific records showed that the seismic demands at various parts of the platforms are in close agreement with the spectral shape of the records records with negative epsilon tend to cause strong nonlinearity in all the platform parts while the positive epsilon records do not excite the platform significantly moreover the records with large spectral values at shorter periods tend to mainly excite the foundation part as well as the lower braced story levels of the jacket this special behavior of the foundation part under the earthquake loading has not been reported in the literature in contrast the larger s a values at periods greater than t1 cause stronger inelastic responses of the jtops at the upper story levels of the jacket 3 the anderson darling ad goodness of fit test and the kernel density function as a non parametric approach showed that the seismic demands follow a lognormal distribution not only at the braced story levels of the jacket but also at the foundation part where the higher modes dominate the maximum responses this is because a carefully selected ensemble of earthquake records could give rise to an appropriate assessment of the anticipated the reported lognormal drift demands in other structures seismic performance the utilized record selection algorithm in this study is on the basis of the empirically verified observation that the set of logarithmic spectral values lns a at different periods is a random vector that has a multivariate normal distribution baker and jayaram 2008 4 the statistical study between the spectral values at the second and third mode periods and the seismic drifts revealed that the higher mode spectral accelerations of the records have a systematic correlation with the seismic demands at the foundation part and the lower part of the jacket this finding indicates that the higher modes of responses do have a distinct effect on the seismic responses of jacket offshore platforms 5 the notable effects of the higher modes may be attributed to this fact that considering the soil pile structure interaction may increase the flexibility of the platform models increasing the influences of the higher modes therefore the soil pile structure interaction is recommended to be modeled as accurately as possible to capture all modes of vibration under an earthquake loading 6 the seismic demands predicted by the first mode load pattern are in good agreement with the benchmark dynamic analysis at the upper part of the jacket however the results obtained by this load pattern significantly differ from those of the benchmark analysis at the lower story levels of the jacket and at the foundation part therefore a conventional pushover analysis with only the first mode of vibration fails to predict the true seismic demands and it is necessary to develop an enhanced pushover procedure to take into account the higher mode effects 7 it was shown that the proposed formulation for the modal drifts improves the accuracy of the mn2 method at the pile foundation and lower braced story levels of the jacket moreover the seismic drift demands predicted by the proposed mn2 method were in excellent agreement with the benchmark nrh results along the height of the platforms on the other hand the results of the extended n2 method were underestimated at the foundation part and were overestimated at the mid story levels of the jacket consequently the mn2 procedure was proposed as a rigorous approach for the use in the seismic demand evaluation of jacket type offshore platforms under the effects of ductility level earthquakes it is noteworthy to mention that the conclusions drawn in the current study have been obtained for two prevalent configurations of jacket offshore platforms in the persian gulf however another study would better to be conducted for other different jtop configurations in order to generalize the results credit authorship contribution statement mohamad zarrin conceptualization methodology software investigation writing original draft writing review

21185,the static pushover analysis can be employed to check the adequate ductility of jacket type offshore platforms jtops under the abnormal level earthquake ale in the design phase the conventional pushover analysis suffers from different inherent limitations such as disregarding the higher mode effects in this paper it is intended to develop an advanced pushover procedure for the seismic design of jtops to this end a multi mode n2 mn2 pushover procedure is proposed that modifies the srss modal combination rule in the extended n2 procedure the proposed procedure utilizes several modes of vibration to increase the accuracy of the method the presented procedure is applied to two case study jtop structures for the ductility level seismic performance evaluation the seismic demands obtained by the mn2 procedure is compared with the average results of the benchmark nonlinear response history nrh analyses conducted using a suite of far field ground motion records scaled to the ale design response spectrum the results of a statistical study show that there is a strong correlation between the spectral values of the records at the shorter periods of jtops and the responses of the foundation and the lower braced story levels of the jacket which emphasize the important effects of the higher modes on the seismic demands of jtops if considering soil pile structure interaction the utilized formulation for the modal combination is shown to improve the accuracy of the mn2 method at the pile foundation and at the lower braced story levels of the jacket moreover the seismic drift demands predicted by the proposed mn2 method are in excellent agreement with the benchmark nrh results along the height of the platforms considering the simplicity and ease of application this method can be utilized as a useful tool for checking the design ductility level earthquake keywords earthquake design check modal response seismic demands soil pile structure interaction extended n2 pushover 1 introduction the nonlinear static procedure nsp has gained prominence in recent years as an alternative tool for estimating the seismic demands of structures responding in the nonlinear range the simplicity ease of use and the low computational efforts make the pushover procedure more popular among the structural engineers nevertheless the primary versions of the pushover procedure lack the ability to take the higher modes effect into account krawinkler and seneviratna 1998 chopra and goel 2002 according to api rp 2eq iso 19901 2 2004 e 2014 the nsp analysis can be utilized to evaluate that jacket type offshore platforms jtops has adequate reserve strength and ductility capacity under the abnormal level earthquake ale loads the utilization of the pushover analysis for evaluating the ductility and energy capacity of jacket offshore platforms abdel raheem 2014 was firstly described by kallaby and millan 1975 where a modal lateral load pattern representing the strength level earthquake shear forces is monotonically increased to push the structure into the inelastic ranges of response golafshani et al 2009 applied the fema 2000 based seismic performance assessments of a case study fixed platform using the pushover analysis they utilized a uniform distribution of the earthquake loads elsayed et al 2014 computed a case study fixed offshore platform ultimate base shear resistance via using the static pushover analysis to derive a resistance variable for reliability analysis the first mode loads were applied progressively until the platform failure was reached el din and kim 2015 carried out the pushover and incremental dynamic analyses to evaluate the seismic performance of a typical fixed base jacket structure to compare the various bracing configurations yang et al 2017 proposed some simplified procedures using the static pushover analysis to perform a rapid assessment of the seismic collapse resistance of jacket offshore platforms in terms of the collapse margin ratio in bea 1991 sharifian et al 2015 abyani et al 2017 asgarian et al 2018 the nonlinear static or dynamic analyses revealed that the failure of the platform is initiated from the foundation part according to this literature survey almost all of these studies utilized the first mode lateral load pattern or the uniform load pattern in the pushover analysis neglecting the effects of the higher modes in the demands predicted in order to overcome the foregoing shortcomings of the conventional pushover procedure several research endeavors have been conducted to develop enhanced pushover procedures chopra and goel 2002 sucuoglu and selim gunay 2011 fragiadakis and vamvatsikos 2010 the modal pushover analysis mpa proposed by chopra and goel 2002 is one of the most famous pushover procedures which is based on the structural dynamics theory in this method some pushover analyses with an invariant lateral load distribution according to the elastic mode shapes of the structure are performed separately then the final seismic demands are determined by combining the peak modal response quantities using the quadratic modal combination rules such as the square root of sum of squares srss or the complete quadratic combination cqc the extended n2 method proposed by kreslin and fajfar 2011 is one of the conceptually robust enhanced pushover procedures which takes into account the effects of higher modes on the responses in the extended n2 method it is assumed that the building remains elastic when vibrating in the higher modes this method is successful in appropriately predicting the seismic demands several other research studies have also been carried out in recent years to take the higher modes effect into account jan et al 2004 poursha et al 2009 khoshnoudian et al 2012 poursha and amini 2015 vafaee and saffari 2017 apart from the force based pushover procedures mentioned above some attempts have also been done in recent years to propose the displacement based pushover approaches sahraei and behnamfar 2014 behnamfar et al 2016 amini and poursha 2016 jalilkhani et al 2020 in these procedures the lateral load patterns are based on the deformations rather than the forces in order to consider the higher mode effect and changes in the modal properties of the structure in the nonlinear region several adaptive pushover procedures were also developed antoniou and pinho 2004a 2004b shakeri et al 2010 abbasnia et al 2013 amini and poursha 2018 since the lateral load pattern must be updated instantly an adaptive solution requires an eigenvalue analysis at each loading increment this process brings about an additional computational effort which reduces the attractiveness of adaptive pushover methods consequently the non adaptive pushover algorithm is more practical than the adaptive one and can be easily used in practice as highlighted above the conventional pushover analysis has only been utilized for the preliminary response evaluation of jacket offshore structures in the previous research studies which has some inherent limitations in light of this limitation the main purpose of this paper is to develop an enhanced pushover procedure for the seismic design of jtops to this end a multi mode n2 mn2 pushover procedure is proposed that modifies the srss modal combination rule in the extended n2 procedure kreslin and fajfar 2011 the proposed procedure utilizes several modes of vibration to increase the accuracy of the method the main advantages of the proposed pushover procedure are classified as 1 the effects of higher modes in estimating the seismic demands of jtops can be taken into consideration using the presented modal formulation for computing the drifts 2 the mn2 pushover method is capable of considering the algebraic sign sign reversal of the higher modes contrary to the extended n2 method 3 the proposed procedure only requires one conventional pushover analysis along with the standard modal analysis which requires less computational effort and analysis time than the other enhanced adaptive and non adaptive pushover procedures 4 the basic concept of the mn2 pushover is based on the common response spectrum analysis which is familiar for both the civil engineers and the researchers moreover the response spectrum tool is available in many civil engineering software used in practice to show the accuracy of the presented procedure it is applied to two case study jtop structures for the ductility level seismic performance evaluation the seismic demands obtained by the mn2 procedure is compared with the average results of the benchmark nonlinear response history analyses conducted using a suite of far field ground motion records these records are scaled to the ale design response spectrum also a comprehensive statistical study is presented to investigate the effects of higher modes on the seismic responses of the jtop structures the mn2 pushover method can be employed during the design phase to check the ductility adequacy of jtop structures under ale this method may be utilized to check whether a special demand limit state has been exceeded an acceptance criterion or not under the ductility level earthquake moreover the distribution of the drift demands along the platform height can be obtained by this method to determine the week links in order to rectify the strength and stiffness irregularities and more uniformly distribute the nonlinear demands along the platform height 2 the algorithm of the proposed approach in the extended n2 method kreslin and fajfar 2011 the effects of higher modes are taken into consideration assuming that the structure remains in the elastic range when vibrating in the higher modes and a standard modal analysis is performed for this purpose the srss rule for the combination of different modes is applied in the extended n2 method therefore the effects of sign inversion in the story displacements due to the contribution of higher modes are ignored the application of the srss modal combination rule has some limitations because there are instances in the dynamic response analysis where the inversion of the sign of story forces does occur antoniou and pinho 2004b in the current study the modal combination rule in the extended n2 procedure is modified to improve the accuracy of the predicted seismic demands thus the maximum story displacements corresponding to the nth mode is calculated according to the following equation 1 d n γ n φ n sd n ξ n t n where φ n is the nth mode shape vector γ n is the corresponding modal participating factor sd n is the spectral displacement for a given earthquake ground motion and t n and ζ n are the vibration period of the structure and the damping ratio associated with the nth mode respectively using sd n the effects of the frequency content of the earthquake records can be considered in the demand evaluation indeed this is a weighting factor to determine the contribution factor of each mode to the total response in this paper in order to surpass the shortcomings of the quadratic modal combination technique the displacements are combined by algebraically adding the modal displacements therefore the combined story displacements d k are computed as 2 d k i 1 k d i i 1 k γ i φ i sd i ξ i t i where k is the number of modes considered in the elastic response spectrum analysis to take the higher mode effects into consideration it should be noted that the absolute value of the modal participation factor is used in this equation to achieve the appropriate contribution of each mode to the displacement demands vector this assumption makes the highest level component in the displacement vectors of different modes be in the same direction therefore the combined displacement at the control node cn where the mode shapes are normalized with reference to is computed using the following equation 3 d k cn i 1 k d i cn i 1 k γ i sd i ζ i t i according to eq 1 the story drift of the nth mode at the story level j is determined as 4 dr n j γ n φ n j φ n j 1 h j sd n ζ n t n the combined story drifts using the first k modes are computed using the following expression 5 dr k j i 1 k γ i φ i j φ i j 1 h j sd i ζ i t i where h j is the height of story level j it is worth noting that the sign of γ n is retained in this equation to ensure that the drift components at the story levels where the higher modes control the responses be in the positive direction this assumption is shown in the next sections to improve the accuracy of the proposed pushover analysis at the pile foundation part and the lower story levels of the jacket however the sign reversal of the higher modes is still captured and affects the drift demands in the mid story levels of the jtop the absolute value of γ n in eq 5 is recommended to be used for the application of the mn2 method for building frames herein in order to determine the number of modes participating in the seismic demands it is suggested to use several modes such that the sum of their effective modal participating mass ratios α n is at least 90 since several modes are considered in the derivation of the seismic demands the method proposed in this study using the n2 approach is named the multi mode n2 mn2 method a detailed step by step implementation of the mn2 procedure is presented as follows 1 perform the eigen analysis of the linearly elastic structure of the jtop to obtain the natural periods of vibration tn mode shapes n and other required modal properties the mode shapes are normalized in such a way that n at the control node equals unity m 1 the uppermost node of the deck or the top of the jacket node may be considered as the control node 2 determine the total target displacement at the control node δ t using the mean of the nonlinear response history analyses the capacity spectrum method the displacement coefficient method or the other proposed approaches in the previous research studies amini and poursha 2016 abbasnia et al 2013 3 perform a conventional pushover analysis with an appropriate invariant load pattern until the control node reaches δ t this can be done using the basic n2 pushover method fajfar and fischinger 1998 or the pushover analysis based on the first mode of vibration 4 determine the number of required modes k using the following equation 6 i 1 k α i 0 9 5 carry out the standard elastic response spectrum analysis and compute the combined displacement at the control node d k c n using eq 3 then calculate the normalization factor nf disp as 7 nf disp δ t d k c n 6 calculate the story drift ratios at each story level using eq 5 and multiply the results by nf disp 7 to derive the final story drift profile envelope the drift ratios obtained in step 3 conventional pushover analysis results and step 6 the normalized elastic modal analysis results 8 to obtain the other local response quantities compute a correction factor for each story level cf drift via dividing the drift of that story level determined from step 7 by that of the pushover analysis in step 3 the cf drift values can be applied to all the local deformation quantities e g rotations obtained from the pushover analysis of step 3 the correction factors cf drift for story drifts are also used in computing the internal forces of members in the condition that the internal forces are lower than the load carrying capacity of the corresponding element in a case that the internal force demands exceed the capacity the internal forces can be determined using deformations considering the associated force deformation relationship kreslin and fajfar 2011 3 description of the case study platforms in order to investigate the accuracy of the proposed pushover analysis the spq1 and spd19c platforms in the persian gulf at water depths of 65 3 m and 77 5 m respectively are considered the platforms have four legs supported by 8 skirt piles and 4 pile through legs driven to 61 m and 103 m depths in the spq1 and spd19c platforms respectively the utilized lateral resisting systems of the jacket are chevron bracing and x bracing types for these platforms see fig 1 the diameter of the piles is 1 52 m and their wall thickness equal to 0 089 m at the upper parts of the pile for the spd19c platform whereas the pile diameter and its wall thickness are 1 52 m and 0 076 m for the spq1 platform respectively the spd19c platform has a typical configuration which represents many jtops installed in the persian gulf asgarian and agheshlui 2009 asgarian and lesani 2009 golafshani et al 2011 zeinoddini et al 2012 vazirizade et al 2020 or in other offshore regions of the world elsayed et al 2014 bai et al 2015 the same configuration as the spq1 platform has also been utilized in the previous research studies bazzurro and cornell 1994 golafshani and gholizad 2009 the overall mass of the deck is 6230 ton and 5822 ton for spd19c and spq1 platforms respectively which comprised of the dead weight of the topside and all the relevant equipment as well as twenty percent of the live loads all the primary secondary and the nonstructural masses of the jacket structure along with the entrapped water of the flooded members and added mass for all the members below the sea level are assigned as lumped masses to the nearest joint in the created numerical model this helps to achieve an accurate distribution of jacket masses the platforms are designed in compliance with the requirements of iso 19902 2007 e 2007 and api rp 2eq iso 19901 2 2004 e 2014 for seismic performance also some additional guidelines are considered in agreement with the 22nd edition of api 2a wsd 2014 according to iso 19902 2007 e 2007 the design procedure is based on the lrfd structural design criteria the ele earthquake event is satisfied during the design phase using the linear response spectrum analysis method to ensure that the platforms have adequate strength the three orthogonal components of the earthquake ground motions are combined linearly such that one component is at its maximum value whereas the other two components are at 40 percent of their respective maximum values api rp 2eq iso 19901 2 2004 e 2014 generic seismic maps of the spectral accelerations for offshore areas of the world presented in api 2eq iso 19901 2 2004 e 2014 are used to construct the ele and ale response spectra to this end the site ale acceleration response spectrum for 2500 years return period is derived by multiplying the site 1000 years spectrum by a scale factor nale equal to 1 6 for the l1 structure exposure level in order to obtain the site ele response spectrum the ale spectrum is divided by a seismic reserve capacity factor cr equal to 1 85 for both of the platforms this factor represents a structure s ability to sustain ground vibrations severe than the ele the adopted value is lower than 2 8 limit for the l1 platforms and 2 limit for the non ductile design defined in iso 19902 2007 e 2007 the full description of the design procedure for the case study models is presented in zarrin et al 2020 these platforms are selected for evaluation purposes of the proposed advanced pushover method because they utilize different bracing types and the height of the platforms are different whereas their other properties are approximately the same moreover the skirt piles have been utilized in the spq1 platform instead of the pile through leg scheme in the spd19c platform hence the effects of the bracing type the structural height and foundation type on the accuracy of the proposed mn2 procedure can be assessed 4 details of the numerical model an elaborated 2d numerical model of the two case study platforms is developed in opensees finite element software mazzoni et al 2007 see fig 2 the same modeling procedures as comprehensively described in the previous research studies of the first author sharifian et al 2015 zarrin et al 2018 2020 asgarian et al 2018 abyani et al 2019a b are utilized in the current study herein only a brief description of the numerical model is discussed a 2d model is utilized in this study for the ease of simplicity and interpretation the size of the horizontal members in the jacket and deck part of the utilized 2d model is defined based on the half of the equivalent stiffness of the whole horizontal framings in the 3d model the legs braces and piles are the same in both the 2d and 3d models the periods of vibration of the 2d model is consistent with that of the 3d model the pile jacket and topside structural members are modeled using a very well formulated distributed plasticity beam column element based on the force formulation spacone et al 1996 the cross section of the members is modeled using the fiber discretization approach the menegotto pinto steel material model menegotto and pinto 1973 is utilized to simulate the stress strain behavior of the fibers which considers the baushinger effects the large displacement effects are incorporated into the numerical model using the efficient co rotational formulation de souza 2000 an initial imperfection equal to 1 1000 of brace length is introduced to the mid span node of the braces to include the buckling capability of the braces every brace segment leg and horizontal frame member is modeled with 10 force based elements the efficiency of the force based elements in simulating the buckling post buckling and hysteretic behavior of tubular members has been verified with experimental tests in many research endeavors asgarian et al 2005 alangari et al 2009 vaezi and zarrin 2020 the soil pile structure interaction problem is simulated utilizing the beam on nonlinear winkler foundation bnwf method the pysimple1 tzsimple1 and qzsimple1 uniaxial materials boulanger et al 1999 are used to model the near field soil lateral bearing skin friction and end bearing the pysimple1 material can take into account the opened gap radiation damping and the stiffness deterioration of the soil hysteretic response boulanger et al 1999 the procedure of modeling the soil pile structure interaction in the current study is verified with available experimental tests in the previous research works of the first author zarrin et al 2017 asgarian et al 2013 5 ensemble of the ground motions 20 far field ground motion records are selected from a 40 record ensemble prepared for the pacific earthquake engineering research center s peer transportation research program baker et al 2011 the original peer record ensemble has a wide variety of spectral shapes which introduces a large and uniform standard deviation over a wide period range of interest the later feature guarantees that the record suite excites a structure in different ways capturing the inherent randomness of the earthquake ground vibrations the median and log standard deviations of the horizontal response spectra of the selected suite match a scenario earthquake with magnitude 7 strike slip earthquake at a distance of 10 km recorded on the soil sites the average shear wave velocity in the top portion of the soil vs30 in the selected records is in agreement with the soil site of the case study jtops the geomean zarrin et al 2019 abyani et al 2019a b and the log standard deviation of the selected 20 records are in close agreement with those of the original 40 record ensemble see fig 3 the nga record sequence numbers rsn of the record set are tabulated in table 1 the fault normal components of the records are used baker et al 2011 6 results and discussion 6 1 conventional pushover analysis results in order to shed light on the response characteristics of the platforms the results obtained by the pushover analysis with the load patterns of the first two modes are presented first depicted in fig 4 a and b are the first and second mode pushover curves for the spq1 platform the deflected shape of the platform corresponding to some key points of the response is also illustrated in this figure as seen several strength losses are observed in the first mode pushover curve corresponding to the buckling of the upper two braced story levels whereas the buckling of the lowermost braced story level leads to sudden drop in the strength in the second mode pushover curve fig 4 c and d show the first and second mode pushover curves of the spd19c platform similar to the spq1 behavior the buckling of the braces at the upper two braced story levels changes the slope of the first mode pushover curve while the second mode pushover curve becomes inelastic when the first braced story level buckles according to this figure it is apparent that the spq1 platform shows a brittle behavior in which some sudden drops in the force displacement curves are observed the reasons behind this behavior can be due to the chevron bracing type of the spq1 jacket rather than the x type bracing of the spd19c platform along with the battered leg in the spd19c platform similar results have been reported in the previous research studies that the failure of the platform is initiated from the upper part of the jacket gates et al 1977 bazzurro and cornell 1994 asgarian and agheshlui 2009 golafshani et al 2009 el din and kim 2015 when subjecting the platform to the first mode load pattern gates et al 1977 asgarian and agheshlui 2009 sharifian et al 2015 elsayed et al 2014 yang et al 2017 or to the uniform load distribution golafshani et al 2009 6 2 modal characteristics of the platforms in this section it is intended to compare the fundamental modal features of the fixed jacket offshore platforms in order to gain some insights into the major dynamic response characteristics the modal properties of the two case study platforms are tabulated in table 2 according to this table the values of α n for the first two modes of the spq1 platform are lower than those for the spd19c platform implying that more modes are required for α n in the case of the spq1 to achieve 90 of the total seismic mass of the structure see eq 6 according to this table 5 and 4 modes should be considered for the spq1 and spd19c platforms respectively to achieve 90 of the total seismic mass of the structure in table 2 the values of γ i are presented for two different cases with regard to the node considered as the control node that is the reference node to which the mode shapes are normalized that is the values of γ i are once determined by taking the top most node of the topside as the control node and they are computed once again by considering the top node of the jacket as the control node as seen the values of the modal participation factor are different for these two cases because they are dependent on how the modes are normalized chopra 2001 fig 5 a and b show the first six mode shapes over the height of the spq1 platform for the two control node cases as seen in fig 5 a the mode shape values of modes 2 and 6 at the pile head elevation 78 5 m where the higher modes significantly influence the maximum responses are negative similarly the mode shape values of modes 3 and 5 at this region are negative when the mode shapes are normalized with respect to the top of the jacket node see fig 5 b moreover the values of γ i are negative for modes 2 and 6 when the mode shapes are normalized with respect to the topside node and are negative for modes 3 and 5 in the case of normalizing the mode shapes with respect to the top of the jacket node in order to improve the accuracy of the seismic demand evaluation for the proposed pushover at the pile foundation and the lower story levels of the jacket the sign of γ i for these modes is retained in eq 4 for the drift evaluation therefore regarding fig 5 a and b and table 2 the drifts derived by this equation for all the considered modes at the pile foundation have a positive sign which lead to the absolutely additive nature of the drifts predicted using eq 5 for the k number of modes considered in other words the multiplication of the negative mode shape values by the negative values of γ i at the pile foundation in the mentioned modes in eq 4 leads to the positive modal drifts note to the positive value of the modal story drifts at the pile foundation of the spq1 platform in fig 6 a and b for all the considered modes also the modal drift values are positive only for the first three modes at the first braced story level of the jacket on the other hand the modal drift values for modes 3 and 4 at the second braced story level are negative effect of sign reversal leading to the improvement of the accuracy of the proposed method as is discussed in section 8 3 the comparison of fig 6 a and b demonstrates that the modal drift values computed based on eq 4 are independent of how the mode shapes are normalized similar modal results as reported for the spq1 platform are observed for the spd19c platform depicted in fig 7 a and b are the mode shapes when they are normalized to the top of the jacket node and the modal drift ratios of this platform respectively as seen in fig 7 b positive drift ratios are predicted at the pile foundation for all the considered modes also the drift values in some of the higher modes are negative at the first and second braced storey levels of the jacket implying the effects of the sign reversal phenomenon in eq 4 6 3 investigation on the higher mode effects via a statistical study in this section it is intended to comprehensively investigate the effects of higher modes on the seismic responses of the jtop structures the nrh analysis is performed for the two platforms using the ground motion suite described earlier for each of the records the desired peak responses are obtained from the results of the nrh analyses in this study the main response quantity is the story like drift ratio over the platform height the drift ratio has been considered as a measure of damage in many research endeavors of fixed offshore platforms golafshani et al 2009 el din and kim 2014 2015 sharifian et al 2015 abyani et al 2017 zarrin et al 2018 limiting the drift ratio in the jacket story levels reduces the structural damages such as brace buckling horizontal frame element buckling pile yielding and non structural damages such as damage to the j tubes conductors and conductor framings fig 8 depicts the height wise variation of the maximum drift ratios obtained from the benchmark nrh analysis for all the 20 records as seen a notable dispersion in the seismic demands is observed in both of the platforms for instance the drift ratio at the upper part of the foundation changes from 0 62 to 2 17 and from 0 41 to 1 51 for the spd19c and spq1 platforms respectively these variations indicate the effects of the inherent randomness aleatoric uncertainty of the earthquake ground motions on the seismic responses of the jtops in order to explore the relation between the drift demands in the various parts of the platform and the characteristics of the response spectra of the selected record suite the seismic demands under the effects of several specific records are investigated in detail fig 9 a illustrates the response spectra of records 1 2 6 11 18 and 19 scaled to the spectral acceleration pseudo acceleration value at the first mode period s a t1 of the spd19c platform moreover fig 10 a shows the height wise variation of the drift ratios for this platform subjected to these records according to fig 9 a the spectral values s a for records 1 and 6 are larger than those of the geometric mean of the 20 record set at the period range between the first and third mode periods the range of the higher mode periods on the other hand the s a values are almost smaller and equal to the geometric mean spectrum in the periods longer than the first mode period t1 for records 1 and 6 respectively it is worth mentioning that when the nonlinear excursions occur in structures the lateral stiffness decrease thus resulting effectively in period elongation of structures as seen in fig 10 a the drift ratios for these records are relatively large at the foundation which are greater than those at the unbraced story level beneath the deck from elevation 5 75 m 13 75 m this finding implies that the records with large spectral values at the higher mode periods excite the lower braced story level of the jacket and the foundation part more significantly note that because the spectral values of record 6 are greater than those of record 1 at periods larger than 2t1 its drift demand is higher at the unbraced story level beneath the deck according to fig 9 a the spectral values of records 2 and 11 at the higher mode periods range and the periods longer than t1 are larger than the geometric mean spectrum in other words the response spectra of these records have a valley in t1 implying that these records have a negative epsilon ε value at t1 ε measures the difference between s a for an as recorded earthquake and the geometric mean s a computed using an attenuation relationship at a specific period baker and jayaram 2008 the ε parameter is a characteristic of an earthquake record and has been identified as an indicator of spectral shape near t1 records with positive ε tend to have a peak spectral shape records 18 and 19 in fig 9 a whereas records with negative ε tend to have a valley spectral shape records 2 and 11 in fig 9 a as seen in fig 10 a records 2 and 11 with negative ε value significantly excite the platform at both the upper part of the jacket and the foundation whereas records 18 and 19 with positive ε value less strongly excite all the platform levels the similar results are observed for the spq1 platform according to fig 10 b the platform does not experience significant nonlinearities under the effects of records 10 and 18 with positive ε values while record 11 with negative ε value leads to the most severe responses among all the records note to record 9 with the s a values lower than the geometric mean spectrum at periods shorter than t1 and higher than the geometric mean spectrum at periods longer than t1 this record excites the upper story levels of the jacket while it does not excite the foundation part significantly the opposite results are obtained for records 3 and 6 see figs 9 b and 10 b from the above discussion it can be concluded that the larger s a values at shorter periods near the second and third mode periods denoted by t2 and t3 respectively more strongly excite the lower braced story levels of the jacket and the foundation part this indicates the effects of the higher mode responses on jacket offshore platforms in contrast the larger s a values at the periods longer than t1 cause stronger inelastic responses of the jtops at the upper story levels of the jacket in order to systematically explore the above presented conclusions in the following a detailed statistical study is presented to investigate the effects of the first mode and the higher modes on the dynamic responses of the jtops the first step is to pursue whether the responses follow a systematic distribution type or not to this end it is intended to determine the appropriate probability density function pd for the drift values utilizing two statistical procedures as discussed in more details in the following two different one component probability distributions i e normal and lognormal ones are evaluated using a goodness of fit test and a non parametric model anderson darling ad test is one of the most powerful goodness of fit tests anderson and darling 1954 based on the empirical distribution function edf the ad test is more sensitive to deviations in the tails of distributions consequently the ad test statistic or correspondingly its p value could be considered as a strong criterion for comparing the hypothesized distributions with a significant emphasis on the distribution tails the ad p values are tabulated in table 3 for the two cases of the drift values i e at the unbraced story level beneath the deck and at the pile head for the spd19c model and at the uppermost braced story level of the jacket and at the pile head for the spq1 model considering the significance level α 0 05 since all the p values are greater than α none of the hypothesized distributions is rejected by ad goodness of fit test generally the greater ad test p values or equally the smaller ad test statistics can show smaller average differences of the hypothesized cdf and the empirical cdf over the whole range of data as seen in table 3 the lognormal p values are larger than those of the normal distribution in all the considered cases moreover kernel density function as a non parametric approach is used to compare the efficiency of each aforementioned pdf for an arbitrary random variable x with the sample values x 1 x 2 x 3 x n the kernel density estimator f ˆ is defined as 8 f ˆ x h 1 n h i 1 n k x x i h in this equation k and h represent the kernel function and the bandwidth parameter respectively the considered kernel function for this study is the so called gaussian function defined by the following equation 9 k x x i h 1 2 π exp x x i 2 2 h 2 in this regard finding the optimal value for the bandwidth parameter is a challenging problem as it controls the smoothness of the density function ouarda et al 2015 to this end the mean integrated squared error mise could be used to derive the optimal value of h 10 m i s e h e f ˆ x h f x 2 d x where f x is the analytical pdf and e is the expected value operator the qualitative comparison between the analytical pdfs and the kernel functions is illustrated in fig 11 as seen the lognormal distribution fits well with the kernel density function at both the upper part of the jacket where the first mode mainly controls the maximum responses and at the foundation where the higher modes dominate the seismic drifts the seismic drifts were shown to follow a lognormal distribution for the frame buildings in the previous research studies romao et al 2013 the observed lognormal distribution for the seismic demands of the jtops is a result of a carefully selected earthquake records based on an approach which matches the selected records with a target response spectrum mean and variance as it is not much easy to qualitatively compare these pdf fits the root mean square error rmse between the kernel function and each estimated pdf r m s e p d f can be computed by eq 11 and is tabulated in table 4 11 r m s e p d f i 1 n f ˆ x i h f x i 2 n where n is the number of data points n 20 in this paper according to this table the lognormal distribution better fits the data because of showing lower r m s e p d f values as another step to investigate the effects of higher modes the correlation between the s a values at the second and third mode periods and the seismic demands is investigated fig 12 a and b show the line fitted to the data obtained from a linear regression between 20 values of s a t 2 and once the drifts at the pile head and the other time the drifts at the unbraced story level beneath the deck respectively for the spd19c model also the equation of the fitted line and the correlation coefficient cc between these two data points are demonstrated on each subplot as is evident the s a t 2 values are somewhat linearly correlated with the drift demands at the foundation while both the cc and the line slope values significantly decrease in the case of the drifts at the unbraced story level beneath the deck moreover fig 12 c and d indicate that a high correlation coefficient is also observed between the s a t 3 values and the foundation drifts whereas they do not have any correlation with the upper part of the jacket drifts similar observations can be deduced from fig 13 for the spq1 platform these findings provide strong statistical evidences that the higher modes have distinct effects on the jtop responses moreover this statistical study approves the above mentioned discussion in the conventional pushover section and the discussion presented at the beginning of this section that the higher modes of vibration mainly affect the seismic drifts at the foundation and the lower braced story levels of the jacket 6 4 the proposed mn2 procedure results the mean values of nrh responses over all the records are considered as the benchmark responses therefore the results of the proposed pushover procedure are compared with the benchmark results moreover the results of some pushover procedures such as the first mode pushover and the extended n2 method are also compared for evaluation purposes in the conventional first mode pushover the structural models are pushed to the average displacements computed from the nrh results which are equal to 0 42 m and 0 634 m for the spd19c and spq1 platforms respectively as emphasized in the conventional pushover analysis results the lower average dynamic displacement of the spd19c is attributed to the more ductile bracing type of this platform together with the battered legs in this model figs 14 16 compare the height wise variation of the maximum drift ratios obtained from the first mode and the enhanced pushover analyses with the results of the benchmark nrh analysis refer to fig 2 for the platform height profile and the elevations of the story levels as mentioned earlier the maximum demands at the upper story levels of the jacket are mainly controlled by the first mode pushover analysis in both of the platforms according to these figures a fairly good agreement is observed between the first mode pushover and the nrh results at the upper three stories of the jacket in both of the platforms the results for the spq1 platform are presented for the two cases of the control node it is noteworthy that the benchmark nrh displacements are also recorded in these control nodes a comparison of fig 14 a and b indicates that when the top of the jacket node is used as the node for controlling the displacements the accuracy of the first mode pushover in estimating the seismic responses increases the reason lies in the fact that the topside in the jtops mainly responds linearly and the nonlinear deformations are mostly concentrated in the jacket and foundation parts therefore transferring the control node from the uppermost node of the topside to the top of the jacket node may lead to a more realistic estimation of the seismic demands at the upper story levels of the jacket considering this finding further discussions are only presented for the case that the displacement is controlled at the top of the jacket node for both of the platforms the results of the elastic modal analysis in the mn2 and the extended n2 methods are presented in figs 14 16 considering 2 to 6 modes for the spq1 platform and 2 to 5 modes for the spd19c platform as seen in figs 14 and 16 a considering more modes in the mn2 method incrementally improves the prediction of the seismic demands at the pile foundation for both of the models due to the additive nature of eq 5 for the pile part as highlighted previously at the second braced story level elevations 32 m and 13 m in the spq1 and spd19c platforms respectively considering only 2 modes overestimates the drift demands in both of the platforms however when considering more than 2 modes in the mn2 method the sign reversal of the higher modes in this story decreases the drift demand leading to the best accuracy in the case of considering 6 and 5 modes for the spq1 and spd19c platforms respectively this can be deduced referring to figs 6 b and 7 b and observing that the modal drift ratios of modes 3 and 4 calculated based on eq 4 are negative in this story level it is interesting to note that considering more than 2 modes at the first braced story level of the jacket does not notably change the drift prediction because the modal drifts for the higher modes is very small relative to those of the first two modes on the other hand according to figs 15 and 16 b considering more than 2 modes in the elastic modal analysis of the extended n2 method does not improve the seismic demand estimations at all the final results of the mn2 and the extended n2 methods calculated via enveloping the results obtained by the multi mode analysis and the first mode pushover analysis are depicted in fig 17 as seen the mn2 pushover method provides excellent estimation of the seismic drift demands over the whole platforms height whereas the extended n2 method significantly underestimates the results at the foundation part of the jacket in both of the platforms furthermore the accuracy of the mn2 method is more than the extended n2 method at the third and second braced story levels of the spq1 and spd19c platforms respectively 7 conclusion a multi mode n2 mn2 procedure was proposed to revise the srss modal combination rule in the extended n2 method so that the sign reversal is considered in the modal combination the relevant modes are selected such that the sum of their effective modal participating mass ratios is at least 90 to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed pushover procedure two case study fixed jacket offshore platforms were modeled in the opensees finite element software a comprehensive statistical study was conducted to investigate the effects of the higher modes then the results of the proposed pushover analysis were compared with the average seismic demands obtained from the nonlinear time history analysis the nrh analyses were performed using an ensemble of ground motion records scaled to the ductility level earthquake the conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the conventional pushover results revealed that the first mode leads to the buckling of the upper story levels the jacket whereas the second mode causes the lower story levels to buckle in both of the considered platforms this observation is in contrast to the common responses of the frame buildings 2 a careful investigation on the response spectra of some specific records showed that the seismic demands at various parts of the platforms are in close agreement with the spectral shape of the records records with negative epsilon tend to cause strong nonlinearity in all the platform parts while the positive epsilon records do not excite the platform significantly moreover the records with large spectral values at shorter periods tend to mainly excite the foundation part as well as the lower braced story levels of the jacket this special behavior of the foundation part under the earthquake loading has not been reported in the literature in contrast the larger s a values at periods greater than t1 cause stronger inelastic responses of the jtops at the upper story levels of the jacket 3 the anderson darling ad goodness of fit test and the kernel density function as a non parametric approach showed that the seismic demands follow a lognormal distribution not only at the braced story levels of the jacket but also at the foundation part where the higher modes dominate the maximum responses this is because a carefully selected ensemble of earthquake records could give rise to an appropriate assessment of the anticipated the reported lognormal drift demands in other structures seismic performance the utilized record selection algorithm in this study is on the basis of the empirically verified observation that the set of logarithmic spectral values lns a at different periods is a random vector that has a multivariate normal distribution baker and jayaram 2008 4 the statistical study between the spectral values at the second and third mode periods and the seismic drifts revealed that the higher mode spectral accelerations of the records have a systematic correlation with the seismic demands at the foundation part and the lower part of the jacket this finding indicates that the higher modes of responses do have a distinct effect on the seismic responses of jacket offshore platforms 5 the notable effects of the higher modes may be attributed to this fact that considering the soil pile structure interaction may increase the flexibility of the platform models increasing the influences of the higher modes therefore the soil pile structure interaction is recommended to be modeled as accurately as possible to capture all modes of vibration under an earthquake loading 6 the seismic demands predicted by the first mode load pattern are in good agreement with the benchmark dynamic analysis at the upper part of the jacket however the results obtained by this load pattern significantly differ from those of the benchmark analysis at the lower story levels of the jacket and at the foundation part therefore a conventional pushover analysis with only the first mode of vibration fails to predict the true seismic demands and it is necessary to develop an enhanced pushover procedure to take into account the higher mode effects 7 it was shown that the proposed formulation for the modal drifts improves the accuracy of the mn2 method at the pile foundation and lower braced story levels of the jacket moreover the seismic drift demands predicted by the proposed mn2 method were in excellent agreement with the benchmark nrh results along the height of the platforms on the other hand the results of the extended n2 method were underestimated at the foundation part and were overestimated at the mid story levels of the jacket consequently the mn2 procedure was proposed as a rigorous approach for the use in the seismic demand evaluation of jacket type offshore platforms under the effects of ductility level earthquakes it is noteworthy to mention that the conclusions drawn in the current study have been obtained for two prevalent configurations of jacket offshore platforms in the persian gulf however another study would better to be conducted for other different jtop configurations in order to generalize the results credit authorship contribution statement mohamad zarrin conceptualization methodology software investigation writing original draft writing review

21186,this study develops new analytical solutions for oblique wave scattering by horizontal perforated plates submerged below the water free surface using a quadratic pressure drop boundary condition both kinds of submerged plates are considered a a horizontal perforated plate as an offshore breakwater b a horizontal perforated plate attached to a vertical wall as a wave absorber the velocity potential decomposition method combined with an efficient iterative algorithm is adopted to obtain the analytical solutions and the hydrodynamic parameters of engineering interest for the reflection transmission and energy loss coefficients as well as the vertical wave force are considered a new simple formula for predicting the discharge coefficient in the quadratic pressure drop condition which is critical to make the analytical solutions to be practically applicable is developed by fitting the analytical results and an amount of experimental data in literature the present analytical solutions are in good agreement with previous analytical solution for special case and the numerical results of an independently developed multi domain boundary element method solution the reflection and transmission coefficients calculated by the present analytical solutions are also in good agreement with experimental data when adopting a well predicted discharge coefficient the present analytical solutions are valuable for fast assessing the hydrodynamic performance of horizontal perforated plates in the initial stage of engineering design the present analytical model can also be readily extended to the multi layer horizontal perforated plates and similar structures keywords horizontal perforated plate quadratic pressure drop discharge coefficient velocity potential decomposition analytical solution reflection coefficient transmission coefficient 1 introduction the horizontal perforated thin plate is a simple coastal structure with small vertical wave forces the horizontal perforated plate can be installed by piles or anchor chains which only requires a low bearing capacity of the seabed moreover the free exchange of seawater through the horizontal perforated plate can meet the requirements of ecological coastal engineering because the wave energy is mainly concentrated near the free water surface the horizontal perforated plate has good wave dissipating performance when it is placed near the water surface all above shows that the horizontal perforated plate has great potential in practical coastal engineering applications some researchers have verified the superiority of the horizontal perforated plate used as an offshore breakwater or attached to a vertical wall as a wave absorber yu 2002 summarized the functional performance of a submerged and essentially horizontal plate for mitigating severe wave attack on offshore and coastal facilities wu et al 1998 showed that a horizontal perforated plate attached to a vertical wall could be an effective wave absorber when it had a larger plate width and suitable porosity this wave absorber was systematically studied by cho and kim 2008 based on the linear potential theory some scholars have analytically investigated the interaction of water waves with submerged horizontal perforated plates among them the linear pressure drop conditions on the perforated plate chwang 1983 yu 1995 were widely used which assumed that the pressure drop across the plate was linearly proportional to the fluid velocity across the plate by these linear boundary conditions most researchers e g chwang and wu 1994 yu 1995 wu et al 1998 liu et al 2008 cho and kim 2008 used the standard matched eigenfunction expansion method to develop analytical solutions with respect to the horizontal perforated plates this method utilized the boundary conditions on the free surface seabed surface and plate surface to obtain the series expressions of the potential functions above and below the perforated plate and thus the complex dispersion relations of wave motion over the perforated plate were encountered such a solution method inevitably needed to solve the complex dispersion relations due to the roots of the complex dispersion relations laid on the complex plane it was difficult to select reasonable initial values to find all the complex roots by iterative calculations although some scholars mciver 1998b mendez and losada 2004 bao et al 2009 have given solution methods for the complex dispersion relations there were still some obstacles to obtaining the analytical solutions for wave interactions with submerged horizontal perforated plates by standard matched eigenfunction expansions lee 1995 developed a velocity potential decomposition method to solve the heave radiation problem of a floating rectangular structure the velocity potential decomposition method constructs reasonable boundary value problems and decomposes the total velocity potential into several artificial velocity potentials therefore the complex dispersion equations were avoided and the complexity of the calculations was simplified liu and li 2011 liu et al 2012 and fang et al 2017 have used the velocity potential decomposition method to solve wave scattering by submerged horizontal perforated plates in their solutions the non homogeneous boundary value problem was separated into a horizontal homogenous boundary value problem and a vertical homogeneous boundary value problem which were solved analytically the above studies were based on the linear pressure drop condition on the perforated plate besides some scholars utilized the quadratic pressure drop law to describe the flow boundary conditions on the perforated plates mei et al 1974 considered jet flow across narrow passages and then developed a quadratic head loss term to examine long wave transmission through the perforated plate bennett et al 1992 further extended the method of mei et al 1974 to be available for transitional waves based on pipe flow molin 1992 proposed another quadratic pressure drop boundary condition on the perforated plate recently molin and remy 2015 introduced the inertial effect of the perforated plate into the quadratic pressure drop condition which was not included in the original version of molin 1992 the study of liu and li 2017 showed that for perforated wall caisson breakwaters the inertial effect was significant for estimating the optimum wave chamber width with a minimum reflection coefficient the advantage of using the quadratic pressure drop condition is that the influence of wave height on the energy dissipation by the perforated plate can be directly incorporated into the solving process for such nonlinear pressure drop boundary conditions the standard matched eigenfunction expansion method cannot work when considering wave interaction with a submerged horizontal perforated plate molin and betous 1993 expanded the normal fluid velocity across the perforated plate as a series expression by utilizing the condition that its value was zero at the plate end they further imposed the series solution of the normal fluid velocity on the perforated plate as a non homogenous boundary condition and then found the series expressions of velocity potentials above and below the perforated plate finally they determined the unknown expansion coefficients in velocity potentials by iteratively solving the quadratic pressure drop condition on the perforated plate based on the method of molin and betous 1993 molin 2001 developed an analytical solution of wave reflection by a horizontal perforated plate wave absorber attached to a vertical wall in the analytical solutions of molin and betous 1993 and molin 2011 the water waves were both normally incident using the method of molin and betous 1993 cho and kim 2013 and cho et al 2013 also developed analytical solutions for wave scattering by submerged horizontal plates but they adopted the linear pressure drop condition in the quadratic pressure drop boundary conditions molin and remy 2015 liu and li 2017 the discharge coefficient μ and the blockage coefficient c denote respectively the resistance and inertial effects of the perforated plate on fluid motion for practical applications of this boundary condition the values of the discharge coefficient and the blockage coefficient must be known a prior the blockage coefficient c can be determined by asymptotic analysis or wave diffraction analysis and has been well determined in literature newman 1969 flagg and newman 1971 taylor 1973 mei et al 1974 tuck 1975 mciver 1998a suh et al 2002 molin and remy 2015 mackay and johanning 2020 the discharge coefficient depends on the plate porosity geometry of the openings and reynolds number molin 1993 and its precise value requires specific experimental tests to determine to give a reasonable predictive formula for the discharge coefficient is valuable to practical application of the quadratic pressure drop condition liu and li 2017 vijay et al 2019 mackay and johanning 2020 molin 2011 and liu and li 2017 have recommended some values of the discharge coefficients for the perforated plates but a reasonable predictive method formula for the discharge coefficient of submerged horizontal perforated plates is still lack in the present study new analytical solutions for wave scattering by two kinds of submerged horizontal perforated plates with the quadratic pressure drop condition molin and remy 2015 liu and li 2017 are developed on the basis of the velocity potential decomposition method the solutions take into account the more general obliquely incident waves and adopt an accurate and efficient iterative algorithm to solve the quadratic nonlinear pressure drop condition meanwhile a simple and practical formula for predicting the discharge coefficient in the quadratic pressure drop condition is developed such a predictive formula is critical for the practical application of the analytical solutions in the next section the boundary value problem of wave interaction with the submerged horizontal perforated plate breakwater is formulated and solved based on the velocity potential decompositions with iterative calculations in section 3 the analytical solution of wave interaction with the wave absorber of a submerged horizontal perforated plate attached to a vertical wall is developed in section 4 the convergence of the present solutions is examined the present analytical solutions are also compared with previous analytical solution for special case liu et al 2008 and independently developed multi domain bem boundary element method solutions for the same problems in section 5 a new simple formula for predicting the discharge coefficient in the quadratic pressure drop condition is developed by fitting the analytical results and experimental data in literature in section 6 the combined influences of major parameters on the hydrodynamic quantities of horizontal perforated plates are discussed finally the main conclusions of this study are drawn 2 solution for horizontal perforated plate breakwater 2 1 mathematical formulation the idealized sketch for wave interaction with a horizontal perforated plate breakwater submerged in the ocean with constant depth h is shown in fig 1 a 3d cartesian coordinate system with the x y plane located on the still water level and the z axis in the vertical direction upwards is adopted small amplitude waves with wave height h and wavelength l approach the breakwater at an angle θ to the positive x axis the wave number k 0 has components of k 0x k 0cosθ and k 0y k 0sinθ in the x and y directions respectively the horizontal plate is located on the position of 0 x b and z a where b is the plate width and a is the submerged depth of the plate the space between the plate and the seabed is d d h a the plate length in the y direction is very large compared to the incident wavelength and thus it is assumed to be infinity the plate thickness δ is too small to compare with the water depth and the incident wavelength and thus it is assumed to be zero when considering wave scattering the whole fluid domain is divided into four sub regions sub region 1 the fluid domain at the left hand side of the plate sub region 2 the fluid domain above the plate sub region 3 the fluid domain beneath the plate and sub region 4 the fluid domain at the right hand side of the plate the fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible and that its motion is irrotational then a velocity potential φ x y z t can be used to describe the fluid motion where t is time considering linear time harmonic water waves with angular frequency ω the velocity potential can be written as φ x y z t re φ x z e i k 0 y y e i ω t where re denotes the real part of the argument φ x z denotes the complex spatial velocity potential and i 1 the complex spatial velocity potential in each sub region satisfies the modified helmholtz equation 1 2 φ j x z x 2 2 φ j x z z 2 k 0 y 2 φ j x z 0 j 1 2 3 4 where the subscript j denotes the velocity potential in sub region j on the still water level the potentials satisfy the free surface condition 2 φ j z k φ j k ω 2 g z 0 j 1 2 4 where g denotes gravity acceleration 3 on the bottom of the water the potentials satisfy the impermeable condition φ j z 0 z h j 1 3 4 the waves must be outgoing and satisfy the condition 4 lim x x k 0 x φ 4 φ r 0 where φ r is the velocity potential of reflected waves the wave energy dissipation and phase shift by the horizontal perforated plate are represented by a quadratic pressure drop condition molin 1992 molin and remy 2015 liu and li 2017 5 φ 2 φ 3 8 i 3 π ω 1 ε 2 μ ε 2 φ 3 z φ 3 z 2 c φ 3 z 0 x b z a where ε is the porosity of the perforated plate μ is the discharge coefficient and c is the blockage coefficient of the perforated plate the quadratic pressure drop boundary condition is used to only consider the influence of wave height on the wave energy dissipation in this paper which does not affect the governing equation and other boundary conditions of the classical linear analytical model mei et al 1974 the quadratic pressure drop boundary condition denotes the wave energy dissipation due to the flow separation through the perforated plate this boundary condition represents the pressure difference between the two sides of the perforated plate and includes two aspects a wave passes through the thin perforated plate which leads to energy dissipation b the inertial force of the perforated plate will change the wave phase when eq 5 is used the discharge coefficient μ and the blockage coefficient c need to be determined in advance the discharge coefficient μ should be relevant with several parameters of the plate porosity the geometry of the openings and reynolds number molin 1993 a reasonable formula for estimating the discharge coefficient of horizontal perforated plates is still lacking as one of the research objectives this study will develop a simple predictive formula of the discharge coefficient in the following section 5 the blockage coefficient c depends on the geometry of the structure and is independent of the wave characteristics newman 1969 tuck 1975 for the slotted plates mei et al 1974 and tuck 1975 derived an analytical formula for the blockage coefficient 6 c s π ln sin π 2 ε where s is the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent slats for the plates with circular holes the numerical predictive methods of the blockage coefficient were developed by mciver 1998a and molin and remy 2015 in their methods the blockage coefficient was related to the radius of the circular hole porosity and the size of the hole layout a comparative review on the blockage coefficient has been recently given by mackay and johanning 2020 besides preceding boundary conditions the velocity potentials must satisfy the following matching conditions between adjacent sub regions 7 φ 1 φ 2 a z 0 φ 3 h z a x 0 8 φ 1 x φ 2 x a z 0 φ 3 x h z a x 0 9 φ 4 φ 2 a z 0 φ 3 h z a x b 10 φ 4 x φ 2 x a z 0 φ 3 x h z a x b 11 φ

potential decomposition method with iterative calculations 2 2 iterative analytical solution the velocity potentials in sub regions 2 and 3 are decomposed into two components 12 φ 2 φ 2 v φ 2 h 13 φ 3 φ 3 v φ 3 h where the subscript v and h denotes that the corresponding artificial velocity potentials in region 2 and 3 are derived by the method of separation of variables along the vertical and the

liu and li 2011 liu et al 2012 fang et al 2017 both the velocity potential decomposition method and the method of splitting the original velocity potential in the plate domain regions 2 and 3 into a symmetric part and an antisymmetric part have been used so as to further simplify the calculation process however splitting the velocity potential into the symmetric and antisymmetric components is not applicable to the present problem with the quadratic pressure drop condition the reason is that when the symmetric and antisymmetric potentials independently satisfy the quadratic pressure drop condition the sum of them the original velocity potential will not meet the same nonlinear boundary condition anymore the velocity potentials in sub regions 1 and 4 satisfy the modified helmholtz equation and the boundary condition in eqs 2 4 and have the following forms 24 φ 1 i g h 2 ω ⅇ i k 0 x x z 0 z r 0 ⅇ i k 0 x x z 0 z n 1 r n ⅇ k n x x z n z 25 φ 4 i g h 2 ω t 0 ⅇ i k 0 x x b z 0 z n 1 t n ⅇ k n x x b z n z the velocity potential in sub regions 2 and 3 which satisfy the modified helmholtz equation and the relevant boundary condition in eqs 14 17 can be written as eqs 26 29 it should be noted that the velocity potential expressions of eqs 26 and 27 should be carefully derived to get convergence results with the increasing of truncated number n zhao et al 2017 26 φ 2 v i g h

in appendix now all the unknown expansion coefficients can be determined by simultaneously solving eqs 42 49 but eq 49 with eqs a 31 and a 32 is a nonlinear equation due to the use of the quadratic pressure drop condition and thus these equations cannot be directly solved here a robust iterative algorithm which is similar to that used by an and faltinsen 2012 molin and remy 2013 and liu and li 2017 is adopted to solve the system of equations the solution process is as follow 1 giving f n n 0 1 2 n in eq a 32 initial assumed values f n are assumed to be zero in the first iteration then the matrix coefficients z m n are determined and eq 49 becomes a linear equation 2 solving eqs 42 49 by gauss elimination method and the updated values of f n n 0 1 2 n are obtained 3 evaluating the difference between the updated and assumed values of f n n 0 1 2 n and stopping the iteration until the differences are all smaller than 10 4 otherwise the average values of the updated and assumed values of f n are adopted as the new initial values and repeating step 2 the reflection coefficient c r and the transmission coefficient c t of the submerged horizontal perforated plate are calculated by 50 c r r 0 51 c t t 0 the energy loss coefficient c e which denotes the loss of incident wave energy can be calculated by 52 c e 1 c r 2 c t 2 for c e 0 there is no energy loss at all for c e 1 the incident wave energy is totally dissipated the vertical wave force f v which denotes the force difference between the lower and upper surfaces of the plate is determined by integrating the dynamic pressure on the plate 53 f v i ρ ω 0 b φ 3 h x a φ 3 v x a φ 2 h x a φ 2 v x a d x ρ g h 2 2 a 0 λ 0 x sin λ 0 x b 2 y 0 a n 1 2 a n λ n x tanh λ n x b 2 y n a n 0 2 c n μ n x tanh μ n x b 2 x n a f n

section we consider a simpler but useful case of wave interaction with a horizontal perforated plate wave absorber which is idealized in fig 2 everything is the same as that in fig 1 except that the fluid domain behind the plate is replaced by a vertical wall which makes the fluid domain decrease to three sub regions the velocity potentials in the three sub regions still satisfy the modified helmholtz equation and the relevant boundary conditions in eqs 1 5 as well as the matching conditions among different regions in eqs 7 8 and 11 but an additional impermeable condition on the vertical wall is needed 55 φ j x 0 x b j 2 3 the velocity potential decomposition method is still used to solve the horizontal perforated plate wave absorber problem after the same procedure of velocity decomposition as that in section 2 the same expressions as those in eqs 24 28 and 29 are obtained for φ 1 φ 2 h and φ 3 h respectively but the velocity potentials φ 2 v and φ 3 v are changed as 56 φ 2

with respect to transmitted waves and remain r n a n b n c n d n e n and f n n 0 1 2 all of these unknown coefficients are determined by matching the boundary conditions among different regions and iterative calculations as shown in section 2 2 and is not repeated here for simplicity the reflection coefficient of the plate wave absorber is still calculated by eq 50 the vertical wave force f v acting on the horizontal perforated plate wave absorber is calculated by 58 f v i ρ ω 0 b φ 3 h x a φ 3 v x a φ 2 h x a φ 2 v x a d x ρ g h 2 a 0 λ 0 x sin λ 0 x b y 0 a n 1 a n λ n x tanh λ n x b y n

in the fluid velocity at the edges of the perforated plates is not considered in the present solution however the calculation accuracy of the hydrodynamic parameters should still be acceptable for engineering purposes which is illustrated in the next section 4 validation of solutions 4 1 convergence examination to confirm the correctness of the present analytical solutions it is necessary to examine the convergence of the iterative calculations with the increasing iterative step m and the convergence of the hydrodynamic quantities with the increasing truncated number n in the series expressions of velocity potentials the following calculation cases are for the submerged horizontal perforated plate breakwater table 1 shows the calculation results of the unknown complex expansion coefficients r 0 a 0 e 0 and t 0 at different iterative steps m in the calculations the truncation number n is 20 the other parameters used in the calculations are b h 1 0 a h 0 3 h l 0 02 ε 0 1 θ 0 c 0 03 μ 0 8 and k 0 h 1 0 it can be seen from table 1 that the calculation results converge rapidly and reach the accuracy of 10 4 after 13 iterative steps in fact for all the calculation examples in this study the iterative calculations generally converge within 20 iterative steps for the same horizontal perforated plate in table 1 the calculated results of the reflection and transmission coefficients with the increasing truncated number n at different k 0 h are listed in table 2 it can be seen from this table that the present series solution converges rapidly with the increasing truncated number the value of n 20 is sufficient for engineering purposes and thus is adopted in the following calculations 4 2 comparison with previous analytical solution using the present model the submerged horizontal perforated plate breakwater is converted to a solid structure by setting the porosity as zero ε 0 for wave scattering by a horizontal solid plate the present calculation results are compared with the previous calculation results of liu et al 2008 as shown in fig 3 the calculation conditions are b h 1 0 a h 0 2 ε 0 and θ 0 it can be seen that the agreement between two solutions is excellent 4 3 comparison with multi domain bem solution the present problems for both kinds of submerged horizontal plates were also numerically solving by an independently developed multi domain bem solution liu and li 2017 in the multi domain bem solution the fluid domain was divided into multiple regions by adding artificial boundaries according to the degenerate boundary the perforated thin plate after discretizing the integral equation independently in each region and combining them on the common boundaries the unknown variables were determined by solving simultaneous equations connected from different regions the multi domain bem solution can conveniently examine structures with complicated shapes but it is computationally time consuming compared to the analytical solution all the hydrodynamic quantities calculated by the present analytical solutions and the multi domain bem solution for two kinds of submerged horizontal plates are compared in figs 4 and 5 the calculating conditions of both perforated plates are b h 1 5 a h 0 1 h l 0 02 ε 0 25 c 0 016 and μ 0 4 the incident wave angles of 0 and 30 are considered fig 4 gives the results of the submerged horizontal perforated plate breakwater while fig 5 shows the results of the submerged horizontal perforated plate wave absorber it is noted that the present solutions for both kinds of submerged horizontal plates are in good agreement with the numerical results of multi domain bem solutions 5 predictive formula of discharge coefficient as reviewed in the introduction the discharge coefficient in the quadratic pressure drop condition is an empirical value and its value needs to be determined by precise experimental tests although some scholars have suggested some values for the discharge coefficients of different perforated plates there is still a lack of a reasonable method to estimate the discharge coefficient of the horizontal perforated plate therefore we develop a new simple formula for predicting the discharge coefficient based on the comparison between the present analytical solutions and the experimental data in literature first of all a number of experimental data for the reflection transmission coefficients of horizontal perforated plates in literature is collected in the case of a specific experimental condition the discharge coefficient adopted in the present analytical solutions is adjusted to make the calculation results closest to the experimental results and this is the expected optimal discharge coefficient after that by fitting the relationship between all the optimal discharge coefficients and the related parameters the predictive formula of the discharge coefficient is developed when looking for the optimal discharge coefficients a refined version of willmott s dimensionless index willmott et al 2012 is used to evaluate the agreement between the calculated and experimental results and the index of agreement d r is defined as 59 d r 1 i 1 i p i o i 2 i 1 i o i o i i 1 i p i o i 2 i 1 i o i o i 2 i 1 i o i o i i 1 i p i o i 1 i 1 i p i o i 2 i 1 i o i o i where p i and o i are the calculated results and experimental data respectively o i is the mean value of experimental results the value range of d r is 1 to 1 and when its value approaches to 1 the calculated and experimental results are in better agreement the experimental data from the studies of cho and kim 2013 kakuno and zhong 1993 and molin 2001 are used to find the optimal discharge coefficients cho and kim 2013 and kakuno and zhong 1993 examined wave interaction with the submerged horizontal perforated plate breakwater while molin 2001 measured wave reflection by the submerged horizontal perforated plate wave absorber no transmission in the tests of cho and kim 2013 and kakuno and zhong 1993 the reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient were both measured and thus they were simultaneously considered when calibrating the optimal discharge coefficients in the tests of molin 2001 there was a gap of 0 62 m width between the submerged horizontal perforated plate and the vertical wall which was slightly different from the present analytical case shown in fig 2 therefore in order to use the experimental data of molin 2001 the multi domain bem solution of liu and li 2017 was adopted for calculations instead of the present analytical solution the blockage coefficient can be calculated unless the radius and the layout of the holes are given since the details on the holes in cho and kim 2013 and molin 2001 were unknown the blockage coefficient cannot be determined alternatively we use a simple empirical formula given by suh et al 2011 and huang et al 2011 to estimate the blockage coefficient which reads 60 c δ 2 ε now the procedure to find the optimal discharge coefficient is as follows 1 calculating the reflection transmission coefficients by increasing the discharge coefficient from 0 to a sufficiently large value at an increment of 0 01 2 using eq 59 to estimate the agreement between the calculation results and the experimental data 3 find the expected discharge coefficient when the index of agreement d r is closest to 1 all the optimal values of the discharge coefficient μ with the largest d r are listed in table 3 and the corresponding values of the relative plate thickness δ h the porosity ε the relative submerged depth a h and the wave steepness h l are also listed the discharge coefficient is further plotted as the function of porosity in fig 6 it can be seen from table 3 and fig 6 that the plate porosity should be the dominant effect parameter of the discharge coefficient and the discharge coefficient decreases significantly with the increasing plate porosity the effects of the relative plate thickness the relative submerged depth and the wave steepness on the discharge coefficient are relatively small therefore only the plate porosity is considered as the affecting factor to develop the predictive formula of the discharge coefficient by fitting the obtained discharge coefficients in table 3 using the least square method a simple predictive formula for the discharge coefficient is developed as 61 μ 0 3024 ε 0 3876 0 08 ε 0 33 the calculation results of eq 61 is also added in fig 6 to further validate the newly developed predictive formula of the discharge coefficient and the practical applicability of the present analytical solutions the calculation results of the analytical solution using the discharge coefficients estimated by eq 61 are compared with the experimental data of cho and kim 2013 and kakuno and zhong 1993 the comparison results are given in figs 7 and 8 where the lines and the dots denote the analytical results and the experimental data respectively the agreement between the analytical results and the experimental data are quite good moreover after adopting the discharge coefficients estimated by eq 61 the calculation results of the multi domain bem solution are compared with the experimental data of molin 2001 in fig 9 again the two different results are in good agreement it is also noted from figs 8 and 9 that when using a fixed discharge coefficient the calculation results can well match the experimental data at different wave steepness wave heights this is attributed to the use of the quadratic pressure drop condition which makes the present solutions directly consider the effect of wave height on the wave energy dissipation by perforated plates although eq 61 cannot fit all the points perfectly valid calculation results of hydrodynamic coefficients can be obtained by using the discharge coefficient predicted by eq 61 in the future study more experimental tests are expected to be carried out to explore the influences of different parameters on the discharge coefficient 6 further results with discussion 6 1 horizontal perforated plate breakwater fig 10 shows the combined effects of the porosity ε and the dimensionless wave number k 0 h on the reflection coefficient transmission coefficient the energy loss coefficient and the dimensionless wave force for the submerged horizontal perforated plate breakwater it can be seen from fig 10 a that with the decrease of ε the reflection coefficient become larger from fig 10 b and 10 c when k 0 h 2 0 3 0 and the porosity ε is about 0 1 the energy dissipation effect of the submerged horizontal perforated plate is significant and results in very small transmission coefficient then the breakwater can provide a very good sheltering for the rear water area in fig 10 d the larger the porosity is the smaller the wave force on the submerged horizontal perforated plate is the reflection coefficient transmission coefficient energy loss coefficient and dimensionless wave force of the submerged horizontal perforated plate breakwater at different values of the relative submerged depth a h and the relative plate width b h are plotted in fig 11 it can be seen from fig 11 a that with the increasing b h the reflection coefficient increases first and then decrease besides when a h 0 1 0 12 and b h 0 6 0 9 the reflection coefficient of the submerged horizontal perforated plate is relatively large from figs 0 11 b and fig 11 c we can see that increasing the relative plate width of the plate can decrease the transmission coefficient of the breakwater effectively it also can be concluded from fig 11 that decreasing the relative submerged depth can offer better sheltering in fig 12 the combined effects of the incident wave angle θ and the dimensionless wave number k 0 h on the reflection coefficient transmission coefficient energy loss coefficient and the dimensionless wave force for the submerged horizontal perforated plate breakwater are plotted fig 12 shows that the transmission coefficient energy loss coefficient and wave force generally decrease with the increasing incident wave angle this should be due to the fact that when the incident wave angle increases the component of wavelength along the plate width direction decreases and thus more wave energy is reflected 6 2 horizontal perforated plate wave absorber fig 13 show the variations of the reflection coefficient and the dimensionless wave force of the horizontal perforated plate wave absorber under different values of porosity ε and the wave number k 0 h it can be seen from fig 13 that when k 0 h is larger than 1 0 and the plate porosity is about 0 1 the optimal plate porosity the wave absorber has an excellent wave absorption efficiency besides as ε decreases the reflection coefficient becomes small and it means most of the wave energy is dissipated by the wave absorber thus the wave interaction with the perforated plate should be strong and this is why the dimensionless wave force is relatively large by comparing figs 13 b and fig 10 d it is found that for the incident waves with larger wavelength the dimensionless wave force acting on the horizontal plate wave absorber is much larger than that on the horizontal plate breakwater fig 14 show the variations of the reflection coefficient and the dimensionless wave force of the horizontal perforated plate wave absorber under different values of incident wave angle θ and the wave number k 0 h in fig 14 the horizontal perforated plate wave absorber has a good wave dissipation performance when the incident wave angle is smaller than 45 in addition the wave force acting on the wave absorber significantly decreases with the increase of the incident wave angle especially for the short waves it can be concluded that the horizontal perforated plate wave absorber can be more effective for experimental wave tank compared with wave basin 7 conclusions the interactions of oblique waves with two kinds of submerged horizontal perforated thin plate structures which included an offshore breakwater and a wave absorber have been investigated by imposing a quadratic pressure drop condition on the perforated plates new iterative analytical solutions for the present problems were developed by using the velocity potential decomposition method the convergence of both the iterative calculation and the series solution itself was confirmed to be rapid the calculation results of the new analytical solutions were in excellent agreement with previous analytical solution for special case and the numerical results of an independently developed multi domain bem solution by fitting the present calculation results and the experimental data in literature a new simple predictive formula for the discharge coefficient of the horizontal perforated thin plate was developed after using the discharge coefficients predicted by the new formula the calculation results of the present new solution were in reasonable agreement with the experimental data of different cases calculation examples showed that when the plate porosity was about 0 1 both horizontal perforated plate structures had good performance for wave energy dissipation the transmission coefficient of the horizontal plate breakwater the reflection coefficient of the horizontal plate wave absorber and the wave forces acting on both structures attained smaller values at larger wave incident angle based on the present method solutions for wave scattering by multi layer horizontal perforated plates or similar structures may be developed in the future study in addition the present predictive formula of the discharge coefficient is expected to be available for other types of perforated thin plates which needs further study

potential decomposition method combined with an efficient iterative algorithm is adopted to obtain the analytical solutions and the hydrodynamic parameters of engineering interest for the reflection transmission and energy loss coefficients as well as the vertical wave force are considered a new simple formula for predicting the discharge coefficient in the quadratic pressure drop condition which is critical to make the analytical solutions to be practically applicable is developed by fitting the analytical results and an amount of experimental data in literature the present analytical solutions are in good agreement with previous analytical solution for special case and the numerical results of an independently developed multi domain boundary element method solution the reflection and transmission coefficients calculated by the present analytical solutions are also in good agreement with experimental data when adopting a well predicted discharge coefficient the present analytical solutions are valuable for fast assessing the hydrodynamic performance of horizontal perforated plates in the initial stage of engineering design the present analytical model can also be readily extended to the multi layer horizontal perforated plates and similar structures keywords horizontal perforated plate quadratic pressure drop discharge coefficient velocity potential decomposition analytical solution reflection coefficient transmission coefficient 1 introduction the horizontal perforated thin plate is a simple coastal structure with small vertical wave forces the horizontal perforated plate can be installed by piles or anchor chains which only requires a low bearing capacity of the seabed moreover the free exchange of seawater through the horizontal perforated plate can meet the requirements of ecological coastal engineering because the wave energy is mainly concentrated near the free water surface the horizontal perforated plate has good wave dissipating performance when it is placed near the water surface all above shows that the horizontal perforated plate has great potential in practical coastal engineering applications some researchers have verified the superiority of the horizontal perforated plate used as an offshore breakwater or attached to a vertical wall as a wave absorber yu 2002 summarized the functional performance of a submerged and essentially horizontal plate for mitigating severe wave attack on offshore and coastal facilities wu et al 1998 showed that a horizontal perforated plate attached to a vertical wall could be an effective wave absorber when it had a larger plate width and suitable porosity this wave absorber was systematically studied by cho and kim 2008 based on the linear potential theory some scholars have analytically investigated the interaction of water waves with submerged horizontal perforated plates among them the linear pressure drop conditions on the perforated plate chwang 1983 yu 1995 were widely used which assumed that the pressure drop across the plate was linearly proportional to the fluid velocity across the plate by these linear boundary conditions most researchers e g chwang and wu 1994 yu 1995 wu et al 1998 liu et al 2008 cho and kim 2008 used the standard matched eigenfunction expansion method to develop analytical solutions with respect to the horizontal perforated plates this method utilized the boundary conditions on the free surface seabed surface and plate surface to obtain the series expressions of the potential functions above and below the perforated plate and thus the complex dispersion relations of wave motion over the perforated plate were encountered such a solution method inevitably needed to solve the complex dispersion relations due to the roots of the complex dispersion relations laid on the complex plane it was difficult to select reasonable initial values to find all the complex roots by iterative calculations although some scholars mciver 1998b mendez and losada 2004 bao et al 2009 have given solution methods for the complex dispersion relations there were still some obstacles to obtaining the analytical solutions for wave interactions with submerged horizontal perforated plates by standard matched eigenfunction expansions lee 1995 developed a velocity potential decomposition method to solve the heave radiation problem of a floating rectangular structure the velocity potential decomposition method constructs reasonable boundary value problems and decomposes the total velocity potential into several artificial velocity potentials therefore the complex dispersion equations were avoided and the complexity of the calculations was simplified liu and li 2011 liu et al 2012 and fang et al 2017 have used the velocity potential decomposition method to solve wave scattering by submerged horizontal perforated plates in their solutions the non homogeneous boundary value problem was separated into a horizontal homogenous boundary value problem and a vertical homogeneous boundary value problem which were solved analytically the above studies were based on the linear pressure drop condition on the perforated plate besides some scholars utilized the quadratic pressure drop law to describe the flow boundary conditions on the perforated plates mei et al 1974 considered jet flow across narrow passages and then developed a quadratic head loss term to examine long wave transmission through the perforated plate bennett et al 1992 further extended the method of mei et al 1974 to be available for transitional waves based on pipe flow molin 1992 proposed another quadratic pressure drop boundary condition on the perforated plate recently molin and remy 2015 introduced the inertial effect of the perforated plate into the quadratic pressure drop condition which was not included in the original version of molin 1992 the study of liu and li 2017 showed that for perforated wall caisson breakwaters the inertial effect was significant for estimating the optimum wave chamber width with a minimum reflection coefficient the advantage of using the quadratic pressure drop condition is that the influence of wave height on the energy dissipation by the perforated plate can be directly incorporated into the solving process for such nonlinear pressure drop boundary conditions the standard matched eigenfunction expansion method cannot work when considering wave interaction with a submerged horizontal perforated plate molin and betous 1993 expanded the normal fluid velocity across the perforated plate as a series expression by utilizing the condition that its value was zero at the plate end they further imposed the series solution of the normal fluid velocity on the perforated plate as a non homogenous boundary condition and then found the series expressions of velocity potentials above and below the perforated plate finally they determined the unknown expansion coefficients in velocity potentials by iteratively solving the quadratic pressure drop condition on the perforated plate based on the method of molin and betous 1993 molin 2001 developed an analytical solution of wave reflection by a horizontal perforated plate wave absorber attached to a vertical wall in the analytical solutions of molin and betous 1993 and molin 2011 the water waves were both normally incident using the method of molin and betous 1993 cho and kim 2013 and cho et al 2013 also developed analytical solutions for wave scattering by submerged horizontal plates but they adopted the linear pressure drop condition in the quadratic pressure drop boundary conditions molin and remy 2015 liu and li 2017 the discharge coefficient μ and the blockage coefficient c denote respectively the resistance and inertial effects of the perforated plate on fluid motion for practical applications of this boundary condition the values of the discharge coefficient and the blockage coefficient must be known a prior the blockage coefficient c can be determined by asymptotic analysis or wave diffraction analysis and has been well determined in literature newman 1969 flagg and newman 1971 taylor 1973 mei et al 1974 tuck 1975 mciver 1998a suh et al 2002 molin and remy 2015 mackay and johanning 2020 the discharge coefficient depends on the plate porosity geometry of the openings and reynolds number molin 1993 and its precise value requires specific experimental tests to determine to give a reasonable predictive formula for the discharge coefficient is valuable to practical application of the quadratic pressure drop condition liu and li 2017 vijay et al 2019 mackay and johanning 2020 molin 2011 and liu and li 2017 have recommended some values of the discharge coefficients for the perforated plates but a reasonable predictive method formula for the discharge coefficient of submerged horizontal perforated plates is still lack in the present study new analytical solutions for wave scattering by two kinds of submerged horizontal perforated plates with the quadratic pressure drop condition molin and remy 2015 liu and li 2017 are developed on the basis of the velocity potential decomposition method the solutions take into account the more general obliquely incident waves and adopt an accurate and efficient iterative algorithm to solve the quadratic nonlinear pressure drop condition meanwhile a simple and practical formula for predicting the discharge coefficient in the quadratic pressure drop condition is developed such a predictive formula is critical for the practical application of the analytical solutions in the next section the boundary value problem of wave interaction with the submerged horizontal perforated plate breakwater is formulated and solved based on the velocity potential decompositions with iterative calculations in section 3 the analytical solution of wave interaction with the wave absorber of a submerged horizontal perforated plate attached to a vertical wall is developed in section 4 the convergence of the present solutions is examined the present analytical solutions are also compared with previous analytical solution for special case liu et al 2008 and independently developed multi domain bem boundary element method solutions for the same problems in section 5 a new simple formula for predicting the discharge coefficient in the quadratic pressure drop condition is developed by fitting the analytical results and experimental data in literature in section 6 the combined influences of major parameters on the hydrodynamic quantities of horizontal perforated plates are discussed finally the main conclusions of this study are drawn 2 solution for horizontal perforated plate breakwater 2 1 mathematical formulation the idealized sketch for wave interaction with a horizontal perforated plate breakwater submerged in the ocean with constant depth h is shown in fig 1 a 3d cartesian coordinate system with the x y plane located on the still water level and the z axis in the vertical direction upwards is adopted small amplitude waves with wave height h and wavelength l approach the breakwater at an angle θ to the positive x axis the wave number k 0 has components of k 0x k 0cosθ and k 0y k 0sinθ in the x and y directions respectively the horizontal plate is located on the position of 0 x b and z a where b is the plate width and a is the submerged depth of the plate the space between the plate and the seabed is d d h a the plate length in the y direction is very large compared to the incident wavelength and thus it is assumed to be infinity the plate thickness δ is too small to compare with the water depth and the incident wavelength and thus it is assumed to be zero when considering wave scattering the whole fluid domain is divided into four sub regions sub region 1 the fluid domain at the left hand side of the plate sub region 2 the fluid domain above the plate sub region 3 the fluid domain beneath the plate and sub region 4 the fluid domain at the right hand side of the plate the fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible and that its motion is irrotational then a velocity potential φ x y z t can be used to describe the fluid motion where t is time considering linear time harmonic water waves with angular frequency ω the velocity potential can be written as φ x y z t re φ x z e i k 0 y y e i ω t where re denotes the real part of the argument φ x z denotes the complex spatial velocity potential and i 1 the complex spatial velocity potential in each sub region satisfies the modified helmholtz equation 1 2 φ j x z x 2 2 φ j x z z 2 k 0 y 2 φ j x z 0 j 1 2 3 4 where the subscript j denotes the velocity potential in sub region j on the still water level the potentials satisfy the free surface condition 2 φ j z k φ j k ω 2 g z 0 j 1 2 4 where g denotes gravity acceleration 3 on the bottom of the water the potentials satisfy the impermeable condition φ j z 0 z h j 1 3 4 the waves must be outgoing and satisfy the condition 4 lim x x k 0 x φ 4 φ r 0 where φ r is the velocity potential of reflected waves the wave energy dissipation and phase shift by the horizontal perforated plate are represented by a quadratic pressure drop condition molin 1992 molin and remy 2015 liu and li 2017 5 φ 2 φ 3 8 i 3 π ω 1 ε 2 μ ε 2 φ 3 z φ 3 z 2 c φ 3 z 0 x b z a where ε is the porosity of the perforated plate μ is the discharge coefficient and c is the blockage coefficient of the perforated plate the quadratic pressure drop boundary condition is used to only consider the influence of wave height on the wave energy dissipation in this paper which does not affect the governing equation and other boundary conditions of the classical linear analytical model mei et al 1974 the quadratic pressure drop boundary condition denotes the wave energy dissipation due to the flow separation through the perforated plate this boundary condition represents the pressure difference between the two sides of the perforated plate and includes two aspects a wave passes through the thin perforated plate which leads to energy dissipation b the inertial force of the perforated plate will change the wave phase when eq 5 is used the discharge coefficient μ and the blockage coefficient c need to be determined in advance the discharge coefficient μ should be relevant with several parameters of the plate porosity the geometry of the openings and reynolds number molin 1993 a reasonable formula for estimating the discharge coefficient of horizontal perforated plates is still lacking as one of the research objectives this study will develop a simple predictive formula of the discharge coefficient in the following section 5 the blockage coefficient c depends on the geometry of the structure and is independent of the wave characteristics newman 1969 tuck 1975 for the slotted plates mei et al 1974 and tuck 1975 derived an analytical formula for the blockage coefficient 6 c s π ln sin π 2 ε where s is the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent slats for the plates with circular holes the numerical predictive methods of the blockage coefficient were developed by mciver 1998a and molin and remy 2015 in their methods the blockage coefficient was related to the radius of the circular hole porosity and the size of the hole layout a comparative review on the blockage coefficient has been recently given by mackay and johanning 2020 besides preceding boundary conditions the velocity potentials must satisfy the following matching conditions between adjacent sub regions 7 φ 1 φ 2 a z 0 φ 3 h z a x 0 8 φ 1 x φ 2 x a z 0 φ 3 x h z a x 0 9 φ 4 φ 2 a z 0 φ 3 h z a x b 10 φ 4 x φ 2 x a z 0 φ 3 x h z a x b 11 φ 2 z φ 3 z 0 x b z a now eqs 1 5 and 7 11 formulate a complete boundary value problem for wave scattering by a submerged horizontal perforated plate in this study this problem is solved by the velocity potential decomposition method with iterative calculations 2 2 iterative analytical solution the velocity potentials in sub regions 2 and 3 are decomposed into two components 12 φ 2 φ 2 v φ 2 h 13 φ 3 φ 3 v φ 3 h where the subscript v and h denotes that the corresponding artificial velocity potentials in region 2 and 3 are derived by the method of separation of variables along the vertical and the horizontal directions respectively the decomposed velocity potentials still satisfy the modified helmholtz equation and the corresponding boundary conditions 14 φ 2 v z ω 2 g φ 2 v z 0 φ 2 v z 0 z a

φ 3 v 8 i 3 π ω 1 ε 2 μ ε 2 φ 3 h z φ 3 h z 2 c φ 3 h z 0 x b z a in previous analytical studies for wave interaction with submerged horizontal perforated plates using linear pressure drop condition liu and li 2011 liu et al 2012 fang et al 2017 both the velocity potential decomposition method and the method of splitting the original velocity potential in the plate domain regions 2 and 3 into a symmetric part and an antisymmetric part have been used so as to further simplify the calculation process however splitting the velocity potential into the symmetric and antisymmetric components is not applicable to the present problem with the quadratic pressure drop condition the reason is that when the symmetric and antisymmetric potentials independently satisfy the quadratic pressure drop condition the sum of them the original velocity potential will not meet the same nonlinear boundary condition anymore the velocity potentials in sub regions 1 and 4 satisfy the modified helmholtz equation and the boundary condition in eqs 2 4 and have the following forms 24 φ 1 i g h 2 ω ⅇ i k 0 x x z 0 z r 0 ⅇ i k 0 x x z 0 z n 1 r n ⅇ k n x x z n z 25 φ 4 i g h 2 ω t 0 ⅇ i k 0 x x b z 0 z n 1 t n ⅇ k n x x b z n z the velocity potential in sub regions 2 and 3 which satisfy the modified helmholtz equation and the relevant boundary condition in eqs 14 17 can be written as eqs 26 29 it should be noted that the velocity potential expressions of eqs 26 and 27 should be carefully derived to get convergence results with the increasing of truncated number n zhao et al 2017 26 φ 2 v i g h

y m z and integrating with respect to z from a to 0 and further using the orthogonal relation and truncating m and n to n it yields 42 r m n r n a m n a m b m n b m δ m m n 1 2 3 n where the matrix

in appendix now all the unknown expansion coefficients can be determined by simultaneously solving eqs 42 49 but eq 49 with eqs a 31 and a 32 is a nonlinear equation due to the use of the quadratic pressure drop condition and thus these equations cannot be directly solved here a robust iterative algorithm which is similar to that used by an and faltinsen 2012 molin and remy 2013 and liu and li 2017 is adopted to solve the system of equations the solution process is as follow 1 giving f n n 0 1 2 n in eq a 32 initial assumed values f n are assumed to be zero in the first iteration then the matrix coefficients z m n are determined and eq 49 becomes a linear equation 2 solving eqs 42 49 by gauss elimination method and the updated values of f n n 0 1 2 n are obtained 3 evaluating the difference between the updated and assumed values of f n n 0 1 2 n and stopping the iteration until the differences are all smaller than 10 4 otherwise the average values of the updated and assumed values of f n are adopted as the new initial values and repeating step 2 the reflection coefficient c r and the transmission coefficient c t of the submerged horizontal perforated plate are calculated by 50 c r r 0 51 c t t 0 the energy loss coefficient c e which denotes the loss of incident wave energy can be calculated by 52 c e 1 c r 2 c t 2 for c e 0 there is no energy loss at all for c e 1 the incident wave energy is totally dissipated the vertical wave force f v which denotes the force difference between the lower and upper surfaces of the plate is determined by integrating the dynamic pressure on the plate 53 f v i ρ ω 0 b φ 3 h x a φ 3 v x a φ 2 h x a φ 2 v x a d x ρ g h 2 2 a 0 λ 0 x sin λ 0 x b 2 y 0 a n 1 2 a n λ n x tanh λ n x b 2 y n a n 0 2 c n μ n x tanh μ n x b 2 x n a f n

section we consider a simpler but useful case of wave interaction with a horizontal perforated plate wave absorber which is idealized in fig 2 everything is the same as that in fig 1 except that the fluid domain behind the plate is replaced by a vertical wall which makes the fluid domain decrease to three sub regions the velocity potentials in the three sub regions still satisfy the modified helmholtz equation and the relevant boundary conditions in eqs 1 5 as well as the matching conditions among different regions in eqs 7 8 and 11 but an additional impermeable condition on the vertical wall is needed 55 φ j x 0 x b j 2 3 the velocity potential decomposition method is still used to solve the horizontal perforated plate wave absorber problem after the same procedure of velocity decomposition as that in section 2 the same expressions as those in eqs 24 28 and 29 are obtained for φ 1 φ 2 h and φ 3 h respectively but the velocity potentials φ 2 v and φ 3 v are changed as 56 φ 2

with respect to transmitted waves and remain r n a n b n c n d n e n and f n n 0 1 2 all of these unknown coefficients are determined by matching the boundary conditions among different regions and iterative calculations as shown in section 2 2 and is not repeated here for simplicity the reflection coefficient of the plate wave absorber is still calculated by eq 50 the vertical wave force f v acting on the horizontal perforated plate wave absorber is calculated by 58 f v i ρ ω 0 b φ 3 h x a φ 3 v x a φ 2 h x a φ 2 v x a d x ρ g h 2 a 0 λ 0 x sin λ 0 x b y 0 a n 1 a n λ n x tanh λ n x b y n a n 0 c n μ n x tanh μ n x b x n a f n β n sin β n b n 0 e n β n sin β n b 1 k tanh β n z a β n z the vertical wave force is still normalized using eq 54 it is noted that the square root singularity in the fluid velocity at the edges of the perforated plates is not considered in the present solution however the calculation accuracy of the hydrodynamic parameters should still be acceptable for engineering purposes which is illustrated in the next section 4 validation of solutions 4 1 convergence examination to confirm the correctness of the present analytical solutions it is necessary to examine the convergence of the iterative calculations with the increasing iterative step m and the convergence of the hydrodynamic quantities with the increasing truncated number n in the series expressions of velocity potentials the following calculation cases are for the submerged horizontal perforated plate breakwater table 1 shows the calculation results of the unknown complex expansion coefficients r 0 a 0 e 0 and t 0 at different iterative steps m in the calculations the truncation number n is 20 the other parameters used in the calculations are b h 1 0 a h 0 3 h l 0 02 ε 0 1 θ 0 c 0 03 μ 0 8 and k 0 h 1 0 it can be seen from table 1 that the calculation results converge rapidly and reach the accuracy of 10 4 after 13 iterative steps in fact for all the calculation examples in this study the iterative calculations generally converge within 20 iterative steps for the same horizontal perforated plate in table 1 the calculated results of the reflection and transmission coefficients with the increasing truncated number n at different k 0 h are listed in table 2 it can be seen from this table that the present series solution converges rapidly with the increasing truncated number the value of n 20 is sufficient for engineering purposes and thus is adopted in the following calculations 4 2 comparison with previous analytical solution using the present model the submerged horizontal perforated plate breakwater is converted to a solid structure by setting the porosity as zero ε 0 for wave scattering by a horizontal solid plate the present calculation results are compared with the previous calculation results of liu et al 2008 as shown in fig 3 the calculation conditions are b h 1 0 a h 0 2 ε 0 and θ 0 it can be seen that the agreement between two solutions is excellent 4 3 comparison with multi domain bem solution the present problems for both kinds of submerged horizontal plates were also numerically solving by an independently developed multi domain bem solution liu and li 2017 in the multi domain bem solution the fluid domain was divided into multiple regions by adding artificial boundaries according to the degenerate boundary the perforated thin plate after discretizing the integral equation independently in each region and combining them on the common boundaries the unknown variables were determined by solving simultaneous equations connected from different regions the multi domain bem solution can conveniently examine structures with complicated shapes but it is computationally time consuming compared to the analytical solution all the hydrodynamic quantities calculated by the present analytical solutions and the multi domain bem solution for two kinds of submerged horizontal plates are compared in figs 4 and 5 the calculating conditions of both perforated plates are b h 1 5 a h 0 1 h l 0 02 ε 0 25 c 0 016 and μ 0 4 the incident wave angles of 0 and 30 are considered fig 4 gives the results of the submerged horizontal perforated plate breakwater while fig 5 shows the results of the submerged horizontal perforated plate wave absorber it is noted that the present solutions for both kinds of submerged horizontal plates are in good agreement with the numerical results of multi domain bem solutions 5 predictive formula of discharge coefficient as reviewed in the introduction the discharge coefficient in the quadratic pressure drop condition is an empirical value and its value needs to be determined by precise experimental tests although some scholars have suggested some values for the discharge coefficients of different perforated plates there is still a lack of a reasonable method to estimate the discharge coefficient of the horizontal perforated plate therefore we develop a new simple formula for predicting the discharge coefficient based on the comparison between the present analytical solutions and the experimental data in literature first of all a number of experimental data for the reflection transmission coefficients of horizontal perforated plates in literature is collected in the case of a specific experimental condition the discharge coefficient adopted in the present analytical solutions is adjusted to make the calculation results closest to the experimental results and this is the expected optimal discharge coefficient after that by fitting the relationship between all the optimal discharge coefficients and the related parameters the predictive formula of the discharge coefficient is developed when looking for the optimal discharge coefficients a refined version of willmott s dimensionless index willmott et al 2012 is used to evaluate the agreement between the calculated and experimental results and the index of agreement d r is defined as 59 d r 1 i 1 i p i o i 2 i 1 i o i o i i 1 i p i o i 2 i 1 i o i o i 2 i 1 i o i o i i 1 i p i o i 1 i 1 i p i o i 2 i 1 i o i o i where p i and o i are the calculated results and experimental data respectively o i is the mean value of experimental results the value range of d r is 1 to 1 and when its value approaches to 1 the calculated and experimental results are in better agreement the experimental data from the studies of cho and kim 2013 kakuno and zhong 1993 and molin 2001 are used to find the optimal discharge coefficients cho and kim 2013 and kakuno and zhong 1993 examined wave interaction with the submerged horizontal perforated plate breakwater while molin 2001 measured wave reflection by the submerged horizontal perforated plate wave absorber no transmission in the tests of cho and kim 2013 and kakuno and zhong 1993 the reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient were both measured and thus they were simultaneously considered when calibrating the optimal discharge coefficients in the tests of molin 2001 there was a gap of 0 62 m width between the submerged horizontal perforated plate and the vertical wall which was slightly different from the present analytical case shown in fig 2 therefore in order to use the experimental data of molin 2001 the multi domain bem solution of liu and li 2017 was adopted for calculations instead of the present analytical solution the blockage coefficient can be calculated unless the radius and the layout of the holes are given since the details on the holes in cho and kim 2013 and molin 2001 were unknown the blockage coefficient cannot be determined alternatively we use a simple empirical formula given by suh et al 2011 and huang et al 2011 to estimate the blockage coefficient which reads 60 c δ 2 ε now the procedure to find the optimal discharge coefficient is as follows 1 calculating the reflection transmission coefficients by increasing the discharge coefficient from 0 to a sufficiently large value at an increment of 0 01 2 using eq 59 to estimate the agreement between the calculation results and the experimental data 3 find the expected discharge coefficient when the index of agreement d r is closest to 1 all the optimal values of the discharge coefficient μ with the largest d r are listed in table 3 and the corresponding values of the relative plate thickness δ h the porosity ε the relative submerged depth a h and the wave steepness h l are also listed the discharge coefficient is further plotted as the function of porosity in fig 6 it can be seen from table 3 and fig 6 that the plate porosity should be the dominant effect parameter of the discharge coefficient and the discharge coefficient decreases significantly with the increasing plate porosity the effects of the relative plate thickness the relative submerged depth and the wave steepness on the discharge coefficient are relatively small therefore only the plate porosity is considered as the affecting factor to develop the predictive formula of the discharge coefficient by fitting the obtained discharge coefficients in table 3 using the least square method a simple predictive formula for the discharge coefficient is developed as 61 μ 0 3024 ε 0 3876 0 08 ε 0 33 the calculation results of eq 61 is also added in fig 6 to further validate the newly developed predictive formula of the discharge coefficient and the practical applicability of the present analytical solutions the calculation results of the analytical solution using the discharge coefficients estimated by eq 61 are compared with the experimental data of cho and kim 2013 and kakuno and zhong 1993 the comparison results are given in figs 7 and 8 where the lines and the dots denote the analytical results and the experimental data respectively the agreement between the analytical results and the experimental data are quite good moreover after adopting the discharge coefficients estimated by eq 61 the calculation results of the multi domain bem solution are compared with the experimental data of molin 2001 in fig 9 again the two different results are in good agreement it is also noted from figs 8 and 9 that when using a fixed discharge coefficient the calculation results can well match the experimental data at different wave steepness wave heights this is attributed to the use of the quadratic pressure drop condition which makes the present solutions directly consider the effect of wave height on the wave energy dissipation by perforated plates although eq 61 cannot fit all the points perfectly valid calculation results of hydrodynamic coefficients can be obtained by using the discharge coefficient predicted by eq 61 in the future study more experimental tests are expected to be carried out to explore the influences of different parameters on the discharge coefficient 6 further results with discussion 6 1 horizontal perforated plate breakwater fig 10 shows the combined effects of the porosity ε and the dimensionless wave number k 0 h on the reflection coefficient transmission coefficient the energy loss coefficient and the dimensionless wave force for the submerged horizontal perforated plate breakwater it can be seen from fig 10 a that with the decrease of ε the reflection coefficient become larger from fig 10 b and 10 c when k 0 h 2 0 3 0 and the porosity ε is about 0 1 the energy dissipation effect of the submerged horizontal perforated plate is significant and results in very small transmission coefficient then the breakwater can provide a very good sheltering for the rear water area in fig 10 d the larger the porosity is the smaller the wave force on the submerged horizontal perforated plate is the reflection coefficient transmission coefficient energy loss coefficient and dimensionless wave force of the submerged horizontal perforated plate breakwater at different values of the relative submerged depth a h and the relative plate width b h are plotted in fig 11 it can be seen from fig 11 a that with the increasing b h the reflection coefficient increases first and then decrease besides when a h 0 1 0 12 and b h 0 6 0 9 the reflection coefficient of the submerged horizontal perforated plate is relatively large from figs 0 11 b and fig 11 c we can see that increasing the relative plate width of the plate can decrease the transmission coefficient of the breakwater effectively it also can be concluded from fig 11 that decreasing the relative submerged depth can offer better sheltering in fig 12 the combined effects of the incident wave angle θ and the dimensionless wave number k 0 h on the reflection coefficient transmission coefficient energy loss coefficient and the dimensionless wave force for the submerged horizontal perforated plate breakwater are plotted fig 12 shows that the transmission coefficient energy loss coefficient and wave force generally decrease with the increasing incident wave angle this should be due to the fact that when the incident wave angle increases the component of wavelength along the plate width direction decreases and thus more wave energy is reflected 6 2 horizontal perforated plate wave absorber fig 13 show the variations of the reflection coefficient and the dimensionless wave force of the horizontal perforated plate wave absorber under different values of porosity ε and the wave number k 0 h it can be seen from fig 13 that when k 0 h is larger than 1 0 and the plate porosity is about 0 1 the optimal plate porosity the wave absorber has an excellent wave absorption efficiency besides as ε decreases the reflection coefficient becomes small and it means most of the wave energy is dissipated by the wave absorber thus the wave interaction with the perforated plate should be strong and this is why the dimensionless wave force is relatively large by comparing figs 13 b and fig 10 d it is found that for the incident waves with larger wavelength the dimensionless wave force acting on the horizontal plate wave absorber is much larger than that on the horizontal plate breakwater fig 14 show the variations of the reflection coefficient and the dimensionless wave force of the horizontal perforated plate wave absorber under different values of incident wave angle θ and the wave number k 0 h in fig 14 the horizontal perforated plate wave absorber has a good wave dissipation performance when the incident wave angle is smaller than 45 in addition the wave force acting on the wave absorber significantly decreases with the increase of the incident wave angle especially for the short waves it can be concluded that the horizontal perforated plate wave absorber can be more effective for experimental wave tank compared with wave basin 7 conclusions the interactions of oblique waves with two kinds of submerged horizontal perforated thin plate structures which included an offshore breakwater and a wave absorber have been investigated by imposing a quadratic pressure drop condition on the perforated plates new iterative analytical solutions for the present problems were developed by using the velocity potential decomposition method the convergence of both the iterative calculation and the series solution itself was confirmed to be rapid the calculation results of the new analytical solutions were in excellent agreement with previous analytical solution for special case and the numerical results of an independently developed multi domain bem solution by fitting the present calculation results and the experimental data in literature a new simple predictive formula for the discharge coefficient of the horizontal perforated thin plate was developed after using the discharge coefficients predicted by the new formula the calculation results of the present new solution were in reasonable agreement with the experimental data of different cases calculation examples showed that when the plate porosity was about 0 1 both horizontal perforated plate structures had good performance for wave energy dissipation the transmission coefficient of the horizontal plate breakwater the reflection coefficient of the horizontal plate wave absorber and the wave forces acting on both structures attained smaller values at larger wave incident angle based on the present method solutions for wave scattering by multi layer horizontal perforated plates or similar structures may be developed in the future study in addition the present predictive formula of the discharge coefficient is expected to be available for other types of perforated thin plates which needs further study

21187,elongated cylindrical structures with non uniform diameters under cross flow are often encountered in marine engineering and energy harvesting devices in this work the vortex induced vibrations of elastically supported circular tapered and wavy cylinders with different cross sections areas are studied numerically using a wake oscillator model the effect of the tapering ratio on the amplitude of oscillation is particularly analyzed for tapered cylinders it is found that the amplitude of oscillation under flow decreases strongly when a critical tapering is reached this is consistent with experimental data a similar effect is found in wavy cylinders a third system consisting of a two section cylinder also elastically supported and under cross flow is then considered and the drop in amplitude is related to the ratio between diameters for this system a linear stability analysis of the equations of the coupled fluid solid system allows giving a good approximation of the critical diameter ratio consistently with the tapered cylinder case it is concluded that the critical diameter ratio corresponds to the maximum variation in vortex shedding parameters that the coupled wake cylinder system can support along its length while keeping a consistent vortex shedding keywords vortex induced vibration wake oscillator model linear stability diameter ratio 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv is a form of coupling between a wake and an elastic structure williamson and govardhan 2004 it might lead to fatigue but is also a way to harvest energy by flows grouthier et al 2014 cylinders undergoing viv may not be of uniform cross section tapered and wavy cylinders have been studied in the past for tapered cylinders fig 1 a several authors bargi et al 2015 hover et al 1998 kaja et al 2016 techet et al 1998 seyed aghazadeh et al 2015 zeinoddini et al 2013 have shown that a strongly tapering almost suppresses viv in their work different cylinders in terms of mass ratios and tapering ratios have been studied numerically and experimentally differences and similarities have been found between linearly tapered cylinders subject to uniform flow and uniform cylinders subject linearly sheared flow balasubramanian and skop 1996 parnaudeau et al 2007 balasubramanian showed a similar oscillating behavior for the two cases some authors analyzed the cellular vortex shedding for a tapered cylinder mathelin and de langre 2005 narasimhamurthy et al 2009 for wavy cylinders fig 1 b the wake and in consequence viv are also affected by the amplitude and wavelength of the waviness as well as the heading angle in elliptical wavy cylinders balasubramanian and skop 1996 lam et al 2004 lam and lin 2009 lee and nguyen 2007 zhao et al 2011 zou et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 assi and bearman 2018 more generally span wise variations of geometry or flow characteristics are at the first order equivalent to diameter variations simulation of viv can be done by using reduced order models such as wake oscillator models païdoussis et al 2010 in this approach the wake dynamics is presented by a single variable that satisfies a van de pol equation this is coupled to the dynamics of the cylinder see for instance facchinetti et al 2004a where it has been shown that the acceleration coupling is the most appropriate forcing of the bluff body by using this nonlinear coupled system the main features of viv phenomenology can be reproduced this model has been applied to a large variety of cases with non uniform flows with rigid cylinder and flexible tensioned cable mathelin and de langre 2005 srinil et al 2009 violette et al 2007 xu et al 2008 the first use of a wake oscillator model to study viv of tapered cylinders was done by balasubramanian and skop 1996 but the drop in amplitude for high tapering was not recovered the wake oscillator model has also been used to study the response of a tensioned cable subjected to flow with different velocity profiles and different boundary conditions the results showed that the simple wake oscillator model can model the important features of dynamics of long cylinders such as waves generated in cables de langre 2006 used a linear stability analysis to analyze the lock in mechanism viv the linear stability analyses of the coupled equations have also been applied to waves generated in the cable the cable under non uniform flow and the competition of unstable wave systems have been discussed as well de langre 2006 gao et al 2018 2019 violette et al 2007 2010 xu et al 2008 considered the applicability of the nonlinear wake oscillator to high aspect ratio risers and performed experiment to validate their numerical results in the present paper we analyze the response of cylinders with different cross sections in three steps first we apply the wake oscillator approach of facchinetti et al 2004a to the case of tapered cylinders and wavy cylinders in the scope of predicting the reduction of amplitude of viv that occurs for strong variation of diameters as a kind of loss of lock in a simpler case of a two section cylinder is then analyzed in a second approach based on de langre 2006 we perform a linear stability analysis of the coupled wake structure system this allows finding approximations of the range of flow velocity where lock in occurs finally in a third approach as an extension of the linear stability approach a simple criteria for loss of lock in is proposed section 2 presents the wake oscillator approach section 3 the application for different cylinders shown in fig 1 section 4 describes the linear stability analysis and the simple criteria 2 wake oscillator model in this section we recall the main features of the wake oscillator model in facchinetti et al 2004a and we extend it to the case of varying cross section the van der pol wake oscillator model has been used for describing the dynamics of the wake behind the cylinder as 1 2 q t 2 ε q 2 1 q t q f here q t is the dimensionless wake variable which is associated to the transverse unsteady lift force q 2 c l c l 0 where c l is the lift coefficient and c l 0 is the reference lift coefficient in a fixed structure subjected to the vortex shedding in eq 1 f is the effect of the motion of the cylinder on the fluid wake oscillator this can be written as a 2 y t 2 here a and ε are parameters that have been determined from experiments for circular cylinders facchinetti et al 2004a in fig 2 an elastically supported rigid cylinder is shown with diameter d and mass m subjected to a steady uniform flow of velocity u this body is restricted to have only movement in the cross flow direction y the movement of the cylinder can be described by a linear oscillator 2 m 2 y t 2 r y t h y s where y is the displacement of the cylinder m is the total mass of the system which includes the mass of structure and the fluid added mass here h is the stiffness of system r is the total damping modeling both the viscous dissipation r s 2 m ζ ω s and the added damping r f γ μ m ω f see facchinetti et al 2004a we define the parameters ζ as the structure reduced damping ω s h m the natural frequency of the structure γ c d 4 π s t as the stall parameter related to the drag coefficient c d ω f the frequency of vortex shedding μ m ρ d 2 the mass ratio m c l 0 16 π 2 s t 2 μ the mass number s t the strouhal number and finally s the exerted force from vortex to cylinder in dimensionless form the coupled equations for a uniform cylinder are facchinetti et al 2004a 3 2 y t 2 2 ζ γ μ ω y t y m ω 2 q 2 q t 2 ε ω q 2 1 q t ω 2 q a y we can extent this formulation to a spanwise varying diameter d z as 4 2 y t 2 2 ζ y t y z 0 λ m ω 2 d z q γ μ ω y t d z 2 q t 2 ε ω d z q 2 1 q t ω d z 2 q a y here d z d z d 0 y y d 0 is the dimensionless amplitude d 0 is the mean diameter of the cylinder t t ω s is the dimensionless time λ l d 0 is the dimensionless length and ω ω f ω s u s t d 0 ω s s t u r is the reduced angular frequency here q z t and d z depend on the spanwise coordinate z eq 4 can be solved numerically in time as in the research of facchinetti et al 2004a but with a series of wake oscillator in the spanwize direction see facchinetti et al 2002 the limit cycle in terms of its amplitude that is reached after a transient from a non zero initial condition is then analyzed as a function of the parameters ω s t u r the shedding frequency and τ l d m a x d m i n mathelin and de langre 2005 the tapering ratio for the tapered cylinder and for the wavy cylinder the ratio d m a x d m i n and the wavelength it was shown that taking into account the diffusion of the wake dynamics in the spanwise direction did not affect significantly the results facchinetti et al 2002 mathelin and de langre 2005 the validation of the van der pol wake oscillator model has been the topic of many papers balasubramanian et al 1996 used nonlinear diffusively coupled wake oscillators to study uniform cylinders and cones under different flow conditions and validated their results against experimental results in facchinetti et al 2002 the wake oscillator approach was used to model the time evolution of vortex shedding over a wavy cylinder in relation to the work of balasubramanian and skop 1996 and bearman and owen 1998 facchinetti et al 2004a studied the coupling of the wake oscillator with a single structural oscillator and compared the results with experiments and other models cables with different conditions have also been studied and the results validated against experiments facchinetti et al 2004b violette et al 2007 2010 more recently cables and risers have been modeled using wake oscillators and the results compared with experiments and dns gao et al 2018 2019 lin et al 2009 xu et al 2008 all the comparisons with experiments or cfd have shown that the wake oscillator can represent qualitatively most of the features of viv and qualitatively some aspects considering its simplicity it is now used in many applications as well as in the analysis of the dynamics of these systems 3 loss of lock in 3 1 tapered cylinder we first apply eq 4 to the tapered cylinder case corresponding to the experiments of zeinoddini et al 2013 μ 6 1 λ 14 28 fig 3 a d shows the normalized amplitude of viv as a function of ω s t u r for four different levels of tapering in those figures the amplitude of vibration of cylinders have been normalized with the amplitude of uniform cylinder with the same characteristics and have been indicated by y y u n i f o r m at τ 60 and τ 30 the lock in is similar to that of a uniform cylinder in those cases τ 60 and τ 30 most of the cylinder is near the diameter at which lock in occurs for τ 25 and τ 20 the amplitude is much smaller because only a part of the cylinder has a diameter corresponding to the lock in condition by systematically exploring the values of τ the evolution of the maximum of the response curve can be plotted fig 3 e a sharp change at τ 27 is observed corresponding to unlock in we can define a critical value of the tapering ratio were unlock in occurs by the center of the s shaped curve or the point of maximum slope here at τ 27 the experimental data by zeinoddini et al 2013 for uniform and tapered at τ 20 are also shown in fig 3 e as and δ respectively the same analysis can be done for the case studied in seyed aghazadeh et al 2015 μ 7 6 λ 19 61 a similar unlock in is observed at about τ 40 fig 3 right the change in these two cases show that the strong decrease of viv amplitude occurs when the tapering is strong enough low tapering ratio the critical tapering ratio where the shift occurs seems to depend on mass ratio which differs between the two cases the experimental data of seyed aghazadeh et al 2015 is also shown in fig 3 j as and for tapered and uniform cylinders respectively but do not show any apparent loss of lock in 3 2 wavy cylinder for wavy cylinders fig 1 b another parameter is used to describe the spanwise variation of the diameter the diameter ratio δ d m a x d m i n the mass ratio and the length to mean diameter ratio are set to 6 1 and 14 28 respectively as in the first case of tapered cylinder above the wavelength of the sinusoidal variation of the diameter is set to l 2 or l 8 fig 4 shows the evolution of the amplitude of motion with the diameter ratio δ by increasing the variation of diameter the maximum amplitude of oscillation decreases and shifts to higher reduced velocity as in the tapered cases in both wavy cylinders a drop of amplitude is found near δ 1 5 note that this drop of amplitude depends on the mass ratio but weakly on the wavelength of diameter variation except for low mass ratio as is illustrated fig 4 k 3 3 two section cylinder to gain a better understanding of the drop in viv amplitude found for the two systems above we consider the simpler more generic case of a two section cylinder see fig 1 c now the diameter ratio δ is simply the ratio of the two diameters for that case the wake variable q z t reduces to two variables q 1 t and q 2 t so that eq 4 become 5 2 y t 2 2 ζ γ μ ω y t y m ω 2 q 1 d 1 q 2 d 2 2 2 q 1 t 2 ε ω d 1 q 1 2 1 q 1 t ω d 1 2 q 1 a 2 y t 2 2 q 2 t 2 ε ω d 2 q 2 2 1 q 2 t ω d 2 2 q 2 a 2 y t 2 where d 1 and d 2 are the upper and lower diameter ratios respectively the aforementioned equations are solved for this case and the results are represented in fig 5 fig 5 a d show the evolution of the viv response when the diameter ratio is increased the classical lock in response curve fig 5 a shifts to a double lock in curve fig 5 d for higher diameter ratios in between the amplitude is reduced as no common frequency of lock in can be found fig 5 e represents the amplitudes of motion as a function of the diameter ratio clearly the splitting of the lock in response in two separated lock in responses results in a drop of the amplitude of response here near δ 1 75 this is similar to the cases of a tapered or wavy cylinder shown before as the ratio between diameters along the cylinder becomes larger no common lock in is found for the coupled dynamical system and this results in a drop of amplitude there is a similarity in the shifting to the double lock in situation for the two section and the wavy cylinders when considering the distribution of diameters a large part of the wavy and two section cylinders have a diameter close to the extreme values conversely the tapered cylinder has a uniform distribution of diameters so the wavy cylinders and the two section cylinder have similar behaviors as we can observe in the second row of fig 4 4 a simple criteria for loss of lock in in the results of the cases computed above it appears that the amplitude of viv drops when the ratio between diameters along the cylinder becomes too large in the tapered cylinder and the wavy cylinder a strong diameter ratio results in a very strong drop of amplitude for the two section cylinder the amplitude of motion is not so strongly reduced as new lock in ranges reappear for high diameter ratios it seems that the mechanism at the origin of amplitude decrease with non uniform diameters is related to the inability of the dynamical system to accommodate with wakes of too different natural frequencies this can be analyzed on the simpler system of the two section cylinder in that case two wake variables coexist that are governed by wake oscillator equations with two distinct frequencies see eq 5 we now use the approach of a linear stability analysis of the set of coupled equations following the work of de langre 2006 in that approach the modes of the coupled system made linear are computed and it has been shown that lock in of the full non linear system corresponds to the existence of an unstable mode in the linear stability analysis in the simple case of uniform flow the range of lock in can be easily computed see in appendix and reads 6 1 1 a m ω 1 1 a m in the more general case of the two section cylinders following the research work of de langre 2006 we remove from eq 5 the non linear terms and the damping terms they become 7 2 y t 2 y m ω 2 q 1 d 1 q 2 d 2 2 2 q 1 t 2 ω d 1 2 q 1 a 2 y t 2 2 q 2 t 2 ω d 2 2 q 2 a 2 y t 2 by looking for eigenmodes in the form of y q 1 q 2 y 0 q 1 0 q 2 0 e i w t the stability of modes can be assessed by looking at the sign of their growth rate i m ω re a l ω see appendix fig 5 f i shows the evolution of the growth rates with the parameter ω for different diameter ratios δ using the same mass ratio as in fig 5 a e for small values of the diameter ratio δ 1 4 an unstable mode corresponding to lock in exists in a continuous range of ω for higher diameter ratio two distinct ranges of instability are found a comparison with the dynamics of the non linear system fig 5 a e shows that the linear stability captures the separation of one lock in in two different ones which was found to be causing a decrease in amplitude to further understand this splitting of the two lock ins using eq 7 the range of instability of each mode can be approximated considering that it is decoupled in the interaction with the cylinder of the other mode they would read respectively 8 1 1 a m ω d 1 1 1 a m 1 1 a m ω d 2 1 1 a m fig 6 shows the evolution of the lock in range with δ for the same mass ratio μ 6 1 with the three approaches above a the solution of the full non linear eq 5 b the linear stability analysis of eq 7 and c eq 8 it is shown that the linear stability approach as well as the simple approximation of eq 8 capture reasonably well the effect of δ on lock in let us now propose a simple criteria for loss of lock in when diameters vary based on the results above these two regions of lock in defined by eq 8 will be separated if the lower bound of the higher domain is larger than the upper bound of the lower domain 9 d 1 1 a m d 2 1 a m or equivalently in term of diameter ratio and mass ratio 10 δ 1 a c μ 1 a c μ where c c l 0 16 π 2 s t 2 in fig 7 for all the cases considered in this paper we can plot the critical diameter ratio that causes a drop in amplitude as a function of the mass ratio μ the criterion defined by eq 10 gives a good approximation of the critical diameter ratio except for small mass ratio note that the linear stability analysis presented above for the two section cylinder gives a more conservative prediction 5 discussion and conclusion we have focused here on the particular case of a uniform flow on a cylinder with varying cross section and used a simple model of the interaction between the wake and the cylinder to try and derive a first understanding of the role of the parameters in all the cases we have studied where the cylinder was tapered wavy or with two section a common featured was found in the results of the computations of viv the amplitude of response decreased when the ratio between the maximum and minimum diameter increased the full lock in that occurs when the diameter is uniform enough is lost by using a simple linear stability analysis the loss of lock in can be understood as the inability of the dynamical system to simultaneously accommodate with very different wake oscillators which are the driving force of viv this simple idea can be expressed in a criterion eq 10 which is derived from previous studies on a linear stability approach of viv the comparison with the results of all the computed cases show that the main effects are well captured mainly through the effect of the mass ratio eq 10 is probably applicable to other shapes of cylinders considering that we have analyzed here different shapes tapered two section and wavy with a large range of mass ratio the applicability to the general case of cables with a variable flow profile is under current analysis going back to the more general problem of spanwise variations it is possible to use the present results to address the issue of variations of flow velocity or even simultaneous variations of flow velocity and diameter the more general form of eq 10 would read 11 d u 2 d u 1 1 a c μ 1 a c μ these results would now need to be checked with a much larger set of data including experiments and full solutions of the fluid dynamics coupled with the cylinder dynamics presently no systematic studies give values of critical diameter ratio although the literature cited in the introduction shows a decrease in amplitude when the span wise variations of diameters increase this is a field of current research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financialinterestsor personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a in the linear stability analysis by de langre 2006 the damping terms in the equations have been neglected and the modes considered as y q y 0 q 0 e i ω t so eq 3 become 12 y 0 ω 2 y 0 m ω 2 q 0 q 0 ω 2 q 0 a y 0 ω 2 consequently the frequency equation has been obtained as 13 ω 1 1 a m ω 2 1 1 a m ω 2 2 4 ω 2 2 and solved it has been found that the range 1 1 a m ω 1 1 a m corresponds to the situation when two modes are coincide so the lock in occurs this procedure has been done for the case of two section cylinder and the equation of frequency is obtained by eq 7 as below 14 ω 6 ω 4 ω 2 a m s 1 ω 2 ω s ω 2 h ω 2 a m p ω 4 h 0 where s δ 2 1 δ 1 2 4 δ 2 h δ 1 4 16 δ 2 and p δ 1 4 2 6 δ 1 δ 1 2 16 δ 2 the solution of this frequency equation for a given value of δ gives three solutions at a given value of ω this is illustrated fig 8 the case of high diameter ratio left shows twice the simple linear lock in mechanism described by de langre 2006 where two real frequencies merge into one with a positive grow rate this happens in two separate ranges of ω corresponding to lock in between the wakes of each sections with the cylinder mode conversely fig 8 right shows a case of low diameter ratio where the lock in process is continuous between the two ranges of ω 
21187,elongated cylindrical structures with non uniform diameters under cross flow are often encountered in marine engineering and energy harvesting devices in this work the vortex induced vibrations of elastically supported circular tapered and wavy cylinders with different cross sections areas are studied numerically using a wake oscillator model the effect of the tapering ratio on the amplitude of oscillation is particularly analyzed for tapered cylinders it is found that the amplitude of oscillation under flow decreases strongly when a critical tapering is reached this is consistent with experimental data a similar effect is found in wavy cylinders a third system consisting of a two section cylinder also elastically supported and under cross flow is then considered and the drop in amplitude is related to the ratio between diameters for this system a linear stability analysis of the equations of the coupled fluid solid system allows giving a good approximation of the critical diameter ratio consistently with the tapered cylinder case it is concluded that the critical diameter ratio corresponds to the maximum variation in vortex shedding parameters that the coupled wake cylinder system can support along its length while keeping a consistent vortex shedding keywords vortex induced vibration wake oscillator model linear stability diameter ratio 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv is a form of coupling between a wake and an elastic structure williamson and govardhan 2004 it might lead to fatigue but is also a way to harvest energy by flows grouthier et al 2014 cylinders undergoing viv may not be of uniform cross section tapered and wavy cylinders have been studied in the past for tapered cylinders fig 1 a several authors bargi et al 2015 hover et al 1998 kaja et al 2016 techet et al 1998 seyed aghazadeh et al 2015 zeinoddini et al 2013 have shown that a strongly tapering almost suppresses viv in their work different cylinders in terms of mass ratios and tapering ratios have been studied numerically and experimentally differences and similarities have been found between linearly tapered cylinders subject to uniform flow and uniform cylinders subject linearly sheared flow balasubramanian and skop 1996 parnaudeau et al 2007 balasubramanian showed a similar oscillating behavior for the two cases some authors analyzed the cellular vortex shedding for a tapered cylinder mathelin and de langre 2005 narasimhamurthy et al 2009 for wavy cylinders fig 1 b the wake and in consequence viv are also affected by the amplitude and wavelength of the waviness as well as the heading angle in elliptical wavy cylinders balasubramanian and skop 1996 lam et al 2004 lam and lin 2009 lee and nguyen 2007 zhao et al 2011 zou et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 assi and bearman 2018 more generally span wise variations of geometry or flow characteristics are at the first order equivalent to diameter variations simulation of viv can be done by using reduced order models such as wake oscillator models païdoussis et al 2010 in this approach the wake dynamics is presented by a single variable that satisfies a van de pol equation this is coupled to the dynamics of the cylinder see for instance facchinetti et al 2004a where it has been shown that the acceleration coupling is the most appropriate forcing of the bluff body by using this nonlinear coupled system the main features of viv phenomenology can be reproduced this model has been applied to a large variety of cases with non uniform flows with rigid cylinder and flexible tensioned cable mathelin and de langre 2005 srinil et al 2009 violette et al 2007 xu et al 2008 the first use of a wake oscillator model to study viv of tapered cylinders was done by balasubramanian and skop 1996 but the drop in amplitude for high tapering was not recovered the wake oscillator model has also been used to study the response of a tensioned cable subjected to flow with different velocity profiles and different boundary conditions the results showed that the simple wake oscillator model can model the important features of dynamics of long cylinders such as waves generated in cables de langre 2006 used a linear stability analysis to analyze the lock in mechanism viv the linear stability analyses of the coupled equations have also been applied to waves generated in the cable the cable under non uniform flow and the competition of unstable wave systems have been discussed as well de langre 2006 gao et al 2018 2019 violette et al 2007 2010 xu et al 2008 considered the applicability of the nonlinear wake oscillator to high aspect ratio risers and performed experiment to validate their numerical results in the present paper we analyze the response of cylinders with different cross sections in three steps first we apply the wake oscillator approach of facchinetti et al 2004a to the case of tapered cylinders and wavy cylinders in the scope of predicting the reduction of amplitude of viv that occurs for strong variation of diameters as a kind of loss of lock in a simpler case of a two section cylinder is then analyzed in a second approach based on de langre 2006 we perform a linear stability analysis of the coupled wake structure system this allows finding approximations of the range of flow velocity where lock in occurs finally in a third approach as an extension of the linear stability approach a simple criteria for loss of lock in is proposed section 2 presents the wake oscillator approach section 3 the application for different cylinders shown in fig 1 section 4 describes the linear stability analysis and the simple criteria 2 wake oscillator model in this section we recall the main features of the wake oscillator model in facchinetti et al 2004a and we extend it to the case of varying cross section the van der pol wake oscillator model has been used for describing the dynamics of the wake behind the cylinder as 1 2 q t 2 ε q 2 1 q t q f here q t is the dimensionless wake variable which is associated to the transverse unsteady lift force q 2 c l c l 0 where c l is the lift coefficient and c l 0 is the reference lift coefficient in a fixed structure subjected to the vortex shedding in eq 1 f is the effect of the motion of the cylinder on the fluid wake oscillator this can be written as a 2 y t 2 here a and ε are parameters that have been determined from experiments for circular cylinders facchinetti et al 2004a in fig 2 an elastically supported rigid cylinder is shown with diameter d and mass m subjected to a steady uniform flow of velocity u this body is restricted to have only movement in the cross flow direction y the movement of the cylinder can be described by a linear oscillator 2 m 2 y t 2 r y t h y

modeling both the viscous dissipation r s 2 m ζ ω s and the added damping r f γ μ m ω f see facchinetti et al 2004a we define the parameters ζ as the structure reduced damping ω s h m the natural frequency of the structure γ c d 4 π s t as the stall parameter related to the drag coefficient c d ω f the frequency of vortex shedding μ m ρ d 2 the mass ratio m c l 0 16 π 2 s t 2 μ the mass number s t the strouhal number and finally s the exerted force from vortex to cylinder in dimensionless form the coupled equations for a uniform cylinder are facchinetti et al 2004a 3 2 y t 2 2 ζ γ μ ω y t y m ω 2 q 2 q t 2 ε ω q 2 1 q t ω 2 q a y we can extent this formulation to a spanwise varying diameter d z as 4 2 y t 2 2 ζ y t y z 0 λ m ω 2 d z q γ μ ω y t d z 2 q t 2 ε ω d z q 2 1 q t ω d z 2 q a y

r is the reduced angular frequency here q z t and d z depend on the spanwise coordinate z eq 4 can be solved numerically in time as in the research of facchinetti et al 2004a but with a series of wake oscillator in the spanwize direction see facchinetti et al 2002 the limit cycle in terms of its amplitude that is reached after a transient from a non zero initial condition is then analyzed as a function of the parameters ω s t u r the shedding frequency and τ l d m a x d m i n mathelin and de langre 2005 the tapering ratio for the tapered cylinder and for the wavy cylinder the ratio d m a x d m i n and the wavelength it was shown that taking into account the diffusion of the wake dynamics in the spanwise direction did not affect significantly the results facchinetti et al 2002 mathelin and de langre 2005 the validation of the van der pol wake oscillator model has been the topic of many papers balasubramanian et al 1996 used nonlinear diffusively coupled wake oscillators to study uniform cylinders and cones under different flow conditions and validated their results against experimental results in facchinetti et al 2002 the wake oscillator approach was used to model the time evolution of vortex shedding over a wavy cylinder in relation to the work of balasubramanian and skop 1996 and bearman and owen 1998 facchinetti et al 2004a studied the coupling of the wake oscillator with a single structural oscillator and compared the results with experiments and other models cables with different conditions have also been studied and the results validated against experiments facchinetti et al 2004b violette et al 2007 2010 more recently cables and risers have been modeled using wake oscillators and the results compared with experiments and dns gao et al 2018 2019 lin et al 2009 xu et al 2008 all the comparisons with experiments or cfd have shown that the wake oscillator can represent qualitatively most of the features of viv and qualitatively some aspects considering its simplicity it is now used in many applications as well as in the analysis of the dynamics of these systems 3 loss of lock in 3 1 tapered cylinder we first apply eq 4 to the tapered cylinder case corresponding to the experiments of zeinoddini et al 2013 μ 6 1 λ 14 28 fig 3 a d shows the normalized amplitude of viv as a function of ω s t u r for four different levels of tapering in those figures the amplitude of vibration of cylinders have been normalized with the amplitude of uniform cylinder with the same characteristics and have been indicated by y y u n i f o r m at τ 60 and τ 30 the lock in is similar to that of a uniform cylinder in those cases τ 60 and τ 30 most of the cylinder is near the diameter at which lock in occurs for τ 25 and τ 20 the amplitude is much smaller because only a part of the cylinder has a diameter corresponding to the lock in condition by systematically exploring the values of τ the evolution of the maximum of the response curve can be plotted fig 3 e a sharp change at τ 27 is observed corresponding to unlock in we can define a critical value of the tapering ratio were unlock in occurs by the center of the s shaped curve or the point of maximum slope here at τ 27 the experimental data by zeinoddini et al 2013 for uniform and tapered at τ 20 are also shown in fig 3 e as and δ respectively the same analysis can be done for the case studied in seyed aghazadeh et al 2015 μ 7 6 λ 19 61 a similar unlock in is observed at about τ 40 fig 3 right the change in these two cases show that the strong decrease of viv amplitude occurs when the tapering is strong enough low tapering ratio the critical tapering ratio where the shift occurs seems to depend on mass ratio which differs between the two cases the experimental data of seyed aghazadeh et al 2015 is also shown in fig 3 j as and for tapered and uniform cylinders respectively but do not show any apparent loss of lock in 3 2 wavy cylinder for wavy cylinders fig 1 b another parameter is used to describe the spanwise variation of the diameter the diameter ratio δ d m a x d m i n the mass ratio and the length to mean diameter ratio are set to 6 1 and 14 28 respectively as in the first case of tapered cylinder above the wavelength of the sinusoidal variation of the diameter is set to l 2 or l 8 fig 4 shows the evolution of the amplitude of motion with the diameter ratio δ by increasing the variation of diameter the maximum amplitude of oscillation decreases and shifts to higher reduced velocity as in the tapered cases in both wavy cylinders a drop of amplitude is found near δ 1 5 note that this drop of amplitude depends on the mass ratio but weakly on the wavelength of diameter variation except for low mass ratio as is illustrated fig 4 k 3 3 two section cylinder to gain a better understanding of the drop in viv amplitude found for the two systems above we consider the simpler more generic case of a two section cylinder see fig 1 c now the diameter ratio δ is simply the ratio of the two diameters for that case the wake variable q z t reduces to two variables q 1 t and q 2 t so that eq 4 become 5 2 y t 2 2 ζ γ μ ω y t y m ω 2 q 1 d 1 q 2 d 2 2 2 q 1 t 2 ε ω d 1 q 1 2 1 q 1 t ω d 1 2 q 1 a 2 y t 2 2 q 2 t 2 ε ω d 2 q 2 2 1 q 2 t ω d 2 2 q 2 a 2 y t 2 where d 1 and d 2 are the upper and lower diameter ratios respectively the aforementioned equations are solved for this case and the results are represented in fig 5 fig 5 a d show the evolution of the viv response when the diameter ratio is increased the classical lock in response curve fig 5 a shifts to a double lock in curve fig 5 d for higher diameter ratios in between the amplitude is reduced as no common frequency of lock in can be found fig 5 e represents the amplitudes of motion as a function of the diameter ratio clearly the splitting of the lock in response in two separated lock in responses results in a drop of the amplitude of response here near δ 1 75 this is similar to the cases of a tapered or wavy cylinder shown before as the ratio between diameters along the cylinder becomes larger no common lock in is found for the coupled dynamical system and this results in a drop of amplitude there is a similarity in the shifting to the double lock in situation for the two section and the wavy cylinders when considering the distribution of diameters a large part of the wavy and two section cylinders have a diameter close to the extreme values conversely the tapered cylinder has a uniform distribution of diameters so the wavy cylinders and the two section cylinder have similar behaviors as we can observe in the second row of fig 4 4 a simple criteria for loss of lock in in the results of the cases computed above it appears that the amplitude of viv drops when the ratio between diameters along the cylinder becomes too large in the tapered cylinder and the wavy cylinder a strong diameter ratio results in a very strong drop of amplitude for the two section cylinder the amplitude of motion is not so strongly reduced as new lock in ranges reappear for high diameter ratios it seems that the mechanism at the origin of amplitude decrease with non uniform diameters is related to the inability of the dynamical system to accommodate with wakes of too different natural frequencies this can be analyzed on the simpler system of the two section cylinder in that case two wake variables coexist that are governed by wake oscillator equations with two distinct frequencies see eq 5 we now use the approach of a linear stability analysis of the set of coupled equations following the work of de langre 2006 in that approach the modes of the coupled system made linear are computed and it has been shown that lock in of the full non linear system corresponds to the existence of an unstable mode in the linear stability analysis in the simple case of uniform flow the range of lock in can be easily computed see in appendix and reads 6 1 1 a m ω 1 1 a m in the more general case of the two section cylinders following the research work of de langre 2006 we remove from eq 5 the non linear terms and the damping terms they become 7 2 y t 2 y m ω 2 q 1 d 1 q 2 d 2 2 2 q 1 t 2 ω d 1 2 q 1 a 2 y t 2 2 q 2 t 2 ω d 2 2 q 2 a 2 y t 2 by looking for eigenmodes in the form of y q 1 q 2 y 0 q 1 0 q 2 0 e i w t the stability of modes can be assessed by looking at the sign of their growth rate i m ω re a l ω see appendix fig 5 f i shows the evolution of the growth rates with the parameter ω for different diameter ratios δ using the same mass ratio as in fig 5 a e for small values of the diameter ratio δ 1 4 an unstable mode corresponding to lock in exists in a continuous range of ω for higher diameter ratio two distinct ranges of instability are found a comparison with the dynamics of the non linear system fig 5 a e shows that the linear stability captures the separation of one lock in in two different ones which was found to be causing a decrease in amplitude to further understand this splitting of the two lock ins using eq 7 the range of instability of each mode can be approximated considering that it is decoupled in the interaction with the cylinder of the other mode they would read respectively 8 1 1 a m ω d 1 1 1 a m 1 1 a m ω d 2 1 1 a m fig 6 shows the evolution of the lock in range with δ for the same mass ratio μ 6 1 with the three approaches above a the solution of the full non linear eq 5 b the linear stability analysis of eq 7 and c eq 8 it is shown that the linear stability approach as well as the simple approximation of eq 8 capture reasonably well the effect of δ on lock in let us now propose a simple criteria for loss of lock in when diameters vary based on the results above these two regions of lock in defined by eq 8 will be separated if the lower bound of the higher domain is larger than the upper bound of the lower domain 9 d 1 1 a m d 2 1 a m or equivalently in term of diameter ratio and mass ratio 10 δ 1 a c μ 1 a c μ where c c l 0 16 π 2 s t 2 in fig 7 for all the cases considered in this paper we can plot the critical diameter ratio that causes a drop in amplitude as a function of the mass ratio μ the criterion defined by eq 10 gives a good approximation of the critical diameter ratio except for small mass ratio note that the linear stability analysis presented above for the two section cylinder gives a more conservative prediction 5 discussion and conclusion we have focused here on the particular case of a uniform flow on a cylinder with varying cross section and used a simple model of the interaction between the wake and the cylinder to try and derive a first understanding of the role of the parameters in all the cases we have studied where the cylinder was tapered wavy or with two section a common featured was found in the results of the computations of viv the amplitude of response decreased when the ratio between the maximum and minimum diameter increased the full lock in that occurs when the diameter is uniform enough is lost by using a simple linear stability analysis the loss of lock in can be understood as the inability of the dynamical system to simultaneously accommodate with very different wake oscillators which are the driving force of viv this simple idea can be expressed in a criterion eq 10 which is derived from previous studies on a linear stability approach of viv the comparison with the results of all the computed cases show that the main effects are well captured mainly through the effect of the mass ratio eq 10 is probably applicable to other shapes of cylinders considering that we have analyzed here different shapes tapered two section and wavy with a large range of mass ratio the applicability to the general case of cables with a variable flow profile is under current analysis going back to the more general problem of spanwise variations it is possible to use the present results to address the issue of variations of flow velocity or even simultaneous variations of flow velocity and diameter the more general form of eq 10 would read 11 d u 2 d u 1 1 a c μ 1 a c μ these results would now need to be checked with a much larger set of data including experiments and full solutions of the fluid dynamics coupled with the cylinder dynamics presently no systematic studies give values of critical diameter ratio although the literature cited in the introduction shows a decrease in amplitude when the span wise variations of diameters increase this is a field of current research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financialinterestsor personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a in the linear stability analysis by de langre 2006 the damping terms in the equations have been neglected and the modes considered as y q y 0 q 0 e i ω t so eq 3 become 12 y 0 ω 2 y 0 m ω 2 q 0 q 0 ω 2 q 0 a y 0 ω 2 consequently the frequency equation has been obtained as 13 ω 1 1 a m ω 2 1 1 a m ω 2 2 4 ω 2 2 and solved it has been found that the range 1 1 a m ω 1 1 a m corresponds to the situation when two modes are coincide so the lock in occurs this procedure has been done for the case of two section cylinder and the equation of frequency is obtained by eq 7 as below 14 ω 6 ω 4 ω 2 a m s 1 ω 2 ω s ω 2 h ω 2 a m p ω 4 h 0 where s δ 2 1 δ 1 2 4 δ 2 h δ 1 4 16 δ 2 and p δ 1 4 2 6 δ 1 δ 1 2 16 δ 2 the solution of this frequency equation for a given value of δ gives three solutions at a given value of ω this is illustrated fig 8 the case of high diameter ratio left shows twice the simple linear lock in mechanism described by de langre 2006 where two real frequencies merge into one with a positive grow rate this happens in two separate ranges of ω corresponding to lock in between the wakes of each sections with the cylinder mode conversely fig 8 right shows a case of low diameter ratio where the lock in process is continuous between the two ranges of ω 
21188,this paper considers the reflection and transmission of flexural gravity waves by a pair of bottom mounted rectangular barriers of arbitrary height and width depth of the fluid considered here is finite but not necessarily uniform the fluid region is bounded by an infinite long thin ice sheet of homogeneous properties using linearized water wave theory the velocity potential associated with the motion is formulated eigenfunction matching technique is used to convert the boundary value problem to a set of integral equations which are solved by using multi term galerkin method the reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated and represented graphically an expression for the energy balance relation is given and checked carefully a model of the problem in which the fluid is bounded by a free surface is recovered for a set of physical parameters the results are analyzed through a number of figures the convergence and correctness of the method is confirmed by comparing the results with the one available in the literature it is shown that a pair of thick bottom mounted barriers have significant impact on reflected and transmitted flexural gravity waves resonance effects are observed and verified for different parameters of the current problem keywords water wave scattering ice cover bottom mounted barriers integral equations multi term galerkin method reflection and transmission coefficients resonance reflection 1 introduction a class of problems associated with scattering of water waves by a breakwater such as thick barriers of various configurations has been studied extensively by many researchers during the last few decades water wave scattering involving thick vertical barriers with rectangular cross section present in uniform finite depth water was first considered by mei and black 1969 they have adopted almost similar formulations as in the works of newman 1965 and miles 1967 for problems of a step shelf guiney et al 1972 studied wave propagation through a small slit in a thick vertical barrier using conformal mapping method liu and wu 1986 used the method of matched asymptotic expansions to study the diffraction of oblique waves by an infinite vertical barrier with a small slit in deep water kanoria et al 1999 analyzed normal scattering of surface wave by a thick vertical barrier of four different configurations by employing eigenfunction expansion method along with multi term galerkin approximations involving ultraspherical gegenbauer polynomials later mandal and kanoria 2000 extended the work of kanoria et al 1999 by considering oblique incidence recently there is a considerable interests in the field of research considering wave interaction with permeable and or elastic breakwaters in water liu et al 2012 considered the problem of wave scattering by a submerged horizontal porous plate of finite thickness using matched eigenfunction expansions hu and liu 2018 introduced a general analytical solution for wave scattering by permeable breakwaters by employing linear potential theory and the method of eigenfunction expansion hu et al 2019 extended the formulation of hu and liu 2018 to consider the oblique incident waves and to deal with multi layered breakwaters a poro elastic model of submerged breakwaters in finite depth fluid was considered by lan et al 2011 to study the bragg scattering of water waves based on the linear wave theory in this work the improved biot s theory of poro elastic media with suitable matching conditions was applied research on wave propagation in water with very large floating structures vlfs have gained considerable interest to the engineers and scientists working on offshore operations in last few years the surface wave propagating beneath the elastic plate is commonly termed as flexural gravity wave the hydroelastic and hydrodynamic behavior of the floating plate are important due to their ability to affect the motion of flexural gravity waves conversely the effects of wave on large floating plate has drawn attention due their practical importance such as to predict the strength of the plate the research motivated by vlfs is described in sturova and korobkin 2005 sturova 2008 2014 in the last few decades a considerable number of research work have been done which aim to study wave propagation through marginal ice zone miz in the polar regions as we know that when the floating ice increases its thickness or the wave period of incoming wave is short very little of wave energy can penetrates the ice cover therefore the reflected and transmitted wave amplitude depends highly on ice thickness as well as the wave period fox and squire 1990 on scattering of oblique wave caused by a narrow crack in ice sheets floating on water of finite depth have been studied by evans and porter 2003 using eigenfunction expansion method and green s function approach porter and evans 2006 extended the work of evans and porter 2003 by considering any finite number of cracks vaughan and squire 2006 studied the propagation of waves under an ice sheet of variable thickness which is interpolated using low order piecewise polynomials porter 2019 proposed a semi analytic approach to study the wave propagation through thin rectangular elastic plates floating on water on topics in the general area of ocean wave or sea ice interactions especially in relation to mathematical modelling have been described by the review paper of squire 2007 it is well known that flexural gravity waves cannot propagate at a speed less than a certain value which depends on the thickness of the ice its physical and mechanical properties and the bottom depth see kheisin 1967 such a situation is possible when the frequency of flexural waves in the ice cover will correspond to the frequency of gravitational waves on the surface of the liquid as a result the archimedean force ceases to act and the balance of the ice cover is achieved only by elastic forces a resonance effect occurs the critical periods of fluctuation of flexural gravity waves are close to the periods of waves arising in the ocean due to a storm so wind generated waves can shake the ice cover which can cause the destruction of ice fields in the arctic as well as shore ice the scientific work c f zemlyak et al 2018 2019 experimentally shows that when the flexural gravity waves overcome the bottom unevenness their ice breaking ability increases sharply the ice destruction can transform waves and dissipate their energy kozin et al 2010 described a numerical model to study the stress strain state of broken ice cover due to motion of a submarine surface waves traveling from a long distance penetrates into the ice covered zone and attenuate gradually these waves has the ability break up the ice sheet and may accelerate the melting rate of sea ice it is observed that the presence of obstacles inside the fluid region has noticeable effect on propagation of flexural gravity waves in polar regions thus it is of practical importance to study wave structure interaction in ice covered region das and mandal 2006 investigated the scattering of obliquely incident waves by a long circular cylinder submerged in deep water beneath an ice cover using green s function technique bhattacharjee and soares 2012 investigated the behavior of flexural gravity waves propagating along a semi infinite floating ice sheet near a vertical wall using multipoles method das and thakur 2013 studied water wave scattering by a sphere submerged in uniform finite depth water bounded by ice cover korobkin et al 2018 studied the problem of flexural gravity wave diffraction by a bottom mounted structure with vertical walls in an ice covered finite depth fluid using the method of vertical modes in the work of kanoria et al 1999 geometry of the problem is considered to be symmetric and the wave interact with a single obstacle present in the fluid but in reality configuration of the problem may not be symmetric moreover there may be multiple number of obstacles at the fluid bottom for which the scattering happen more than once therefore it will be worthy to consider a general configuration of the fluid domain with multiple rectangular barriers during winter in cold regions surface of the sea water is frozen into large sheet of thin ice and melted down in the summer in this research our aim is to model a problem in which the ice effect can be incorporated and applied in various practical situations so we have considered the problem of flexural gravity wave scattering by a pair of thick vertical submerged barriers of arbitrary height and width depth the fluid is considered to be finite but not necessarily uniform surface of the fluid is assumed to be covered by a very thin infinite sheet of ice of uniform flexural rigidity so that the motion of the ice sheet is governed by a kirchhoff model based on eigenfunction matching method the problem is transformed to a set of integral equations involving unknown functions associated with horizontal velocity of motion above the barriers multi term galerkin technique with a suitably chosen basis function is adopted to calculate the unknown functions numerically it must be noted that in presence of thick barriers the unknown functions possess cubic root singularity near the sharp edge of the barriers porter 1995 proposed a basis function involving ultraspherical gegenbauer polynomials and was used by evans and fernyhough 1995 in their research on edge waves traveling along a periodic coastline consisting of a straight and vertical cliff face as we have considered the barriers at different depths therefore the edge conditions are not unique characteristics of various parameters namely length and phase velocity of flexural gravity waves in a finite depth water are verified numerically hydrodynamic properties such as reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated numerically at different wave modes accuracy of the results are verified up to five decimal places advantages of the multi term over single term galerkin method are confirmed through a table at different value of the parameters graph of both the coefficients are analyzed the energy balance relation satisfied by reflection and transmission coefficients can be obtained due to a pair of bottom mounted thick barriers resonance effect on flexural gravity wave is considered and significant effects have been observed motivation of the present work is due to the construction of offshore structures in ice covered waters this study can further be extended to estimate the ice breaking possibilities considered frequently in various engineering problems 2 mathematical formulation a three dimensional cartesian coordinate system is chosen with y axis pointing vertically downwards into the fluid region and the plane y 0 aligned with the undisturbed ice free surface of water the fluid is assumed to be of constant density ρ w have finite depth and bounded above by thin sheet of floating ice suppose the ice sheet is of thickness d density ρ i flexural rigidity d the expression for flexural rigidity of the ice is d e d 3 12 1 ν 2 ρ g where g being the acceleration due to gravity e is the young s modulus ν is the poisson s ratio we consider a pair of rectangular barriers submerged in the fluid at depths h 2 and h 4 beneath the ice sheet respectively we divide the fluid region into five subregions given by ω 1 x a 0 y h 1 ω 2 a x 0 0 y h 2 ω 3 0 x b 0 y h 3 ω 4 b x c 0 y h 4 ω 5 x c 0 y h 5 the geometry of the present problem being shown in fig 1 assuming irrotational time harmonic motion in the fluid of angular frequency ω and the wave is incident from the negative infinity with an angle θ we denote the wavenumber of incident wave by k 1 0 so that α 1 0 k 1 0 cos θ and μ k 1 0 sin θ the resulting motion in the fluid is characterized by velocity potential r e φ x

governed by euler bernoulli thin elastic plate model so that the linearized boundary condition on the underside of ice sheet is given as 2 2 d x 2 μ 2 2 1 δ φ y k φ 0 in x y 0 where k ω 2 g submergence of ice sheet about y 0 depends on the ice thickness via δ ρ i ω 2 d ρ w g conditions along the rigid bottom of the fluid and horizontal boundary of the barriers are given by 2 3 φ y 0 on x

respectively eqns 4 2 4 3 yield the constants a j k n j 1 2 3 4 k 1 2 so that we can get 4 15 b 1 k n 0 n a 1 k n χ 1 n b 2 k n 0 n a 2 k n χ 2 n for k 1 2 and therefore the reflection and transmission coefficients are obtained easily from eqn 3 15 5 analysis and discussion in this section the physical quantities such as wavelength phase velocity reflected and transmitted amplitude of flexural gravity waves are numerically calculated and plotted in different graphs for various values of the parameters like ice thickness d flexural rigidity d incidence angle θ various lengths etc in the subsequent calculations we have used e 5 g p a ν 0 3 ρ w 1025 0 k g m 3 ρ i 922 5 k g m 3 and g 9 81 m s 2 the fluid depth h 1 of ω 1 is considered to be 500 m and parameters are non dimensionalized with the length scale of h 1 the ratio of amplitude of reflected wave to incident at a distance far from the obstacle is termed as reflection coefficient in this problem we have considered an incident flexural gravity wave of unit amplitude similarly the transmission coefficients can be defined we denote the absolute amplitude of the reflection and transmission coefficients by c r and c t respectively 5 1 flexural gravity wave characteristics suppose depth of the fluid be h and bounded by a thin ice sheet of thickness d the dispersion equation of the flexural gravity wave is given by 5 1 ω 2 g k d k 4 1 ε ω 2 g tanh k h where ε ρ i ρ w d in fig 2 we have discussed the effects of depth h on wave length λ 2 π k and phase velocity c ω k as a function of angular frequency ω the parameters in equation 5 1 are non dimensionalize with respect to the length l 500 m mathematically we have considered d l 4 0 01 and ε 0 001 it is clear from the figure that the wavelength increases with increasing fluid depth for a fluid of depth 500 m or high it is that the curves almost coincide at higher frequencies ω 0 2 as the depth increase phase velocity of flexural gravity waves increases at high frequencies the phase velocities of flexural gravity wave in deep water are equal fig 3 shows the effect of flexural rigidity on wavelength and phase velocity as a function of ω we have considered h l 0 5 and ε 0 001 it is observed that the wavelength increases with increasing flexural rigidity of the wave at low frequencies ω 0 098 the wavelengths are equal it can be seen from the figure that length of flexural gravity waves i e when d l 4 0 are higher than the water waves i e when d l 4 0 the phase velocities increase with increasing flexural rigidity of wave at low frequency the phase velocity of water wave and flexural gravity wave are same 5 2 accuracy and convergence of results here we check the accuracy and convergence of the n 1 term galerkin technique used in the present research in table 1 the results for reflection coefficients c r are computed at different truncated number m in the expansion of the velocity potential it can be seen clearly from the table that a three figure accuracy of the values of reflection coefficients is confirmed by considering 25 evanescent modes in table 2 the numerical values of reflection coefficients are tabulated at different n at n 5 the results are accurate up to three decimal place therefore we fix m 25 and n 5 to calculate c r and c t in this section it must be noted that higher accuracy of the results can also be obtained using larger values of m and n 5 3 the energy balance relation here we check the present semi analytic method through an energy balance relation this relation describes how incident energy distributed among the reflected and transmitted waves this conservation relation is obtained by applying green s second identity on the functions φ x y and φ x y over the fluid region if depths of the regions ω 1 and ω 5 are equal then the energy balance relation can be obtained as 5 2 c r 2 c t 2 1 however the depths of ω 1 and ω 5 are different c r and c t satisfies the following identity 5 3 c r 2 j c t 2 1 where j α 5 0 c 5 0 α 1 0 c 1 0 for different values of k h 1 the above relations 5 2 5 3 can be verified as in the last column of table 3 and table 4 which certainly gives a partial check on the validation of the problem studied here table 3 represents set of values c r c t and c r 2 c t 2 as a function of the wavenumber k h 1 associated with the problem of wave scattering by two thick barriers of equal height and width the fluid being considered to be of uniform depth i e h 1 h 3 h 5 the table shows that for a pair of symmetric barriers in a fluid of depth h 1 c r and c t satisfies the energy identity 5 2 on the other hand when the fluid is not of uniform depth the coefficients satisfy the identity 5 3 which are shown in table 4 these two tables implies the correctness of the numerical results obtained in the present manuscript from the results it is clear that in a fluid with unequal depth c t may exceed the value unity which was not observed for uniform depth fluids 5 4 approximation to single barrier problem correctness of the present work is verified through several limiting solutions corresponding to a single barrier problem available in the literature in figs 4 5 we consider h 2 h 1 h 3 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 h 5 h 1 1 b h 1 0 001 and d h 1 0 therefore for normal incidence the present problem reduced to the one considered by kanoria et al 1999 and for oblique incidence this research coincide with mandal and kanoria 2000 fig 4 presents the results for c r as a function of k h 1 for the case of single rectangular barrier at different thickness it is noticed that the results in figure 3 of kanoria et al 1999 are recovered the graphs shows that the reflection coefficients become more oscillatory as the thickness of the barrier increases and at higher wavenumber these coefficients becomes zero asymptotically for oblique incidence c r are depicted at different angle it is observed as expected that the amplitude of reflection coefficients decreases and the number of zeros decrease with increase in incidence angle this observation is similar to wave reflection by a thick rectangular barrier as in mandal and kanoria 2000 the influence of ice cover on oblique scattering of waves by a thick rectangular barrier is presented in fig 6 we have considered ice sheet of three different thickness viz 0 m 1 m and 2 5 m floating over a fluid of depth 500 m so that d h 1 0 0 001 and 0 005 respectively depth of the fluid in ω 5 is considered to be 450 m deep below the ice cover so that h 5 h 1 0 9 the other non dimensional parameters are considered as a h 1 1 b h 1 0 001 c h 1 1 h 2 h 1 h 3 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 and θ 45 o the absolute values of reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated as a function of dimensionless wavenumber k h 1 and depicted in fig 6 it can be seen that the zeros of reflection coefficients increases with increasing rigidity of the ice sheet the amplitude of c r at higher values of k h 1 amplifies due to the ice sheet on the other hand c r diminishes as the values of k h 1 increases the transmission coefficients c t show the opposite behavior at different values of k h 1 in fig 7 the absolute values of reflection and transmission coefficients versus the non dimensional wavenumber k h 1 are depicted for three different width of a barrier viz 5 m 250 m and 500 m therefore we consider a h 1 c h 1 0 01 a h 1 c h 1 0 5 a h 1 c h 1 1 the other parameters are b h 1 0 001 d h 1 0 002 h 2 h 1 h 3 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 h 5 h 1 0 9 θ 45 o clearly it is seen that in a ice covered fluid the oscillatory nature of c r and c t increases with increasing width of the barrier this behavior is quite natural for wide barriers multiple interaction between ends of a thick barrier occur 5 5 wave scattering by pair of barriers now we analyze the results for the case of a pair of bottom mounted thick barriers in fig 8 the absolute reflection and transmission coefficients for the case of single and a pair if thick barriers are compared the coefficients are depicted as a function of wavenumber k h 1 for single barrier we consider a h 1 c h 1 0 5 b h 1 0 001 h 2 h 1 h 3 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 and for pair of bottom mounted barriers we take a h 1 1 b h 1 2 c h 1 3 h 2 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 h 3 h 1 1 the other parameter are d h 1 0 002 h 5 h 1 0 9 and θ 45 o it is clear that increase in number of barriers may increase the amplitude of reflection moreover the oscillation in c r and c t increases with increasing number of barriers due to multiple interaction between the barriers the effects of fluid depth in ω 3 are shown in fig 9 we consider a fluid of depth 500 m i e h 1 h 5 500 m so that h 5 h 1 1 at different depth h 3 h 1 1 2 1 0 8 the reflection and transmission coefficients are depicted for a h 1 1 b h 1 2 c h 1 3 d h 1 0 002 h 2 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 and θ 45 o it can be seen that the depth h 3 h 1 has very negligible effect on c r and c t therefore we fix h 3 h 1 1 in rest of the analysis results for flexural gravity waves obliquely incident upon a pair of bottom mounted thick barriers are presented in fig 10 at different depth of ω 5 the reflection and transmission coefficients are plotted as a function of k h 1 for a h 1 1 b h 1 2 c h 1 3 d h 1 0 002 h 2 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 h 3 h 1 1 θ 45 o and h 5 h 1 1 0 9 0 8 it is observed that for non uniform fluid depths the reflection coefficients never become zero and c t may exceed the value one therefore in a fluid of non uniform depth zero reflection or complete transmission is not possible at higher values of k h 1 fig 11 display c r and c t against the wavenumber k h 1 for three different thickness of the ice sheet d h 1 0 0 002 and 0 005 respectively the non dimensional parameters considered are a h 1 1 b h 1 2 c h 1 3 h 2 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 h 3 h 1 1 h 5 h 1 0 9 and θ 45 o it is observed that c r oscillates with increasing k h 1 and diminishes gradually as k h 1 increases the maximum value of c r are also increase with increasing thickness of ice sheet this figure shows that ice cover has a noticeable impact on wave propagation over a pair of bottom mounted thick barriers indeed from this figure we may conclude that as the flexural rigidity of ice sheet increases the amplitude of wave reflection also increases after a certain value of k h 1 here k h 1 1 48 now we check the effects of increasing angle of incidence on c r and c t for a h 1 1 b h 1 2 c h 1 3 d h 1 0 002 h 2 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 h 3 h 1 1 and h 5 h 1 0 9 in fig 12 the absolute values of reflection and transmission coefficients are shown for three different angle θ 0 o θ 30 o and θ 45 o as expected it is observed that in presence of pair of thick barriers the amplitude of reflection coefficient decreases with increasing angle of incidence the transmission coefficients behave in opposite manner it is also found that oscillatory nature of the coefficients decreases with increasing θ in figs 13 15 we verify the results for different height of the barriers graphs for c r and c t against k h 1 for different height of the barrier in ω 2 i e h 1 h 2 are plotted in fig 13 we consider three different heights namely 100 m 150 m 200 m while the height of the barrier in ω 4 is kept fixed at 250 m width of the barriers is 1000 m in numerical calculation we have considered a h 1 2 b h 1 0 2 c h 1 2 2 d h 1 0 002 h 4 h 1 0 5 h 3 h 1 1 h 5 h 1 0 9 θ 45 o and h 2 h 1 0 8 0 7 0 6 due to asymmetry of the barriers the reflection coefficients never become zero except at k h 1 0 as the difference between height of the barriers increases the amplitude of reflection coefficients also increase in this case the transmission coefficient found to be more than one in the vicinity of k h 1 0 as in previous figure in fig 14 we verify the results for different heights of the barrier in ω 4 while height of the other barrier is taken fixed for this we assume h 4 h 1 0 8 0 7 0 6 h 2 h 1 0 5 and the other parameters are remain same if we compare this figure with fig 13 we may draw the conclusion that in the present configuration of barriers amplitude of reflection coefficients are shorter and therefore the transmission coefficients has the opposite behavior in fig 15 the reflection and transmission coefficients versus the wavenumber k h 1 are plotted for two symmetric thick barriers of different height it is considered that the regions ω 2 and ω 4 have equal depth the results are depicted at three different depths viz 300 m 250 m and 200 m for which h 2 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 6 0 5 0 4 respectively the other parameters in numerical computation are a h 1 2 b h 1 0 2 c h 1 2 2 d h 1 0 002 h 3 h 1 1 h 5 h 1 0 9 θ 45 o it is clear that the amplitude of reflection coefficients increase with increasing height of the barriers indeed the oscillatory nature of reflection coefficients increase with increasing hight of barriers further it is observed that the transmission coefficient attains the highest amplitude at very small 0 2 or very large 5 values of k h 1 it may be noticed from figs 13 15 that the asymmetric model of the barriers produces less reflection than a symmetric one in fig 16 c r and c t are depicted as a function of non dimensional wavenumber k h 1 for three different width of the barriers viz 10 m 250 m and 500 m so we take b h 1 1 d h 1 0 002 h 2 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 h 3 h 1 1 h 5 h 1 0 9 θ 45 o and a h 1 c b h 1 0 02 0 5 1 it can be observed that the coefficients are oscillatory in nature and the oscillation increases with increasing width of the barriers as the fluid depth is non uniform the reflection coefficient vanishes only when k h 1 0 consequently the transmission coefficients may exceed the value unity as k h 1 0 in fig 17 we present the graphs for the reflection and transmission coefficients as a function of k h 1 at three different distances between two symmetric barriers in a fluid of uniform depth we take a h 1 1 d h 1 0 002 h 2 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 h 3 h 1 h 5 h 1 1 θ 45 o and b h 1 c h 1 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 it is found that fluctuation of the coefficients increase with increasing distance of the barriers indeed the number of zeros of reflection coefficients increase as the value of b h 1 increases 5 6 bragg resonance scattering here we analyze the reflection and transmission coefficients for normally incident waves of length λ depth of the ocean in ω j j 1 3 5 are considered to be equal we also consider height of the thick barriers be equal so that h 2 h 4 we define a length l a b c which is twice the distance between middle of the barriers we non dimensionalize the parameters with respect to the length l in fig 18 the reflection and transmission coefficients are graphed as a function of dimensionless length l λ for various thickness of ice sheet we consider three different ice sheet of thickness 0 m 4 84 m and 12 1 m we take a 600 m b 600 m c 1220 m h 1 h 3 h 5 500 m h 2 h 4 250 m so that l 2420 m the bragg resonating reflection can be seen clearly when 0 001 l λ 5 0 the maximum value of the reflection coefficients appears in the first second and third resonating periods are at l λ 0 551 l λ 1 591 and l λ 3 851 respectively this figure reveals that the principle peaks of the bragg resonance at l λ 0 551 are lower than the sub harmonic peaks at l λ 1 591 it can be noticed that changes in ice thickness or flexural rigidity has significant effect in the reflection coefficients in the second and third harmonic periods as the thickness or flexural rigidity of ice sheet increases the maximum peaks increase in each resonating period in l λ 1 a reverse pattern is observed in the case of transmission coefficients the flexural rigidity of ice sheet is directly proportional to the ice thickness therefore from fig 18 we can conclude that the resonance reflection at lower wavelength increases with increase in flexural rigidity d l 4 the graphs for reflection and transmission coefficients versus l λ are plotted in fig 19 for different height of the barriers namely 300 m 250 m and 200 m beneath the ice sheet of thickness 4 84 m therefore we take three configurations in which h 2 h 4 200 m h 2 h 4 250 m and h 2 h 4 300 m respectively the other parameters remain same in this figure fig 19 reveals the fact that the resonating reflections decrease with the increase in barrier heights h 1 h 2 and h 1 h 4 fig 20 exhibits the reflection and transmission coefficients versus l λ for different distances i e b between the thick barriers we consider depths of the fluid as 500 m height of the barriers as 250 m width of the barriers as 600 m the graphs are plotted for three different values of b viz 500 m 1000 m and 1500 m this figure demonstrates the variation of c r and c t for different values of b l it is observed that the principal peak of resonating reflections increases with increasing distance between the barriers but the resonating reflection for the sub harmonic peak at l λ 1 561 reduces the value with increasing b l it is also seen that for large distance between barriers the resonating nature of reflection coefficients may not exists 6 conclusion briefly we summarize the main outcomes of the present manuscript a linearized mathematical model that describes how flexural gravity wave interact with a pair of bottom mounted rectangular barriers in a ice covered region the ice cover is being modeled as a thin homogeneous elastic plate floating on a fluid of finite but non uniform depth eigenfunction matching method along with multi term galerkin technique is adopted to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients correctness of the proposed method is confirmed through the energy balance relation of the associated model and various published works available in the literature for a pair of bottom mounted thick barriers the reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated numerically and their absolute values are depicted against the non dimensional wavenumber k h 1 in a number of figures changes in lengths e g height and width of the barriers distance between barriers and thickness of the ice sheet are illustrated by analyzing the reflection and transmission coefficients some conclusions are summarized below 1 when the flexural gravity waves incident obliquely on a pair of thick barriers the reflection coefficients fluctuate more in comparison with single thick barrier due to multiple interaction between the ends of the barriers 2 in presence of a thick bottom mounted barrier the reflection and transmission coefficients are oscillatory in nature and rapid oscillation observed in case of pair of barriers 3 when geometry of the problem is symmetric about y 0 the reflection coefficients vanishes at infinite number of values of k h 1 the transmission coefficient possess the value less than or equal to unity 4 for an asymmetric model of the problem the reflection coefficient vanishes only at k h 1 0 at which the transmission coefficient may exceed the value unity 5 thickness and flexural rigidity of the ice sheet has significant effect on the scattering behavior of flexural gravity waves as the thickness increases amplitude of the reflection coefficients become large at higher values of k h 1 in this case the zeros of reflection coefficients corresponding to thick ice sheet are larger than that of thin ice sheet 6 the amplitude of reflection coefficients for a pair of symmetric barrier are smaller than that in presence of asymmetric barriers 7 bragg scattering is observed in presence of two thick barriers at l λ 1 it is found that the resonance reflection may be amplified due to development in ice thickness increase in barriers height has the ability to increase the resonance reflection it is also observed that increase in gap between the barriers can reduce the resonating reflection for flexural gravity wave it must be noted that the model developed here is applicable to a wide range of geophysical problems this model can further be extended to study various hydrodynamic properties related to wave structure interaction in a finite depth fluid which would be more useful for

method reflection and transmission coefficients resonance reflection 1 introduction a class of problems associated with scattering of water waves by a breakwater such as thick barriers of various configurations has been studied extensively by many researchers during the last few decades water wave scattering involving thick vertical barriers with rectangular cross section present in uniform finite depth water was first considered by mei and black 1969 they have adopted almost similar formulations as in the works of newman 1965 and miles 1967 for problems of a step shelf guiney et al 1972 studied wave propagation through a small slit in a thick vertical barrier using conformal mapping method liu and wu 1986 used the method of matched asymptotic expansions to study the diffraction of oblique waves by an infinite vertical barrier with a small slit in deep water kanoria et al 1999 analyzed normal scattering of surface wave by a thick vertical barrier of four different configurations by employing eigenfunction expansion method along with multi term galerkin approximations involving ultraspherical gegenbauer polynomials later mandal and kanoria 2000 extended the work of kanoria et al 1999 by considering oblique incidence recently there is a considerable interests in the field of research considering wave interaction with permeable and or elastic breakwaters in water liu et al 2012 considered the problem of wave scattering by a submerged horizontal porous plate of finite thickness using matched eigenfunction expansions hu and liu 2018 introduced a general analytical solution for wave scattering by permeable breakwaters by employing linear potential theory and the method of eigenfunction expansion hu et al 2019 extended the formulation of hu and liu 2018 to consider the oblique incident waves and to deal with multi layered breakwaters a poro elastic model of submerged breakwaters in finite depth fluid was considered by lan et al 2011 to study the bragg scattering of water waves based on the linear wave theory in this work the improved biot s theory of poro elastic media with suitable matching conditions was applied research on wave propagation in water with very large floating structures vlfs have gained considerable interest to the engineers and scientists working on offshore operations in last few years the surface wave propagating beneath the elastic plate is commonly termed as flexural gravity wave the hydroelastic and hydrodynamic behavior of the floating plate are important due to their ability to affect the motion of flexural gravity waves conversely the effects of wave on large floating plate has drawn attention due their practical importance such as to predict the strength of the plate the research motivated by vlfs is described in sturova and korobkin 2005 sturova 2008 2014 in the last few decades a considerable number of research work have been done which aim to study wave propagation through marginal ice zone miz in the polar regions as we know that when the floating ice increases its thickness or the wave period of incoming wave is short very little of wave energy can penetrates the ice cover therefore the reflected and transmitted wave amplitude depends highly on ice thickness as well as the wave period fox and squire 1990 on scattering of oblique wave caused by a narrow crack in ice sheets floating on water of finite depth have been studied by evans and porter 2003 using eigenfunction expansion method and green s function approach porter and evans 2006 extended the work of evans and porter 2003 by considering any finite number of cracks vaughan and squire 2006 studied the propagation of waves under an ice sheet of variable thickness which is interpolated using low order piecewise polynomials porter 2019 proposed a semi analytic approach to study the wave propagation through thin rectangular elastic plates floating on water on topics in the general area of ocean wave or sea ice interactions especially in relation to mathematical modelling have been described by the review paper of squire 2007 it is well known that flexural gravity waves cannot propagate at a speed less than a certain value which depends on the thickness of the ice its physical and mechanical properties and the bottom depth see kheisin 1967 such a situation is possible when the frequency of flexural waves in the ice cover will correspond to the frequency of gravitational waves on the surface of the liquid as a result the archimedean force ceases to act and the balance of the ice cover is achieved only by elastic forces a resonance effect occurs the critical periods of fluctuation of flexural gravity waves are close to the periods of waves arising in the ocean due to a storm so wind generated waves can shake the ice cover which can cause the destruction of ice fields in the arctic as well as shore ice the scientific work c f zemlyak et al 2018 2019 experimentally shows that when the flexural gravity waves overcome the bottom unevenness their ice breaking ability increases sharply the ice destruction can transform waves and dissipate their energy kozin et al 2010 described a numerical model to study the stress strain state of broken ice cover due to motion of a submarine surface waves traveling from a long distance penetrates into the ice covered zone and attenuate gradually these waves has the ability break up the ice sheet and may accelerate the melting rate of sea ice it is observed that the presence of obstacles inside the fluid region has noticeable effect on propagation of flexural gravity waves in polar regions thus it is of practical importance to study wave structure interaction in ice covered region das and mandal 2006 investigated the scattering of obliquely incident waves by a long circular cylinder submerged in deep water beneath an ice cover using green s function technique bhattacharjee and soares 2012 investigated the behavior of flexural gravity waves propagating along a semi infinite floating ice sheet near a vertical wall using multipoles method das and thakur 2013 studied water wave scattering by a sphere submerged in uniform finite depth water bounded by ice cover korobkin et al 2018 studied the problem of flexural gravity wave diffraction by a bottom mounted structure with vertical walls in an ice covered finite depth fluid using the method of vertical modes in the work of kanoria et al 1999 geometry of the problem is considered to be symmetric and the wave interact with a single obstacle present in the fluid but in reality configuration of the problem may not be symmetric moreover there may be multiple number of obstacles at the fluid bottom for which the scattering happen more than once therefore it will be worthy to consider a general configuration of the fluid domain with multiple rectangular barriers during winter in cold regions surface of the sea water is frozen into large sheet of thin ice and melted down in the summer in this research our aim is to model a problem in which the ice effect can be incorporated and applied in various practical situations so we have considered the problem of flexural gravity wave scattering by a pair of thick vertical submerged barriers of arbitrary height and width depth the fluid is considered to be finite but not necessarily uniform surface of the fluid is assumed to be covered by a very thin infinite sheet of ice of uniform flexural rigidity so that the motion of the ice sheet is governed by a kirchhoff model based on eigenfunction matching method the problem is transformed to a set of integral equations involving unknown functions associated with horizontal velocity of motion above the barriers multi term galerkin technique with a suitably chosen basis function is adopted to calculate the unknown functions numerically it must be noted that in presence of thick barriers the unknown functions possess cubic root singularity near the sharp edge of the barriers porter 1995 proposed a basis function involving ultraspherical gegenbauer polynomials and was used by evans and fernyhough 1995 in their research on edge waves traveling along a periodic coastline consisting of a straight and vertical cliff face as we have considered the barriers at different depths therefore the edge conditions are not unique characteristics of various parameters namely length and phase velocity of flexural gravity waves in a finite depth water are verified numerically hydrodynamic properties such as reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated numerically at different wave modes accuracy of the results are verified up to five decimal places advantages of the multi term over single term galerkin method are confirmed through a table at different value of the parameters graph of both the coefficients are analyzed the energy balance relation satisfied by reflection and transmission coefficients can be obtained due to a pair of bottom mounted thick barriers resonance effect on flexural gravity wave is considered and significant effects have been observed motivation of the present work is due to the construction of offshore structures in ice covered waters this study can further be extended to estimate the ice breaking possibilities considered frequently in various engineering problems 2 mathematical formulation a three dimensional cartesian coordinate system is chosen with y axis pointing vertically downwards into the fluid region and the plane y 0 aligned with the undisturbed ice free surface of water the fluid is assumed to be of constant density ρ w have finite depth and bounded above by thin sheet of floating ice suppose the ice sheet is of thickness d density ρ i flexural rigidity d the expression for flexural rigidity of the ice is d e d 3 12 1 ν 2 ρ g where g being the acceleration due to gravity e is the young s modulus ν is the poisson s ratio we consider a pair of rectangular barriers submerged in the fluid at depths h 2 and h 4 beneath the ice sheet respectively we divide the fluid region into five subregions given by ω 1 x a 0 y h 1 ω 2 a x 0 0 y h 2 ω 3 0 x b 0 y h 3 ω 4 b x c 0 y h 4 ω 5 x c 0 y h 5 the geometry of the present problem being shown in fig 1 assuming irrotational time harmonic motion in the fluid of angular frequency ω and the wave is incident from the negative infinity with an angle θ we denote the wavenumber of incident wave by k 1 0 so that α 1 0 k 1 0 cos θ and μ k 1 0 sin θ the resulting motion in the fluid is characterized by velocity potential r e φ x

governed by euler bernoulli thin elastic plate model so that the linearized boundary condition on the underside of ice sheet is given as 2 2 d x 2 μ 2 2 1 δ φ y k φ 0 in x y 0 where k ω 2 g submergence of ice sheet about y 0 depends on the ice thickness via δ ρ i ω 2 d ρ w g conditions along the rigid bottom of the fluid and horizontal boundary of the barriers are given by 2 3 φ y 0 on x

transmission coefficients are obtained easily from eqn 3 15 5 analysis and discussion in this section the physical quantities such as wavelength phase velocity reflected and transmitted amplitude of flexural gravity waves are numerically calculated and plotted in different graphs for various values of the parameters like ice thickness d flexural rigidity d incidence angle θ various lengths etc in the subsequent calculations we have used e 5 g p a ν 0 3 ρ w 1025 0 k g m 3 ρ i 922 5 k g m 3 and g 9 81 m s 2 the fluid depth h 1 of ω 1 is considered to be 500 m and parameters are non dimensionalized with the length scale of h 1 the ratio of amplitude of reflected wave to incident at a distance far from the obstacle is termed as reflection coefficient in this problem we have considered an incident flexural gravity wave of unit amplitude similarly the transmission coefficients can be defined we denote the absolute amplitude of the reflection and transmission coefficients by c r and c t respectively 5 1 flexural gravity wave characteristics suppose depth of the fluid be h and bounded by a thin ice sheet of thickness d the dispersion equation of the flexural gravity wave is given by 5 1 ω 2 g k d k 4 1 ε ω 2 g tanh k h where ε ρ i ρ w d in fig 2 we have discussed the effects of depth h on wave length λ 2 π k and phase velocity c ω k as a function of angular frequency ω the parameters in equation 5 1 are non dimensionalize with respect to the length l 500 m mathematically we have considered d l 4 0 01 and ε 0 001 it is clear from the figure that the wavelength increases with increasing fluid depth for a fluid of depth 500 m or high it is that the curves almost coincide at higher frequencies ω 0 2 as the depth increase phase velocity of flexural gravity waves increases at high frequencies the phase velocities of flexural gravity wave in deep water are equal fig 3 shows the effect of flexural rigidity on wavelength and phase velocity as a function of ω we have considered h l 0 5 and ε 0 001 it is observed that the wavelength increases with increasing flexural rigidity of the wave at low frequencies ω 0 098 the wavelengths are equal it can be seen from the figure that length of flexural gravity waves i e when d l 4 0 are higher than the water waves i e when d l 4 0 the phase velocities increase with increasing flexural rigidity of wave at low frequency the phase velocity of water wave and flexural gravity wave are same 5 2 accuracy and convergence of results here we check the accuracy and convergence of the n 1 term galerkin technique used in the present research in table 1 the results for reflection coefficients c r are computed at different truncated number m in the expansion of the velocity potential it can be seen clearly from the table that a three figure accuracy of the values of reflection coefficients is confirmed by considering 25 evanescent modes in table 2 the numerical values of reflection coefficients are tabulated at different n at n 5 the results are accurate up to three decimal place therefore we fix m 25 and n 5 to calculate c r and c t in this section it must be noted that higher accuracy of the results can also be obtained using larger values of m and n 5 3 the energy balance relation here we check the present semi analytic method through an energy balance relation this relation describes how incident energy distributed among the reflected and transmitted waves this conservation relation is obtained by applying green s second identity on the functions φ x y and φ x y over the fluid region if depths of the regions ω 1 and ω 5 are equal then the energy balance relation can be obtained as 5 2 c r 2 c t 2 1 however the depths of ω 1 and ω 5 are different c r and c t satisfies the following identity 5 3 c r 2 j c t 2 1 where j α 5 0 c 5 0 α 1 0 c 1 0 for different values of k h 1 the above relations 5 2 5 3 can be verified as in the last column of table 3 and table 4 which certainly gives a partial check on the validation of the problem studied here table 3 represents set of values c r c t and c r 2 c t 2 as a function of the wavenumber k h 1 associated with the problem of wave scattering by two thick barriers of equal height and width the fluid being considered to be of uniform depth i e h 1 h 3 h 5 the table shows that for a pair of symmetric barriers in a fluid of depth h 1 c r and c t satisfies the energy identity 5 2 on the other hand when the fluid is not of uniform depth the coefficients satisfy the identity 5 3 which are shown in table 4 these two tables implies the correctness of the numerical results obtained in the present manuscript from the results it is clear that in a fluid with unequal depth c t may exceed the value unity which was not observed for uniform depth fluids 5 4 approximation to single barrier problem correctness of the present work is verified through several limiting solutions corresponding to a single barrier problem available in the literature in figs 4 5 we consider h 2 h 1 h 3 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 h 5 h 1 1 b h 1 0 001 and d h 1 0 therefore for normal incidence the present problem reduced to the one considered by kanoria et al 1999 and for oblique incidence this research coincide with mandal and kanoria 2000 fig 4 presents the results for c r as a function of k h 1 for the case of single rectangular barrier at different thickness it is noticed that the results in figure 3 of kanoria et al 1999 are recovered the graphs shows that the reflection coefficients become more oscillatory as the thickness of the barrier increases and at higher wavenumber these coefficients becomes zero asymptotically for oblique incidence c r are depicted at different angle it is observed as expected that the amplitude of reflection coefficients decreases and the number of zeros decrease with increase in incidence angle this observation is similar to wave reflection by a thick rectangular barrier as in mandal and kanoria 2000 the influence of ice cover on oblique scattering of waves by a thick rectangular barrier is presented in fig 6 we have considered ice sheet of three different thickness viz 0 m 1 m and 2 5 m floating over a fluid of depth 500 m so that d h 1 0 0 001 and 0 005 respectively depth of the fluid in ω 5 is considered to be 450 m deep below the ice cover so that h 5 h 1 0 9 the other non dimensional parameters are considered as a h 1 1 b h 1 0 001 c h 1 1 h 2 h 1 h 3 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 and θ 45 o the absolute values of reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated as a function of dimensionless wavenumber k h 1 and depicted in fig 6 it can be seen that the zeros of reflection coefficients increases with increasing rigidity of the ice sheet the amplitude of c r at higher values of k h 1 amplifies due to the ice sheet on the other hand c r diminishes as the values of k h 1 increases the transmission coefficients c t show the opposite behavior at different values of k h 1 in fig 7 the absolute values of reflection and transmission coefficients versus the non dimensional wavenumber k h 1 are depicted for three different width of a barrier viz 5 m 250 m and 500 m therefore we consider a h 1 c h 1 0 01 a h 1 c h 1 0 5 a h 1 c h 1 1 the other parameters are b h 1 0 001 d h 1 0 002 h 2 h 1 h 3 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 h 5 h 1 0 9 θ 45 o clearly it is seen that in a ice covered fluid the oscillatory nature of c r and c t increases with increasing width of the barrier this behavior is quite natural for wide barriers multiple interaction between ends of a thick barrier occur 5 5 wave scattering by pair of barriers now we analyze the results for the case of a pair of bottom mounted thick barriers in fig 8 the absolute reflection and transmission coefficients for the case of single and a pair if thick barriers are compared the coefficients are depicted as a function of wavenumber k h 1 for single barrier we consider a h 1 c h 1 0 5 b h 1 0 001 h 2 h 1 h 3 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 and for pair of bottom mounted barriers we take a h 1 1 b h 1 2 c h 1 3 h 2 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 h 3 h 1 1 the other parameter are d h 1 0 002 h 5 h 1 0 9 and θ 45 o it is clear that increase in number of barriers may increase the amplitude of reflection moreover the oscillation in c r and c t increases with increasing number of barriers due to multiple interaction between the barriers the effects of fluid depth in ω 3 are shown in fig 9 we consider a fluid of depth 500 m i e h 1 h 5 500 m so that h 5 h 1 1 at different depth h 3 h 1 1 2 1 0 8 the reflection and transmission coefficients are depicted for a h 1 1 b h 1 2 c h 1 3 d h 1 0 002 h 2 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 and θ 45 o it can be seen that the depth h 3 h 1 has very negligible effect on c r and c t therefore we fix h 3 h 1 1 in rest of the analysis results for flexural gravity waves obliquely incident upon a pair of bottom mounted thick barriers are presented in fig 10 at different depth of ω 5 the reflection and transmission coefficients are plotted as a function of k h 1 for a h 1 1 b h 1 2 c h 1 3 d h 1 0 002 h 2 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 h 3 h 1 1 θ 45 o and h 5 h 1 1 0 9 0 8 it is observed that for non uniform fluid depths the reflection coefficients never become zero and c t may exceed the value one therefore in a fluid of non uniform depth zero reflection or complete transmission is not possible at higher values of k h 1 fig 11 display c r and c t against the wavenumber k h 1 for three different thickness of the ice sheet d h 1 0 0 002 and 0 005 respectively the non dimensional parameters considered are a h 1 1 b h 1 2 c h 1 3 h 2 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 h 3 h 1 1 h 5 h 1 0 9 and θ 45 o it is observed that c r oscillates with increasing k h 1 and diminishes gradually as k h 1 increases the maximum value of c r are also increase with increasing thickness of ice sheet this figure shows that ice cover has a noticeable impact on wave propagation over a pair of bottom mounted thick barriers indeed from this figure we may conclude that as the flexural rigidity of ice sheet increases the amplitude of wave reflection also increases after a certain value of k h 1 here k h 1 1 48 now we check the effects of increasing angle of incidence on c r and c t for a h 1 1 b h 1 2 c h 1 3 d h 1 0 002 h 2 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 h 3 h 1 1 and h 5 h 1 0 9 in fig 12 the absolute values of reflection and transmission coefficients are shown for three different angle θ 0 o θ 30 o and θ 45 o as expected it is observed that in presence of pair of thick barriers the amplitude of reflection coefficient decreases with increasing angle of incidence the transmission coefficients behave in opposite manner it is also found that oscillatory nature of the coefficients decreases with increasing θ in figs 13 15 we verify the results for different height of the barriers graphs for c r and c t against k h 1 for different height of the barrier in ω 2 i e h 1 h 2 are plotted in fig 13 we consider three different heights namely 100 m 150 m 200 m while the height of the barrier in ω 4 is kept fixed at 250 m width of the barriers is 1000 m in numerical calculation we have considered a h 1 2 b h 1 0 2 c h 1 2 2 d h 1 0 002 h 4 h 1 0 5 h 3 h 1 1 h 5 h 1 0 9 θ 45 o and h 2 h 1 0 8 0 7 0 6 due to asymmetry of the barriers the reflection coefficients never become zero except at k h 1 0 as the difference between height of the barriers increases the amplitude of reflection coefficients also increase in this case the transmission coefficient found to be more than one in the vicinity of k h 1 0 as in previous figure in fig 14 we verify the results for different heights of the barrier in ω 4 while height of the other barrier is taken fixed for this we assume h 4 h 1 0 8 0 7 0 6 h 2 h 1 0 5 and the other parameters are remain same if we compare this figure with fig 13 we may draw the conclusion that in the present configuration of barriers amplitude of reflection coefficients are shorter and therefore the transmission coefficients has the opposite behavior in fig 15 the reflection and transmission coefficients versus the wavenumber k h 1 are plotted for two symmetric thick barriers of different height it is considered that the regions ω 2 and ω 4 have equal depth the results are depicted at three different depths viz 300 m 250 m and 200 m for which h 2 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 6 0 5 0 4 respectively the other parameters in numerical computation are a h 1 2 b h 1 0 2 c h 1 2 2 d h 1 0 002 h 3 h 1 1 h 5 h 1 0 9 θ 45 o it is clear that the amplitude of reflection coefficients increase with increasing height of the barriers indeed the oscillatory nature of reflection coefficients increase with increasing hight of barriers further it is observed that the transmission coefficient attains the highest amplitude at very small 0 2 or very large 5 values of k h 1 it may be noticed from figs 13 15 that the asymmetric model of the barriers produces less reflection than a symmetric one in fig 16 c r and c t are depicted as a function of non dimensional wavenumber k h 1 for three different width of the barriers viz 10 m 250 m and 500 m so we take b h 1 1 d h 1 0 002 h 2 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 h 3 h 1 1 h 5 h 1 0 9 θ 45 o and a h 1 c b h 1 0 02 0 5 1 it can be observed that the coefficients are oscillatory in nature and the oscillation increases with increasing width of the barriers as the fluid depth is non uniform the reflection coefficient vanishes only when k h 1 0 consequently the transmission coefficients may exceed the value unity as k h 1 0 in fig 17 we present the graphs for the reflection and transmission coefficients as a function of k h 1 at three different distances between two symmetric barriers in a fluid of uniform depth we take a h 1 1 d h 1 0 002 h 2 h 1 h 4 h 1 0 5 h 3 h 1 h 5 h 1 1 θ 45 o and b h 1 c h 1 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 it is found that fluctuation of the coefficients increase with increasing distance of the barriers indeed the number of zeros of reflection coefficients increase as the value of b h 1 increases 5 6 bragg resonance scattering here we analyze the reflection and transmission coefficients for normally incident waves of length λ depth of the ocean in ω j j 1 3 5 are considered to be equal we also consider height of the thick barriers be equal so that h 2 h 4 we define a length l a b c which is twice the distance between middle of the barriers we non dimensionalize the parameters with respect to the length l in fig 18 the reflection and transmission coefficients are graphed as a function of dimensionless length l λ for various thickness of ice sheet we consider three different ice sheet of thickness 0 m 4 84 m and 12 1 m we take a 600 m b 600 m c 1220 m h 1 h 3 h 5 500 m h 2 h 4 250 m so that l 2420 m the bragg resonating reflection can be seen clearly when 0 001 l λ 5 0 the maximum value of the reflection coefficients appears in the first second and third resonating periods are at l λ 0 551 l λ 1 591 and l λ 3 851 respectively this figure reveals that the principle peaks of the bragg resonance at l λ 0 551 are lower than the sub harmonic peaks at l λ 1 591 it can be noticed that changes in ice thickness or flexural rigidity has significant effect in the reflection coefficients in the second and third harmonic periods as the thickness or flexural rigidity of ice sheet increases the maximum peaks increase in each resonating period in l λ 1 a reverse pattern is observed in the case of transmission coefficients the flexural rigidity of ice sheet is directly proportional to the ice thickness therefore from fig 18 we can conclude that the resonance reflection at lower wavelength increases with increase in flexural rigidity d l 4 the graphs for reflection and transmission coefficients versus l λ are plotted in fig 19 for different height of the barriers namely 300 m 250 m and 200 m beneath the ice sheet of thickness 4 84 m therefore we take three configurations in which h 2 h 4 200 m h 2 h 4 250 m and h 2 h 4 300 m respectively the other parameters remain same in this figure fig 19 reveals the fact that the resonating reflections decrease with the increase in barrier heights h 1 h 2 and h 1 h 4 fig 20 exhibits the reflection and transmission coefficients versus l λ for different distances i e b between the thick barriers we consider depths of the fluid as 500 m height of the barriers as 250 m width of the barriers as 600 m the graphs are plotted for three different values of b viz 500 m 1000 m and 1500 m this figure demonstrates the variation of c r and c t for different values of b l it is observed that the principal peak of resonating reflections increases with increasing distance between the barriers but the resonating reflection for the sub harmonic peak at l λ 1 561 reduces the value with increasing b l it is also seen that for large distance between barriers the resonating nature of reflection coefficients may not exists 6 conclusion briefly we summarize the main outcomes of the present manuscript a linearized mathematical model that describes how flexural gravity wave interact with a pair of bottom mounted rectangular barriers in a ice covered region the ice cover is being modeled as a thin homogeneous elastic plate floating on a fluid of finite but non uniform depth eigenfunction matching method along with multi term galerkin technique is adopted to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients correctness of the proposed method is confirmed through the energy balance relation of the associated model and various published works available in the literature for a pair of bottom mounted thick barriers the reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated numerically and their absolute values are depicted against the non dimensional wavenumber k h 1 in a number of figures changes in lengths e g height and width of the barriers distance between barriers and thickness of the ice sheet are illustrated by analyzing the reflection and transmission coefficients some conclusions are summarized below 1 when the flexural gravity waves incident obliquely on a pair of thick barriers the reflection coefficients fluctuate more in comparison with single thick barrier due to multiple interaction between the ends of the barriers 2 in presence of a thick bottom mounted barrier the reflection and transmission coefficients are oscillatory in nature and rapid oscillation observed in case of pair of barriers 3 when geometry of the problem is symmetric about y 0 the reflection coefficients vanishes at infinite number of values of k h 1 the transmission coefficient possess the value less than or equal to unity 4 for an asymmetric model of the problem the reflection coefficient vanishes only at k h 1 0 at which the transmission coefficient may exceed the value unity 5 thickness and flexural rigidity of the ice sheet has significant effect on the scattering behavior of flexural gravity waves as the thickness increases amplitude of the reflection coefficients become large at higher values of k h 1 in this case the zeros of reflection coefficients corresponding to thick ice sheet are larger than that of thin ice sheet 6 the amplitude of reflection coefficients for a pair of symmetric barrier are smaller than that in presence of asymmetric barriers 7 bragg scattering is observed in presence of two thick barriers at l λ 1 it is found that the resonance reflection may be amplified due to development in ice thickness increase in barriers height has the ability to increase the resonance reflection it is also observed that increase in gap between the barriers can reduce the resonating reflection for flexural gravity wave it must be noted that the model developed here is applicable to a wide range of geophysical problems this model can further be extended to study various hydrodynamic properties related to wave structure interaction in a finite depth fluid which would be more useful for

21189,the problem of interaction between water wave and moored rectangular floating breakwater is studied using the semi analytical scaled boundary finite element method sbfem in a two dimensional vertical plane the current study applies a generalized solution process by locating the scaling center within the bounded sub domains instead of the body of structure resulting in a homogeneous sbfem equation in spite of the merits of such choice for the scaling center that makes possible the analysis of non rectangular objects the method is changed to numerical analytical one with its consequences such numerical solution in the problem of water wave radiation and diffraction is validated by comparing the results with previous reported studies the generality and robustness of the current sbfem based model is also examined for non rectangular cross sections of the floating breakwater focusing on the proposed sbfem based model the full wave rigid body interaction is analyzed for a moored rectangular floating structure moreover in order to make the linear numerical modeling accurate taking into account the nonlinear aspects of the interaction problem the artificial damping coefficients are quantified and the relevant formula is derived keywords scaled boundary finite element method water wave moored floating breakwater interaction modification of damping effects 1 introduction floating breakwaters fbws are among the most common marine structures which are continuously exposed to water waves abul azm and gesraha 2000 zheng et al 2004a 2004b the analysis of interaction between this type of structures and the surrounding wave domain is the focus of many research endeavors in the past two decades achieving an efficient and accurate model for the analysis of wave fbw interaction have remained as a common challenge for the researchers in this field over the last two decades a semi analytical method the so called scaled boundary finite element method sbfem has been employed to analyze the interactive systems in an infinite solution domain the current study has concentrated on establishing an sbfem based model to examine the wave and moored fbw interaction few studies have emphasized upon determining the hydrodynamic forces exerted on floating objects by sbfem li et al 2005a 2005b solved the problem of wave diffraction and radiation by a rectangular floating structure in an infinite fluid domain with a constant depth based on their study meng and zou 2013 and song and tao 2011 conducted two research on the wave diffraction and radiation caused by respectively a rectangular floating body near a side wall and a horizontal elliptical cylinder in these three studies the scaling center of bounded sub domains was chosen to be located on sharp corners of the structure this decision turned the governing equation into a non homogeneous type in the scaled boundary coordinate system nevertheless setting such locations for scaling center provides analytical solutions for velocity potential distribution on the body surfaces which requires a variety of particular solutions in the presence of normal velocity on the object boundaries using this method a unified solution process for solving wave diffraction and different modes of radiation cannot be established so that for each mode of motion a separate particular solution is needed in order to overcome the problems associated with non homogeneous governing equations several studies were carried out by locating the scaling center at positions other than the sharp corners of the structures tao et al 2007 carried out research to solve wave interaction with a circular cylinder due to non existence of sharp corners they applied sbfem by positioning the scaling center of both the bounded and unbounded sub domains at the center of the structure later song et al 2010 studied wave interaction with multiple cylinders of arbitrary shape they divided the bounded domain into several sub domains with the scaling centers located within each bounded sub domain in both cases it was found that for impermeable fixed structures the governing equation transformed into a homogeneous one in the sbfem coordinate system in order to investigate the effect of decreasing rate of wave exciting force on the porous structures tao et al 2009 song and tao 2010 and liu and lin 2013 applied the sbfem to examine the wave diffraction caused by porous cylindrical structures they concluded that by taking the porosity effects into account and considering the scaling center within bounded sub domains the right hand side of the governing equation becomes zero the mentioned works were extended by li et al 2013a 2013b to analyze the problem of the wave piles group interaction in the three dimensions they included the wave forces structure motions and water surface changes in their research in the present study we have investigated the positioning of scaling center within the bonded sub domain of an fbw with rectangular cross section the sbfem based researches have currently focused on wave diffraction and radiation problems rather than the problem of water wave interaction with free floated or moored fbw in order to consider the effects of mooring lines on fbws performance the sbfem based model should be further developed investigations on the moored fbw behavior exposed to water waves has been performed in various models different cable configurations were taken into consideration in literature taut mooring lines were utilized al solihat and nahon 2016 elchahal et al 2008 williams et al 2000 in these studies the taut lines are modeled as a mass less linear spring which caused simplification of the computations based on jian s cable stiffness formulation 1980 sannasiraj et al 1998 applied the slack mooring lines stiffness matrix to investigate the two dimensional motions of fbw they conducted experiments to substantiate and verify their numerical results their work was expanded by lee and cho 2003 for slack mooring lines which rests on the seabed near the anchor point the mooring line stiffness matrix established by sannasiraj et al 1998 and lee and cho 2003 is based on the assumption that the components of the stiffness matrices are not affected by the body movements furthermore the drag damping of mooring lines is ignored according to lee and cho 2003 unreported damping coefficients were applied to the numerical results of sannasiraj et al 1998 to obtain a better match with their experimental observations incorporating the mooring line stiffness matrix provided by sannasiraj et al 1998 gesraha 2006 analyzed the wave interaction with a moored fbw with vertical side plates his findings indicated that utilizing these structural elements decreased the transmission coefficient and exciting forces cho 2016 continued the previous study for extra porous side plates and concluded that by proper selection of porosity and deeper side plates wave transmission could be considerably reduced in another pivotal study loukogeorgaki and angelides 2005 implemented a numerical model to determine the mooring line stiffness matrix for a three dimensional floating structure their proposed model determined the mooring lines stiffness matrix on the basis of the differential changes of cable tension caused by the static motion of the structure the coefficients corresponding to drag damping of mooring lines and viscous forces were determined by using an iterative process which led to significant increase in computational efforts this study intends to develop an sbfem based two dimensional vertical model to solve the problem of water waves interaction with moored rectangular fbw in the first step to homogenize the governing equations in the scaled boundary coordinate systems and eliminate the need for organizing different forms of particular solutions unlike the studies of li et al 2005a 2005b and meng and zou 2013 the scaling centers of bounded sub domains are located within the associated solution domain next the computational merits and demerits of this modification are discussed the generality and robustness of established sbfem based model are examined for two different non rectangular cross sections analysis of the wave moored fbws interaction is the second purpose of this paper this problem is solved by the sbfem based model as well in order to adapt the calculated results to reported experimental responses as mentioned in the literature the additional damping is employed as far as the calibration of the linear model is concerned the required additional damping is extracted in the current study these artificial damping values per non dimensionalized incident wavelengths are recommended to be used in the future studies the reminding of the paper is organized into six sections section 2 outlines the theoretical formulation of the problem section 3 presents the governing equations in sbfem coordinate systems and the procedure to solve sbfem equations the equations of motion are summarized in section 4 in section 5 first solution of the radiation problem is presented to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the current sbfem model then by evaluating the diffraction problem modeling the validated model is justified to solve the interaction problem section 6 concludes the paper 2 governing equation the sketch used to define the parameters of the problem of interaction between a linear wave with the frequency of ω propagating in the water with a depth of h and a moored rectangular floating breakwater is shown in fig 1 by assuming an infinite length for the structure the effect of wave diffraction around the breakwater is ignored the width and draft of the breakwater are denoted by b and t respectively a slack mooring system restricts the movement of the structure the cartesian coordinate system o x y z is employed as shown to define the governing equations of the wave field surrounding the breakwater assuming an ideal fluid the irrotational flow field can be described in terms of velocity potential thus by separating space and time variables for a periodic motion velocity potential is expressed as 1 φ x z t re al φ x z e i ω t assuming linear wave theory the total velocity potential φ t is divided into three velocity potentials as follows 2 φ t φ i φ s φ r φ i φ s j 1 3 s j φ j where φ i φ s and φ r represent the incident the diffraction and the radiation velocity potentials respectively in addition s j is the amplitude of the j t h mode of motion j 1 for heave j 2 for sway and j 3 for roll within the fluid domain the potential φ should satisfy laplace equation 3 2 φ 0 the boundary conditions describing the flow can be expressed as follows 4 φ z ω 2 g φ at the free surface z 0 5 φ z 0 at the bottom z h 6 φ n v n on the solid surfaces where g is the gravitational acceleration and v n is the normal velocity at a solid surface incident wave potential φ i may be expressed as 7 φ i i g a ω cosh k z h cosh k h e i k x a and k are wave amplitude and wave number respectively on the infinite boundary the potential should have finite values hence sommerfeld boundary condition is applied as 8 lim φ i x i k φ i 0 x where φ i denotes each mode of the potentials introduced in equation 2 3 scaled boundary finite element method sbfem governing laplace equation together with the boundary conditions discussed above are solved using sbfem in this semi analytical method the unknown velocity potentials are solved numerically on the discretized boundaries s of solution domain analytical solutions are sought within each domain along radial lines connecting central point called the scaling center x 0 y 0 to any point on the boundaries in order to implement this method governing equations are converted from cartesian into a new coordinate system ξ s as defined in fig 2 the coordinate ξ is zero at the scaling center and 1 on the boundaries the circumferential coordinate s is defined along the boundaries the scaling center should be positioned so that all the points on the boundaries are visible from that center to achieve this for the problem at hand the whole computational domain is divided into four sub domains ω 2 and ω 3 are the bounded sub domains while ω 1 and ω 4 are the unbounded ones as shown in fig 2 the scaling center is positioned within each sub domain which is different from the previous applications of sbfem on rectangular fbws 3 1 formulation for bounded sub domains as demonstrated in fig 3 two bounded sub domains are considered these sub domains share the same boundary γ int 2 on one side and each share a boundary with the unbounded sub domains γ int 1 γ int 3 on the other side discretization nodes on the boundaries of each bounded subdomain are illustrated in fig 3 the cartesian coordinates of each node is defined by x and y vectors the coordinates of an arbitrary point within an element can be calculated utilizing shape functions similar to finite element method moreover applying the scaling coordinate ξ any arbitrary point within the domain can be defined as a function of a point on the boundary s and the position of scaling center thus the position of any point within each sub domain x ˆ y ˆ is defined by 9 x ˆ x 0 ξ n s x 10 y ˆ y 0 ξ n s y n s is the shape functions the velocity potential at any arbitrary point on a sector can be defined via the potential values of the nodes as 11 φ ξ s n s a ξ where a ξ is the potential function along the lines connecting the scaling center to the nodes similar to the reviewed investigations in section 1 in the current work attempt is made to homogenize the governing equation in the scaled boundary coordinate system by considering the scaling center of the bounded sub domain within the associated medium this objective is satisfied the merits and demerits of this decision are discussed in part 1 of section 5 by applying the galerkin s weighted residual method along the circumferential direction the governing differential equation in the scaled boundary coordinates is expressed as 12 w ξ e t e

solution for the unbounded sub domains in order to obtain the sbfem solution in the far field unbounded sub domains with parallel top and bottom side faces a modified coordinate system is applied the origin is located on the interface of bounded and unbounded sub domains and only the boundary on this interface is discretized introducing the s coordinate along the mentioned interface boundary and ξ

also x p and z p are the components of the distance between the points which connect the cable to the body and the rotation center 5 results and discussion this section is divided into two parts the first part deals with examining the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed sbfem model with the scaling center positioned within the nearfield subdomains for this objective both radiation and diffraction problems are simulated and compared against same cases using sbfem with scaling center on the sharp corners of the floating breakwater in the second part simulations are carried out for the problem of wave moored floating breakwater interaction wave induced forces damping and added mass coefficients required for this part are obtained from the results of the simulations of the first part 5 1 evaluating of the accuracy and efficiency of proposed model in order to estimate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed model radiation problem is considered in the first step with regards to efficiency the computational time of the proposed model is compared against the results of li et al 2005a 2005b li et al 2005a 2005b model was reproduced in the present study by locating the scaling center at the lower corners of the floating body the best results in li et al 2005a 2005b were obtained by discretization of boundaries by two three nodes quadratic elements the same is adopted in the present study the same simulations are repeated as proposed in section 3 1 by locating the scaling center within the bounded sub domain this leads to homogenization of the governing equation in the scaled boundary coordinate system and by applying defined normal velocities on the boundaries of floating body the governing equations can be solved via a unified solution process in this modeling approach there is a need for discretization of the structure surface boundaries different mesh densities are incorporated for discretization of these boundaries coarse mesh consists of two three nodes quadratic elements on each boundary the medium and fine mesh densities consist of 4 and 8 three nodes quadratic elements on body boundaries respectively therefore for the coarse medium and fine mesh densities the bounded sub domain is discretized by 12 elements 16 elements and 24 elements respectively also the unbounded sub domains are modeled by two elements the hydrodynamic forces applied to the structures are defined as 33 f w j i ω ρ s 0 φ w n j d s where n j is the generalized normal with n 1 n z n 2 n x and n 3 z z 0 n x x x 0 n z x 0 z 0 is the rotation center ρ is the fluid density s 0 is the wetted surface in o x z plane and f w j is the force in j direction caused by heave sway and rotational movements w 1 2 3 of the floating body respectively in order to calculate the integral in equation 33 the 5 points 9 points and 13 points newton cotes method were employed for coarse medium and fine mesh densities respectively the added mass μ w j and damping coefficients λ w j per unit length of the structure are calculated as follows 34 μ j w 1 ω 2 re f w j 35 λ w j 1 ω im f w j the non dimensional added mass c a and damping c d coefficients can be defined as 36 c a w j 1 ω 2 b t s re f w j 37 c d w j 1 ω 2 b t s im f w j where s is amplitude of forced displacement in radiation problem for a structure with b t 1 0 and h t 3 0 with b t and h defined in fig 1 the computational times required for these hydrodynamic coefficients with different mesh densities are compared to that of the proposed model by li et al 2005a 2005b and presented in table 1 the radiation problem is analyzed for 100 different frequencies and the total computational time of each model is measured in table 1 the second column represents the number of total elements which are employed for simulation the last column illustrates the computational time of each case on the other hand as shown in fig 5 the results of above four cases are compared with the analytical solution proposed zheng et al 2004b to demonstrate the accuracy of each case it is clear that by using the medium and fine mesh densities the results are in good agreement with the bench mark zheng et al 2004b solution for the sake of quantifying the accuracy of each modeling case the mean squares error mse is calculated for each case and presented in table 2 for different hydrodynamic coefficients the mses are calculated and arranged in rows of table 2 as is seen in table 2 the corresponding mses of the medium and fine mesh densities are in acceptable range of error as compared with the model of li et al 2005b for the purpose of evaluating the generality and robustness of the proposed model the current sbfem based model is examined for wave diffraction problem by three floating breakwaters of rectangular π shaped and circular cross sections the incident wave at left boundary γ int 1 generates normal velocities therefore this problem could be solved using the same approach as for radiation problem the hydrodynamic loads resulted from the incident wave on the stationary structures in k direction are calculated as 38 f k i ω ρ s 0 φ i φ s n k d s the above exiting loads will be used for the simulation of full interaction between incident waves and moored floating breakwater for a rectangular structure with b t 6 0 and h t 2 0 the components of forces applied on the structure are compared with the analytical results of zheng et al 2004b as illustrated in fig 6 the dimensionless forces are calculated by w 1 ρ g a b and w 2 0 5 ρ g a b 2 as is seen the results of the developed model are in good agreement with the results of the analytical work meanwhile in the case of π shaped fbw for the purpose of demonstrating the robustness of the proposed model in the infinite medium with sharp corners a structure with b h 1 0 t h 0 25 and u b 0 5 is considered where u is the depth of each side plate that is vertically protruded from the both sides of the bottom of the structure fig 7 and the plate thickness is assumed to be zero focusing on the design of the medium mesh densities for the breakwater of rectangular cross section to discretize the solution domain the bottom boundary of the structure is discretized with eight three node quadratic elements and four elements discretize other structural boundaries hence 38 three node quadratic elements are needed to discretize the whole fluid domain the components of wave induced forces are shown in fig 8 in comparison with the numerical results of cho 2016 as can be seen the results have a good agreement with the mentioned results based on the validated results it can be concluded that even with taking a few elements for solving the problems in the solution domain with sharp corners sbfem does not suffer from any numerical deficiencies and the results are accurate eventually as demonstrated in fig 9 the problem of water wave diffraction is examined considering a horizontal circular cylinder with the radius r draft r and water depth 2 r restrained on the water surface in this case the main objective is to evaluate the generality of the proposed sbfem based model the reason why the circular cylinder is selected for the examination is rooted in the fact that the faces of this structure are not perpendicular to each other moreover the results of the wave diffraction problem for the mentioned structure are available in the literature to validate the calculated results from the present model to discretize the surface of the structure two different mesh densities are considered first by employing 12 three node quadratic elements on the structure boundary the number of elements in the whole fluid domain is attained equal to 26 however by shrinking the mesh sizes and using 36 elements to discretize the structural boundary the total mesh obtained alters to 50 elements the components of non dimensional forces f x f x ρ g a r and f z f z ρ g a r applied to the structure are compared with naftzger et al 1979 in fig 10 there are some differences between the calculated results and the results in the literature estimating the curve surface by linear elements and calculating the numerical integration in each element are the causes of these differences these discrepancies can be eliminated by increasing the number of elements from table 1 and table 2 it is founded that there is need for approximately 35 additional computation time for achieving almost the same accuracy of li et al 2005a 2005b results however by applying the scaling center within the nearfield subdomains a unified solution process is devised that can be employed for radiation and diffraction problems moreover a simpler multipurpose code is at hand which can be easily used for any non rectangular floating breakwater since the primary purpose of this study is to focus on the rectangular cross section extracting the other results for non rectangular cross sections will be the subject of future research 5 2 full interaction between wave and moored floating breakwater considering the discussed problems in the previous sections the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the floating object could be estimated by solving diffraction radiation problems in this section the moored floating breakwater responses interacting with incident waves are obtained from the proposed model and validated against experimental data this objective is achieved by comparing the calculated responses in the present study with the reported experimental and numerical results of sannasiraj et al 1998 and the numerical results of lee and cho 2003 in sannasiraj et al 1998 experiments a rectangular floating breakwater with a width of 0 4 m draft of 0 1 m and the length of 3 78 m in a water depth of 2 35 m is subjected to regular waves with a height of 0 05 m and the frequency range of 0 3 1 5 h z the floating body is tightened by four slack mooring lines each with a length of 4 7 m on the other hand sannasiraj et al 1998 and lee and cho 2003 solved this problem numerically in a two dimensional vertical configuration with the finite element and element free galerkin methods respectively the approach of sannasiraj et al 1998 in modeling the mooring lines effects have been compared with more complex methods such as loukogeorgaki and angelides 2005 the comparison showed appropriate accuracy of sannasiraj et al 1998 model despite its simplicity hence in the present research this method is employed to include the effects of mooring lines on the interaction of floating breakwater and incident waves for the incident waves with the above mentioned frequency range the responses of amplified operators raos for the heave sway and roll motions are obtained from the simulation of current model and compared against mentioned experimental and numerical results as shown in fig 11 in general there is a fairly good agreement between the numerical results of the present study and the reported ones in mentioned literatures in the range of 0 3 ω 2 b 2 g 0 4 a rapid growth occurred in rao of the sway mode which is attributed to the robust coupling between the roll and sway motions in other words this significant growth in sway responses is the result of resonance created in roll motion the present model well predicted this phenomenon as shown in fig 11 clear differences between the results of current model and those of experiment data and other two dimensional numerical solutions can be observed as discussed in previous section there are marginal differences between the obtained results of current model with that of others in the solution of diffraction and radiation problems that yield the fundamental parameters such as wave exciting forces added mass and damping matrices used in full interaction equation 25 these marginal and negligible errors somehow eliminate the possibility of existence of severe numerical errors in the proposed model there are several other possible explanations for these differences first reason is that fluid viscosity is excluded in the governing laplace equation so that viscous damping caused by flow separation at sharp corners is ignored in such models including our proposed one as mentioned by lee and cho 2003 this discrepancies have been compensated for in the numerical results of sannasiraj et al 1998 by introducing empirical artificial damping not reported in their paper secondly drag damping of mooring lines which have not been considered in their modeling can be considered as another cause finally nonlinear effects in fluid structure interaction which is not considered in the governing linear equations is considered to be the third reason 5 3 modification of damping effects as mentioned in the discussion brought forward at the end of the previous section it seems damping is under estimated by the proposed model the principal objective of this section is to compensate for this under estimation by introducing additional artificial damping and creating a better accordance with experimental data for this purpose the components d 11 d 22 and d 33 of the diagonal radiation damping matrix should be adjusted for each frequency in order to determine the needed additional damping the radiation damping coefficients are amplified so that the obtained raos from the sbfem based model converges to the experimental results of sannasiraj et al 1998 although 100 different incident wave frequencies are considered in the current study there are only a few reported experimental results therefore the numerical results in the above mentioned studies are employed for other frequencies to calibrate the sbfem based model this may explain why there are some discrepancies between our final results and other numerical models for example peak frequency in heave motion moves to lower values which is due to the aggregation of the experimental results in this range for the z component of the structure motion the proportion of required additional damping a d z to the radiation damping coefficient d 11 a d z d 11 as a function of the wavelength to structure width ratio l b is illustrated in fig 12 since the reported experimental and numerical results in the mentioned studies are a function of the incident wavelength and their geometrical dimensions are constant the proposed formulas include only the dimensionless incident wavelength these artificial damping ratio should be added to the d 11 component as can be seen with increase in the wavelength there is need for smaller artificial damping a possible explanation for this is that by increasing in the wavelength the performance of the floating breakwater in reflecting the incident waves decreases in such cases the structure follows the fluid movements this phenomenon reduces the effects of viscous damping caused by the flow separation at sharp corners and eliminate the necessity for additional artificial damping equation 39 is fitted to the additional damping values the coefficient of determination r 2 1 for this equation is an indication of its high accuracy 39 a d z d 11 130 571 l b 5 379 for the horizontal component of the structure motion additional artificial damping a d x is calculated and added to the d 22 component in the radiation damping matrix the additional damping ratios for sway motion are presented in fig 13 it can be seen that in the frequencies close to the resonance of the roll motion larger viscous damping is required this phenomenon is caused by flow separation in rotational motion the trend of variation of this ratio w r t frequency is similar to that of d 22 shown in fig 5d at frequencies much lower than that of roll motion resonance flow separation diminishes and no artificial added damping is needed a polynomial function which is fitted to the considered additional values is represented in equation 40 40 a d x d 22 0 0008 l b 6 0 026 l b 5 0 332 l b 4 2 19 l b 3 7 915 l b 2 14 921 l b 12 36 l b 8 a d x d 22 0 l b 8 the coefficient of determination r 2 0 9969 indicates suitability of the fitted function finally for roll motion on the one hand the peak value of rao did not reported in the experimental results of sannasiraj et al 1998 on the other hand there is a notable difference between numerical responses of sannasiraj et al 1998 and lee and cho 2003 therefore the current model is adjusted in a way that the modified peak value locates at the average of two numerical ones hence close to resonant frequencies the d 33 component is doubled it should be noted that because of the strong coupling between the horizontal and rotational motions of the structure the added damping to d 22 component of the radiation damping matrix affects the rotational responses implicitly these modifications are applied and the corresponding modified structure responses are obtained which are shown in fig 14 as shown in fig 14 by applying these artificial damping the results of the current model converge to experimental responses moreover by applying these artificial damping coefficients as shown in fig 15 the calculated transmission coefficients k t are in a proper agreement with various studies so it can be concluded that by employing these formulations the accuracy of linear models can be improved to predict the responses of restrained floating objects against water waves 6 conclusion the sbfem method is used as a robust and efficient method to solve the problem of wave interaction with a moored floating breakwater in an infinite fluid domain 1 by locating the scaling center within the bounded sub domains and employing four three node quadratic elements on the boundaries of floating body the governing equation in the scaled boundary coordinate system becomes homogeneous at the cost of increasing the computation effort by 35 this implementation eliminates the need for a variety of particular solutions and provides a unified solution process for different radiation modes and wave diffraction problems this method is equally applicable to floating bodies with non rectangular cross sections 2 by implementing the current sbfem model simulation results for radiation and diffraction problems are highly accurate as compared to the result of another sbfem based model with the scaling center on the structure sharp corners and those of an analytical solution 3 considering an accurate and straightforward model to calculate the mooring s stiffness matrix and employing the calculated wave exciting forces and validated hydrodynamic coefficients an applicable model is established to solve the problem of full interaction between water wave and moored floating breakwater with an arbitrary cross section the performance generality and robustness of the proposed model demonstrate its acceptable capability as a linear simulator model to solve the interaction problem 4 in order to consider the nonlinear phenomena such as the drag damping of mooring lines and flow separation from sharp corners and the fluid viscosity the linear model is modified to produce more accurate results this adjustment is made via applying additional artificial damping new equations are proposed for the calculations of these additional damping this research will serve as a basis for future studies on various shapes of floating breakwaters and

21189,the problem of interaction between water wave and moored rectangular floating breakwater is studied using the semi analytical scaled boundary finite element method sbfem in a two dimensional vertical plane the current study applies a generalized solution process by locating the scaling center within the bounded sub domains instead of the body of structure resulting in a homogeneous sbfem equation in spite of the merits of such choice for the scaling center that makes possible the analysis of non rectangular objects the method is changed to numerical analytical one with its consequences such numerical solution in the problem of water wave radiation and diffraction is validated by comparing the results with previous reported studies the generality and robustness of the current sbfem based model is also examined for non rectangular cross sections of the floating breakwater focusing on the proposed sbfem based model the full wave rigid body interaction is analyzed for a moored rectangular floating structure moreover in order to make the linear numerical modeling accurate taking into account the nonlinear aspects of the interaction problem the artificial damping coefficients are quantified and the relevant formula is derived keywords scaled boundary finite element method water wave moored floating breakwater interaction modification of damping effects 1 introduction floating breakwaters fbws are among the most common marine structures which are continuously exposed to water waves abul azm and gesraha 2000 zheng et al 2004a 2004b the analysis of interaction between this type of structures and the surrounding wave domain is the focus of many research endeavors in the past two decades achieving an efficient and accurate model for the analysis of wave fbw interaction have remained as a common challenge for the researchers in this field over the last two decades a semi analytical method the so called scaled boundary finite element method sbfem has been employed to analyze the interactive systems in an infinite solution domain the current study has concentrated on establishing an sbfem based model to examine the wave and moored fbw interaction few studies have emphasized upon determining the hydrodynamic forces exerted on floating objects by sbfem li et al 2005a 2005b solved the problem of wave diffraction and radiation by a rectangular floating structure in an infinite fluid domain with a constant depth based on their study meng and zou 2013 and song and tao 2011 conducted two research on the wave diffraction and radiation caused by respectively a rectangular floating body near a side wall and a horizontal elliptical cylinder in these three studies the scaling center of bounded sub domains was chosen to be located on sharp corners of the structure this decision turned the governing equation into a non homogeneous type in the scaled boundary coordinate system nevertheless setting such locations for scaling center provides analytical solutions for velocity potential distribution on the body surfaces which requires a variety of particular solutions in the presence of normal velocity on the object boundaries using this method a unified solution process for solving wave diffraction and different modes of radiation cannot be established so that for each mode of motion a separate particular solution is needed in order to overcome the problems associated with non homogeneous governing equations several studies were carried out by locating the scaling center at positions other than the sharp corners of the structures tao et al 2007 carried out research to solve wave interaction with a circular cylinder due to non existence of sharp corners they applied sbfem by positioning the scaling center of both the bounded and unbounded sub domains at the center of the structure later song et al 2010 studied wave interaction with multiple cylinders of arbitrary shape they divided the bounded domain into several sub domains with the scaling centers located within each bounded sub domain in both cases it was found that for impermeable fixed structures the governing equation transformed into a homogeneous one in the sbfem coordinate system in order to investigate the effect of decreasing rate of wave exciting force on the porous structures tao et al 2009 song and tao 2010 and liu and lin 2013 applied the sbfem to examine the wave diffraction caused by porous cylindrical structures they concluded that by taking the porosity effects into account and considering the scaling center within bounded sub domains the right hand side of the governing equation becomes zero the mentioned works were extended by li et al 2013a 2013b to analyze the problem of the wave piles group interaction in the three dimensions they included the wave forces structure motions and water surface changes in their research in the present study we have investigated the positioning of scaling center within the bonded sub domain of an fbw with rectangular cross section the sbfem based researches have currently focused on wave diffraction and radiation problems rather than the problem of water wave interaction with free floated or moored fbw in order to consider the effects of mooring lines on fbws performance the sbfem based model should be further developed investigations on the moored fbw behavior exposed to water waves has been performed in various models different cable configurations were taken into consideration in literature taut mooring lines were utilized al solihat and nahon 2016 elchahal et al 2008 williams et al 2000 in these studies the taut lines are modeled as a mass less linear spring which caused simplification of the computations based on jian s cable stiffness formulation 1980 sannasiraj et al 1998 applied the slack mooring lines stiffness matrix to investigate the two dimensional motions of fbw they conducted experiments to substantiate and verify their numerical results their work was expanded by lee and cho 2003 for slack mooring lines which rests on the seabed near the anchor point the mooring line stiffness matrix established by sannasiraj et al 1998 and lee and cho 2003 is based on the assumption that the components of the stiffness matrices are not affected by the body movements furthermore the drag damping of mooring lines is ignored according to lee and cho 2003 unreported damping coefficients were applied to the numerical results of sannasiraj et al 1998 to obtain a better match with their experimental observations incorporating the mooring line stiffness matrix provided by sannasiraj et al 1998 gesraha 2006 analyzed the wave interaction with a moored fbw with vertical side plates his findings indicated that utilizing these structural elements decreased the transmission coefficient and exciting forces cho 2016 continued the previous study for extra porous side plates and concluded that by proper selection of porosity and deeper side plates wave transmission could be considerably reduced in another pivotal study loukogeorgaki and angelides 2005 implemented a numerical model to determine the mooring line stiffness matrix for a three dimensional floating structure their proposed model determined the mooring lines stiffness matrix on the basis of the differential changes of cable tension caused by the static motion of the structure the coefficients corresponding to drag damping of mooring lines and viscous forces were determined by using an iterative process which led to significant increase in computational efforts this study intends to develop an sbfem based two dimensional vertical model to solve the problem of water waves interaction with moored rectangular fbw in the first step to homogenize the governing equations in the scaled boundary coordinate systems and eliminate the need for organizing different forms of particular solutions unlike the studies of li et al 2005a 2005b and meng and zou 2013 the scaling centers of bounded sub domains are located within the associated solution domain next the computational merits and demerits of this modification are discussed the generality and robustness of established sbfem based model are examined for two different non rectangular cross sections analysis of the wave moored fbws interaction is the second purpose of this paper this problem is solved by the sbfem based model as well in order to adapt the calculated results to reported experimental responses as mentioned in the literature the additional damping is employed as far as the calibration of the linear model is concerned the required additional damping is extracted in the current study these artificial damping values per non dimensionalized incident wavelengths are recommended to be used in the future studies the reminding of the paper is organized into six sections section 2 outlines the theoretical formulation of the problem section 3 presents the governing equations in sbfem coordinate systems and the procedure to solve sbfem equations the equations of motion are summarized in section 4 in section 5 first solution of the radiation problem is presented to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the current sbfem model then by evaluating the diffraction problem modeling the validated model is justified to solve the interaction problem section 6 concludes the paper 2 governing equation the sketch used to define the parameters of the problem of interaction between a linear wave with the frequency of ω propagating in the water with a depth of h and a moored rectangular floating breakwater is shown in fig 1 by assuming an infinite length for the structure the effect of wave diffraction around the breakwater is ignored the width and draft of the breakwater are denoted by b and t respectively a slack mooring system restricts the movement of the structure the cartesian coordinate system o x y z is employed as shown to define the governing equations of the wave field surrounding the breakwater assuming an ideal fluid the irrotational flow field can be described in terms of velocity potential thus by separating space and time variables for a periodic motion velocity potential is expressed as 1 φ x z t re al φ x z e i ω t assuming linear wave theory the total velocity potential φ t is divided into three velocity potentials as follows 2 φ t φ i φ s φ r φ i φ s j 1 3 s j φ j where φ i φ s and φ r represent the incident the diffraction and the radiation velocity potentials respectively in addition s j is the amplitude of the j t h mode of motion j 1 for heave j 2 for sway and j 3 for roll within the fluid domain the potential φ should satisfy laplace equation 3 2 φ 0 the boundary conditions describing the flow can be expressed as follows 4 φ z ω 2 g φ at the free surface z 0 5 φ z 0 at the bottom z h 6 φ n v n on the solid surfaces where g is the gravitational acceleration and v n is the normal velocity at a solid surface incident wave potential φ i may be expressed as 7 φ i i g a ω cosh k z h cosh k h e i k x a and k are wave amplitude and wave number respectively on the infinite boundary the potential should have finite values hence sommerfeld boundary condition is applied as 8 lim φ i x i k φ i 0 x where φ i denotes each mode of the potentials introduced in equation 2 3 scaled boundary finite element method sbfem governing laplace equation together with the boundary conditions discussed above are solved using sbfem in this semi analytical method the unknown velocity potentials are solved numerically on the discretized boundaries s of solution domain analytical solutions are sought within each domain along radial lines connecting central point called the scaling center x 0 y 0 to any point on the boundaries in order to implement this method governing equations are converted from cartesian into a new coordinate system ξ s as defined in fig 2 the coordinate ξ is zero at the scaling center and 1 on the boundaries the circumferential coordinate s is defined along the boundaries the scaling center should be positioned so that all the points on the boundaries are visible from that center to achieve this for the problem at hand the whole computational domain is divided into four sub domains ω 2 and ω 3 are the bounded sub domains while ω 1 and ω 4 are the unbounded ones as shown in fig 2 the scaling center is positioned within each sub domain which is different from the previous applications of sbfem on rectangular fbws 3 1 formulation for bounded sub domains as demonstrated in fig 3 two bounded sub domains are considered these sub domains share the same boundary γ int 2 on one side and each share a boundary with the unbounded sub domains γ int 1 γ int 3 on the other side discretization nodes on the boundaries of each bounded subdomain are illustrated in fig 3 the cartesian coordinates of each node is defined by x and y vectors the coordinates of an arbitrary point within an element can be calculated utilizing shape functions similar to finite element method moreover applying the scaling coordinate ξ any arbitrary point within the domain can be defined as a function of a point on the boundary s and the position of scaling center thus the position of any point within each sub domain x ˆ y ˆ is defined by 9 x ˆ x 0 ξ n s x 10 y ˆ y 0 ξ n s y n s is the shape functions the velocity potential at any arbitrary point on a sector can be defined via the potential values of the nodes as 11 φ ξ s n s a ξ where a ξ is the potential function along the lines connecting the scaling center to the nodes similar to the reviewed investigations in section 1 in the current work attempt is made to homogenize the governing equation in the scaled boundary coordinate system by considering the scaling center of the bounded sub domain within the associated medium this objective is satisfied the merits and demerits of this decision are discussed in part 1 of section 5 by applying the galerkin s weighted residual method along the circumferential direction the governing differential equation in the scaled boundary coordinates is expressed as 12 w ξ e t e

solution for the unbounded sub domains in order to obtain the sbfem solution in the far field unbounded sub domains with parallel top and bottom side faces a modified coordinate system is applied the origin is located on the interface of bounded and unbounded sub domains and only the boundary on this interface is discretized introducing the s coordinate along the mentioned interface boundary and ξ parallel to the bottom and to side faces and towards infinity the modified coordinates system is formed thus ξ changes from zero at the interface boundaries γ int 1 or γ int 3 to infinity at far end γ the relationship between the cartesian and modified scaled boundary coordinate system may be expressed as 15 x ˆ n s x ξ 16 y ˆ n s y this coordinate system is demonstrated in fig 4 following li et al 2005a 2005b the governing equations in the modified sbfe coordinate system are expressed as follows 17 e 0 a ξ ξ ξ e 1 t e 1 a ξ ξ k 2 m 0 e 2 a ξ 0 18 q ξ e 0 a ξ ξ e 1 t a ξ here again the definition of each parameter is given in appendix b 3 3 solution process to solve the governing equations in the scaled boundary coordinate system by introducing the new variable χ ξ a ξ q ξ and employing equation 13 equation 14 can be written as 19 ξ χ ξ ξ z χ ξ using equation 17 and the variable χ ξ equation 18 is transformed as 20 χ ξ ξ z χ ξ where z denotes hamilton matrix solving this system of standard eigen value problems results the relations between a ξ and q ξ these relations can be obtained for the bounded and unbounded sub domains from equations 21 and 22 respectively 21 q ξ h b a ξ 22 q ξ h a ξ where h b and h are the stiffness matrices for bounded and unbounded sub domains respectively considering the matching conditions at the interfaces between the sub domains n and n 1 as 23 φ n φ n 1 at the interface between sub domains 24 φ n n φ n 1 n at the interface between sub domains and combining these conditions with equations 21 and 22 the sub domains are assembled when the nodal potentials based on the assembled equations are solved wave pressure and subsequently the exciting forces and hydrodynamic coefficients can be determined the same procedure presented in li

also x p and z p are the components of the distance between the points which connect the cable to the body and the rotation center 5 results and discussion this section is divided into two parts the first part deals with examining the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed sbfem model with the scaling center positioned within the nearfield subdomains for this objective both radiation and diffraction problems are simulated and compared against same cases using sbfem with scaling center on the sharp corners of the floating breakwater in the second part simulations are carried out for the problem of wave moored floating breakwater interaction wave induced forces damping and added mass coefficients required for this part are obtained from the results of the simulations of the first part 5 1 evaluating of the accuracy and efficiency of proposed model in order to estimate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed model radiation problem is considered in the first step with regards to efficiency the computational time of the proposed model is compared against the results of li et al 2005a 2005b li et al 2005a 2005b model was reproduced in the present study by locating the scaling center at the lower corners of the floating body the best results in li et al 2005a 2005b were obtained by discretization of boundaries by two three nodes quadratic elements the same is adopted in the present study the same simulations are repeated as proposed in section 3 1 by locating the scaling center within the bounded sub domain this leads to homogenization of the governing equation in the scaled boundary coordinate system and by applying defined normal velocities on the boundaries of floating body the governing equations can be solved via a unified solution process in this modeling approach there is a need for discretization of the structure surface boundaries different mesh densities are incorporated for discretization of these boundaries coarse mesh consists of two three nodes quadratic elements on each boundary the medium and fine mesh densities consist of 4 and 8 three nodes quadratic elements on body boundaries respectively therefore for the coarse medium and fine mesh densities the bounded sub domain is discretized by 12 elements 16 elements and 24 elements respectively also the unbounded sub domains are modeled by two elements the hydrodynamic forces applied to the structures are defined as 33 f w j i ω ρ s 0 φ w n j d s where n j is the generalized normal with n 1 n z n 2 n x and n 3 z z 0 n x x x 0 n z x 0 z 0 is the rotation center ρ is the fluid density s 0 is the wetted surface in o x z plane and f w j is the force in j direction caused by heave sway and rotational movements w 1 2 3 of the floating body respectively in order to calculate the integral in equation 33 the 5 points 9 points and 13 points newton cotes method were employed for coarse medium and fine mesh densities respectively the added mass μ w j and damping coefficients λ w j per unit length of the structure are calculated as follows 34 μ j w 1 ω 2 re f w j 35 λ w j 1 ω im f w j the non dimensional added mass c a and damping c d coefficients can be defined as 36 c a w j 1 ω 2 b t s re f w j 37 c d w j 1 ω 2 b t s im f w j where s is amplitude of forced displacement in radiation problem for a structure with b t 1 0 and h t 3 0 with b t and h defined in fig 1 the computational times required for these hydrodynamic coefficients with different mesh densities are compared to that of the proposed model by li et al 2005a 2005b and presented in table 1 the radiation problem is analyzed for 100 different frequencies and the total computational time of each model is measured in table 1 the second column represents the number of total elements which are employed for simulation the last column illustrates the computational time of each case on the other hand as shown in fig 5 the results of above four cases are compared with the analytical solution proposed zheng et al 2004b to demonstrate the accuracy of each case it is clear that by using the medium and fine mesh densities the results are in good agreement with the bench mark zheng et al 2004b solution for the sake of quantifying the accuracy of each modeling case the mean squares error mse is calculated for each case and presented in table 2 for different hydrodynamic coefficients the mses are calculated and arranged in rows of table 2 as is seen in table 2 the corresponding mses of the medium and fine mesh densities are in acceptable range of error as compared with the model of li et al 2005b for the purpose of evaluating the generality and robustness of the proposed model the current sbfem based model is examined for wave diffraction problem by three floating breakwaters of rectangular π shaped and circular cross sections the incident wave at left boundary γ int 1 generates normal velocities therefore this problem could be solved using the same approach as for radiation problem the hydrodynamic loads resulted from the incident wave on the stationary structures in k direction are calculated as 38 f k i ω ρ s 0 φ i φ s n k d s the above exiting loads will be used for the simulation of full interaction between incident waves and moored floating breakwater for a rectangular structure with b t 6 0 and h t 2 0 the components of forces applied on the structure are compared with the analytical results of zheng et al 2004b as illustrated in fig 6 the dimensionless forces are calculated by w 1 ρ g a b and w 2 0 5 ρ g a b 2 as is seen the results of the developed model are in good agreement with the results of the analytical work meanwhile in the case of π shaped fbw for the purpose of demonstrating the robustness of the proposed model in the infinite medium with sharp corners a structure with b h 1 0 t h 0 25 and u b 0 5 is considered where u is the depth of each side plate that is vertically protruded from the both sides of the bottom of the structure fig 7 and the plate thickness is assumed to be zero focusing on the design of the medium mesh densities for the breakwater of rectangular cross section to discretize the solution domain the bottom boundary of the structure is discretized with eight three node quadratic elements and four elements discretize other structural boundaries hence 38 three node quadratic elements are needed to discretize the whole fluid domain the components of wave induced forces are shown in fig 8 in comparison with the numerical results of cho 2016 as can be seen the results have a good agreement with the mentioned results based on the validated results it can be concluded that even with taking a few elements for solving the problems in the solution domain with sharp corners sbfem does not suffer from any numerical deficiencies and the results are accurate eventually as demonstrated in fig 9 the problem of water wave diffraction is examined considering a horizontal circular cylinder with the radius r draft r and water depth 2 r restrained on the water surface in this case the main objective is to evaluate the generality of the proposed sbfem based model the reason why the circular cylinder is selected for the examination is rooted in the fact that the faces of this structure are not perpendicular to each other moreover the results of the wave diffraction problem for the mentioned structure are available in the literature to validate the calculated results from the present model to discretize the surface of the structure two different mesh densities are considered first by employing 12 three node quadratic elements on the structure boundary the number of elements in the whole fluid domain is attained equal to 26 however by shrinking the mesh sizes and using 36 elements to discretize the structural boundary the total mesh obtained alters to 50 elements the components of non dimensional forces f x f x ρ g a r and f z f z ρ g a r applied to the structure are compared with naftzger et al 1979 in fig 10 there are some differences between the calculated results and the results in the literature estimating the curve surface by linear elements and calculating the numerical integration in each element are the causes of these differences these discrepancies can be eliminated by increasing the number of elements from table 1 and table 2 it is founded that there is need for approximately 35 additional computation time for achieving almost the same accuracy of li et al 2005a 2005b results however by applying the scaling center within the nearfield subdomains a unified solution process is devised that can be employed for radiation and diffraction problems moreover a simpler multipurpose code is at hand which can be easily used for any non rectangular floating breakwater since the primary purpose of this study is to focus on the rectangular cross section extracting the other results for non rectangular cross sections will be the subject of future research 5 2 full interaction between wave and moored floating breakwater considering the discussed problems in the previous sections the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the floating object could be estimated by solving diffraction radiation problems in this section the moored floating breakwater responses interacting with incident waves are obtained from the proposed model and validated against experimental data this objective is achieved by comparing the calculated responses in the present study with the reported experimental and numerical results of sannasiraj et al 1998 and the numerical results of lee and cho 2003 in sannasiraj et al 1998 experiments a rectangular floating breakwater with a width of 0 4 m draft of 0 1 m and the length of 3 78 m in a water depth of 2 35 m is subjected to regular waves with a height of 0 05 m and the frequency range of 0 3 1 5 h z the floating body is tightened by four slack mooring lines each with a length of 4 7 m on the other hand sannasiraj et al 1998 and lee and cho 2003 solved this problem numerically in a two dimensional vertical configuration with the finite element and element free galerkin methods respectively the approach of sannasiraj et al 1998 in modeling the mooring lines effects have been compared with more complex methods such as loukogeorgaki and angelides 2005 the comparison showed appropriate accuracy of sannasiraj et al 1998 model despite its simplicity hence in the present research this method is employed to include the effects of mooring lines on the interaction of floating breakwater and incident waves for the incident waves with the above mentioned frequency range the responses of amplified operators raos for the heave sway and roll motions are obtained from the simulation of current model and compared against mentioned experimental and numerical results as shown in fig 11 in general there is a fairly good agreement between the numerical results of the present study and the reported ones in mentioned literatures in the range of 0 3 ω 2 b 2 g 0 4 a rapid growth occurred in rao of the sway mode which is attributed to the robust coupling between the roll and sway motions in other words this significant growth in sway responses is the result of resonance created in roll motion the present model well predicted this phenomenon as shown in fig 11 clear differences between the results of current model and those of experiment data and other two dimensional numerical solutions can be observed as discussed in previous section there are marginal differences between the obtained results of current model with that of others in the solution of diffraction and radiation problems that yield the fundamental parameters such as wave exciting forces added mass and damping matrices used in full interaction equation 25 these marginal and negligible errors somehow eliminate the possibility of existence of severe numerical errors in the proposed model there are several other possible explanations for these differences first reason is that fluid viscosity is excluded in the governing laplace equation so that viscous damping caused by flow separation at sharp corners is ignored in such models including our proposed one as mentioned by lee and cho 2003 this discrepancies have been compensated for in the numerical results of sannasiraj et al 1998 by introducing empirical artificial damping not reported in their paper secondly drag damping of mooring lines which have not been considered in their modeling can be considered as another cause finally nonlinear effects in fluid structure interaction which is not considered in the governing linear equations is considered to be the third reason 5 3 modification of damping effects as mentioned in the discussion brought forward at the end of the previous section it seems damping is under estimated by the proposed model the principal objective of this section is to compensate for this under estimation by introducing additional artificial damping and creating a better accordance with experimental data for this purpose the components d 11 d 22 and d 33 of the diagonal radiation damping matrix should be adjusted for each frequency in order to determine the needed additional damping the radiation damping coefficients are amplified so that the obtained raos from the sbfem based model converges to the experimental results of sannasiraj et al 1998 although 100 different incident wave frequencies are considered in the current study there are only a few reported experimental results therefore the numerical results in the above mentioned studies are employed for other frequencies to calibrate the sbfem based model this may explain why there are some discrepancies between our final results and other numerical models for example peak frequency in heave motion moves to lower values which is due to the aggregation of the experimental results in this range for the z component of the structure motion the proportion of required additional damping a d z to the radiation damping coefficient d 11 a d z d 11 as a function of the wavelength to structure width ratio l b is illustrated in fig 12 since the reported experimental and numerical results in the mentioned studies are a function of the incident wavelength and their geometrical dimensions are constant the proposed formulas include only the dimensionless incident wavelength these artificial damping ratio should be added to the d 11 component as can be seen with increase in the wavelength there is need for smaller artificial damping a possible explanation for this is that by increasing in the wavelength the performance of the floating breakwater in reflecting the incident waves decreases in such cases the structure follows the fluid movements this phenomenon reduces the effects of viscous damping caused by the flow separation at sharp corners and eliminate the necessity for additional artificial damping equation 39 is fitted to the additional damping values the coefficient of determination r 2 1 for this equation is an indication of its high accuracy 39 a d z d 11 130 571 l b 5 379 for the horizontal component of the structure motion additional artificial damping a d x is calculated and added to the d 22 component in the radiation damping matrix the additional damping ratios for sway motion are presented in fig 13 it can be seen that in the frequencies close to the resonance of the roll motion larger viscous damping is required this phenomenon is caused by flow separation in rotational motion the trend of variation of this ratio w r t frequency is similar to that of d 22 shown in fig 5d at frequencies much lower than that of roll motion resonance flow separation diminishes and no artificial added damping is needed a polynomial function which is fitted to the considered additional values is represented in equation 40 40 a d x d 22 0 0008 l b 6 0 026 l b 5 0 332 l b 4 2 19 l b 3 7 915 l b 2 14 921 l b 12 36 l b 8 a d x d 22 0 l b 8 the coefficient of determination r 2 0 9969 indicates suitability of the fitted function finally for roll motion on the one hand the peak value of rao did not reported in the experimental results of sannasiraj et al 1998 on the other hand there is a notable difference between numerical responses of sannasiraj et al 1998 and lee and cho 2003 therefore the current model is adjusted in a way that the modified peak value locates at the average of two numerical ones hence close to resonant frequencies the d 33 component is doubled it should be noted that because of the strong coupling between the horizontal and rotational motions of the structure the added damping to d 22 component of the radiation damping matrix affects the rotational responses implicitly these modifications are applied and the corresponding modified structure responses are obtained which are shown in fig 14 as shown in fig 14 by applying these artificial damping the results of the current model converge to experimental responses moreover by applying these artificial damping coefficients as shown in fig 15 the calculated transmission coefficients k t are in a proper agreement with various studies so it can be concluded that by employing these formulations the accuracy of linear models can be improved to predict the responses of restrained floating objects against water waves 6 conclusion the sbfem method is used as a robust and efficient method to solve the problem of wave interaction with a moored floating breakwater in an infinite fluid domain 1 by locating the scaling center within the bounded sub domains and employing four three node quadratic elements on the boundaries of floating body the governing equation in the scaled boundary coordinate system becomes homogeneous at the cost of increasing the computation effort by 35 this implementation eliminates the need for a variety of particular solutions and provides a unified solution process for different radiation modes and wave diffraction problems this method is equally applicable to floating bodies with non rectangular cross sections 2 by implementing the current sbfem model simulation results for radiation and diffraction problems are highly accurate as compared to the result of another sbfem based model with the scaling center on the structure sharp corners and those of an analytical solution 3 considering an accurate and straightforward model to calculate the mooring s stiffness matrix and employing the calculated wave exciting forces and validated hydrodynamic coefficients an applicable model is established to solve the problem of full interaction between water wave and moored floating breakwater with an arbitrary cross section the performance generality and robustness of the proposed model demonstrate its acceptable capability as a linear simulator model to solve the interaction problem 4 in order to consider the nonlinear phenomena such as the drag damping of mooring lines and flow separation from sharp corners and the fluid viscosity the linear model is modified to produce more accurate results this adjustment is made via applying additional artificial damping new equations are proposed for the calculations of these additional damping this research will serve as a basis for future studies on various shapes of floating breakwaters and their interaction with surrounding water waves credit authorship contribution statement meisam qorbani fouladi methodology software writing original draft data curation peyman badiei supervision
