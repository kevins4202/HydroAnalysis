5955,understanding how land use change influences the water cycle is of critical importance to land and water management determining the timing location and rates of groundwater recharge and their relationship to land use is often challenging leading to significant uncertainties in water budgets and water cycle planning in this study a combination of physical and hydrochemical isotope techniques were used to estimate and map groundwater recharge rates and identify its key controlling factors in a rapidly urbanising catchment in southeast australia the primary objective was to provide qualitative and quantitative information regarding recharge allowing comparison and monitoring of changes as future urbanisation takes place the presence of significant tritium in shallow groundwater 1 0 tu along with radiocarbon activities 85 pmc and low salinity e g ec 600 Âµs cm allowed identification of areas where significant recharge has taken place in recent years these were strongly associated with elevated topography on the basin margin and the absence of volcanic clay the dominant lithology underlying most of the region this interpretation is supported by time series analysis of soil moisture profiles which indicate minimal vertical propagation of precipitation below 1 5 m depth in volcanic clay soils estimation of recharge rates was conducted using chloride mass balance and water table fluctuation analysis in water table aquifer monitoring bores rates mostly ranged between 1 5 and 50 mm yr however recharge exceeding 100 mm year was identified in a spatially restricted zone at the edge of the basin here the volcanic lithology is absent and quaternary sand directly overlies the lower cainozoic sand aquifer this area comprises a small percentage of land in the study area approximately 15 but is estimated to contribute a large proportion nearly half of recharge the findings underscore the importance of characterising recharge locations and processes to support the protection of groundwater quality and quantity for example through careful land use planning keywords groundwater recharge environmental isotopes urbanisation land use change 1 introduction the world s population is increasingly living in urban and peri urban lands resulting in the rapid expansion of cities physical footprints globally un 2017 understanding how land use change including urbanisation affects the hydrological cycle is a critically important topic with major implications for future water and land use planning vorosmarty et al 2000 baker 2003 usgs 2015 while there have been significant advances in recent years understanding changes to surface hydrology during and following land conversion for urbanisation gupta 2010 to date the effects on sub surface hydrology particularly groundwater recharge are poorly understood lerner 2002 schirmer et al 2013 han et al 2017 urbanisation results in significant changes to the physical structure of the land surface and shallow sub surface as well as water usage patterns which have the potential to affect catchment and aquifer water balances and water quality fig 1 with respect to groundwater recharge lerner 2002 and schirmer et al 2013 highlighted that contrary to commonly held beliefs conversion from agriculture or forest to urban or peri urban land may result in increases in groundwater recharge or little change in net rates however such land use change is commonly associated with significant changes in the location s and mechanism s of recharge groundwater recharge is defined as the vertical flow of water reaching the water table which adds to groundwater storage healy 2010 rates of recharge vary spatially and temporally by orders of magnitude depending on the interplay between climate geology and soil type topography surface hydrology vegetation and land use scanlon et al 2006 mcmahon et al 2011 numerous physical and tracer based techniques have been developed to estimate recharge e g healy 2010 cartwright et al 2017 some of the most common include chloride mass balance cmb water table fluctuation wtf and water balancing however most techniques suffer from significant uncertainty scanlon et al 2002 and it is rare for any single method to provide comprehensive spatial and temporal information about recharge mechanisms rates and locations as such it is preferable to use multiple independent lines of evidence to constrain rates and determine key factors controlling these healy 2010 in this study a combination of physical and hydrochemical methods were used to estimate rates of groundwater recharge across a catchment experiencing rapid urbanisation and determine its spatial patterns and relationship to key influences such as soils geology elevation and surface infrastructure this is required as a baseline from which to conduct ongoing assessment of the effects of future hydrogeological changes as urbanisation progresses over the coming decade s and to identify early indications of changes in recharge rate location and mechanism s as this occurs the primary aims of the study were to a identify areas of active groundwater recharge i e where significant recharge over recent years or decades is evident b determine the key factors e g soils geology topography controlling groundwater recharge rates in different areas c quantify likely recharge rates throughout the catchment under current day conditions d explore the implications of these findings for future land and water management e g given the current and future expected changes in land use this information can be used to inform strategies to maximise the quality and quantity of groundwater recharge entering the underlying aquifer system as land use change progresses for example through strategic protection of areas found to be high recharge zones to our knowledge this is one of the first studies to use multiple field based techniques to independently estimate and map groundwater recharge rates and determine their relationships to other factors in a catchment experiencing rapid urbanisation 2 study area 2 1 geographic and hydrogeological setting the study area comprises approximately 50 km2 of land on the western margin of the western port basin located southeast of cranbourne fig 2 approximately 45 km southeast of the city of melbourne in southeast australia fig 2 the location was selected because a it has been previously identified as an important recharge area for groundwater in the koo wee rup water supply protection area where groundwater is the primary water supply lakey 1980 b the area is currently undergoing widespread land use change urbanisation with the potential to influence groundwater recharge however the rates mechanisms and locations of recharge are to date poorly understood the local climate is temperate with mean temperatures ranging from 14 0 to 25 6 c in summer and 6 2 to 13 6 c in winter fig 4 long term average annual rainfall bureau of meteorology station no 86244 is 785 mm and is on average slightly higher in winter and spring than summer long term average annual potential pan evaporation 1351 mm exceeds annual precipitation with considerably higher rates in summer 195 mm month than winter 51 mm month this results in favourable conditions for groundwater recharge predominantly occurring in winter when average rainfall exceeds potential evaporation fig 4 surface water drainage across the basin consists of ephemeral and permanent streams flowing southward off upland areas fig 2 the once extensive koo wee rup swamp to the southeast of the study area has now been effectively drained by an extensive network of artificial drains which convey much of the surface runoff in the catchment to western port bay primarily for the purpose of flood protection and to convert the swamp to agricultural land these drains flow predominantly above quaternary clays and as such have relatively little interaction with groundwater e g lee et al 2016 in the west of the western port basin some additional surface flow occurs in ephemeral channels which only flow for short periods following heavy rain events i e baseflow is minimal since the construction of new suburbs in the northern part of this area stormwater flow is also channelled into a constructed wetland adjacent to sites bh4s on fig 3 the geology and hydrogeology of the region are summarised in lakey and tickell 1981 lee 2015 and others briefly the western port basin is a relatively shallow cainozoic structure filled with a mixture of clay silt sand minor coal and limestone and basalt lava flows jenkin 1962 the basin is bounded to the west by the tyabb fault clyde monocline to the east by the heath hill fault and to the north by outcropping palaeozoic bedrock fig 5 the basin is typically less than 100 m deep in the west but thickens in the east up to 300 m lakey and tickell 1980 silurian meta sediments including sandstone mudstone and siltstone form the bedrock over the western part of the basin jenkin 1962 and these outcrop in the southwest of the study area cainozoic deposition occurred through a series of marine transgressions and regressions and volcanic eruptions lakey and tickell 1981 the paleocene oligocene childers formation consists of ligneous clay dense silt and coarse sand and gravel deposited by alluvial and paludal processes the childers formation contains fresh groundwater and has relatively high hydraulic conductivity 3 4 m day forming a locally important aquifer confined by the overlying older volcanics lakey and tickell 1981 the miocene older volcanics monbulk volcanic group occur extensively across the basin with substantial outcrop and sub crop near cranbourne and underlie younger cainozoic sediments elsewhere in the basin fig 5 the basalt flows are locally interbedded with clay sand gravel and coal carrillo rivera 1975 this unit forms an important aquifer which can be classified as leaky confined lakey and tickell 1981 noted that the basalts are often highly weathered to clay both in sub crop in the cranbourne area and at deeper levels between different lava flows within the western port basin miocene marine and non marine sediments baxter and sherwood formations overlie the volcanics throughout much of the basin however these units are largely absent in the study area which is focussed in the west where urbanisation is taking place fig 3 fig 5 here the older volcanics and or silurian bedrock are instead overlain by thin layers of quaternary deposits predominantly pleistocene aeolian sand this sand is quartzose medium to coarse grained and forms north west to south east aligned ridges in the cranbourne area groundwater is extracted from thin localised aquifers in these sands however these have limited storage capacity 2 2 land use and future development plans the study area includes the commercial centre of cranbourne and surrounding market garden farms to the east and south fig 2 fig 3 since the 1980s the area has been dominated by irrigated horticulture the source of irrigation water is a mixture of surface water groundwater and in more recent times treated municipal wastewater since the mid 2000s suburban development has begun to replace agricultural land this is governed by the victorian planning scheme and urban growth boundary which was extended in 2012 to take in a significant area of new land south and east of cranbourne that was previously zoned for agricultural use the city of casey the local government area had an estimated population of 275 000 in 2013 and this is predicted to grow to 492 000 by 2041 city of casey 2016 cranbourne east within the study area currently has the highest rate of population growth in australia abs 2018 accompanying this growth agricultural land is being replaced by low density residential housing sub divisions fig 1 fig 3 shows satellite imagery of the area since 2006 indicating the extent of replacement of agricultural land with sub urban development up to 2017 given the existing land use change that has occurred since approximately 2013 and that the data in the study were collected between 2014 and 2017 the data and findings do not represent a complete pre urbanisation characterisation of the hydrological regime but rather a snapshot during a relatively early stage of urbanisation much of the farmland visible on fig 3 has now been approved for re development and is expected to be converted to residential suburbs over the next decade 2 3 previous studies of recharge previous studies e g carrillo rivera 1975 longley et al 1978 lakey 1980 ghd 2010 skm 2003 identified areas of out cropping and sub cropping cainozoic formations along the western and eastern margins of the western port basin as the most likely locations for groundwater recharge recharge was considered in these studies to occur through a combination of diffuse infiltration through sand or outcropping basalt and focussed recharge via losses from the lang lang river and wetlands on french island which both occur to the east outside the studied area lakey 1980 applied the water table fluctuation wtf method over annual groundwater level time series to estimate a recharge rate of approximately 2 000 ml year in the cranbourne area 65 km2 lakey 1980 considered the older volcanics to be unconfined comprising the main intake area for groundwater recharge in the west of the basin our study area longley et al 1978 calculated recharge as an input to a finite difference groundwater model of the basin estimating a percentage of rainfall infiltration over areas of outcropping older volcanics and adjusting this to achieve calibration to piezometric head data this resulted in estimated recharge of 4400 5000 ml year over 45 km2 of land surrounding cranbourne equivalent to a rate of 100 113 mm year or approximately 15 of rainfall recharge was also estimated in a later two layer numerical finite difference groundwater model applying a uniform rainfall infiltration rate and varying vertical hydraulic conductivities to achieve calibration to piezometric heads skm 2003 this resulted in an estimated overall recharge of 5800 ml yr in the western port basin with the majority occurring on the eastern side e g near the lang lang river rather than the west these modelling studies did not involve any substantial spatial adjustment or refinement of recharge rates for specific areas e g to reflect heterogeneity in surface conditions such as soil texture despite these previous attempts to estimate recharge rates in the basin to date limited field data have been collected from the water table aquifer and shallow sub surface within the hypothesised recharge area s to support or further investigate these estimates as such there is ongoing uncertainty as to the location rates and mechanisms of recharge 3 data collection sampling and analysis 3 1 rainfall and soil moisture monitoring precipitation events were measured between 2014 and 2017 using a tipping bucket rain gauge tb6 hydrological services installed at clyde recreation reserve next to bh2 fig 5 the gauge was installed 2 m above the ground and clear of overhead obstructions as per the installation guidelines hydrological services 2008 rainfall was collected and logged as 0 2 mm events summed to daily totals for the purposes of data plotting in conjunction with groundwater level and soil moisture time series e g fig s1 vertical profiles of soil moisture were monitored at 30 cm intervals to a depth of 1 5 m at two locations near bh4 and bh2 see fig 4 for locations using capacitance sensors sentek housed in pvc tubes the sensors induce an electromagnetic field to measure changes in capacitance related to changes in soil moisture capacitance was converted to volumetric water content Î¸v as described by paltineanu and starr 1997 these data were considered semi quantitative showing relative changes in soil moisture with time at different depths following rain events as opposed to precise quantification of absolute volumetric soil moisture contents which would require more detailed calibration paltineanu and starr 1997 3 2 monitoring bore installation and water level logging groundwater monitoring bores n 13 were installed during drilling campaigns in january 2014 and july 2016 locations were selected to cover the area previously mapped as the zone of recharge lakey 1980 nested monitoring bores were installed at four locations to examine vertical hydraulic gradients and the relationship between the shallow and deeper aquifers fig 4 fig 5 boreholes were drilled using either mud rotary boring with few or no additives in the water based drilling fluid or solid auger with u tubes shelby tubes depending on the lithology to provide accurate lithological samples wherever possible bores were constructed with 50 mm diameter class 18 upvc casing with 3 m long slotted sections bore annuli were backfilled with 1 2 mm diameter washed quartz sand filter pack to approximately 0 5 m above the top of screen and backfilled with bentonite and cement bores were developed through manual bailing pumping and air lifting to remove drilling fluid and ensure representative groundwater samples from the aquifer bore construction and lithology logs are included as electronic supplementary material appendix a non vented groundwater pressure transducers solinst levelogger and in situ level troll were deployed in twelve monitoring bores five of these loggers also recorded electrical conductivity logging frequency intervals ranged from 15 to 60 min a barometric pressure logger recorded atmospheric air pressure at the same frequency pressure readings were converted to water depth d correcting for density and barometric loading according to smith 2012 water levels were also periodically manually checked using a solinst interface probe and logger data adjusted where necessary accordingly electrical conductivity loggers were periodically checked against a calibration standard and measurements were taken as specific conductance Âµs cm or ms cm corrected to 25 c 3 3 groundwater sampling hydrochemical and radio isotope analysis hydrochemical analyses were conducted on groundwater samples collected between 2014 and 2017 n 23 samples were collected using a 12 v submersible pump proactive supertwister pumping at approximately 0 3l min electrical conductivity ec temperature ph and dissolved oxygen do were monitored using a hach hq40d or ysi 556 handheld water quality meter and stabilisation of these parameters and water levels were achieved prior to sampling samples were collected in hdpe bottles filled to the top and capped to minimise headspace alkalinity titrations were performed in the field with a hach digital titrator and sulfuric acid 0 16 n or 1 60 n solution using bromocresol green methyl red indicator samples for cation analysis were filtered through 0 45 Âµm filter paper or in line filters aquapore and acidified in the field with hno3 major ions were analysed at la trobe university or the monash university school of earth atmosphere and environment at la trobe university potassium and sodium were analysed on a flame photometer and chloride on a sherwood chloride analyser model 926 calcium and magnesium were analysed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy at monash university major ions were analysed using an ion chromatograph metrohm and icp ms following methods described in cartwright et al 2010 bicarbonate concentrations were determined from alkalinity titrations and are precise to 5 charge balance errors were less than 10 except in two instances tritium analysis on samples collected in 2014 n 13 was conducted by liquid scintillation spectrometry following distillation and electrolytic enrichment at the national isotope centre gns new zealand or the australian nuclear science and technology organisation ansto tritium concentrations are expressed in tritium units tu samples from the national isotope centre have a precision of 0 06 tu at an average tritium concentration of recent rainfall 4 tu and a detection limit of 0 025tu morgenstern and taylor 2009 samples from ansto have 1Ï uncertainties between 0 02 and 0 03 with a minimum quantification limit of 0 15 tu a further batch of tritium samples n 3 were submitted to isotech laboratories champaign il usa in 2016 this analysis used the same techniques electrolytic enrichment and liquid scintillation counting but with a higher quantification limit of 1 0tu radiocarbon analyses n 15 were completed at ansto and isotech laboratories using accelerator mass spectrometry at ansto radiocarbon activities were determined on graphite targets using the 2mv tandetron accelerator star and reported as percent modern carbon pmc fink et al 2004 this involves normalisation of 14c 12c ratios to 14c activities assuming Î´13c values of dissolved inorganic carbon dic of 25 e g plummer and glynn 2013 the radiocarbon activities had a range of 1Ï errors between 0 03 and 0 4 3 4 recharge estimation 3 4 1 chloride mass balance the concentration of chloride in rainfall was measured directly on 3 occasions in 2017 by collecting water in the rain gauge following precipitation events of different sizes chloride concentrations ranged from 7 1 to 15 0 mg l with a mean of 11 7 mg l this compares to a long term study completed by crosbie et al 2012 in which monthly rainwater samples for more than four years were analysed in melbourne resulting in a weighted average of 5 4 mg l the higher concentrations observed in this study are attributed to the closer proximity to the coastline the sampling station was located 9 km from the coast while that in crosbie et al 2012 was located approximately 20 km from the coast this is line with a study of variation of chloride in precipitation with distance from the southern coast of australia bresciani et al 2014 which observed a decline from approximately 30 mg l near the coast to approximately 16 mg l at a distance 7 km inland on non vegetated land the average concentration of chloride in rainfall and in sampled groundwater from the bores were used to estimate recharge using the steady state chloride mass balance method cmb as described by crosbie et al 2010 eq 2 2 r p cl p cl gw where r recharge mm yr p rainfall precipitation mm yr clp chloride concentration in rainfall mg l and clgw chloride concentration in groundwater mg l it is acknowledged that this method provides an indication of long term average recharge by vertical percolation assuming steady state hydrological conditions which may over simplify recharge processes in the catchment additionally chloride deposition is known to be spatially variable and may be significantly impacted by vegetation which tends to increase deposition bresciani et al 2014 this in turn could lead to calculated recharge rates that under estimate true values in the study area vegetation is relatively sparse and has been for the past five or more decades due to the high utilization of land for agriculture this method was applied to all bores constructed and sampled during the study n 14 in some cases on multiple dates as well as data collated from government monitoring bores contained in the victorian water measurement information system delwp 2017 a full download of this database was completed and 1975 bores containing water quality information were identified across the western port basin this was further refined to a subset of 168 bores with at least one full set of major ion data including chloride a 2 km buffer beyond the study area was applied to extend the data coverage where multiple concentrations of chloride were recorded at a bore at different times the most recent value was used these data were then converted into a map of cmb based recharge estimates using ordinary point kriging 3 4 2 water table fluctuation monitoring bores screened across the water table which showed response s to rainfall events were selected for recharge estimation according to eq 3 healy and cook 2002 3 r s y Î´ h Î´ t where r recharge sy specific yield Î´h change in water level and Î´t is the time period the change in water level Î´h is the change specifically related to a rainfall event or alternatively the rainfall within a season and accounts for the underlying natural recession in water level trends cuthbert 2014 in some instances the unsaturated zone thickness meant that that this technique was not appropriate for recharge estimation healy and cook 2002 due the significant lag time between rainfall and a water table response one site bh3d was also excluded from analysis using this method as the hydrograph indicated influence from nearby groundwater pumping 4 results 4 1 lithology and updated hydrogeological conceptualisation figs 6 and 7 show groundwater elevations in the uppermost unconfined aquifer collected in 2016 along with mapping and interpolation of the extent and thickness of the older volcanics basalt and clay based on the drilling results and existing lithology data e g appendix a a revised conceptual model of the hydrogeology was developed on this basis providing important constraints on the likely locations s of groundwater recharge fig 7 key aspects of this model are the older volcanics are widespread in the central and eastern part of the study area where they sub crop extensively but absent along the western margin near the catchment divide this unit forms the uppermost unconfined aquifer over most of the study area except for a small area in the southwest fig 6 fig 7 where the older volcanics unit sub crops it is extremely weathered to clay with no rock fabric visible typically for the top 10 m below this depth the oder volcanics transitions to moderately weathered to fresh basalt along the western margin of the catchment quaternary sand and clay outcrop and directly overlie the childers formation or silurian siltstone the baxter formation tbm which appears on geological maps of the study area and overlies the older volcanics to the east lakey and tickell 1980 was not encountered during drilling groundwater flow is east to south easterly and is driven by the topographic high along the margin of the catchment fig 2 fig 6 the topography peaks locally at approximately 100 mahd at the cranbourne royal botanic garden fig 7 upward vertical hydraulic gradients from the childers formation to the overlying older volcanics were observed at three nested bore locations the childers aquifer is thus confined by the overlying older volcanics a downward vertical hydraulic gradient was encountered at bh2 the only nested site where both bores are screened in the older volcanics this indicates potential for recharge via vertical percolation the older volcanics is particularly thick 49 m at this location 4 2 radiogenic isotopes tritium concentrations varied significantly across the study area fig 8 with concentrations up to 2 40 tu and seven samples below the detection limit the mean concentration of eight samples with detectable tritium was 1 50tu the presence of tritium indicates a component of modern water in an aquifer where modern is defined as recharge having occurred within approximately the last 50 years jasechko 2016 tritium occurs in the atmosphere and rainfall due to background cosmogenic production however nuclear weapons testing during the 1950s and 1960s resulted in elevated concentrations in groundwater recharged since approximately 1960 worldwide more pronounced in the northern than southern hemisphere concentrations in rainfall peaked in australia in 1963 at approximately 160 tu and have since declined the current concentration in melbourne rainfall is approximately 3 tu representing ambient background with minimal residual effect from the nuclear testing tadros et al 2014 given tritium s half life 12 3 years groundwater with a significant component of recharge from the past one to two decades should contain concentrations between approximately 0 5 to 2 5 tu groundwater recharged during the early 1960 s would also be expected to contain similar concentrations following radioactive decay of tritium in rainfall from its peak level during this era radiocarbon activities ranged from 14 77 to 100 8 pmc radiocarbon activity in groundwater reflects input from the atmosphere and soil gas co2 incorporated into the dissolved inorganic carbon dic of recharging groundwater incorporation of water recharged during the bomb pulse of the 1960s can result in elevated activities 100pmc while dilution of 14c active dic with dead carbon from the aquifer matrix leads to decreasing activities typically in siliciclastic aquifers radiocarbon activities above 90pmc reflect a significant component of modern recharge i e water infiltrated since the 1950s most bores with tritium concentrations above 0 5 tu also contained radiocarbon activities between 85 and 101 pmc consistent with a significant fraction of recent recharge these bores are mostly located within approximately 1 km of the catchment divide and exhibited low groundwater salinities ec 600 Âµs cm as a general principle groundwater in semi arid areas with relatively high recharge rates typically contains relatively low salinities as recharge from rainfall percolation is inversely proportional to evapotranspiration which concentrates the residual solutes herczeg et al 2001 most samples with relatively low or no detectable tritium were also more saline e g ec 1500 Âµs cm fig 8 consistent with lower recharge rates and higher et in bores with relatively saline groundwater but measurable tritium i e where there is evidence of recent recharge e g bh4s this may indicate an increase from historically low recharge rates to higher modern rates samples with low salinity as well as low 3h and 14c activities such as at bh3d and bh4d are interpreted as reflecting pre modern recharge at significant rates elsewhere in the catchment e g further up gradient which has not undergone further salinization e g due to inter aquifer mixing during subsequent transit in the aquifer on timescales of thousands of years 4 3 soil moisture profiles soil moisture was monitored at two locations in weathered older volcanics soils and typically showed rapid changes at shallow depths in response to rainfall but limited or no response at deeper levels fig 9 for example the soil moisture at 0 3 m depth near bh4 fluctuated significantly following precipitation events particularly during the latter part of the monitoring period the magnitude of change in soil moisture following rainfall appeared to increase in the later months of 2016 and early 2017 summer as shallow soils dried out in the hotter weather and with relatively longer periods between rainfall events this potentially reflects a greater degree of shallow infiltration via macro pores in the dry soils soil moisture at intermediate depths e g 0 9 m showed only minor fluctuations in response to rainfall throughout the monitored period although a significant rainfall event in december 2016 appeared to trigger a response at this depth this may indicate soil moisture at this depth only becomes responsive to rainfall after development of cracks during summer and or when a threshold rainfall event size is exceeded below 1 m depth no significant fluctuation in soil moisture were recorded over the monitored period coupled with upward potential gradients increasing soil saturation with depth this indicates little or no recharge via vertical percolation at the monitored localities most rainfall is thus likely consumed by upwards flux via evapotranspiration although a component of bypass flow cannot be ruled out groundwater in bh4s shows a rapid measurable recharge response to rainfall events fig s1 interpreted as reflecting horizontal flow of water from a new constructed wetland adjacent to the bore providing a mechanism of bypass flow to the water table as vertical percolation is not observed in the soil moisture profile further detail regarding this mechanism is outlined in hall 2018 a similar pattern of soil moisture variation with depth was observed at the second monitored profile near bh2 with little or no fluctuation observed in response to any rainfall events at 1 5 m depth at this site the unsaturated zone is thicker than 10 m and composed of volcanic clay and as such the soil moisture data again indicate minimal potential for recharge via vertical percolation this is consistent with high groundwater salinity in bh2 ec of 10 000 Âµs cm likely corresponding to a high rate of evapotranspiration at the expense of potential recharge the presence of detectable tritium 0 06tu in this groundwater does indicate a very small component of recharge since the 1960s this may represent input of recharge at very low rates over recent decades 4 4 recharge estimation 4 4 1 water table fluctuation groundwater levels showed a variety of responses to rainfall events and seasonal climate fluctuations across the study area three bores located near the western edge bh5 bh10 and rbg12 showed significant responses to rainfall fig s1 allowing for recharge estimation using the wtf method two of these hydrographs bh10 and rbg12 showed water level responses sensitive to individual rain events e g sharp increases within one day of rainfall while bh5 showed a seasonal relationship i e an overall rise in winter and fall in summer the responses in these bores met the conditions considered acceptable for applying the water table fluctuation method healy and cook 2002 resulting in recharge rates between 12 and 133 mm year table 2 the highest rates were calculated in rbg12 and bh10 which are located near the topographic high at the edge of the catchment where volcanic clay is absent from the soil and lithological profile fig 7 the wtf method was also applied to other monitored bores in the study area however the results should be viewed as having significant uncertainty due to various limitations in the data as explained in table 2 overall estimated recharge rates using the water table fluctuation method for bores screened in the older volcanics were relatively low but not insignificant e g 20 mm yr exceptions to this were the high estimated rates for three bores located near the constructed wetland mentioned above bh4 bh7 and bh8 which were installed for the purpose of investigating the wetland s interaction with groundwater of these three bores estimated recharge is highest closest to the wetland bh4 as described in section 4 3 soil moisture profiles at this location fig 9 showed no evidence of downward percolation of rainfall and thus another mechanism e g horizontal flux from the wetland is interpreted as being responsible this is discussed further in hall 2018 and is not examined in detail here 4 4 2 chloride mass balance recharge rates from the bores drilled for this study calculated using the chloride mass balance cmb method ranged from 1 5 to 136 mm year table 3 somewhat consistent with the rates determined using wtf the highest rates occurred in groundwater in the quaternary sediments and childers formation 22 136 mm yr near the western edge of the basin with lower rates typically observed in the older volcanics median 5 1 mm year the cmb method was further applied to historical data from across the study area n 162 to improve the spatial coverage of recharge estimates fig 10 table 3 the estimated rates are highest 50 200 mm year in a restricted area extending east from the cranbourne royal botanic garden where the quaternary sediments directly overlie the childers formation i e the older volcanics are absent fig 10 recharge rates of less than 50 mm year occur above the older volcanics along the western margin of the basin declining eastwards to less than 10 mm year fig 10 5 discussion 5 1 recharge rates spatial variation and relationship to key controls while our data provide some support to previous conceptualisations of recharge in the western port basin i e that active recharge occurs within the studied area they provide significant refinement regarding the spatial distribution rates and lithological controls on recharge in areas where the older volcanics outcrop or sub crop recharge is limited 1 5 50 mm year with a median of approximately 5 mm year such rates may still be considered significant in the context of generally low recharge rates over much of the australian continent crosbie et al 2012 however they are low compared to the rates estimated elsewhere in the catchment e g where the volcanics are absent and lower than previous estimates of recharge in the catchment based on numerical modelling longley et al 1978 and other techniques e g seasonal water level fluctuation analysis lakey 1980 the general absence of detectable tritium in most of the shallow older volcanics monitoring bores table 1 confirms that recent recharge to this unit is limited while the two localities where soil moisture profiles were recorded both within volcanic clay also indicated minimal vertical propagation of water occurring below the root zone recharge occurs at significantly higher rates up to 220 mm year on quaternary sand at the topographically elevated margin of the basin as shown by both wtf and chloride mass balance estimates which are broadly consistent tables 2 and 3 this finding has important implications regarding the influence of urbanisation on groundwater in the study area much of the land currently being re developed from agricultural to urban uses is located above the outcrop sub crop of the older volcanics in the northern and western parts of the study area fig 3 given that our data indicate relatively minor recharge occurring via direct infiltration in this area the influence of land use change on the underlying groundwater system is likely to be relatively limited at least in terms of recharge e g fig 1 this finding runs counter to the hypothesis that urbanisation will result in significant changes to recharge rates in the area due to significant modifications to the land surface and water budget during urbanisation our findings are also somewhat contrary to previous modelling studies of the region e g longley et al 1978 which hypothesised higher rates of recharge in this zone based on the mapping of recharge rates derived from chloride mass balance calculations approximately 48 of the total estimated recharge in the study area falls over approximately 15 of the land surface the area enclosed by the contour where recharge is estimated to be 50 mm year approximately 20 of recharge occurs over just 3 of the land area on the southwest margin of the study area fig 10 these elevated recharge rates are consistent with wtf based estimates and other lines of evidence high tritium and radiocarbon activity low groundwater salinity indicating that this restricted geographic area is critical for providing recharge to the basin the geology of this region is different to most of the study area being composed of coarse grained quaternary sands with minor organic matter overlying the childers formation i e the older volcanics are absent groundwater recharged in this area flows to the east fig 6 where it is thought to replenish the important water supply aquifers of the western port group baxter and sherwood formations via vertical leakage lakey and tickell 1981 the childers formation may also provide some recharge to the overlying older volcanics aquifer east of the recharge areas s because hydraulic gradients are typically upwards in the nested bores monitoring these two units however the contribution of vertical leakage to the volcanics appears to be limited possibly due to the presence of confining clays at the base of the basalts both salinity and radio isotope data show that groundwater compositions in the two units are distinct indicating that such leakage is not extensive e g table 1 5 2 implications for land and water management the findings of this study have important implications for future management of land and water in the catchment and for other similar areas experiencing urbanisation land use is rapidly changing with agricultural land being replaced by residential sub divisions section 2 3 fig 3 the construction of new suburbs involves earthworks which grade and compact soils and excavate them for the installation of underground pipes construction of roads pavements and dwellings likely associated hydrological effects include the reduction of open areas with opportunity for diffuse recharge the introduction of new water sources from outside the catchment e g through delivery of pressurised mains water and more rapid channelling of rainfall runoff to specific points in the landscape and ultimately out of the catchment via stormwater drainage networks for flood protection e g lerner 2002 usgs 2015 these modifications are likely to result in a shift from more diffuse recharge to more focussed sources of recharge e g below leaking infrastructure such as mains and sewer pipes lerner 2002 and or below constructed wetlands where storm runoff is channelled this appears to be indicated by our data but is not examined in further detail here concerns over the possible effect of urbanisation on recharge quantity in the study area appear not to be well founded as recharge appears to be inherently limited by the geology in most of the areas undergoing urbanisation above the older volcanics this underscores the importance of collecting direct observation data to map recharge rates and determine its variability and relationship to underlying geological and soil properties as opposed to estimation based on catchment wide water balances or numerical model calibration in particular the study illustrates the importance of considering spatial variation in recharge as distinct from assuming recharge comprises for example a uniform proportion of rainfall the use of multiple qualitative and quantitative recharge estimation techniques is valuable in this regard through this approach more targeted approaches to land and water management can be developed in the face of rapidly changing landscapes e g strategic protection of key areas where conditions favour high quality and or quantity of recharge the highest rates of groundwater recharge in the study area identified using tritium radiocarbon and salinity data and then quantified using chloride mass balance and water table fluctuations are associated with a small geographic area with specific geological characteristics presence of sand and absence of clay that are favourable for rapid sub surface infiltration as discussed above this area accounts for approximately half of the recharge volume in the study area similar findings have been reported in other settings where recharge windows providing a disproportionate amount of overall recharge to an aquifer system have been identified using environmental tracer data e g meredith et al 2012 protection of the quality and quantity of sub surface infiltration occurring in such areas for example by prohibiting activities that may introduce pollutants or compromise soil infiltration capacity is one potential strategy by which groundwater quality and quantity can be maximised and maintained in the face of rapidly changing land use the land where the highest recharge rates occur in the study area is currently part of a protected reserve associated with the cranbourne royal botanic garden as such land uses such as suburban development which may alter recharge rates or introduce contaminants are currently prohibited maintaining this protection status is one relatively simple strategy by which the recharge rates and quality entering the western port basin s aquifers can be maintained over the long term even as the catchment experiences significant hydrological changes 5 3 limitations and uncertainties one of the primary limitations in our study and one which is likely to be applicable in similar cases is the absence of data regarding recharge under completely pre urban conditions in the catchment determining the impact of urbanisation on recharge is therefore somewhat confounded by the fact that urban infrastructure is already having some influence on recharge and the data collected therefore do not represent a true pre development baseline nonetheless some of the data e g radioisotopes and chloride in groundwater do provide a relatively robust indication of recharge processes on timescales likely to predominantly reflect pre urbanisation conditions e g decades chloride mass balance is a technique which time integrates recharge over many years e g allison and hughes 1983 and it is thus suitable for assessing averaged recharge rates over such timescales given that urban development in the area is mostly very recent we believe the chloride based estimates predominantly reflect pre urbanisation recharge rates this contrasts with other techniques such as water table fluctuation or soil moisture monitoring which effectively have no memory and only indicate recharge under current monitored conditions a further potential limitation in our study is the lack of surface water monitoring which typically helps to constrain catchment water balances and improve recharge estimates however within the study area the single major natural surface water body clyde creek is ephemeral only containing water immediately following high rainfall events monitoring these flows is difficult in practice and would likely provide limited additional precision in estimates of groundwater recharge in the absence of accurate estimates of et 6 conclusions and implications this study highlights the value of collecting a variety of independent field data to substantiate and refine conceptual models and quantify groundwater recharge without such data mapping and analysis the spatial dependencies and key factors controlling recharge would be difficult to determine leading to uncertainty with respect to how future water budgets and water quality may change as land use change e g urbanisation takes place using alternative techniques such as water balance analysis or numerical modelling without such field data would be unlikely to provide the level of local detail about recharge rates mechanisms and its controlling factors for example our data and findings allowed for a more refined understanding of the locations and rates of groundwater recharge in the study area which in some cases contradict previous modelling such detailed information is required to make planning decisions that optimise the potential quantities and quality of recharge during and following land use change the findings have significant implications for future management of land and water in the study area and urbanising catchments more generally our data provide evidence that a relatively small area provides a disproportionate amount of the water ultimately recharging the aquifers of the basin the primary factor governing this is the surface and shallow geology which exhibits local variation that is significant in terms of controlling recharge rates and volumes for the wider catchment this underscores the importance and value of maintaining strict land use control policies within this area much like wellhead protection zones enacted in

5955,understanding how land use change influences the water cycle is of critical importance to land and water management determining the timing location and rates of groundwater recharge and their relationship to land use is often challenging leading to significant uncertainties in water budgets and water cycle planning in this study a combination of physical and hydrochemical isotope techniques were used to estimate and map groundwater recharge rates and identify its key controlling factors in a rapidly urbanising catchment in southeast australia the primary objective was to provide qualitative and quantitative information regarding recharge allowing comparison and monitoring of changes as future urbanisation takes place the presence of significant tritium in shallow groundwater 1 0 tu along with radiocarbon activities 85 pmc and low salinity e g ec 600 Âµs cm allowed identification of areas where significant recharge has taken place in recent years these were strongly associated with elevated topography on the basin margin and the absence of volcanic clay the dominant lithology underlying most of the region this interpretation is supported by time series analysis of soil moisture profiles which indicate minimal vertical propagation of precipitation below 1 5 m depth in volcanic clay soils estimation of recharge rates was conducted using chloride mass balance and water table fluctuation analysis in water table aquifer monitoring bores rates mostly ranged between 1 5 and 50 mm yr however recharge exceeding 100 mm year was identified in a spatially restricted zone at the edge of the basin here the volcanic lithology is absent and quaternary sand directly overlies the lower cainozoic sand aquifer this area comprises a small percentage of land in the study area approximately 15 but is estimated to contribute a large proportion nearly half of recharge the findings underscore the importance of characterising recharge locations and processes to support the protection of groundwater quality and quantity for example through careful land use planning keywords groundwater recharge environmental isotopes urbanisation land use change 1 introduction the world s population is increasingly living in urban and peri urban lands resulting in the rapid expansion of cities physical footprints globally un 2017 understanding how land use change including urbanisation affects the hydrological cycle is a critically important topic with major implications for future water and land use planning vorosmarty et al 2000 baker 2003 usgs 2015 while there have been significant advances in recent years understanding changes to surface hydrology during and following land conversion for urbanisation gupta 2010 to date the effects on sub surface hydrology particularly groundwater recharge are poorly understood lerner 2002 schirmer et al 2013 han et al 2017 urbanisation results in significant changes to the physical structure of the land surface and shallow sub surface as well as water usage patterns which have the potential to affect catchment and aquifer water balances and water quality fig 1 with respect to groundwater recharge lerner 2002 and schirmer et al 2013 highlighted that contrary to commonly held beliefs conversion from agriculture or forest to urban or peri urban land may result in increases in groundwater recharge or little change in net rates however such land use change is commonly associated with significant changes in the location s and mechanism s of recharge groundwater recharge is defined as the vertical flow of water reaching the water table which adds to groundwater storage healy 2010 rates of recharge vary spatially and temporally by orders of magnitude depending on the interplay between climate geology and soil type topography surface hydrology vegetation and land use scanlon et al 2006 mcmahon et al 2011 numerous physical and tracer based techniques have been developed to estimate recharge e g healy 2010 cartwright et al 2017 some of the most common include chloride mass balance cmb water table fluctuation wtf and water balancing however most techniques suffer from significant uncertainty scanlon et al 2002 and it is rare for any single method to provide comprehensive spatial and temporal information about recharge mechanisms rates and locations as such it is preferable to use multiple independent lines of evidence to constrain rates and determine key factors controlling these healy 2010 in this study a combination of physical and hydrochemical methods were used to estimate rates of groundwater recharge across a catchment experiencing rapid urbanisation and determine its spatial patterns and relationship to key influences such as soils geology elevation and surface infrastructure this is required as a baseline from which to conduct ongoing assessment of the effects of future hydrogeological changes as urbanisation progresses over the coming decade s and to identify early indications of changes in recharge rate location and mechanism s as this occurs the primary aims of the study were to a identify areas of active groundwater recharge i e where significant recharge over recent years or decades is evident b determine the key factors e g soils geology topography controlling groundwater recharge rates in different areas c quantify likely recharge rates throughout the catchment under current day conditions d explore the implications of these findings for future land and water management e g given the current and future expected changes in land use this information can be used to inform strategies to maximise the quality and quantity of groundwater recharge entering the underlying aquifer system as land use change progresses for example through strategic protection of areas found to be high recharge zones to our knowledge this is one of the first studies to use multiple field based techniques to independently estimate and map groundwater recharge rates and determine their relationships to other factors in a catchment experiencing rapid urbanisation 2 study area 2 1 geographic and hydrogeological setting the study area comprises approximately 50 km2 of land on the western margin of the western port basin located southeast of cranbourne fig 2 approximately 45 km southeast of the city of melbourne in southeast australia fig 2 the location was selected because a it has been previously identified as an important recharge area for groundwater in the koo wee rup water supply protection area where groundwater is the primary water supply lakey 1980 b the area is currently undergoing widespread land use change urbanisation with the potential to influence groundwater recharge however the rates mechanisms and locations of recharge are to date poorly understood the local climate is temperate with mean temperatures ranging from 14 0 to 25 6 c in summer and 6 2 to 13 6 c in winter fig 4 long term average annual rainfall bureau of meteorology station no 86244 is 785 mm and is on average slightly higher in winter and spring than summer long term average annual potential pan evaporation 1351 mm exceeds annual precipitation with considerably higher rates in summer 195 mm month than winter 51 mm month this results in favourable conditions for groundwater recharge predominantly occurring in winter when average rainfall exceeds potential evaporation fig 4 surface water drainage across the basin consists of ephemeral and permanent streams flowing southward off upland areas fig 2 the once extensive koo wee rup swamp to the southeast of the study area has now been effectively drained by an extensive network of artificial drains which convey much of the surface runoff in the catchment to western port bay primarily for the purpose of flood protection and to convert the swamp to agricultural land these drains flow predominantly above quaternary clays and as such have relatively little interaction with groundwater e g lee et al 2016 in the west of the western port basin some additional surface flow occurs in ephemeral channels which only flow for short periods following heavy rain events i e baseflow is minimal since the construction of new suburbs in the northern part of this area stormwater flow is also channelled into a constructed wetland adjacent to sites bh4s on fig 3 the geology and hydrogeology of the region are summarised in lakey and tickell 1981 lee 2015 and others briefly the western port basin is a relatively shallow cainozoic structure filled with a mixture of clay silt sand minor coal and limestone and basalt lava flows jenkin 1962 the basin is bounded to the west by the tyabb fault clyde monocline to the east by the heath hill fault and to the north by outcropping palaeozoic bedrock fig 5 the basin is typically less than 100 m deep in the west but thickens in the east up to 300 m lakey and tickell 1980 silurian meta sediments including sandstone mudstone and siltstone form the bedrock over the western part of the basin jenkin 1962 and these outcrop in the southwest of the study area cainozoic deposition occurred through a series of marine transgressions and regressions and volcanic eruptions lakey and tickell 1981 the paleocene oligocene childers formation consists of ligneous clay dense silt and coarse sand and gravel deposited by alluvial and paludal processes the childers formation contains fresh groundwater and has relatively high hydraulic conductivity 3 4 m day forming a locally important aquifer confined by the overlying older volcanics lakey and tickell 1981 the miocene older volcanics monbulk volcanic group occur extensively across the basin with substantial outcrop and sub crop near cranbourne and underlie younger cainozoic sediments elsewhere in the basin fig 5 the basalt flows are locally interbedded with clay sand gravel and coal carrillo rivera 1975 this unit forms an important aquifer which can be classified as leaky confined lakey and tickell 1981 noted that the basalts are often highly weathered to clay both in sub crop in the cranbourne area and at deeper levels between different lava flows within the western port basin miocene marine and non marine sediments baxter and sherwood formations overlie the volcanics throughout much of the basin however these units are largely absent in the study area which is focussed in the west where urbanisation is taking place fig 3 fig 5 here the older volcanics and or silurian bedrock are instead overlain by thin layers of quaternary deposits predominantly pleistocene aeolian sand this sand is quartzose medium to coarse grained and forms north west to south east aligned ridges in the cranbourne area groundwater is extracted from thin localised aquifers in these sands however these have limited storage capacity 2 2 land use and future development plans the study area includes the commercial centre of cranbourne and surrounding market garden farms to the east and south fig 2 fig 3 since the 1980s the area has been dominated by irrigated horticulture the source of irrigation water is a mixture of surface water groundwater and in more recent times treated municipal wastewater since the mid 2000s suburban development has begun to replace agricultural land this is governed by the victorian planning scheme and urban growth boundary which was extended in 2012 to take in a significant area of new land south and east of cranbourne that was previously zoned for agricultural use the city of casey the local government area had an estimated population of 275 000 in 2013 and this is predicted to grow to 492 000 by 2041 city of casey 2016 cranbourne east within the study area currently has the highest rate of population growth in australia abs 2018 accompanying this growth agricultural land is being replaced by low density residential housing sub divisions fig 1 fig 3 shows satellite imagery of the area since 2006 indicating the extent of replacement of agricultural land with sub urban development up to 2017 given the existing land use change that has occurred since approximately 2013 and that the data in the study were collected between 2014 and 2017 the data and findings do not represent a complete pre urbanisation characterisation of the hydrological regime but rather a snapshot during a relatively early stage of urbanisation much of the farmland visible on fig 3 has now been approved for re development and is expected to be converted to residential suburbs over the next decade 2 3 previous studies of recharge previous studies e g carrillo rivera 1975 longley et al 1978 lakey 1980 ghd 2010 skm 2003 identified areas of out cropping and sub cropping cainozoic formations along the western and eastern margins of the western port basin as the most likely locations for groundwater recharge recharge was considered in these studies to occur through a combination of diffuse infiltration through sand or outcropping basalt and focussed recharge via losses from the lang lang river and wetlands on french island which both occur to the east outside the studied area lakey 1980 applied the water table fluctuation wtf method over annual groundwater level time series to estimate a recharge rate of approximately 2 000 ml year in the cranbourne area 65 km2 lakey 1980 considered the older volcanics to be unconfined comprising the main intake area for groundwater recharge in the west of the basin our study area longley et al 1978 calculated recharge as an input to a finite difference groundwater model of the basin estimating a percentage of rainfall infiltration over areas of outcropping older volcanics and adjusting this to achieve calibration to piezometric head data this resulted in estimated recharge of 4400 5000 ml year over 45 km2 of land surrounding cranbourne equivalent to a rate of 100 113 mm year or approximately 15 of rainfall recharge was also estimated in a later two layer numerical finite difference groundwater model applying a uniform rainfall infiltration rate and varying vertical hydraulic conductivities to achieve calibration to piezometric heads skm 2003 this resulted in an estimated overall recharge of 5800 ml yr in the western port basin with the majority occurring on the eastern side e g near the lang lang river rather than the west these modelling studies did not involve any substantial spatial adjustment or refinement of recharge rates for specific areas e g to reflect heterogeneity in surface conditions such as soil texture despite these previous attempts to estimate recharge rates in the basin to date limited field data have been collected from the water table aquifer and shallow sub surface within the hypothesised recharge area s to support or further investigate these estimates as such there is ongoing uncertainty as to the location rates and mechanisms of recharge 3 data collection sampling and analysis 3 1 rainfall and soil moisture monitoring precipitation events were measured between 2014 and 2017 using a tipping bucket rain gauge tb6 hydrological services installed at clyde recreation reserve next to bh2 fig 5 the gauge was installed 2 m above the ground and clear of overhead obstructions as per the installation guidelines hydrological services 2008 rainfall was collected and logged as 0 2 mm events summed to daily totals for the purposes of data plotting in conjunction with groundwater level and soil moisture time series e g fig s1 vertical profiles of soil moisture were monitored at 30 cm intervals to a depth of 1 5 m at two locations near bh4 and bh2 see fig 4 for locations using capacitance sensors sentek housed in pvc tubes the sensors induce an electromagnetic field to measure changes in capacitance related to changes in soil moisture capacitance was converted to volumetric water content Î¸v as described by paltineanu and starr 1997 these data were considered semi quantitative showing relative changes in soil moisture with time at different depths following rain events as opposed to precise quantification of absolute volumetric soil moisture contents which would require more detailed calibration paltineanu and starr 1997 3 2 monitoring bore installation and water level logging groundwater monitoring bores n 13 were installed during drilling campaigns in january 2014 and july 2016 locations were selected to cover the area previously mapped as the zone of recharge lakey 1980 nested monitoring bores were installed at four locations to examine vertical hydraulic gradients and the relationship between the shallow and deeper aquifers fig 4 fig 5 boreholes were drilled using either mud rotary boring with few or no additives in the water based drilling fluid or solid auger with u tubes shelby tubes depending on the lithology to provide accurate lithological samples wherever possible bores were constructed with 50 mm diameter class 18 upvc casing with 3 m long slotted sections bore annuli were backfilled with 1 2 mm diameter washed quartz sand filter pack to approximately 0 5 m above the top of screen and backfilled with bentonite and cement bores were developed through manual bailing pumping and air lifting to remove drilling fluid and ensure representative groundwater samples from the aquifer bore construction and lithology logs are included as electronic supplementary material appendix a non vented groundwater pressure transducers solinst levelogger and in situ level troll were deployed in twelve monitoring bores five of these loggers also recorded electrical conductivity logging frequency intervals ranged from 15 to 60 min a barometric pressure logger recorded atmospheric air pressure at the same frequency pressure readings were converted to water depth d correcting for density and barometric loading according to smith 2012 water levels were also periodically manually checked using a solinst interface probe and logger data adjusted where necessary accordingly electrical conductivity loggers were periodically checked against a calibration standard and measurements were taken as specific conductance Âµs cm or ms cm corrected to 25 c 3 3 groundwater sampling hydrochemical and radio isotope analysis hydrochemical analyses were conducted on groundwater samples collected between 2014 and 2017 n 23 samples were collected using a 12 v submersible pump proactive supertwister pumping at approximately 0 3l min electrical conductivity ec temperature ph and dissolved oxygen do were monitored using a hach hq40d or ysi 556 handheld water quality meter and stabilisation of these parameters and water levels were achieved prior to sampling samples were collected in hdpe bottles filled to the top and capped to minimise headspace alkalinity titrations were performed in the field with a hach digital titrator and sulfuric acid 0 16 n or 1 60 n solution using bromocresol green methyl red indicator samples for cation analysis were filtered through 0 45 Âµm filter paper or in line filters aquapore and acidified in the field with hno3 major ions were analysed at la trobe university or the monash university school of earth atmosphere and environment at la trobe university potassium and sodium were analysed on a flame photometer and chloride on a sherwood chloride analyser model 926 calcium and magnesium were analysed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy at monash university major ions were analysed using an ion chromatograph metrohm and icp ms following methods described in cartwright et al 2010 bicarbonate concentrations were determined from alkalinity titrations and are precise to 5 charge balance errors were less than 10 except in two instances tritium analysis on samples collected in 2014 n 13 was conducted by liquid scintillation spectrometry following distillation and electrolytic enrichment at the national isotope centre gns new zealand or the australian nuclear science and technology organisation ansto tritium concentrations are expressed in tritium units tu samples from the national isotope centre have a precision of 0 06 tu at an average tritium concentration of recent rainfall 4 tu and a detection limit of 0 025tu morgenstern and taylor 2009 samples from ansto have 1Ï uncertainties between 0 02 and 0 03 with a minimum quantification limit of 0 15 tu a further batch of tritium samples n 3 were submitted to isotech laboratories champaign il usa in 2016 this analysis used the same techniques electrolytic enrichment and liquid scintillation counting but with a higher quantification limit of 1 0tu radiocarbon analyses n 15 were completed at ansto and isotech laboratories using accelerator mass spectrometry at ansto radiocarbon activities were determined on graphite targets using the 2mv tandetron accelerator star and reported as percent modern carbon pmc fink et al 2004 this involves normalisation of 14c 12c ratios to 14c activities assuming Î´13c values of dissolved inorganic carbon dic of 25 e g plummer and glynn 2013 the radiocarbon activities had a range of 1Ï errors between 0 03 and 0 4 3 4 recharge estimation 3 4 1 chloride mass balance the concentration of chloride in rainfall was measured directly on 3 occasions in 2017 by collecting water in the rain gauge following precipitation events of different sizes chloride concentrations ranged from 7 1 to 15 0 mg l with a mean of 11 7 mg l this compares to a long term study completed by crosbie et al 2012 in which monthly rainwater samples for more than four years were analysed in melbourne resulting in a weighted average of 5 4 mg l the higher concentrations observed in this study are attributed to the closer proximity to the coastline the sampling station was located 9 km from the coast while that in crosbie et al 2012 was located approximately 20 km from the coast this is line with a study of variation of chloride in precipitation with distance from the southern coast of australia bresciani et al 2014 which observed a decline from approximately 30 mg l near the coast to approximately 16 mg l at a distance 7 km inland on non vegetated land the average concentration of chloride in rainfall and in sampled groundwater from the bores were used to estimate recharge using the steady state chloride mass balance method cmb as described by crosbie et al 2010 eq 2 2 r p cl p cl gw where r recharge mm yr p rainfall precipitation mm yr clp chloride concentration in rainfall mg l and clgw chloride concentration in groundwater mg l it is acknowledged that this method provides an indication of long term average recharge by vertical percolation assuming steady state hydrological conditions which may over simplify recharge processes in the catchment additionally chloride deposition is known to be spatially variable and may be significantly impacted by vegetation which tends to increase deposition bresciani et al 2014 this in turn could lead to calculated recharge rates that under estimate true values in the study area vegetation is relatively sparse and has been for the past five or more decades due to the high utilization of land for agriculture this method was applied to all bores constructed and sampled during the study n 14 in some cases on multiple dates as well as data collated from government monitoring bores contained in the victorian water measurement information system delwp 2017 a full download of this database was completed and 1975 bores containing water quality information were identified across the western port basin this was further refined to a subset of 168 bores with at least one full set of major ion data including chloride a 2 km buffer beyond the study area was applied to extend the data coverage where multiple concentrations of chloride were recorded at a bore at different times the most recent value was used these data were then converted into a map of cmb based recharge estimates using ordinary point kriging 3 4 2 water table fluctuation monitoring bores screened across the water table which showed response s to rainfall events were selected for recharge estimation according to eq 3 healy and cook 2002 3 r s y Î´ h Î´ t where r recharge sy specific yield Î´h change in water level and Î´t is the time period the change in water level Î´h is the change specifically related to a rainfall event or alternatively the rainfall within a season and accounts for the underlying natural recession in water level trends cuthbert 2014 in some instances the unsaturated zone thickness meant that that this technique was not appropriate for recharge estimation healy and cook 2002 due the significant lag time between rainfall and a water table response one site bh3d was also excluded from analysis using this method as the hydrograph indicated influence from nearby groundwater pumping 4 results 4 1 lithology and updated hydrogeological conceptualisation figs 6 and 7 show groundwater elevations in the uppermost unconfined aquifer collected in 2016 along with mapping and interpolation of the extent and thickness of the older volcanics basalt and clay based on the drilling results and existing lithology data e g appendix a a revised conceptual model of the hydrogeology was developed on this basis providing important constraints on the likely locations s of groundwater recharge fig 7 key aspects of this model are the older volcanics are widespread in the central and eastern part of the study area where they sub crop extensively but absent along the western margin near the catchment divide this unit forms the uppermost unconfined aquifer over most of the study area except for a small area in the southwest fig 6 fig 7 where the older volcanics unit sub crops it is extremely weathered to clay with no rock fabric visible typically for the top 10 m below this depth the oder volcanics transitions to moderately weathered to fresh basalt along the western margin of the catchment quaternary sand and clay outcrop and directly overlie the childers formation or silurian siltstone the baxter formation tbm which appears on geological maps of the study area and overlies the older volcanics to the east lakey and tickell 1980 was not encountered during drilling groundwater flow is east to south easterly and is driven by the topographic high along the margin of the catchment fig 2 fig 6 the topography peaks locally at approximately 100 mahd at the cranbourne royal botanic garden fig 7 upward vertical hydraulic gradients from the childers formation to the overlying older volcanics were observed at three nested bore locations the childers aquifer is thus confined by the overlying older volcanics a downward vertical hydraulic gradient was encountered at bh2 the only nested site where both bores are screened in the older volcanics this indicates potential for recharge via vertical percolation the older volcanics is particularly thick 49 m at this location 4 2 radiogenic isotopes tritium concentrations varied significantly across the study area fig 8 with concentrations up to 2 40 tu and seven samples below the detection limit the mean concentration of eight samples with detectable tritium was 1 50tu the presence of tritium indicates a component of modern water in an aquifer where modern is defined as recharge having occurred within approximately the last 50 years jasechko 2016 tritium occurs in the atmosphere and rainfall due to background cosmogenic production however nuclear weapons testing during the 1950s and 1960s resulted in elevated concentrations in groundwater recharged since approximately 1960 worldwide more pronounced in the northern than southern hemisphere concentrations in rainfall peaked in australia in 1963 at approximately 160 tu and have since declined the current concentration in melbourne rainfall is approximately 3 tu representing ambient background with minimal residual effect from the nuclear testing tadros et al 2014 given tritium s half life 12 3 years groundwater with a significant component of recharge from the past one to two decades should contain concentrations between approximately 0 5 to 2 5 tu groundwater recharged during the early 1960 s would also be expected to contain similar concentrations following radioactive decay of tritium in rainfall from its peak level during this era radiocarbon activities ranged from 14 77 to 100 8 pmc radiocarbon activity in groundwater reflects input from the atmosphere and soil gas co2 incorporated into the dissolved inorganic carbon dic of recharging groundwater incorporation of water recharged during the bomb pulse of the 1960s can result in elevated activities 100pmc while dilution of 14c active dic with dead carbon from the aquifer matrix leads to decreasing activities typically in siliciclastic aquifers radiocarbon activities above 90pmc reflect a significant component of modern recharge i e water infiltrated since the 1950s most bores with tritium concentrations above 0 5 tu also contained radiocarbon activities between 85 and 101 pmc consistent with a significant fraction of recent recharge these bores are mostly located within approximately 1 km of the catchment divide and exhibited low groundwater salinities ec 600 Âµs cm as a general principle groundwater in semi arid areas with relatively high recharge rates typically contains relatively low salinities as recharge from rainfall percolation is inversely proportional to evapotranspiration which concentrates the residual solutes herczeg et al 2001 most samples with relatively low or no detectable tritium were also more saline e g ec 1500 Âµs cm fig 8 consistent with lower recharge rates and higher et in bores with relatively saline groundwater but measurable tritium i e where there is evidence of recent recharge e g bh4s this may indicate an increase from historically low recharge rates to higher modern rates samples with low salinity as well as low 3h and 14c activities such as at bh3d and bh4d are interpreted as reflecting pre modern recharge at significant rates elsewhere in the catchment e g further up gradient which has not undergone further salinization e g due to inter aquifer mixing during subsequent transit in the aquifer on timescales of thousands of years 4 3 soil moisture profiles soil moisture was monitored at two locations in weathered older volcanics soils and typically showed rapid changes at shallow depths in response to rainfall but limited or no response at deeper levels fig 9 for example the soil moisture at 0 3 m depth near bh4 fluctuated significantly following precipitation events particularly during the latter part of the monitoring period the magnitude of change in soil moisture following rainfall appeared to increase in the later months of 2016 and early 2017 summer as shallow soils dried out in the hotter weather and with relatively longer periods between rainfall events this potentially reflects a greater degree of shallow infiltration via macro pores in the dry soils soil moisture at intermediate depths e g 0 9 m showed only minor fluctuations in response to rainfall throughout the monitored period although a significant rainfall event in december 2016 appeared to trigger a response at this depth this may indicate soil moisture at this depth only becomes responsive to rainfall after development of cracks during summer and or when a threshold rainfall event size is exceeded below 1 m depth no significant fluctuation in soil moisture were recorded over the monitored period coupled with upward potential gradients increasing soil saturation with depth this indicates little or no recharge via vertical percolation at the monitored localities most rainfall is thus likely consumed by upwards flux via evapotranspiration although a component of bypass flow cannot be ruled out groundwater in bh4s shows a rapid measurable recharge response to rainfall events fig s1 interpreted as reflecting horizontal flow of water from a new constructed wetland adjacent to the bore providing a mechanism of bypass flow to the water table as vertical percolation is not observed in the soil moisture profile further detail regarding this mechanism is outlined in hall 2018 a similar pattern of soil moisture variation with depth was observed at the second monitored profile near bh2 with little or no fluctuation observed in response to any rainfall events at 1 5 m depth at this site the unsaturated zone is thicker than 10 m and composed of volcanic clay and as such the soil moisture data again indicate minimal potential for recharge via vertical percolation this is consistent with high groundwater salinity in bh2 ec of 10 000 Âµs cm likely corresponding to a high rate of evapotranspiration at the expense of potential recharge the presence of detectable tritium 0 06tu in this groundwater does indicate a very small component of recharge since the 1960s this may represent input of recharge at very low rates over recent decades 4 4 recharge estimation 4 4 1 water table fluctuation groundwater levels showed a variety of responses to rainfall events and seasonal climate fluctuations across the study area three bores located near the western edge bh5 bh10 and rbg12 showed significant responses to rainfall fig s1 allowing for recharge estimation using the wtf method two of these hydrographs bh10 and rbg12 showed water level responses sensitive to individual rain events e g sharp increases within one day of rainfall while bh5 showed a seasonal relationship i e an overall rise in winter and fall in summer the responses in these bores met the conditions considered acceptable for applying the water table fluctuation method healy and cook 2002 resulting in recharge rates between 12 and 133 mm year table 2 the highest rates were calculated in rbg12 and bh10 which are located near the topographic high at the edge of the catchment where volcanic clay is absent from the soil and lithological profile fig 7 the wtf method was also applied to other monitored bores in the study area however the results should be viewed as having significant uncertainty due to various limitations in the data as explained in table 2 overall estimated recharge rates using the water table fluctuation method for bores screened in the older volcanics were relatively low but not insignificant e g 20 mm yr exceptions to this were the high estimated rates for three bores located near the constructed wetland mentioned above bh4 bh7 and bh8 which were installed for the purpose of investigating the wetland s interaction with groundwater of these three bores estimated recharge is highest closest to the wetland bh4 as described in section 4 3 soil moisture profiles at this location fig 9 showed no evidence of downward percolation of rainfall and thus another mechanism e g horizontal flux from the wetland is interpreted as being responsible this is discussed further in hall 2018 and is not examined in detail here 4 4 2 chloride mass balance recharge rates from the bores drilled for this study calculated using the chloride mass balance cmb method ranged from 1 5 to 136 mm year table 3 somewhat consistent with the rates determined using wtf the highest rates occurred in groundwater in the quaternary sediments and childers formation 22 136 mm yr near the western edge of the basin with lower rates typically observed in the older volcanics median 5 1 mm year the cmb method was further applied to historical data from across the study area n 162 to improve the spatial coverage of recharge estimates fig 10 table 3 the estimated rates are highest 50 200 mm year in a restricted area extending east from the cranbourne royal botanic garden where the quaternary sediments directly overlie the childers formation i e the older volcanics are absent fig 10 recharge rates of less than 50 mm year occur above the older volcanics along the western margin of the basin declining eastwards to less than 10 mm year fig 10 5 discussion 5 1 recharge rates spatial variation and relationship to key controls while our data provide some support to previous conceptualisations of recharge in the western port basin i e that active recharge occurs within the studied area they provide significant refinement regarding the spatial distribution rates and lithological controls on recharge in areas where the older volcanics outcrop or sub crop recharge is limited 1 5 50 mm year with a median of approximately 5 mm year such rates may still be considered significant in the context of generally low recharge rates over much of the australian continent crosbie et al 2012 however they are low compared to the rates estimated elsewhere in the catchment e g where the volcanics are absent and lower than previous estimates of recharge in the catchment based on numerical modelling longley et al 1978 and other techniques e g seasonal water level fluctuation analysis lakey 1980 the general absence of detectable tritium in most of the shallow older volcanics monitoring bores table 1 confirms that recent recharge to this unit is limited while the two localities where soil moisture profiles were recorded both within volcanic clay also indicated minimal vertical propagation of water occurring below the root zone recharge occurs at significantly higher rates up to 220 mm year on quaternary sand at the topographically elevated margin of the basin as shown by both wtf and chloride mass balance estimates which are broadly consistent tables 2 and 3 this finding has important implications regarding the influence of urbanisation on groundwater in the study area much of the land currently being re developed from agricultural to urban uses is located above the outcrop sub crop of the older volcanics in the northern and western parts of the study area fig 3 given that our data indicate relatively minor recharge occurring via direct infiltration in this area the influence of land use change on the underlying groundwater system is likely to be relatively limited at least in terms of recharge e g fig 1 this finding runs counter to the hypothesis that urbanisation will result in significant changes to recharge rates in the area due to significant modifications to the land surface and water budget during urbanisation our findings are also somewhat contrary to previous modelling studies of the region e g longley et al 1978 which hypothesised higher rates of recharge in this zone based on the mapping of recharge rates derived from chloride mass balance calculations approximately 48 of the total estimated recharge in the study area falls over approximately 15 of the land surface the area enclosed by the contour where recharge is estimated to be 50 mm year approximately 20 of recharge occurs over just 3 of the land area on the southwest margin of the study area fig 10 these elevated recharge rates are consistent with wtf based estimates and other lines of evidence high tritium and radiocarbon activity low groundwater salinity indicating that this restricted geographic area is critical for providing recharge to the basin the geology of this region is different to most of the study area being composed of coarse grained quaternary sands with minor organic matter overlying the childers formation i e the older volcanics are absent groundwater recharged in this area flows to the east fig 6 where it is thought to replenish the important water supply aquifers of the western port group baxter and sherwood formations via vertical leakage lakey and tickell 1981 the childers formation may also provide some recharge to the overlying older volcanics aquifer east of the recharge areas s because hydraulic gradients are typically upwards in the nested bores monitoring these two units however the contribution of vertical leakage to the volcanics appears to be limited possibly due to the presence of confining clays at the base of the basalts both salinity and radio isotope data show that groundwater compositions in the two units are distinct indicating that such leakage is not extensive e g table 1 5 2 implications for land and water management the findings of this study have important implications for future management of land and water in the catchment and for other similar areas experiencing urbanisation land use is rapidly changing with agricultural land being replaced by residential sub divisions section 2 3 fig 3 the construction of new suburbs involves earthworks which grade and compact soils and excavate them for the installation of underground pipes construction of roads pavements and dwellings likely associated hydrological effects include the reduction of open areas with opportunity for diffuse recharge the introduction of new water sources from outside the catchment e g through delivery of pressurised mains water and more rapid channelling of rainfall runoff to specific points in the landscape and ultimately out of the catchment via stormwater drainage networks for flood protection e g lerner 2002 usgs 2015 these modifications are likely to result in a shift from more diffuse recharge to more focussed sources of recharge e g below leaking infrastructure such as mains and sewer pipes lerner 2002 and or below constructed wetlands where storm runoff is channelled this appears to be indicated by our data but is not examined in further detail here concerns over the possible effect of urbanisation on recharge quantity in the study area appear not to be well founded as recharge appears to be inherently limited by the geology in most of the areas undergoing urbanisation above the older volcanics this underscores the importance of collecting direct observation data to map recharge rates and determine its variability and relationship to underlying geological and soil properties as opposed to estimation based on catchment wide water balances or numerical model calibration in particular the study illustrates the importance of considering spatial variation in recharge as distinct from assuming recharge comprises for example a uniform proportion of rainfall the use of multiple qualitative and quantitative recharge estimation techniques is valuable in this regard through this approach more targeted approaches to land and water management can be developed in the face of rapidly changing landscapes e g strategic protection of key areas where conditions favour high quality and or quantity of recharge the highest rates of groundwater recharge in the study area identified using tritium radiocarbon and salinity data and then quantified using chloride mass balance and water table fluctuations are associated with a small geographic area with specific geological characteristics presence of sand and absence of clay that are favourable for rapid sub surface infiltration as discussed above this area accounts for approximately half of the recharge volume in the study area similar findings have been reported in other settings where recharge windows providing a disproportionate amount of overall recharge to an aquifer system have been identified using environmental tracer data e g meredith et al 2012 protection of the quality and quantity of sub surface infiltration occurring in such areas for example by prohibiting activities that may introduce pollutants or compromise soil infiltration capacity is one potential strategy by which groundwater quality and quantity can be maximised and maintained in the face of rapidly changing land use the land where the highest recharge rates occur in the study area is currently part of a protected reserve associated with the cranbourne royal botanic garden as such land uses such as suburban development which may alter recharge rates or introduce contaminants are currently prohibited maintaining this protection status is one relatively simple strategy by which the recharge rates and quality entering the western port basin s aquifers can be maintained over the long term even as the catchment experiences significant hydrological changes 5 3 limitations and uncertainties one of the primary limitations in our study and one which is likely to be applicable in similar cases is the absence of data regarding recharge under completely pre urban conditions in the catchment determining the impact of urbanisation on recharge is therefore somewhat confounded by the fact that urban infrastructure is already having some influence on recharge and the data collected therefore do not represent a true pre development baseline nonetheless some of the data e g radioisotopes and chloride in groundwater do provide a relatively robust indication of recharge processes on timescales likely to predominantly reflect pre urbanisation conditions e g decades chloride mass balance is a technique which time integrates recharge over many years e g allison and hughes 1983 and it is thus suitable for assessing averaged recharge rates over such timescales given that urban development in the area is mostly very recent we believe the chloride based estimates predominantly reflect pre urbanisation recharge rates this contrasts with other techniques such as water table fluctuation or soil moisture monitoring which effectively have no memory and only indicate recharge under current monitored conditions a further potential limitation in our study is the lack of surface water monitoring which typically helps to constrain catchment water balances and improve recharge estimates however within the study area the single major natural surface water body clyde creek is ephemeral only containing water immediately following high rainfall events monitoring these flows is difficult in practice and would likely provide limited additional precision in estimates of groundwater recharge in the absence of accurate estimates of et 6 conclusions and implications this study highlights the value of collecting a variety of independent field data to substantiate and refine conceptual models and quantify groundwater recharge without such data mapping and analysis the spatial dependencies and key factors controlling recharge would be difficult to determine leading to uncertainty with respect to how future water budgets and water quality may change as land use change e g urbanisation takes place using alternative techniques such as water balance analysis or numerical modelling without such field data would be unlikely to provide the level of local detail about recharge rates mechanisms and its controlling factors for example our data and findings allowed for a more refined understanding of the locations and rates of groundwater recharge in the study area which in some cases contradict previous modelling such detailed information is required to make planning decisions that optimise the potential quantities and quality of recharge during and following land use change the findings have significant implications for future management of land and water in the study area and urbanising catchments more generally our data provide evidence that a relatively small area provides a disproportionate amount of the water ultimately recharging the aquifers of the basin the primary factor governing this is the surface and shallow geology which exhibits local variation that is significant in terms of controlling recharge rates and volumes for the wider catchment this underscores the importance and value of maintaining strict land use control policies within this area much like wellhead protection zones enacted in

5956,artificial and natural tracers have been frequently used to study the water interactions in the river karst aquifer continuum dissolved organic matter expressed in the form of total or dissolved organic carbon has proven to be an effective soil related parameter when studying the recharge behavior of karst aquifers in many cases in this study we discuss the use of more catchment specific dissolved organic matter groups like humic substances to characterize the hydrodynamic and chemical interactions of the sinking tuhala river and the shallow nabala rakvere karst aquifer hosting the tuhala karst system in a boreal catchment of northern estonia a network of 15 surface water and groundwater monitoring points was sampled for humic substances major ions and stable isotopes for seven field campaigns 138 samples in total under different hydrological conditions over the period of one year in the context of relatively homogenous major ion chemistry and stable isotope signatures humic substances proved to be an effective conservative tracer for delineating and characterizing the mixing of the waters of the tuhala river and shallow aquifer in the karst system a two component mass balance mixing model utilizing humic substances was used to evaluate the mixing fractions in the main perennial spring group of the karst system and in other relevant monitoring points if possible it was deduced that on average 88 16 of the recharge for the main perennial spring group of the karst system was provided by the tuhala river in the case of the wet september of 2017 only 54 of the

wada et al 2010 gleeson et al 2012 hartmann et al 2014 famiglietti 2014 dalin et al 2017 it has been estimated that globally the groundwater abstraction already exceeds the sustainable recharge wada et al 2010 gleeson et al 2012 dÃ¶ll et al 2014 there is still uncertainty regarding the potential impact of climate change and other future developments on groundwater recharge smerdon 2017 van engelenburg et al 2018 some authors claim that northern boreal waters are experiencing the most dramatic impacts of the global change weyhenmeyer et al 2015 de wit et al 2016 creed et al 2018 bergstrÃ¶m and karlsson 2019 the change is generally manifested in an increasing amount of terrestrial dissolved organic matter in the surface water also known as browning creed et al 2018 one can presume that the increasing organic matter concentrations could also affect the shallow groundwater as surface streams may receive but also provide considerable groundwater recharge winter et al 1998 winter 2001 sophocleous 2002 andreo et al 2008 smith et al 2015 perhaps the most relevant yet intricate cases of such interactions are associated with karst aquifers globally as well as in estonia karst aquifers are amongst the most important sources of drinking water ford and williams 2007 perens and vallner 1997 it has been estimated that globally up to 25 ford and williams 2007 of consumed domestic groundwater is being abstracted from karst aquifers in estonia where carbonate rocks outcrop on almost half of the total land surface this quote is even higher about 33 olesk 2016 although groundwater resources in estonia are often perceived to be abundant there are vast areas where the resources are in poor status due to human impact activities of the state upon protecting groundwater 2018 moreover the hydraulic functioning and the interaction of surface water and groundwater in shallow karst aquifers of estonia is generally little known karst aquifers typically represent highly heterogeneous and anisotropic medium often characterized by triple matrix fractures and conduits porosity worthington 1999 2007 white 2002 bakalowicz 2005 leading to complex hydrogeological conditions concurrently with the autogenic recharge in this type of aquifers diagnostic karst features on the surface like dry valleys dolines and ponors allow unfiltered point recharge of surface water into the subsurface white 2002 ford and williams 2007 the flow in karst aquifers occurs dominantly in conduits worthington 1999 2007 which permit low resistance and turbulent transfer of groundwater over great distances white 2002 bakalowicz 2005 rapid infiltration high transmissivity and storage capacity provide favorable conditions for the development of groundwater flow systems in karst aquifers driscoll

in the stream karst aquifer continuum benischke et al 2007 hunkeler and mudry 2007 among other natural tracers dissolved organic matter dom usually expressed in the form of total organic carbon toc or more commonly dissolved organic carbon doc has in many cases proven to be an effective soil related parameter when studying the recharge behavior of karst systems emblanch et al 1998 vesper and white

with the dom doc that was leached out from the soil zone by the infiltrating recharge hunkeler mudry 2007 in case the recharge to the karst system is assumed to be primarily autogenic dom doc can be considered as a non or semi conservative natural tracer due to spatial and temporal variation in infiltration dom doc release retention biodegradation etc hunkeler mudry 2007 bertrand et al 2014 in theory if the karst system is binary e g that it is also recharged by sinking surface stream in addition to the autogenic diffuse recharge the dom concentrations could be used to distinguish between the two components katz et al 1998 crandall et al 1999 katz 2001b kulakowski 2010 furthermore when dealing with a dom rich allogenic stream originating from a mire catchment the concentration of more catchment specific dom constituent groups like humic substances hs could be assessed hs are complex polymeric organic acids most abundant are humic and fulvic acids with a variety of molecular weights nagao et al 2003 that may constitute 40 80 of dom thurman 1985 wetzel 2001 thus being the most significant fraction of dom in natural water according to steinberg 2003 hs are significantly more abundant in the wetland mire bog runoff compared to rainwater groundwater and river water originating from mineral soil catchment various factors like temporal variation in precipitation and runoff air and water temperature and biological activity may influence the hs concentration in the stream water moore and jackson 1989 gerke 2018 suggests that soil humic substances can be relatively resistant to uv and biodegradation in certain circumstances dom doc including hs may be treated as a conservative or semi conservative tracer to assess surface water and groundwater interactions if the primary source is known dittmar and kattner 2003 cooper et al 2008 bertrand et al 2014 einsiedl et al 2007 showed that although fulvic acids may undergo a rapid molecular transformation in karst aquifers the near complete turnover of fulvic acids in groundwater may take decades moreover einsiedl et al 2007 pointed out based on lee et al 2005 and buckau et al 2000 that fulvic acids block out the calcite surfaces in carbonate aquifers over time by sorption thus making fulvic acids which are a major contributor to hs a conservative tracer crandall et al 1999 and katz et al 1998 2004 successfully used tannins and lignins source of hs as natural tracers in order to characterize the interaction of dom rich surface water and shallow groundwater as the surface topography and climate in estonia during holocene favored the formation and expansion of mires it has been estimated that peatlands make up approximately 21 22 of estonia s land surface orru 1992 ilomets 1997 masing et al 2000 generally boreal peatland mire catchments are among the ones to have the highest dom doc concentrations and fluxes aitkenhead and mcdowell 2000 wetzel 2001 ritson et al 2019 mires especially raised bogs form the headwaters for numerous hs rich boreal streams that often sink into karst aquifers on the carbonate outcrops of northern estonia such sinking streams are demonstrated to be responsible for the final chemical composition of the shallow karst groundwater in the northern half of estonia furthermore hs abundant in such streams could prove to be useful natural tracer to provide insights into surface water groundwater interactions it has been stated that the natural background concentration of dom in surface waters of estonia may range 25 60 mg l simm 1975 according to pihlap 2016 the mean natural concentration of doc in estonian mire transitional mire and bog waters is 50 8 16 3 mgc l this study aims to characterize the hydrodynamic and hydrochemical interactions of the hs rich tuhala river and the nabala rakvere shallow karst aquifer hosting the tuhala karst system tks an important groundwater resource in northern estonia previous findings on the general hydrochemistry of the tks date back to 1970 80 s laas and jÃ¼rine 1974 heinsalu 1978 sooÃ¤Ã¤r 1980 thus the modern conditions were little known until the current study in order to achieve the proposed goal surface and groundwater hydrodynamics major ion chemistry hs and stable isotopes were assessed we emphasize that hs abundant in such streams could prove to be useful natural tracer to provide insights into surface water groundwater interactions in the tks but also elsewhere where similar conditions exist 2 material and methods 2 1 study area description the tuhala karst system tks is located in the nw part of the east european platform northern estonia in the heart of the harju plateau of ordovician and silurian carbonate rocks fig 1 the study area covers approximately 1 8 km2 on the lower course of the tuhala river a left bank tributary of the pirita river basin area of 799 km2 fig 1 the tuhala river is a 25 km long hs rich stream that rises in the bogs of the mahtra wetland area 12 km upstream from the tks fig 1 having a basin area of 112 km2 the tks has been developed on top of a cuesta escarpment ridge approximate location can be seen in fig 1 roughly coinciding with the baltic ice lake shoreline that formed sometime during its development 14 000 and 11 600 cal years bp vassiljev and saarse 2013 the cuesta like relief providing a crucial hydraulic gradient for the tks separates the isolation basin of the mahtra wetland area on the southern gentle slope and the valley system of the pirita river on the northern steep slope fig 1 the topography of the study area could be characterized as gently rolling ground moraines interrupted by the tuhala river and the associated karst valleys and dolines fig 2 the ground elevation is the greatest 62 65 m a s l at the w and sw margins of the area and descends towards ne margin to 54 m a s l fig 1 a veneer 2 9 m thick of quaternary cover predominantly late weichselian glacial till mantles the underlying upper ordovician katian stage carbonate rocks fig 2 suuroja et al 2003 the saunja and paekna formation limestone are part of the nabala rakvere shallow karst aquifer that spreads through the whole study area fig 2 the overlying kÃµrgessaare formation limestone fig 2 is similarly fractured and karstified thus it is not distinguished from the nabala rakvere aquifer in the context of this study the same applies to the overlying quaternary aquifer fig 2 although in some places the quaternary deposits may act as a relative upper aquitard producing the confinement of the underlying nabala rakvere aquifer the tks is situated in the transition zone of the baltic sea maritime and continental cfb and dfb according to kÃ¶ppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 climate regions the average annual temperature in estonia is 5 2 c as the average annual amount of precipitation according to the kuusiku and tallinn harku weather stations see location in fig 1 of the estonian weather service 735 mm exceeds the average annual evapotranspiration 430 450 mm kink 2007 humid conditions prevail the hs rich tuhala river sinks into the tks hosted by the nabala rakvere aquifer fig

depending on the hydrological conditions the groundwater flow velocities in the tks have been estimated from tracer tests to be in the range of 225 800 m h fig 1 koit et al 2017 the lower positioned springs of the witch s well overflow group activate when q 2 2 4 m3 s is reached in the tuhala river koit et al 2017 the symbol of the overflow spring group the witch s well starts to overflow when the flow rate in the tuhala river exceeds approximately 4 m3 s during low flow conditions the witch s well may become stagnant koit 2016 when the virulase valley fig 1 is flooded surface flow along the kuie dry valley fig 1 will be established when there is no surface flow in the upper part of the valley water appears downstream from the kalda mÃ¤ttasoo and reiesmÃ¤e springs hereafter named as the kuie springs fig 1 for a more detailed overview on the hydrodynamic functioning of the tks see koit 2016 and koit et al 2017 although the tuhala river has been considered the primary source of recharge for the tks bauert and perens 2012 recent studies koit 2016 koit et al 2017 have suggested that some portion of recharge could originate from the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer the households inhabiting the study area generally draw groundwater from the nabala rakvere aquifer and often experience water quality problems that could be associated with the influence of the tuhala river 2 2 methods 2 2 1 monitoring network a network of 15 monitoring points table 1 including eight drilled wells four dug wells two springs and one point in the tuhala river just upstream from the tks was assembled for the present study all of the monitored drilled wells drw were screened in the nabala rakvere aquifer 19 m depth at maximum as a local speciality all of the monitored dug wells dgw except mp8 were located in the bottom of karst dolines these are generally yielding water from the overlying quaternary aquifer and the top of the nabala rakvere aquifer although mp5 represents the witch s

fig 1 the mean amount of precipitation for the period of october 2016 october 2017 was 777 mm the s1 see fig 3 was carried out during low flow conditions accompanied by the autumn s first considerable rainfall melting the thin snow cover that had fallen a couple of days earlier in november 2016 a rainfall induced thaw triggered a medium high flood event sufficient to activate the lower positioned springs in the witch s well intermittent spring group see in fig 3 a tracer test carried out on november 21 showed that the groundwater velocity between the recharge area and the perennial spring group reached 800 m h in these hydrological conditions koit et al 2017 in the end of november another moderate thaw event occurred resulting in medium flow conditions during which the s2 was carried out episodic low intensity snowfalls occurred throughout the january february and usually melted within the following two weeks the s3 was carried out during low flow conditions during the recession of a small flood peak that occurred in the beginning of january the day before s3 air temperature had raised above freezing leading to thaw conditions boosted by light precipitation the s4 was carried out in medium flow conditions during the recession of a rather modest rainfall thaw induced spring flood event fig 3 during the s4 the recession was interrupted by another small flood peak probably caused by the diurnal freeze thaw cycles the s5 was performed when the groundwater and the springs had almost reached their hydrological low stand of the study period the rainy august 87 mm vs the long term mean 85 mm gave way to the record wet 268 mm vs the long term mean 201 mm autumn of 2017 the resulting rise of surface water and groundwater level was more intense in groundwater veetÃµusme springs mp6 and mp9 compared to the tuhala river mp4 this was referring to the effect of the depleted runoff and still significant evapotranspiration in the tuhala river mp4 upper catchment in september 2017 the latter resulted in a remarkable difference between the input and output flow rates and water levels in the tuhala river mp4 and the veetÃµusme springs mp9 during the s6 as seen in fig 3 after the first recharge event in september 2017 another one followed in the middle of october fig 3 the response to recharge pulse was still quicker in the veetÃµusme springs mp9 referring to the significant effect of autogenic recharge to the tks however with the effect of evapotranspiration much lower in october and groundwater storage plenished by the last recharge event the flood peak in the tuhala river mp4 soon followed consequently the lower positioned springs of the witch s well mp5 intermittent group were activated fig 3 when comparing the total surface water input mp4 and output mp9 mp5 overflow of the tks during the peak flow of october 2017 flood 4 04 vs 2 74 m3 s respectively the output accounts for 67 of the input the difference is thought to be caused by the limited throughput capacity of the tks discussed by koit et al 2017 and the buffering effect of the intermittent lake in the virulase valley that acts as a dynamic storage the s7 was carried out during the recession of the october 2017 flood in high flow conditions see fig 3 when assessing the average surface water input 0 61 m3 s in mp4 and output flow rate 0 75 m3 s in mp9 mp5 overflow of the tks during the study period of october 2016 october 2017 the average output was 23 higher than the input the latter could refer to the impact of the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer on recharging the karst system previously considered to be driven primarily by the allogenic recharge from tuhala river by bauert and perens 2012 reluctantly depending on the groundwater level the tks seems to be either partly feeding perched or draining the hosting aquifer the hydrological conditions of the kuie springs mp1 were observed visually during the study period the kuie springs showed no significant deviations from its normal flow rate up to few liters per second which could have been associated with the impact of the tuhala river the flow rate in the kuie springs developed from the contribution of the small perennial springs of kalda reiesmÃ¤e and mÃ¤ttasoo see fig 1 also during the s7 fig 3 the flow rate in the kuie springs remained low due to the fact that the approximate hydrological threshold conditions as estimated by koit et al 2017 in the tuhala river required for establishing the surface flow in the kuie dry valley were not met at the time noteworthy is the behavior of the groundwater level in the mp8 where it was virtually static throughout the most of the study period the water level did not respond to pumping and only rose abruptly during the autumn flood of 2017 3 2 general hydrochemistry of the study area table 2 summarizes the statistical parameters calculated from the hydrochemical data gathered during this study throughout the study period all sampled waters were of the ca hco3 type fig 4 a referring to carbonate minerals as the major contributor to the hydrochemistry of the surface water and shallow groundwater in the tks catchment all of the analyzed water samples were dominated by the hco3 anion followed by in the decreasing order of abundance so4 2 no3 cl f fig 4a and table 2 among cations ca2 was the most abundant followed by in the decreasing order of abundance mg2 na k fig 4a and table 2 in general the tds decreases in the tuhala river mp4 spring and dgw groups in response to dilution caused by the increasing flow conditions the mean tds was the highest in the drw group that are screening in the deeper part up to 20 m deep of the nabala rakvere aquifer followed by the springs dgw and the tuhala river mp4 groups fig 4b the majority of the drw group also featured lower coefficient of variation cv of tds compared to other groups referring to more stable mineralization of groundwater in the deeper part of the nabala rakvere aquifer the tuhala river mp4 features the highest cv for the majority of the observed physicochemical parameters table 2 although originating from a mire catchment the ph was usually above neutral by the time the tuhala river reached the mp4 depending on the flow conditions a significant deviation in tds sd 87 mg l could be observed fig 4b the latter was likely due to the dilution controlled by the proportion of the more significant low tds mire runoff component in comparison to the other less abundant sources or recharge mineral soil catchment and groundwater reflected by the increase in tds and consequently the spc during low flow conditions the groundwater contribution is evident in the tuhala river recharge the kuie mp1 and veetÃµusme springs mp9 representing the spring group differ significantly from each other table 2 the mp1 had a higher mean tds and lower tds cv compared to that of the veetÃµusme spring mp9 the kuie springs mp1 seem to be more similar to the drw group thus is most likely discharging the regional groundwater of the nabala rakvere aquifer the high sd and cv values for tds in the spring group are therefore caused mainly by the mp9 which is more similar to the tuhala river mp4 and the witch s well spring group mp5 as would be expected based on the results of the earlier tracer experiments by koit 2016 and koit et al 2017 however the mean spc and tds in veetÃµusme springs mp9 are slightly higher compared to the tuhala river mp4 that is the main proven koit 2016 koit et al 2017 source for recharge for the springs the latter also refers to the probable partial contribution of the nabala rakvere aquifer to the discharge in the veetÃµusme springs mp9 as already pointed out in the hydrodynamic chapter when assessing the statistical variability of tds also for the majority of the remaining physicochemical parameters in table 2 versus the mean values the tuhala river mp4 the witch s well mp5 veetÃµusme springs mp9 mp12 and mp15 constitute a cluster that features similarly high cv compared to the other monitoring points fig 4 it may be assumed that the tuhala river mp4 providing the highly variable allogenic recharge is most likely provoking the high variability in the river cluster fig 5 another cluster that differs from the river and the groundwater cluster is the one comprising the mp8 and mp11 doline related dgws 3 3 dissolved co2 and saturation indices of the carbonated species the studied surface waters and groundwater in the tks generally evolve under open carbonate system conditions however closed conditions could be suspected in the case of the deeper drws mp2 in fig 6 b the waters in the drw group were generally in saturation state with respect to calcite and dolomite fig 6a sporadic under saturation in mp2 mp6 mp12 occurs during high flow conditions s7 the overall saturation trend in the dgw group is similar to the rest of the groups however the water in some of the dgws are more likely to be under saturated regardless of the flow conditions the water in the kuie springs mp1 was always in saturation state with respect to calcite and dolomite fig 6a in addition the lowest logpco2 readings were generally associated with the kuie springs mp1 possibly due to the low flow and relatively great distance of the sampling point from the actual spring resurgence giving time for co2 to degas during low flow conditions s1 s3 and s5 the water in the tuhala river mp4 was in saturation state with respect to calcite and dolomite but never in equilibrium with respect to atmospheric logpco2 figs 6a and 5b during medium and high flow conditions the tuhala river mp4 was undersaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite analogously to the tuhala river mp4 the veetÃµusme springs mp9 reached saturation with respect to calcite and dolomite only during low flow conditions and during medium to high flow conditions the water was undersaturated it should be noted that during some sampling campaigns s1 s3 s5 s6 and s7 the tuhala river mp4 was always more saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite compared to the veetÃµusme springs mp9 fig 6a in the case of the s4 the relationship was the opposite 3 4 the occurrence and dynamics of humic substances in the waters of the study area the tuhala river mp4 featured the highest mean hs concentration amongst all of the monitoring points fig 7 a the highest and lowest concentrations in the tuhala river mp4 were observed during s6 40 7 mg l and s3 22 mg l respectively there was no clear trend between the hydrodynamic conditions in the tuhala river mp4 and hs concentration this could have been due to dilution caused by surface flowpath dominancy in wetlands as described in mulholland 2003 but also because the variation of flow rates and vegetation activity are not always consistent the latter could be due to the limited amount of data when comparing the mean hs concentration the tuhala river mp4 was followed by the witch s well mp5 the veetÃµusme springs mp9 mp12 and mp15 as seen in fig 7a the mean hs concentrations were the lowest and less variable in the drw group representing the water from the deeper part of the nabala rakvere aquifer as an exception the highest deviation in hs concentrations was observed in mp12 a drw that has previously been proved koit et al 2017 to be in direct hydraulic connection with the tuhala river mp4 when the mean hs concentrations of the monitoring points were plotted versus the cv of tds fig 7b the outcome generally agreed with the clusters drawn in fig 5 it can be assumed that the tuhala river mp4 is the primary source of hs in the tks when the hs results are compared with the tracing results of precedent studies koit et al 2017 it is clear that hs acts in a relatively conservative way highlighting evidences about the partly previously proven hydraulic connections between the tuhala river mp4 and other monitoring points 3 5 environmental isotopes Î´18o and Î´2h the Î´18o and Î´2h values of the espoo rainfall period of 2010 2015 from the iaea wmo gnip database that were used to calculate the lmwl Î´2h 7 9 Î´18o 8 5 ranged from 18 9 to 6 9 and 141 to 43 respectively the gmwl was based on Î´2h 8 Î´18o 10 as defined by craig 1961 the lmwl and gmwl plot almost parallel to each other fig 8 a the isotopic signatures of the remaining water samples collected see table 2 during the sampling campaigns s5 s6 and s7 generally plot min max range for Î´18o values from 11 8 to 9 5 and for Î´2h values 84 4 to 68 4 along the lmwl and gmwl indicating the overall meteoric origin of the nabala rakvere aquifer groundwater and surface waters in the study area the isotopic composition in the majority of the drws generally agrees with the shallow groundwater isoscape for the baltic artesian basin proposed by raidla et al 2016 the general trend in fig 8a suggests that the monitoring points which were exposed to the atmospheric meteorological conditions the tuhala river springs and dgws tend to shift towards isotopic enrichment during low flow conditions especially summer and vice versa a cluster comprising dgws mp5 and mp15 the veetÃµusme spring mp9 and the tuhala river mp4 clearly shows temporally heavier isotopic composition indicating the effect of evaporation during summer low and medium flow s5 and s6 although following the same overall trend there is a small yet noticeable discrepancy between the tuhala river mp4 and the veetÃµusme springs mp9 both during the winter high flow s7 and summer low flow s5 in both cases s5 and s7 the veetÃµusme springs mp9 show slightly lighter isotopic composition compared to the tuhala river mp4 this could be due to the mixing of the sinking water of the tuhala river with groundwater lighter isotopic composition while transferring the tks when the available Î´18o values were plotted against the hs fig 8b concentrations for s5 s6 and s7 similar trends in the formed were seen in figs 5 and 7b referring to their strong hydrochemical interaction the tuhala river mp4 the witch s well mp5 and the veetÃµusme springs mp9 generally form the core river influenced cluster for each distinct trendline representing the sampling campaigns s5 s6 and s7 as seen in fig 8b depending on the hydrological conditions mp15 and mp12 may also plot in the river influenced cluster the overall effect of evaporation during winter high flow s7 and summer low flow s5 is visible in the fig 7b the river influenced cluster during the s6 fig 8b also features evidence of isotopic fractionation by evaporation furthermore the veetÃµusme springs mp9 featured a slightly heavier Î´18o signature and significantly lower hs concentration compared to the tuhala river mp4 and the witch s well spring group mp5 the latter also reinforces the hypotheses launched in the previous chapters about the unusual hydrological conditions in the tks during s6 that could have been due to significant autogenic recharge contribution 3 6 hydrochemical interactions between surface waters and groundwater in the tuhala karst system prior to moving on to the pca the hydrochemical dataset had to be cleaned from the outliers conspicuously high concentrations of na k cl and no3 were observed in mp8 mp11 mp14 and mp15 figs 9 a and 8b the concentrations for the latter ions in the tuhala river mp4 were lower in all cases thus their allogenic origin could be ruled out the combination of the parameters and the location type most were dgw of the particular monitoring points where anomalous concentrations were detected generally indicated the possibility of local contamination due to livestock farming the use of mineral organic fertilizers road salts and or to inadequate wastewater management to avoid the dampening of the naturally occurring hydrochemical processes in the tks by anthropogenically induced effects na k cl and no3 were excluded from the pca in order to gain insights into the hydrochemical processes occurring in the tks a pca was performed including nine physical chemical variables ph spc mg2 ca2 f so4 2 hco3 tds and hs three supplementary quantitative variables sicalcite sidolomite and logpco2 and 93 observations a pearson correlation coefficient matrix was compiled table 3 a from the standardized values of the nine primary and three supplementary variables included in the pca as expected spc as the global indicator for water mineralization has the highest positive correlation with the tds which in turn correlates the best with carbonate system related parameters like hco3 ca2 and mg2 but on the contrary has a strong negative correlation with the hs table 3a the variables were transformed into two principal factors such as factors f1 and f2 with the highest eigenvalues 6 1 and 1 2 were chosen according to the rule of 1 together f1 and f2 accounted for 80 4 of the variability in the input data fig 9 the variables associated with the carbonate system and the residence time tds spc hco3 ca2 mg2 f and so4 2 hunkeler and mudry 2007 provided the most significant positive contribution to f1 67 4 while the hs provided the most significant negative contribution as seen in table 3b the reverse statistical relationship between tds and hs for f1 and also in table 3a could be interpreted as the river groundwater interaction expressed through the co effect of dilution and hs concentration dynamics as previously seen in fig 6b the f2 13 1 receives the greatest positive contribution from ph and f the additional variables sicalcite sidolomite and logpco2 computed from the in situ measured ph values are associated with the factor f2 when the factor scores of the observations were plotted in fig 10 b a triangular shaped observation cloud was formed the shape is mainly determined by tds comprising all the major components and hs along the opposite extremes of the x axis representing dilution and mineralization as the main reverse hydrochemical trends in the tks along the y axis ph and logpco2 supplementary variables are the dominant variables representing ph co2 dynamics fig 10b in the waters of the tks the majority of the observations of the drw group except for mp12 mp1 mp11 and mp15 of the dgw group plots to the right half of the observation cloud in fig 10b forming the groundwater related cluster the latter cluster is elongated along the y axis with deeper drws corresponding to lower ph higher logpco2 but also to parameters that could be associated with longer residence time higher mg2 so4 2 and f concentrations plotted in the lower half of the groundwater cluster making up the shallow groundwater sub cluster of the nabala rakvere aquifer the upper half of the groundwater cluster the so called surficial groundwater fig 10b is mostly comprised of observations matching the dgw group during low medium flow and the mp12 during low flow and kuie spring mp1 samples the groundwater in the tks is generally characterized by similar tds values the differentiation of the surficial groundwater sub cluster fig 10b is clearly defined by generally higher ph values co2 degassing due to being closer to the surface in the river aquifer continuum the relatively high and stable tds of the kuie springs mp1 fig 10 compared to that of the veetÃµusme springs mp9 fig 10b indicates that during the study period the kuie springs were discharging groundwater from the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer e g similar to the groundwater observed in the drw group the long distance between the kuie springs resurgence and sampling point resulted in slight dilution in tds and a significant decrease in logpco2 the left half of the observation cloud fig 10b primarily comprises the factor scores of the observations of the tuhala river mp4 the veetÃµusme springs mp9 and the witch s well springs mp5 which make up the core of the river cluster and its end member the dispersion of the tuhala river mp4 samples along the x axis fig 10 illustrates the shifting balance between mineralization possibly due to increased groundwater contribution and dilution from the increase of hs rich mire runoff depending on the hydrological conditions for a detailed comparison the tuhala river mp4 the veetÃµusme springs mp9 and if possible the witch s well mp5 during each sampling campaign were encircled in fig 10b during low flow conditions both the tuhala river mp4 and the veetÃµusme springs mp9 shift towards the groundwater cluster the increase of tds during low flow could be attributed to the relative significance of the groundwater contribution when the dilute allogenic input is low fig 10b during low flow conditions s1 s3 and s5 the witch s well mp4 plots apart from the tuhala river mp4 and the veetÃµusme springs mp9 pairs due to groundwater from the well appeared to be disconnected and stagnant koit et al 2017 proved that although hydraulically connected to the tks during low to medium flow active circulation of water in the witch s well mp5 started in case of medium and high flow conditions in the tks this is also evident in the current hydrochemical data as during medium and high flow conditions s2 s4 s6 and s7 the witch s well mp5 plots together with to the tuhala river mp4 and the veetÃµusme springs mp9 pairs fig 10b 3 7 mixing processes in the tuhala karst system the discrepancies between the observation pairs of the tuhala river mp4 and the veetÃµusme springs mp9 during each sampling campaign fig 10b could indicate the fate of the sinking tuhala river mp4 water during its transfer through the tks during the s1 s2 s5 and s7 the water in the veetÃµusme springs mp9 featured a generally slight increase in tds and logpco2 values and a slight decrease in hs concentrations compared to the sinking water of the tuhala river mp4 during the s3 and s4 the differences were reverse fig 10b the output in the veetÃµusme springs mp9 was slightly more diluted lower tds compared to the tuhala river mp4 the smaller differences as can be seen during the s1 and s2 between the input and output water quality mainly major ions could have been caused by the non conservative behavior of the more reactive tracers during the transfer barberÃ¡ et al 2014 jurado et al 2015 but more likely due to temporal difference in sampling and small analytical uncertainties due to the relatively short transfer time of the tks during medium low to high flow conditions that is approximately 1 5 to 2 5 h based on koit et al 2017 and the relatively homogeneous hydrochemistry in the tks the possible hydrochemical reactions during mixing are hereafter not considered significant in the context of the current dataset moreover as backed by many sources cited in the introduction section hs as the main tracer is expected to be relatively conservative in the given conditions more significant changes in water quality as are evident during the s3 s4 s5 s6 and s7 could refer to mixing with groundwater originating from the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer and other sources in the case of s6 and s7 the enrichment in the concentrations of cl no3 f or so4 2 and dilution in hs could be observed in the case of the s3 and s4 the contributing groundwater had to be more dilute affected by the autogenic recharge snowmelt than the sinking water in the tuhala river mp4 clearly distinct from the others a significant difference between the mp4 and mp9 during the s6 fig 10b is evident the latter was also evidenced by the hydrological fig 2 hydrochemical fig 6 and isotopic fig 8 results in the previous chapters also evident in fig 10b is the hydrochemical evolution of the observations in the dgw and drw group mp8 mp11 mp12 and mp15 the trajectories are traced with the colored arrows in fig 10b in response to increasing flow conditions the observations of the aforementioned monitoring points during low or medium flow conditions plot within or close to the groundwater cluster but shift towards the river cluster during medium and high flow conditions this indicates the arrival of surface water from the sinking tuhala river mp4 water and mixing with the shallow groundwater in the mp8 mp11 mp12 and mp15 in the case of the mp12 the mixing occurs primarily because of the leak in the casing of the well koit et al 2017 but also due to its location in the highly karstified fracture zone of the virulase valley fig 1 the interaction of the mp8 mp11 and mp15 doline related dgws with the tuhala river in response to increasing flow conditions was more modest compared to the mp5 of the witch s well spring group the hydrochemical evolution constantly low logpco2 and invariable tds of the mp8 likely refers to the stagnant groundwater within the dug well during low to medium flow conditions however when taking into account the constant groundwater level during the sample pumping for s1 s6 see fig 1 the mp8 behaved like it was recharged from a perched reservoir in order to evaluate how the sinking waters of tuhala river mp4 interact with shallow groundwater of the hosting karst aquifer during its transfer through the tks a solute mass balance mixing analysis was performed for the main output of the tks the veetÃµusme springs mp9 and but also for the other monitoring points indicating significant mixing in the pca fig 10 although a triangular observation cloud was formed in fig 10b suggesting that there could be at least three end members involved in the mixing system the surficial groundwater end member seems to root from the shallow groundwater end member as there is seemingly no direct connection between the river and shallow groundwater sub clusters in fig 10b this means that in a simplified context ignoring other possible end members due to lack of data the surficial groundwater end member delineated by co2 dynamics is rather an intermediate stage of shallow groundwater becoming more exposed to surficial conditions and mixing with the surface water thus a shallow groundwater end member with a complete dataset used tracers and lowest mean deviation among the calculated mixing fractions was used a two component mass balance mixing model as used by barberÃ¡ and andreo 2017 clark 2015 crandall et al 1999 and katz et al 1998 was applied 1 f river c mix c groundwater c river c groundwater where friver represents the calculated water fraction of tuhala river mp4 in the veetÃµusme springs mp9 cspring cgroundwater criver denote the concentrations of a selected tracer in the mixture of the considered monitoring point for the veetÃµusme springs mp9 mixing calculations the semiconservative tracers f cl and so4 2 which produced the most consistent results compared to hs were also assessed in the case of the s5 s6 and s7 the available Î´18o data was also used in mixing calculations due to the higher degree of uncertainty involved in estimating mixing fractions in the dug and drilled wells e g no active circulation possibility of insufficient purging etc only hs and Î´18o data as the most conservative parameters were assessed most consistent calculation results mean deviation of 10 among the mixing fraction calculations table 4 were achieved by using the observations from the mp10 for hydrogeological and hydrochemical context see figs 1 and 10b as the shallow groundwater end member the mean tuhala river mp4 mixing fractions based on hs ions and hs ions combined were 88 10 for the whole study table 4 the mixing fractions calculated using the ions alone and hs ions combined explained 87 and 90 p 0 05 of variation respectively in the tuhala river mp4 mixing fractions based on hs alone thus at least in the case of the veetÃµusme springs mp9 hs provided relatively reliable results for assessing the mixing processes in the tks the results for the dgws and drws observed in the mixing analysis mp5 mp8 mp11 mp12 and mp15 should be assessed with reservation due to greater uncertainties involved it should also be taken into account that the Î´18o signature of the surface water and the actual surficial groundwater may have been relatively similar in some cases thus the calculated mixing fractions may not always indicate the exact end member of the mixing water in the meteorically affected system rather than reflect the broader source of origin in order to put the mixing fraction results in the context of the hydraulic interactions between the tks and the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer the hydraulic gradients of both were assessed table 5 to derive a parameter that would conclude the hydraulic interaction the hydraulic gradient ratio aquifer tks was calculated for each sampling campaign table 5 the lower the hydraulic gradient ratio the greater the intersection of the estimated potentiometric surfaces and vice versa the potentiometric surface of the tks was above perched the potentiometric surface of the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer during the low flow condition campaigns s1 s3 and s5 fig 11 in the case of low flow conditions the hydraulic gradient ratios were among the highest min max range 0 78 0 83 observed which means that the potentiometric surface and the hydraulic gradients of the tks and the aquifer were the closest to being parallel during low flow conditions the veetÃµusme springs mp9 were discharging primarily the water from the sinking tuhala river mp4 mean 96 4 table 4 and fig 11 depending on the low flow sampling campaign up to 8 of the discharge in the veetÃµusme springs mp9 could have been contributed by the groundwater from the hosting aquifer based on hs in the case of s5 the Î´ 18o data also confirmed groundwater contribution up to 18 as the spring discharge during the s5 was isotopically lighter compared to that than of the sinking water the witch s well mp5 remained hydraulically connected to the tks during low flow conditions mean 98 3 however the slightly overestimated mixing fractions by both the hs probably due to the retardation of the previous event water and Î´18o heavier composition due to free surface water evaporation during the s1 and s5 could indicate poor circulation and or stagnant effect in the witch s well mp5 as also discussed by koit 2016 and koit et al 2017 different trends were observed among the other considered monitoring points mp8 mp11 mp12 and mp15 during low flow conditions the mp8 featured approximately 13 of tuhala river mp4 mixing fraction based on hs however Î´18o indicated no contribution 0 thus when also relying on the findings of the pca analysis it is rather likely that mp8 was disconnected from the tks during low flow conditions in the mp11 the calculations suggested 14 13 and 42 of tuhala river mp4 mixing fractions based on hs and Î´18o respectively when compared to the other sampling campaigns it is likely that the mixing fractions observed in mp8 and mp11 during low flow conditions could entail uncertainties related to stagnancy additionally it may be assumed that the water in the tuhala river mp4 at the time primarily originated from the groundwater runoff upstream from the tks the latter could have led to similar isotopic signatures among the mixing end members if in the case of mp11 the mixing fractions during s1 and s5 should be explained the most plausible reason would be the low groundwater level that would otherwise dilute and or prevent the intruding water from the tuhala river mp4 in the case of mp12 relatively consistent mean mixing fractions of 23 22 and 27 were obtained based on hs and Î´18o respectively in mp15 the mean tuhala river mp4 mixing fraction based on hs and Î´18o was 40 24 and 52 respectively the good agreement of hs and Î´18o mixing fractions in mp12 and mp15 in the case of the s5 confirms convincingly the partial contribution from the tuhala river mp4 during low flow conditions the tuhala river mp4 mixing fractions based on hs among the monitoring points mp8 mp11 mp12 and mp15 were generally lowest in the case of the s3 winter season the three medium flow events observed s2 s4 and s6 are presented separately in fig 11 as they featured differing results table 4 during medium flow conditions the veetÃµusme springs mp9 featured slightly lower mean mixing fraction mean 82 24 of the tuhala river mp4 water compared to the low flow conditions the mean mixing fraction of tuhala river mp4 was also lower in the witch s well mp5 mean 90 8 during s2 the estimated potentiometric surface of the tks was above the potentiometric surface of the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer fig 11 and the hydraulic gradient ratio was the highest observed 0 88 during the study the veetÃµusme springs mp9 and the witch s well mp5 featured tuhala river mp4 mixing fractions of 99 and 98 respectively referring to the tks being flushed by primarily the water of the tuhala river mp4 in the case of s4 both the surface water and groundwater levels were slightly higher when compared to the conditions of the s2 the potentiometric surface of the nabala rakvere aquifer in the discharge area were exceeded intersected the estimated potentiometric surface of the tks fig 11 as indicated by the hydraulic gradient ratio 0 66 consequently in all of the observed monitoring points the tuhala river mp4 mixing fractions were slightly lower compared to the s2 the latter may have referred to the effect of considerable snowmelt induced autogenic recharge to the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer that may have occurred during the s4 resulting in an even more diluted mixture in the veetÃµusme springs mp9 as also indicated by the overestimated mixing fractions calculated from the major ions table 4 in the case of the s6 the water levels in the recharge area of the tks were significantly lower compared to the s2 and s4 however the situation was the opposite in the discharge area table 4 and fig 11 moreover the potentiometric surface of the nabala rakvere aquifer in the discharge area was above the estimated potentiometric surface of the tks resulting in the lowest hydraulic gradient ratio 0 49 observed during the study during the s6 the veetÃµusme springs mp9 featured unexpectedly low tuhala river mp4 mixing fraction 54 to confirm this similar result 52 was obtained when the selected ions were compared to the tuhala river mp4 when also the meteorological and hydrological conditions discussed in the previous chapters are taken into account it is plausible that the tks was receiving a significant contribution from the surficial part of the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer that had been recently autogenically recharged as for the tuhala river mp4 the headwater bog catchment was probably still buffering the rainfall and the modest flow rate in the river originated mostly from the recent surface and surficial groundwater runoff upstream during the s6 the witch s well mp5 featured 92 tuhala river mp4 mixing fraction during medium flow conditions the mp8 mp11 mp12 and mp15 featured tuhala river mp4 mixing fractions in the range of 1 96 table 4 and fig 11 similar to the low flow conditions the 6 9 mixing fractions based on hs and 0 based on Î´18o in the mp8 indicated that there was probably no connection with the tks during medium flow conditions s4 and s6 in contrast to the low flow conditions the mp11 showed lower mixing fractions mean 3 min max range 0 9 during medium flow conditions based on hs this may have been due to the higher groundwater levels for reference see the contours for s4 in fig 1 preventing the intrusion dilution of the water from the tuhala river mp4 in the activated flowpaths of the tks during the s6 the proportion of the mixing fraction in mp11 based on Î´18o 19 also seems to confirm the latter claim in mp12 the mean mixing fraction mean 81 min max range 58 96 was higher compared to the low flow conditions in the case of the s6 the mixing fractions in mp12 based on hs and Î´18o 58 59 were consistent the mp15 was only observed during s4 and s6 during the s4 the tuhala river mp4 mixing fraction in mp15 was higher 39 compared to s6 7 51 based on hs and Î´18o respectively during the s7 high flow conditions occurred in the tks however the conditions were not sufficient enough to initiate the witch s well mp5 overflow as determined by koit et al 2017 at the time the potentiometric surface of the shallow aquifer in the discharge area of the tks was above the estimated potentiometric surface of the tks fig 11 as also indicated by the hydraulic gradient ratio 0 58 during the s7 the veetÃµusme springs featured 82 76 based on the ions tuhala river mp4 mixing fraction based on hs referring to a significant groundwater contribution in the spring discharge as well as in the case of the s6 the Î´18o suggested nearly 100 tuhala river mp4 contribution due to the overall dominant meteoric influence intensive rainfall among the end members the witch s well mp5 was confirmed to be fully connected 100 100 based on both the hs and Î´18o respectively to the tuhala river mp4 during the s7 there was a significant groundwater level increase observed in mp8 accompanied by the flooding of the lower areas of the vanakubja valley for location see fig 1 strangely according to hs the tuhala river mp4 mixing fraction in the mp8 was 0 however the mixing fraction based on Î´18o suggested 94 contribution from the tuhala river mp4 in the case of the mp8 insufficient purging could be suspected due to the great volume of the water in the dug well during high flow conditions the water was visually observed in the field to become darker in color by the end of the purging process in contrast the Î´18o findings confirm the mp8 likely becoming hydraulically linked with the tks while also support the overall meteoric influence hypothesis discussed above similar situation as witnessed in mp8 could be suspected in the case of the mp11 as the tuhala river mp4 mixing fractions based on hs 25 and Î´18o 83 were slightly conflicting an additional difference between the estimated fractions could have been provoked by the high relative groundwater level in mp11 preventing the arrival of groundwater from the active part of the tks in mp12 the high groundwater level could have retarded the intrusion of the water from the tuhala river mp4 thus relatively modest mixing fraction 29 was obtained in similar conditions the mp15 behaved differently as the highest tuhala river mp4 mixing fraction 73 was observed as seen in fig 12 there is a good agreement r2 0 7 n 7 p 0 019 between the tuhala river mp4 mixing fraction and the hydraulic gradient ratio of the tks and the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer this means that the magnitude of groundwater contribution in the discharge of the veetÃµusme springs mp9 is dependent of the hydraulic relationship between the tks and the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer in other words it seems plausible that the groundwater contribution in the veetÃµusme spring mp9 discharge increases together with the increasing intersection of the potentiometric surfaces characterized by the hydraulic gradient ratio the sampling campaigns carried out during low to medium low flow conditions s1 s2 s3 and s5 form a cluster corresponding to parallel potentiometric surfaces and smaller contributions from the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer when the flow conditions intensify s4 s6 and s7 the potentiometric surfaces intersect and groundwater contribution to the tks increases the overall relationship seems to be reasonably linear however it is evident in fig 3 that in the case of the s6 there is a non linear deviation from the trend which refers to the unexpectedly dynamic and non stationary response of the tks and the hosting aquifer to extreme precipitation this stresses the non linearity of the tks as also attributed to karst systems generally by bakalowicz 2005 moreover the cases of s6 s7 and s4 show that the hosting aquifer has a significant impact mean groundwater contribution 12 16 on the tks functioning 3 8 wider implications of using humic substances in surface water groundwater interaction studies this study demonstrates that the use of hs when assessing karst systems shows great potential although dom doc has been previously successfully applied in numerous studies of karst systems emblanch et al 1998 vesper and white 2004 pronk et al 2006 hunkeler and mudry 2007 trÄek 2008 mudarra et al 2011 charlier et al 2012 jin et al 2014 mudarra et al 2014 the use of hs could add additional value under appropriate conditions for example according to bertrand et al 2014 water in boreal environments may feature a distinctive doc dom including hs signature due to its origin rendering the hs a conservative or semi conservative tracer dittmar and kattner 2003 cooper et al 2008 bertrand et al 2014 this theory was confirmed in our study where the hs concentrations in the tuhala river were significantly higher than in the general autogenic recharge based on the drilled wells not affected by the river infiltrating through the till soils on the nabala rakvere aquifer this suggests that hs could be effectively used to distinguish the allogenic recharge component from other significantly less hs rich recharge components based on the observations of the authors these conditions could apply for the majority of the known binary karst systems in estonia less for the ones in the pandivere upland where autogenic recharge prevails and mires are not as widespread moreover we find that the approach described in this study would not only be applicable in the boreal environment but globally where karst systems are receiving focused recharge rich in dom as shown in this study however the effective implementation of hs requires sufficient supplementary hydrochemical data major and or major ions stable isotopes including doc concentrations in comparison if possible 4 conclusions this study presents the outcome of the combined assessment of surface and groundwater hydrodynamics major ion chemistry hs and stable isotopes to characterize the interaction of the hs rich tuhala river and the shallow nabala rakvere karst aquifer hosting the tks the sampled surface water in the tuhala river and shallow groundwater up to 20 m deep in all of the monitored springs dgw and drw were homogeneously ca hco3 type throughout the study mean tds increased with depth being generally higher in the drws and the lowest in the tuhala river although the major ion composition and water type among the sampled monitoring points in the tks was homogeneous the assessment of variability of tds effectively assisted in delineating the monitoring points that were more likely interacting with the tuhala river in the tks similar to major ion chemistry the isotopic signatures of the water samples collected during the s5 s6 and s7 showed generally little variance and indicated the overall meteoric origin of the surface waters and shallow groundwater in the tks although the isotopic sample set was incomplete it pointed out the complex interrelation of surface water and shallow groundwater in a typical karst catchment on the carbonate outcrops of northern estonia hs proved to be an effective tracer for characterizing the interaction of the tuhala river and the nabala rakvere aquifer hosting the tks karst system tuhala river with the highest mean hs concentration was found to be the dominant source of hs to the tks thus making the use of hs as a natural tracer possible moreover when plotted against the mean tds and Î´18o hs allowed the delineation of monitoring points that were more likely to be interacting with the tuhala river subsequently relying on the high descriptive capability of the hs the performed pca successfully confirmed the monitoring points interacting with the tuhala river in the theoretical mixing space the pca also highlighted the hydrochemical discrepancies between the sinking tuhala river and the veetÃµusme perennial spring group of the tks further indicating the possible mixing of the sinking tuhala river water and the groundwater from the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer in the tks to quantify the possible mixing processes in the tks hs was used as the main natural tracer in two component mass balance mixing model the mixing results showed that the mean contribution of the sinking tuhala river in the main perennial spring was 88 16 on average 12 16 of the discharge in the main perennial springs of the tks could originate from the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer in an extreme case up to 46 of the discharge was found to be originating from the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer referring to the non linear behavior of the tks furthermore the river groundwater mixing fractions in the veetÃµusme perennial spring group recharge were found to be in good agreement r2 0 7 n 7 p 0 019 with the hydraulic gradient ratio i e the intersection of the potentiometric surfaces of the tks

5956,artificial and natural tracers have been frequently used to study the water interactions in the river karst aquifer continuum dissolved organic matter expressed in the form of total or dissolved organic carbon has proven to be an effective soil related parameter when studying the recharge behavior of karst aquifers in many cases in this study we discuss the use of more catchment specific dissolved organic matter groups like humic substances to characterize the hydrodynamic and chemical interactions of the sinking tuhala river and the shallow nabala rakvere karst aquifer hosting the tuhala karst system in a boreal catchment of northern estonia a network of 15 surface water and groundwater monitoring points was sampled for humic substances major ions and stable isotopes for seven field campaigns 138 samples in total under different hydrological conditions over the period of one year in the context of relatively homogenous major ion chemistry and stable isotope signatures humic substances proved to be an effective conservative tracer for delineating and characterizing the mixing of the waters of the tuhala river and shallow aquifer in the karst system a two component mass balance mixing model utilizing humic substances was used to evaluate the mixing fractions in the main perennial spring group of the karst system and in other relevant monitoring points if possible it was deduced that on average 88 16 of the recharge for the main perennial spring group of the karst system was provided by the tuhala river in the case of the wet september of 2017 only 54 of the spring discharge originated from the river i e 46 could have been provided by the hosting aquifer the river aquifer mixing fractions were found to be in good agreement r2 0 7 n 7 p 0 019 with the

wada et al 2010 gleeson et al 2012 hartmann et al 2014 famiglietti 2014 dalin et al 2017 it has been estimated that globally the groundwater abstraction already exceeds the sustainable recharge wada et al 2010 gleeson et al 2012 dÃ¶ll et al 2014 there is still uncertainty regarding the potential impact of climate change and other future developments on groundwater recharge smerdon 2017 van engelenburg et al 2018 some authors claim that northern boreal waters are experiencing the most dramatic impacts of the global change weyhenmeyer et al 2015 de wit et al 2016 creed et al 2018 bergstrÃ¶m and karlsson 2019 the change is generally manifested in an increasing amount of terrestrial dissolved organic matter in the surface water also known as browning creed et al 2018 one can presume that the increasing organic matter concentrations could also affect the shallow groundwater as surface streams may receive but also provide considerable groundwater recharge winter et al 1998 winter 2001 sophocleous 2002 andreo et al 2008 smith et al 2015 perhaps the most relevant yet intricate cases of such interactions are associated with karst aquifers globally as well as in estonia karst aquifers are amongst the most important sources of drinking water ford and williams 2007 perens and vallner 1997 it has been estimated that globally up to 25 ford and williams 2007 of consumed domestic groundwater is being abstracted from karst aquifers in estonia where carbonate rocks outcrop on almost half of the total land surface this quote is even higher about 33 olesk 2016 although groundwater resources in estonia are often perceived to be abundant there are vast areas where the resources are in poor status due to human impact activities of the state upon protecting groundwater 2018 moreover the hydraulic functioning and the interaction of surface water and groundwater in shallow karst aquifers of estonia is generally little known karst aquifers typically represent highly heterogeneous and anisotropic medium often characterized by triple matrix fractures and conduits porosity worthington 1999 2007 white 2002 bakalowicz 2005 leading to complex hydrogeological conditions concurrently with the autogenic recharge in this type of aquifers diagnostic karst features on the surface like dry valleys dolines and ponors allow unfiltered point recharge of surface water into the subsurface white 2002 ford and williams 2007 the flow in karst aquifers occurs dominantly in conduits worthington 1999 2007 which permit low resistance and turbulent transfer of groundwater over great distances white 2002 bakalowicz 2005 rapid infiltration high transmissivity and storage capacity provide favorable conditions for the development of groundwater flow systems in karst aquifers driscoll 1986 green et al 2006 but at the same time enable the fast transport of potential pollutants quinlan 1989 green et al 2006 numerous studies have been focused on the assessment of groundwater and surface water interactions in karst settings by incorporating hydrochemical and isotopic data baker and lamont black 2001 katz et al 1997 katz et al 1998 crandall et al 1999 katz 2001a lee and krothe 2001 wu et al 2008 moore et al 2009 ravbar et al 2012 jin et al 2014 sutton et al 2014 barberÃ¡ and andreo 2017 commonly artificial and natural tracers have been used to determine water interactions in the stream karst aquifer continuum benischke et al 2007 hunkeler and mudry 2007 among other natural tracers dissolved organic matter dom usually expressed in the form of total organic carbon toc or more commonly dissolved organic carbon doc has in many cases proven to be an effective soil related parameter when studying the recharge behavior of karst systems emblanch et al 1998 vesper and white 2004 pronk et al 2006 hunkeler and mudry 2007 trÄek 2008 mudarra et al 2011 charlier et al 2012 jin et al 2014 mudarra et al 2014 in general the doc signal in the spring discharge has been associated with the dom doc that was leached out from the soil zone by the infiltrating recharge hunkeler mudry 2007 in case the recharge to the karst system is assumed to be primarily autogenic dom doc can be considered as a non or semi conservative natural tracer due to spatial and temporal variation in infiltration dom doc release retention biodegradation etc hunkeler mudry 2007 bertrand et al 2014 in theory if the karst system is binary e g that it is also recharged by sinking surface stream in addition to the autogenic diffuse recharge the dom concentrations could be used to distinguish between the two components katz et al 1998 crandall et al 1999 katz 2001b kulakowski 2010 furthermore when dealing with a dom rich allogenic stream originating from a mire catchment the concentration of more catchment specific dom constituent groups like humic substances hs could be assessed hs are complex polymeric organic acids most abundant are humic and fulvic acids with a variety of molecular weights nagao et al 2003 that may constitute 40 80 of dom thurman 1985 wetzel 2001 thus being the most significant fraction of dom in natural water according to steinberg 2003 hs are significantly more abundant in the wetland mire bog runoff compared to rainwater groundwater and river water originating from mineral soil catchment various factors like temporal variation in precipitation and runoff air and water temperature and biological activity may influence the hs concentration in the stream water moore and jackson 1989 gerke 2018 suggests that soil humic substances can be relatively resistant to uv and biodegradation in certain circumstances dom doc including hs may be treated as a conservative or semi conservative tracer to assess surface water and groundwater interactions if the primary source is known dittmar and kattner 2003 cooper et al 2008 bertrand et al 2014 einsiedl et al 2007 showed that although fulvic acids may undergo a rapid molecular transformation in karst aquifers the near complete turnover of fulvic acids in groundwater may take decades moreover einsiedl et al 2007 pointed out based on lee et al 2005 and buckau et al 2000 that fulvic acids block out the calcite surfaces in carbonate aquifers over time by sorption thus making fulvic acids which are a major contributor to hs a conservative tracer crandall et al 1999 and katz et al 1998 2004 successfully used tannins and lignins source of hs as natural tracers in order to characterize the interaction of dom rich surface water and shallow groundwater as the surface topography and climate in estonia during holocene favored the formation and expansion of mires it has been estimated that peatlands make up approximately 21 22 of estonia s land surface orru 1992 ilomets 1997 masing et al 2000 generally boreal peatland mire catchments are among the ones to have the highest dom doc concentrations and fluxes aitkenhead and mcdowell 2000 wetzel 2001 ritson et al 2019 mires especially raised bogs form the headwaters for numerous hs rich boreal streams that often sink into karst aquifers on the carbonate outcrops of northern estonia such sinking streams are demonstrated to be responsible for the final chemical composition of the shallow karst groundwater in the northern half of estonia furthermore hs abundant in such streams could prove to be useful natural tracer to provide insights into surface water groundwater interactions it has been stated that the natural background concentration of dom in surface waters of estonia may range 25 60 mg l simm 1975 according to pihlap 2016 the mean natural concentration of doc in estonian mire transitional mire and bog waters is 50 8 16 3 mgc l this study aims to characterize the hydrodynamic and hydrochemical interactions of the hs rich tuhala river and the nabala rakvere shallow karst aquifer hosting the tuhala karst system tks an important groundwater resource in northern estonia previous findings on the general hydrochemistry of the tks date back to 1970 80 s laas and jÃ¼rine 1974 heinsalu 1978 sooÃ¤Ã¤r 1980 thus the modern conditions were little known until the current study in order to achieve the proposed goal surface and groundwater hydrodynamics major ion chemistry hs and stable isotopes were assessed we emphasize that hs abundant in such streams could prove to be useful natural tracer to provide insights into surface water groundwater interactions in the tks but also elsewhere where similar conditions exist 2 material and methods 2 1 study area description the tuhala karst system tks is located in the nw part of the east european platform northern estonia in the heart of the harju plateau of ordovician and silurian carbonate rocks fig 1 the study area covers approximately 1 8 km2 on the lower course of the tuhala river a left bank tributary of the pirita river basin area of 799 km2 fig 1 the tuhala river is a 25 km long hs rich stream that rises in the bogs of the mahtra wetland area 12 km upstream from the tks fig 1 having a basin area of 112 km2 the tks has been developed on top of a cuesta escarpment ridge approximate location can be seen in fig 1 roughly coinciding with the baltic ice lake shoreline that formed sometime during its development 14 000 and 11 600 cal years bp vassiljev and saarse 2013 the cuesta like relief providing a crucial hydraulic gradient for the tks separates the isolation basin of the mahtra wetland area on the southern gentle slope and the valley system of the pirita river on the northern steep slope fig 1 the topography of the study area could be characterized as gently rolling ground moraines interrupted by the tuhala river and the associated karst valleys and dolines fig 2 the ground elevation is the greatest 62 65 m a s l at the w and sw margins of the area and descends towards ne margin to 54 m a s l fig 1 a veneer 2 9 m thick of quaternary cover predominantly late weichselian glacial till mantles the underlying upper ordovician katian stage carbonate rocks fig 2 suuroja et al 2003 the saunja and paekna formation limestone are part of the nabala rakvere shallow karst aquifer that spreads through the whole study area fig 2 the overlying kÃµrgessaare formation limestone fig 2 is similarly fractured and karstified thus it is not distinguished from the nabala rakvere aquifer in the context of this study the same applies to the overlying quaternary aquifer fig 2 although in some places the quaternary deposits may act as a relative upper aquitard producing the confinement of the underlying nabala rakvere aquifer the tks is situated in the transition zone of the baltic sea maritime and continental cfb and dfb according to kÃ¶ppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 climate regions the average annual temperature in estonia is 5 2 c as the average annual amount of precipitation according to the kuusiku and tallinn harku weather stations see location in fig 1 of the estonian weather service 735 mm exceeds the average annual evapotranspiration 430 450 mm kink 2007 humid conditions prevail the hs rich tuhala river sinks into the tks hosted by the nabala rakvere aquifer fig 1 in the ponors of the Ã¤mmaauk and virulase valley figs 1 and 2 after 1 1 5 km of underground flow the majority of the water reemerges in the main discharge area comprising the veetÃµusme perennial spring group qmax 2 6 m3 s according to heinsalu 1978 and the overflow spring group of the witch s well represented by an overflowing dug well qmax 1 1 1 m3 s according to heinsalu 1978 koit 2016 depending on the hydrological conditions the groundwater flow velocities in the tks have been estimated from tracer tests to be in the range of 225 800 m h fig 1 koit et al 2017 the lower positioned springs of the witch s well overflow group activate when q 2 2 4 m3 s is reached in the tuhala river koit et al 2017 the symbol of the overflow spring group the witch s well starts to overflow when the flow rate in the tuhala river exceeds approximately 4 m3 s during low flow conditions the witch s well may become stagnant koit 2016 when the virulase valley fig 1 is flooded surface flow along the kuie dry valley fig 1 will be established when there is no surface flow in the upper part of the valley water appears downstream from the kalda mÃ¤ttasoo and reiesmÃ¤e springs hereafter named as the kuie springs fig 1 for a more detailed overview on the hydrodynamic functioning of the tks see koit 2016 and koit et al 2017 although the tuhala river has been considered the primary source of recharge for the tks bauert and perens 2012 recent studies koit 2016 koit et al 2017 have suggested that some portion of recharge could originate from the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer the households inhabiting the study area generally draw groundwater from the nabala rakvere aquifer and often experience water quality problems that could be associated with the influence of the tuhala river 2 2 methods 2 2 1 monitoring network a network of 15 monitoring points table 1 including eight drilled wells four dug wells two springs and one point in the tuhala river just upstream from the tks was assembled for the present study all of the monitored drilled wells drw were screened in the nabala rakvere aquifer 19 m depth at maximum as a local speciality all of the monitored dug wells dgw except mp8 were located in the bottom of karst dolines these are generally yielding water from the overlying quaternary aquifer and the top of the nabala rakvere aquifer although mp5 represents the witch s well overflow spring group in this study it is included in the dgw group some of the monitored wells mp3 mp10 and mp15 are used daily while some others mp2 mp6 mp8 mp11 mp12 during summer seasons before sampling surface water groundwater levels measured except in mp3 and mp15 using a dipper or measuring tape from a determined datum elevation table 1 which were georeferenced using a leica gnss precision meter the tuhala river mp4 mp6 and the veetÃµusme springs mp9 were equipped with automatic water level data loggers onset hobo u20l 02 the tuhala river mp4 the veetÃµusme springs mp9 and the witch s well overflow spring group represented by the mp5 in this study discharge data were estimated based on the rating curves developed from 2014 by koit 2016 koit et al 2017 the estonian weather service 2019 provided hourly rainfall data of the kuusiku and tallinn harku weather stations for location see fig 1 2 2 2 sample collection seven field campaigns for in situ measurements and water

standardized n 1 prior to conduct the multivariate statistical analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological context according to the kuusiku and tallinn harku weather stations for location see fig 1 the mean amount of precipitation for the period of october 2016 october 2017 was 777 mm the s1 see fig 3 was carried out during low flow conditions accompanied by the autumn s first considerable rainfall melting the thin snow cover that had fallen a couple of days earlier in november 2016 a rainfall induced thaw triggered a medium high flood event sufficient to activate the lower positioned springs in the witch s well intermittent spring group see in fig 3 a tracer test carried out on november 21 showed that the groundwater velocity between the recharge area and the perennial spring group reached 800 m h in these hydrological conditions koit et al 2017 in the end of november another moderate thaw event occurred resulting in medium flow conditions during which the s2 was carried out episodic low intensity snowfalls occurred throughout the january february and usually melted within the following two weeks the s3 was carried out during low flow conditions during the recession of a small flood peak that occurred in the beginning of january the day before s3 air temperature had raised above freezing leading to thaw conditions boosted by light precipitation the s4 was carried out in medium flow conditions during the recession of a rather modest rainfall thaw induced spring flood event fig 3 during the s4 the recession was interrupted by another small flood peak probably caused by the diurnal freeze thaw cycles the s5 was performed when the groundwater and the springs had almost reached their hydrological low stand of the study period the rainy august 87 mm vs the long term mean 85 mm gave way to the record wet 268 mm vs the long term mean 201 mm autumn of 2017 the resulting rise of surface water and groundwater level was more intense in groundwater veetÃµusme springs mp6 and mp9 compared to the tuhala river mp4 this was referring to the effect of the depleted runoff and still significant evapotranspiration in the tuhala river mp4 upper catchment in september 2017 the latter resulted in a remarkable difference between the input and output flow rates and water levels in the tuhala river mp4 and the veetÃµusme springs mp9 during the s6 as seen in fig 3 after the first recharge event in september 2017 another one followed in the middle of october fig 3 the response to recharge pulse was still quicker in the veetÃµusme springs mp9 referring to the significant effect of autogenic recharge to the tks however with the effect of evapotranspiration much lower in october and groundwater storage plenished by the last recharge event the flood peak in the tuhala river mp4 soon followed consequently the lower positioned springs of the witch s well mp5 intermittent group were activated fig 3 when comparing the total surface water input mp4 and output mp9 mp5 overflow of the tks during the peak flow of october 2017 flood 4 04 vs 2 74 m3 s respectively the output accounts for 67 of the input the difference is thought to be caused by the limited throughput capacity of the tks discussed by koit et al 2017 and the buffering effect of the intermittent lake in the virulase valley that acts as a dynamic storage the s7 was carried out during the recession of the october 2017 flood in high flow conditions see fig 3 when assessing the average surface water input 0 61 m3 s in mp4 and output flow rate 0 75 m3 s in mp9 mp5 overflow of the tks during the study period of october 2016 october 2017 the average output was 23 higher than the input the latter could refer to the impact of the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer on recharging the karst system previously considered to be driven primarily by the allogenic recharge from tuhala river by bauert and perens 2012 reluctantly depending on the groundwater level the tks seems to be either partly feeding perched or draining the hosting aquifer the hydrological conditions of the kuie springs mp1 were observed visually during the study period the kuie springs showed no significant deviations from its normal flow rate up to few liters per second which could have been associated with the impact of the tuhala river the flow rate in the kuie springs developed from the contribution of the small perennial springs of kalda reiesmÃ¤e and mÃ¤ttasoo see fig 1 also during the s7 fig 3 the flow rate in the kuie springs remained low due to the fact that the approximate hydrological threshold conditions as estimated by koit et al 2017 in the tuhala river required for establishing the surface flow in the kuie dry valley were not met at the time noteworthy is the behavior of the groundwater level in the mp8 where it was virtually static throughout the most of the study period the water level did not respond to pumping and only rose abruptly during the autumn flood of 2017 3 2

were of the ca hco3 type fig 4 a referring to carbonate minerals as the major contributor to the hydrochemistry of the surface water and shallow groundwater in the tks catchment all of the analyzed water samples were dominated by the hco3 anion followed by in the decreasing order of abundance so4 2 no3 cl f fig 4a and table 2 among cations ca2 was the most abundant followed by in the decreasing order of abundance mg2 na k fig 4a and table 2 in general the tds decreases in the tuhala river mp4 spring and dgw groups in response to dilution caused by the increasing flow conditions the mean tds was the highest in the drw group that are screening in the deeper part up to 20 m deep of the nabala rakvere aquifer followed by the springs dgw and the tuhala river mp4 groups fig 4b the majority of the drw group also featured lower coefficient of variation cv of tds compared to other groups referring to more stable mineralization of groundwater in the deeper part of the nabala rakvere aquifer the tuhala river mp4 features the highest cv for the majority of the observed physicochemical parameters table 2 although originating from a mire catchment the ph was usually above neutral by the time the tuhala river reached the mp4 depending on the flow conditions a significant deviation in tds sd 87 mg l could be observed fig 4b the latter was likely due to the dilution controlled by the proportion of the more significant low tds mire runoff component in comparison to the other less abundant sources or recharge mineral soil catchment and groundwater reflected by the increase in tds and consequently the spc during low flow conditions the groundwater contribution is evident in the tuhala river recharge the kuie mp1 and veetÃµusme springs mp9 representing the spring group differ significantly from each other table 2 the mp1 had a higher mean tds and lower tds cv compared to that of the veetÃµusme spring mp9 the kuie springs mp1 seem to be more similar to the drw group thus is most likely discharging the regional groundwater of the nabala rakvere aquifer the high sd and cv values for tds in the spring group are therefore caused mainly by the mp9 which is more similar to the tuhala river mp4 and the witch s well spring group mp5 as would be expected based on the results of the earlier tracer experiments by koit 2016 and koit et al 2017 however the mean spc and tds in veetÃµusme springs mp9 are slightly higher compared to the tuhala river mp4 that is the main proven koit 2016 koit et al 2017 source for recharge for the springs the latter also refers to the probable partial contribution of the nabala rakvere aquifer to the discharge in the veetÃµusme springs mp9 as already pointed out in the hydrodynamic chapter when assessing the statistical variability of tds also for the majority of the remaining physicochemical parameters in table 2 versus the mean values the tuhala river mp4 the witch s well mp5 veetÃµusme springs mp9 mp12 and mp15 constitute a cluster that features similarly high cv compared to the other monitoring points fig 4 it may be assumed that the tuhala river mp4 providing the highly variable allogenic recharge is most likely provoking the high variability in the river cluster fig 5 another cluster that differs from the river and the groundwater cluster is the one comprising the mp8 and mp11 doline related dgws 3 3 dissolved co2 and saturation indices of the carbonated species the studied surface waters and groundwater in the tks generally evolve under open carbonate system conditions however closed conditions could be suspected in the case of the deeper drws mp2 in fig 6 b the waters in the drw group were generally in saturation state with respect to calcite and dolomite fig 6a sporadic under saturation in mp2 mp6 mp12 occurs during high flow conditions s7 the overall saturation trend in the dgw group is similar to the rest of the groups however the water in some of the dgws are more likely to be under saturated regardless of the flow conditions the water in the kuie springs mp1 was always in saturation state with respect to calcite and dolomite fig 6a in addition the lowest logpco2 readings were generally associated with the kuie springs mp1 possibly due to the low flow and relatively great distance of the sampling point from the actual spring resurgence giving time for co2 to degas during low flow conditions s1 s3 and s5 the water in the tuhala river mp4 was in saturation state with respect to calcite and dolomite but never in equilibrium with respect to atmospheric logpco2 figs 6a and 5b during medium and high flow conditions the tuhala river mp4 was undersaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite analogously to the tuhala river mp4 the veetÃµusme springs mp9 reached saturation with respect to calcite and dolomite only during low flow conditions and during medium to high flow conditions the water was undersaturated it should be noted that during some sampling campaigns s1 s3 s5 s6 and s7 the tuhala river mp4 was always more saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite compared to the veetÃµusme springs mp9 fig 6a in the case of the s4 the relationship was the opposite 3 4 the occurrence and dynamics of humic substances in the waters of the study area the tuhala river mp4 featured the highest mean hs concentration amongst all of the monitoring points fig 7 a the highest and lowest concentrations in the tuhala river mp4 were observed during s6 40 7 mg l and s3 22 mg l respectively there was no clear trend between the hydrodynamic conditions in the tuhala river mp4 and hs concentration this could have been due to dilution caused by surface flowpath dominancy in wetlands as described in mulholland 2003 but also because the variation of flow rates and vegetation activity are not always consistent the latter could be due to the limited amount of data when comparing the mean hs concentration the tuhala river mp4 was followed by the witch s well mp5 the veetÃµusme springs mp9 mp12 and mp15 as seen in fig 7a the mean hs concentrations were the lowest and less variable in the drw group representing the water from the deeper part of the nabala rakvere aquifer as an exception the highest deviation in hs concentrations was observed in mp12 a drw that has previously been proved koit et al 2017 to be in direct hydraulic connection with the tuhala river mp4 when the mean hs concentrations of the monitoring points were plotted versus the cv of tds fig 7b the outcome generally agreed with the clusters drawn in fig 5 it can be assumed that the tuhala river mp4 is the primary source of hs in the tks when the hs results are compared with the tracing results of precedent studies koit et al 2017 it is clear that hs acts in a relatively conservative way highlighting evidences about the partly previously proven hydraulic connections between the tuhala river mp4 and other monitoring points 3 5 environmental isotopes Î´18o and Î´2h the Î´18o and Î´2h values of the espoo rainfall period of 2010 2015 from the iaea wmo gnip database that were used to calculate the lmwl Î´2h 7 9 Î´18o 8 5 ranged from 18 9 to 6 9 and 141 to 43 respectively the gmwl was based on Î´2h 8 Î´18o 10 as defined by craig 1961 the lmwl and gmwl plot almost parallel to each other fig 8 a the isotopic signatures of the remaining water samples collected see table 2 during the sampling campaigns s5 s6 and s7 generally plot min max range for Î´18o values from 11 8 to 9 5 and for Î´2h values 84 4 to 68 4 along the lmwl and gmwl indicating the overall meteoric origin of the nabala rakvere aquifer groundwater and surface waters in the study area the isotopic composition in the majority of the drws generally agrees with the shallow groundwater isoscape for the baltic artesian basin proposed by raidla et al 2016 the general trend in fig 8a suggests that the monitoring points which were exposed to the atmospheric meteorological conditions the tuhala river springs and dgws tend to shift towards isotopic enrichment during low flow conditions especially summer and vice versa a cluster comprising dgws mp5 and mp15 the veetÃµusme spring mp9 and the tuhala river mp4 clearly shows temporally heavier isotopic composition indicating the effect of evaporation during summer low and medium flow s5 and s6 although following the same overall trend there is a small yet noticeable discrepancy between the tuhala river mp4 and the veetÃµusme springs mp9 both during the winter high flow s7 and summer low flow s5 in both cases s5 and s7 the veetÃµusme springs mp9 show slightly lighter isotopic composition compared to the tuhala river mp4 this could be due to the mixing of the sinking water of the tuhala river with groundwater lighter isotopic composition while transferring the tks when the available Î´18o values were plotted against the hs fig 8b concentrations for s5 s6 and s7 similar trends in the formed were seen in figs 5 and 7b referring to their strong hydrochemical interaction the tuhala river mp4 the witch s well mp5 and the veetÃµusme springs mp9 generally form the core river influenced cluster for each distinct trendline representing the sampling campaigns s5 s6 and s7 as seen in fig 8b depending on the hydrological conditions mp15 and mp12 may also plot in the river influenced cluster the overall effect of evaporation during winter high flow s7 and summer low flow s5 is visible in the fig 7b the river influenced cluster during the s6 fig 8b also features evidence of isotopic fractionation by evaporation furthermore the veetÃµusme springs mp9 featured a slightly heavier Î´18o signature and significantly lower hs concentration compared to the tuhala river mp4 and the witch s well spring group mp5 the latter also reinforces the hypotheses launched in the previous chapters about the unusual hydrological conditions in the tks during s6 that could have been due to significant autogenic recharge contribution 3 6 hydrochemical interactions between surface waters and groundwater in the tuhala karst system prior to moving on to the pca the hydrochemical dataset had to be cleaned from the outliers conspicuously high concentrations of na k cl and no3 were observed in mp8 mp11 mp14 and mp15 figs 9 a and 8b the concentrations for the latter ions in the tuhala river mp4 were lower in all cases thus their allogenic origin could be ruled out the combination of the parameters and the location type most were dgw of the particular monitoring points where anomalous concentrations were detected generally indicated the possibility of local contamination due to livestock farming the use of mineral organic fertilizers road salts and or to inadequate wastewater management to avoid the dampening of the naturally occurring hydrochemical processes in the tks by anthropogenically induced effects na k cl and no3 were excluded from the pca in order to gain insights into the hydrochemical processes occurring in the tks a pca was performed including nine physical chemical variables ph spc mg2 ca2 f so4 2 hco3 tds and hs three supplementary quantitative variables sicalcite sidolomite and logpco2 and 93 observations a pearson correlation coefficient matrix was compiled table 3 a from the standardized values of the nine primary and three supplementary variables included in the pca as expected spc as the global indicator for water mineralization has the highest positive correlation with the tds which in turn correlates the best with carbonate system related parameters like hco3 ca2 and mg2 but on the contrary has a strong negative correlation with the hs table 3a the variables were transformed into two principal factors such as factors f1 and f2 with the highest eigenvalues 6 1 and 1 2 were chosen according to the rule of 1 together f1 and f2 accounted for 80 4 of the variability in the input data fig 9 the variables associated with the carbonate system and the residence time tds spc hco3 ca2 mg2 f and so4 2 hunkeler and mudry 2007 provided the most significant positive contribution to f1 67 4 while the hs provided the most significant negative contribution as seen in table 3b the reverse statistical relationship between tds and hs for f1 and also in table 3a could be interpreted as the river groundwater interaction expressed through the co effect of dilution and hs concentration dynamics as previously seen in fig 6b the f2 13 1 receives the greatest positive contribution from ph and f the additional variables sicalcite sidolomite and logpco2 computed from the in situ measured ph values are associated with the factor f2 when the factor scores of the observations were plotted in fig 10 b a triangular shaped observation cloud was formed the shape is mainly determined by tds comprising all the major components and hs along the opposite extremes of the x axis representing dilution and mineralization as the main reverse hydrochemical trends in the tks along the y axis ph and logpco2 supplementary variables are the dominant variables representing ph co2 dynamics fig 10b in the waters of the tks the majority of the observations of the drw group except for mp12 mp1 mp11 and mp15 of the dgw group plots to the right half of the observation cloud in fig 10b forming the groundwater related cluster the latter cluster is elongated along the y axis with deeper drws corresponding to lower ph higher logpco2 but also to parameters that could be associated with longer residence time higher mg2 so4 2 and f concentrations plotted in the lower half of the groundwater cluster making up the shallow groundwater sub cluster of the nabala rakvere aquifer the upper half of the groundwater cluster the so called surficial groundwater fig 10b is mostly comprised of observations matching the dgw group during low medium flow and the mp12 during low flow and kuie spring mp1 samples the groundwater in the tks is generally characterized by similar tds values the differentiation of the surficial groundwater sub cluster fig 10b is clearly defined by generally higher ph values co2 degassing due to being closer to the surface in the river aquifer continuum the relatively high and stable tds of the kuie springs mp1 fig 10 compared to that of the veetÃµusme springs mp9 fig 10b indicates that during the study period the kuie springs were discharging groundwater from the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer e g similar to the groundwater observed in the drw group the long distance between the kuie springs resurgence and sampling point resulted in slight dilution in tds and a significant decrease in logpco2 the left half of the observation cloud fig 10b primarily comprises the factor scores of the observations of the tuhala river mp4 the veetÃµusme springs mp9 and the witch s well springs mp5 which make up the core of the river cluster and its end member the dispersion of the tuhala river mp4 samples along the x axis fig 10 illustrates the shifting balance between mineralization possibly due to increased groundwater contribution and dilution from the increase of hs rich mire runoff depending on the hydrological conditions for a detailed comparison the tuhala river mp4 the veetÃµusme springs mp9 and if possible the witch s well mp5 during each sampling campaign were encircled in fig 10b during low flow conditions both the tuhala river mp4 and the veetÃµusme springs mp9 shift towards the groundwater cluster the increase of tds during low flow could be attributed to the relative significance of the groundwater contribution when the dilute allogenic input is low fig 10b during low flow conditions s1 s3 and s5 the witch s well mp4 plots apart from the tuhala river mp4 and the veetÃµusme springs mp9 pairs due to groundwater from the well appeared to be disconnected and stagnant koit et al 2017 proved that although hydraulically connected to the tks during low to medium flow active circulation of water in the witch s well mp5 started in case of medium and high flow conditions in the tks this is also evident in the current hydrochemical data as during medium and high flow conditions s2 s4 s6 and s7 the witch s well mp5 plots together with to the tuhala river mp4 and the veetÃµusme springs mp9 pairs fig 10b 3 7 mixing processes in the tuhala karst system the discrepancies between the observation pairs of the tuhala river mp4 and the veetÃµusme springs mp9 during each sampling campaign fig 10b could indicate the fate of the sinking tuhala river mp4 water during its transfer through the tks during the s1 s2 s5 and s7 the water in the veetÃµusme springs mp9 featured a generally slight increase in tds and logpco2 values and a slight decrease in hs concentrations compared to the sinking water of the tuhala river mp4 during the s3 and s4 the differences were reverse fig 10b the output in the veetÃµusme springs mp9 was slightly more diluted lower tds compared to the tuhala river mp4 the smaller differences as can be seen during the s1 and s2 between the input and output water quality mainly major ions could have been caused by the non conservative behavior of the more reactive tracers during the transfer barberÃ¡ et al 2014 jurado et al 2015 but more likely due to temporal difference in sampling and small analytical uncertainties due to the relatively short transfer time of the tks during medium low to high flow conditions that is approximately 1 5 to 2 5 h based on koit et al 2017 and the relatively homogeneous hydrochemistry in the tks the possible hydrochemical reactions during mixing are hereafter not considered significant in the context of the current dataset moreover as backed by many sources cited in the introduction section hs as the main tracer is expected to be relatively conservative in the given conditions more significant changes in water quality as are evident during the s3 s4 s5 s6 and s7 could refer to mixing with groundwater originating from the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer and other sources in the case of s6 and s7 the enrichment in the concentrations of cl no3 f or so4 2 and dilution in hs could be observed in the case of the s3 and s4 the contributing groundwater had to be more dilute affected by the autogenic recharge snowmelt than the sinking water in the tuhala river mp4 clearly distinct from the others a significant difference between the mp4 and mp9 during the s6 fig 10b is evident the latter was also evidenced by the hydrological fig 2 hydrochemical fig 6 and isotopic fig 8 results in the previous chapters also evident in fig 10b is the hydrochemical evolution of the observations in the dgw and drw group mp8 mp11 mp12 and mp15 the trajectories are traced with the colored arrows in fig 10b in response to increasing flow conditions the observations of the aforementioned monitoring points during low or medium flow conditions plot within or close to the groundwater cluster but shift towards the river cluster during medium and high flow conditions this indicates the arrival of surface water from the sinking tuhala river mp4 water and mixing with the shallow groundwater in the mp8 mp11 mp12 and mp15 in the case of the mp12 the mixing occurs primarily because of the leak in the casing of the well koit et al 2017 but also due to its location in the highly karstified fracture zone of the virulase valley fig 1 the interaction of the mp8 mp11 and mp15 doline related dgws with the tuhala river in response to increasing flow conditions was more modest compared to the mp5 of the witch s well spring group the hydrochemical evolution constantly low logpco2 and invariable tds of the mp8 likely refers to the stagnant groundwater within the dug well during low to medium flow conditions however when taking into account the constant groundwater level during the sample pumping for s1 s6 see fig 1 the mp8 behaved like it was recharged from a perched reservoir in order to evaluate how the sinking waters of tuhala river mp4 interact with shallow groundwater of the hosting karst aquifer during its transfer through the tks a solute mass balance mixing analysis was performed for the main output of the tks the veetÃµusme springs mp9 and but also for the other monitoring points indicating significant mixing in the pca fig 10 although a triangular observation cloud was formed in fig 10b suggesting that there could be at least three end members involved in the mixing system the surficial groundwater end member seems to root from the shallow groundwater end member as there is seemingly no direct connection between the river and shallow groundwater sub clusters in fig 10b this means that in a simplified context ignoring other possible end members due to lack of data the surficial groundwater end member delineated by co2 dynamics is rather an intermediate stage of shallow groundwater becoming more exposed to surficial conditions and mixing with the surface water thus a shallow groundwater end member with a complete dataset used tracers and lowest mean deviation among the calculated mixing fractions was used a two component mass balance mixing model as used by barberÃ¡ and andreo 2017 clark 2015 crandall et al 1999 and katz et al 1998 was applied 1 f river c mix c groundwater c river c groundwater where friver represents the calculated water fraction of tuhala river mp4 in the veetÃµusme springs mp9 cspring cgroundwater criver denote the concentrations of a selected tracer in the mixture of the considered monitoring point for the veetÃµusme springs mp9 mixing calculations the semiconservative tracers f cl and so4 2 which produced the most consistent results compared to hs were also assessed in the case of the s5 s6 and s7 the available Î´18o data was also used in mixing calculations due to the higher degree of uncertainty involved in estimating mixing fractions in the dug and drilled wells e g no active circulation possibility of insufficient purging etc only hs and Î´18o data as the most conservative parameters were assessed most consistent calculation results mean deviation of 10 among the mixing fraction calculations table 4 were achieved by using the observations from the mp10 for hydrogeological and hydrochemical context see figs 1 and 10b as the shallow groundwater end member the mean tuhala river mp4 mixing fractions based on hs ions and hs ions combined were 88 10 for the whole study table 4 the mixing fractions calculated using the ions alone and hs ions combined explained 87 and 90 p 0 05 of variation respectively in the tuhala river mp4 mixing fractions based on hs alone thus at least in the case of the veetÃµusme springs mp9 hs provided relatively reliable results for assessing the mixing processes in the tks the results for the dgws and drws observed in the mixing analysis mp5 mp8 mp11 mp12 and mp15 should be assessed with reservation due to greater uncertainties involved it should also be taken into account that the Î´18o signature of the surface water and the actual surficial groundwater may have been relatively similar in some cases thus the calculated mixing fractions may not always indicate the exact end member of the mixing water in the meteorically affected system rather than reflect the broader source of origin in order to put the mixing fraction results in the context of the hydraulic interactions between the tks and the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer the hydraulic gradients of both were assessed table 5 to derive a parameter that would conclude the hydraulic interaction the hydraulic gradient ratio aquifer tks was calculated for each sampling campaign table 5 the lower the hydraulic gradient ratio the greater the intersection of the estimated potentiometric surfaces and vice versa the potentiometric surface of the tks was above perched the potentiometric surface of the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer during the low flow condition campaigns s1 s3 and s5 fig 11 in the case of low flow conditions the hydraulic gradient ratios were among the highest min max range 0 78 0 83 observed which means that the potentiometric surface and the hydraulic gradients of the tks and the aquifer were the closest to being parallel during low flow conditions the veetÃµusme springs mp9 were discharging primarily the water from the sinking tuhala river mp4 mean 96 4 table 4 and fig 11 depending on the low flow sampling campaign up to 8 of the discharge in the veetÃµusme springs mp9 could have been contributed by the groundwater from the hosting aquifer based on hs in the case of s5 the Î´ 18o data also confirmed groundwater contribution up to 18 as the spring discharge during the s5 was isotopically lighter compared to that than of the sinking water the witch s well mp5 remained hydraulically connected to the tks during low flow conditions mean 98 3 however the slightly overestimated mixing fractions by both the hs probably due to the retardation of the previous event water and Î´18o heavier composition due to free surface water evaporation during the s1 and s5 could indicate poor circulation and or stagnant effect in the witch s well mp5 as also discussed by koit 2016 and koit et al 2017 different trends were observed among the other considered monitoring points mp8 mp11 mp12 and mp15 during low flow conditions the mp8 featured approximately 13 of tuhala river mp4 mixing fraction based on hs however Î´18o indicated no contribution 0 thus when also relying on the findings of the pca analysis it is rather likely that mp8 was disconnected from the tks during low flow conditions in the mp11 the calculations suggested 14 13 and 42 of tuhala river mp4 mixing fractions based on hs and Î´18o respectively when compared to the other sampling campaigns it is likely that the mixing fractions observed in mp8 and mp11 during low flow conditions could entail uncertainties related to stagnancy additionally it may be assumed that the water in the tuhala river mp4 at the time primarily originated from the groundwater runoff upstream from the tks the latter could have led to similar isotopic signatures among the mixing end members if in the case of mp11 the mixing fractions during s1 and s5 should be explained the most plausible reason would be the low groundwater level that would otherwise dilute and or prevent the intruding water from the tuhala river mp4 in the case of mp12 relatively consistent mean mixing fractions of 23 22 and 27 were obtained based on hs and Î´18o respectively in mp15 the mean tuhala river mp4 mixing fraction based on hs and Î´18o was 40 24 and 52 respectively the good agreement of hs and Î´18o mixing fractions in mp12 and mp15 in the case of the s5 confirms convincingly the partial contribution from the tuhala river mp4 during low flow conditions the tuhala river mp4 mixing fractions based on hs among the monitoring points mp8 mp11 mp12 and mp15 were generally lowest in the case of the s3 winter season the three medium flow events observed s2 s4 and s6 are presented separately in fig 11 as they featured differing results table 4 during medium flow conditions the veetÃµusme springs mp9 featured slightly lower mean mixing fraction mean 82 24 of the tuhala river mp4 water compared to the low flow conditions the mean mixing fraction of tuhala river mp4 was also lower in the witch s well mp5 mean 90 8 during s2 the estimated potentiometric surface of the tks was above the potentiometric surface of the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer fig 11 and the hydraulic gradient ratio was the highest observed 0 88 during the study the veetÃµusme springs mp9 and the witch s well mp5 featured tuhala river mp4 mixing fractions of 99 and 98 respectively referring to the tks being flushed by primarily the water of the tuhala river mp4 in the case of s4 both the surface water and groundwater levels were slightly higher when compared to the conditions of the s2 the potentiometric surface of the nabala rakvere aquifer in the discharge area were exceeded intersected the estimated potentiometric surface of the tks fig 11 as indicated by the hydraulic gradient ratio 0 66 consequently in all of the observed monitoring points the tuhala river mp4 mixing fractions were slightly lower compared to the s2 the latter may have referred to the effect of considerable snowmelt induced autogenic recharge to the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer that may have occurred during the s4 resulting in an even more diluted mixture in the veetÃµusme springs mp9 as also indicated by the overestimated mixing fractions calculated from the major ions table 4 in the case of the s6 the water levels in the recharge area of the tks were significantly lower compared to the s2 and s4 however the situation was the opposite in the discharge area table 4 and fig 11 moreover the potentiometric surface of the nabala rakvere aquifer in the discharge area was above the estimated potentiometric surface of the tks resulting in the lowest hydraulic gradient ratio 0 49 observed during the study during the s6 the veetÃµusme springs mp9 featured unexpectedly low tuhala river mp4 mixing fraction 54 to confirm this similar result 52 was obtained when the selected ions were compared to the tuhala river mp4 when also the meteorological and hydrological conditions discussed in the previous chapters are taken into account it is plausible that the tks was receiving a significant contribution from the surficial part of the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer that had been recently autogenically recharged as for the tuhala river mp4 the headwater bog catchment was probably still buffering the rainfall and the modest flow rate in the river originated mostly from the recent surface and surficial groundwater runoff upstream during the s6 the witch s well mp5 featured 92 tuhala river mp4 mixing fraction during medium flow conditions the mp8 mp11 mp12 and mp15 featured tuhala river mp4 mixing fractions in the range of 1 96 table 4 and fig 11 similar to the low flow conditions the 6 9 mixing fractions based on hs and 0 based on Î´18o in the mp8 indicated that there was probably no connection with the tks during medium flow conditions s4 and s6 in contrast to the low flow conditions the mp11 showed lower mixing fractions mean 3 min max range 0 9 during medium flow conditions based on hs this may have been due to the higher groundwater levels for reference see the contours for s4 in fig 1 preventing the intrusion dilution of the water from the tuhala river mp4 in the activated flowpaths of the tks during the s6 the proportion of the mixing fraction in mp11 based on Î´18o 19 also seems to confirm the latter claim in mp12 the mean mixing fraction mean 81 min max range 58 96 was higher compared to the low flow conditions in the case of the s6 the mixing fractions in mp12 based on hs and Î´18o 58 59 were consistent the mp15 was only observed during s4 and s6 during the s4 the tuhala river mp4 mixing fraction in mp15 was higher 39 compared to s6 7 51 based on hs and Î´18o respectively during the s7 high flow conditions occurred in the tks however the conditions were not sufficient enough to initiate the witch s well mp5 overflow as determined by koit et al 2017 at the time the potentiometric surface of the shallow aquifer in the discharge area of the tks was above the estimated potentiometric surface of the tks fig 11 as also indicated by the hydraulic gradient ratio 0 58 during the s7 the veetÃµusme springs featured 82 76 based on the ions tuhala river mp4 mixing fraction based on hs referring to a significant groundwater contribution in the spring discharge as well as in the case of the s6 the Î´18o suggested nearly 100 tuhala river mp4 contribution due to the overall dominant meteoric influence intensive rainfall among the end members the witch s well mp5 was confirmed to be fully connected 100 100 based on both the hs and Î´18o respectively to the tuhala river mp4 during the s7 there was a significant groundwater level increase observed in mp8 accompanied by the flooding of the lower areas of the vanakubja valley for location see fig 1 strangely according to hs the tuhala river mp4 mixing fraction in the mp8 was 0 however the mixing fraction based on Î´18o suggested 94 contribution from the tuhala river mp4 in the case of the mp8 insufficient purging could be suspected due to the great volume of the water in the dug well during high flow conditions the water was visually observed in the field to become darker in color by the end of the purging process in contrast the Î´18o findings confirm the mp8 likely becoming hydraulically linked with the tks while also support the overall meteoric influence hypothesis discussed above similar situation as witnessed in mp8 could be suspected in the case of the mp11 as the tuhala river mp4 mixing fractions based on hs 25 and Î´18o 83 were slightly conflicting an additional difference between the estimated fractions could have been provoked by the high relative groundwater level in mp11 preventing the arrival of groundwater from the active part of the tks in mp12 the high groundwater level could have retarded the intrusion of the water from the tuhala river mp4 thus relatively modest mixing fraction 29 was obtained in similar conditions the mp15 behaved differently as the highest tuhala river mp4 mixing fraction 73 was observed as seen in fig 12 there is a good agreement r2 0 7 n 7 p 0 019 between the tuhala river mp4 mixing fraction and the hydraulic gradient ratio of the tks and the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer this means that the magnitude of groundwater contribution in the discharge of the veetÃµusme springs mp9 is dependent of the hydraulic relationship between the tks and the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer in other words it seems plausible that the groundwater contribution in the veetÃµusme spring mp9 discharge increases together with the increasing intersection of the potentiometric surfaces characterized by the hydraulic gradient ratio the sampling campaigns carried out during low to medium low flow conditions s1 s2 s3 and s5 form a cluster corresponding to parallel potentiometric surfaces and smaller contributions from the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer when the flow conditions intensify s4 s6 and s7 the potentiometric surfaces intersect and groundwater contribution to the tks increases the overall relationship seems to be reasonably linear however it is evident in fig 3 that in the case of the s6 there is a non linear deviation from the trend which refers to the unexpectedly dynamic and non stationary response of the tks and the hosting aquifer to extreme precipitation this stresses the non linearity of the tks as also attributed to karst systems generally by bakalowicz 2005 moreover the cases of s6 s7 and s4 show that the hosting aquifer has a significant impact mean groundwater contribution 12 16 on the tks functioning 3 8 wider implications of using humic substances in surface water groundwater interaction studies this study demonstrates that the use of hs when assessing karst systems shows great potential although dom doc has been previously successfully applied in numerous studies of karst systems emblanch et al 1998 vesper and white 2004 pronk et al 2006 hunkeler and mudry 2007 trÄek 2008 mudarra et al 2011 charlier et al 2012 jin et al 2014 mudarra et al 2014 the use of hs could add additional value under appropriate conditions for example according to bertrand et al 2014 water in boreal environments may feature a distinctive doc dom including hs signature due to its origin rendering the hs a conservative or semi conservative tracer dittmar and kattner 2003 cooper et al 2008 bertrand et al 2014 this theory was confirmed in our study where the hs concentrations in the tuhala river were significantly higher than in the general autogenic recharge based on the drilled wells not affected by the river infiltrating through the till soils on the nabala rakvere aquifer this suggests that hs could be effectively used to distinguish the allogenic recharge component from other significantly less hs rich recharge components based on the observations of the authors these conditions could apply for the majority of the known binary karst systems in estonia less for the ones in the pandivere upland where autogenic recharge prevails and mires are not as widespread moreover we find that the approach described in this study would not only be applicable in the boreal environment but globally where karst systems are receiving focused recharge rich in dom as shown in this study however the effective implementation of hs requires sufficient supplementary hydrochemical data major and or major ions stable isotopes including doc concentrations in comparison if possible 4 conclusions this study presents the outcome of the combined assessment of surface and groundwater hydrodynamics major ion chemistry hs and stable isotopes to characterize the interaction of the hs rich tuhala river and the shallow nabala rakvere karst aquifer hosting the tks the sampled surface water in the tuhala river and shallow groundwater up to 20 m deep in all of the monitored springs dgw and drw were homogeneously ca hco3 type throughout the study mean tds increased with depth being generally higher in the drws and the lowest in the tuhala river although the major ion composition and water type among the sampled monitoring points in the tks was homogeneous the assessment of variability of tds effectively assisted in delineating the monitoring points that were more likely interacting with the tuhala river in the tks similar to major ion chemistry the isotopic signatures of the water samples collected during the s5 s6 and s7 showed generally little variance and indicated the overall meteoric origin of the surface waters and shallow groundwater in the tks although the isotopic sample set was incomplete it pointed out the complex interrelation of surface water and shallow groundwater in a typical karst catchment on the carbonate outcrops of northern estonia hs proved to be an effective tracer for characterizing the interaction of the tuhala river and the nabala rakvere aquifer hosting the tks karst system tuhala river with the highest mean hs concentration was found to be the dominant source of hs to the tks thus making the use of hs as a natural tracer possible moreover when plotted against the mean tds and Î´18o hs allowed the delineation of monitoring points that were more likely to be interacting with the tuhala river subsequently relying on the high descriptive capability of the hs the performed pca successfully confirmed the monitoring points interacting with the tuhala river in the theoretical mixing space the pca also highlighted the hydrochemical discrepancies between the sinking tuhala river and the veetÃµusme perennial spring group of the tks further indicating the possible mixing of the sinking tuhala river water and the groundwater from the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer in the tks to quantify the possible mixing processes in the tks hs was used as the main natural tracer in two component mass balance mixing model the mixing results showed that the mean contribution of the sinking tuhala river in the main perennial spring was 88 16 on average 12 16 of the discharge in the main perennial springs of the tks could originate from the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer in an extreme case up to 46 of the discharge was found to be originating from the hosting nabala rakvere aquifer referring to the non linear behavior of the tks furthermore the river groundwater mixing fractions in the veetÃµusme perennial spring group recharge were found to be in good agreement r2 0 7 n 7 p 0 019 with the hydraulic gradient ratio i e the intersection of the potentiometric surfaces of the tks

5957,groundwater tidal fluctuations were studied in a multi layered sandy coastal aquifer at dor bay israel 35 m from shore the aquifer at the site is ca 50 m thick and it consists of a superficial phreatic unit underlain by two confined units separated by 1 3 m thick clay layers while the top of the deep unit is at 30 m below sea level the top of the intermediate unit is irregular and it is

unit exceeding those in the shallow unit 4 month average agw asw of 0 72 and 0 53 using li and jiao s 2001 solution we showed that the deeper unit is in hydraulic contact with the sea at 100 400 m from shore which should be due to the termination or breaching of the deeper clay this is probably the result of a buried ridge similar to the submerged calcareous sandstone ridge that exists today in

bresciani et al 2015a b this paper presents research into a complexed coastal aquifer which includes both a shallow partly confined unit that is exposed to seawater infiltration close to shore and a deep fully confined unit whose connection with the sea is not observed both the effect of partial confinement in the shallow unit and the connection of the deep unit with the sea are investigated by means of tidal fluctuations with the advantage of the two units sharing the same lithology and of having very close to shore observation boreholes 1 1 study site and hydrogeology the study site is located at dor bay the southern carmel coast northern israel fig 1 where a quaternary coastal aquifer about 50 m thick is underlain by cretaceous marls the quaternary aquifer is sub divided into three sub aquifers separated by thin 1 to 3 m thick clay units including a few m thick phreatic holocene sand unit which is underlain by two confined units of mixed calcareous sandstone and sand b and c fig 2 at 30 40 m from the bay the roofs of the confined units are at 4 5 and 29 31 mbsl and their thicknesses are 23 and 18 m respectively fig 2 the top of unit b is highly irregular forming ridges and depressions with the latter covered by a shallow clay unit and the phreatic sand unit a fig 3 at the study site unit b is partly exposed close to the shore 20 30 m offshore in the bay as well as along an e w ridge that borders the bay just north of the site fig 1 and is fully exposed 120 150 m offshore where it creates a submerged n s ridge parallel to shore figs 1 and 3 the offshore extension of the clay layer that separates unit b and unit c i e the location where unit c s roof terminates and is exposed to seawater infiltration is unknown in this paper we discuss the progression of the tidal signal in both units and use it to address the question of where does unit c connect with the sea in both confined units a fresh saline water interface was identified separating top slightly brackish water ec 5 ms cm 1 from bottom saline water we note that the salinity of unit c bottom water is similar to that of seawater 55 ms cm 1 while in unit b the conductivity of bottom water is 40 ms cm 1 2 methods the main body of level measurements reported in this study was taken during may sept 2012 total of 147 days in three boreholes drilled 35 m from the sea 30 40 m during high and low tide respectively two of these boreholes are opened to the confined units b and c dor 4 and dor 3 respectively figs 1 and 2 and the third dor 5 is opened to the superficial phreatic unit a we also report about measurements between feb apr 2009 conducted in two other boreholes p11 and p21 opened to unit b at 40 and 60 m from the sea groundwater levels were measured by eijkelkamp and solinst mini divers 1 h resolution fluctuation time series are shown in fig 4 a c full data could be found in the supplementary information together with sea level which was measured 2 km offshore 15 km south of dor bay the hadera iolr station we note that tidal fluctuations in the bay are in phase with those measured in the open sea as shown in fig 4d although amplitudes are usually slightly stronger in the bay therefore the agw asw ratios reported below should be regarded as maximum values 3 results dor bay levels and tidal fluctuations groundwater level in unit c was on average 54 and 58 cm higher than in units b and a respectively averages of 106 52 and 48 cm above sea level during may sept 2012 respectively fig 4a and app 1 which suggests that units b and c are hydraulically disconnected groundwater level in both units nicely correlated with the hadera iolr station sea level and showed typical bi daily daily and bi monthly tidal frequencies with clear dominance of the first in the confined units figs 4a b and 5 this was superimposed on long term trends e g low levels during may through june app 1 and level decrease between july and september 2012 fig 4a groundwater bi daily fluctuations were significantly weaker than those observed in sea level with those in c stronger than in b the may sept average of the bi daily amplitudes were 6 21 and 4 55 cm at frequency of 1 934 fig 5 which is 72 and 53 of the hadera iolr station sea level amplitudes respectively nevertheless in both units level fluctuations were in phase with sea level fig 4b unlike the confined units fluctuations in a phreatic were very small amplitudes of 1 cm fig 5 6 6 of sea level amplitudes in unit b level at 60 m from shore was slightly higher than at 40 m average difference of 4 6 cm and amplitudes were on average 44 and 47 respectively of the hadera sea level amplitudes 2009 data filtered to 1 94 d 1 due to the large non tidal fluctuations fig 4c 4 discussion the connection of deep sub aquifers with the sea along the israeli coast was doubted by kolton 1988 and yechieli et al 2009 unit c in dor bay although not very deep top at 30 m 40 m inland could serve as a case study for the existence and location of this connection which could then be applied to other deeper units along the coast assuming horizontal layering of sub surface strata and considering the local bathymetric slope 1 this unit shouldn t be exposed i e breach the seafloor closer than 3 km offshore this will be tested below against the observed tidal amplitudes in this unit on the other hand unit b although confined at the site and seawards is exposed in a patchy way at about one third of the bay and along the ridge seaward land extension that borders the bay on its north fig 1 tidal signals in this unit are compared in the discussion below with confined phreatic and leaky aquifer models to test the applicability of these models to such an irregular coastal aquifer unit in this case fine tuning is allowed due to the availability of three close so shore within 60 m boreholes that intrude and document this unit 4 1 submarine roof extension of the deeper confined unit the deep unit c at dor is apparently completely confined with its top being 30 m deep at the shore fig 2 despite of the above mentioned a priori remote contact with the sea the tidal signal in unit c is relatively strong with amplitudes significantly stronger than in unit b 0 72 and 0 53 of seawater amplitude at 35 m from shore fig 5 and with no lag behind sea level 1 h considering our resolution fig 4b below we investigate the possibility of complete detachment from the sea i e an infinite or far enough offshore extension of the confining layer against a scenario of hydraulic contact at a certain distance offshore a

is blocked at a certain distance from shore by impermeable sediments i e clays as suggested by some authors for the deeper units of the israeli coastal aquifer south of our study site e g kolton 1988 kafri and goldman 2006 nevertheless with this configuration tidal signal would probably look similar to the infinite case or with somewhat weaker amplitudes e g li et al 2007b therefore it seems that unit c has a physical connection with the sea somewhere offshore li and chen 1991 were the first to derive the equations for a confined unit with a roof that extends to a certain distance offshore we

of dor tal et al 2018 we got a surprisingly close to shore 150 m contact with seawater table 1 fig 6 a using higher conductivity 100 m d 1 the distance changes to 380 m offshore fig 7 we also checked an ss value as low as 10 6 cm 1 e g domenico and mifflin 1965 batu 1998 which if used with the higher conductivity of 100 m d 1 as measured by one of the slug tests in the same aquifer unit at ma agan michael 6 km south of dor tal et al 2018 may even yield a contact distance of 1 300 m table 1 and fig 7 on the other hand larger ss e g 10 4 m 1 as used by tal et al 2018 will minimize the roof to less than 100 m considering the lithology involved sandstone mixed with loose sand and the shallow depths we believe that the ss value of 10 5 cm 1 is more reasonable and conclude that unit c is probably exposed to seawater infiltration within 150 400 m from shore identical numbers were derived also when assuming that the shore extends to the end of the roof using the simple solution of jacob 1950 for a confined unit that terminates at the shore and calculating for the onshore distance of the borehole a gw x a sw e Ï ss kt 0 x we note for future studies that two boreholes at different distance from shore could assist in deriving both roof distance offshore and aquifer hydraulic properties see fig 6a we suggest that unlike the above ad hoc assumption of a farther offshore termination the confining clay that separates unit b and c terminates beneath or not far from the submerged n s ridge fig 1 similar to the shallower clay layer that separates the phreatic sand a from unit b fig 8 the sandstone ridge is a fossilized pleistocene dune and the shallow clay was deposited in coastal marshes that abounded in the topographic depressions between the dunes sivan et al 2003 which in turn were covered by holocene sands this is probably also the case with the deeper unit which likewise consists of a calcareous sandstone that was apparently formed under similar environmental conditions accordingly it is suggested that the submerged ridge fig 1 is the locus of succession of older ridges and that also in the past prior to unit b deposition the clay was bounded to a topographic depression at the same location fig 8 as a result in the ridge area there is a direct hydraulic contact between the sandstone units b and c whether or not the deep clay resumes seawards of the ridge should be further studied nevertheless the implications of this close to shore contact are very important to seawater intrusion and aquifer management we note that the above calculations were based on tidal amplitudes from the more open sea conditions of the hadera iolr station 15 km to the south while the amplitudes inside the bay were probably slightly stronger fig 4d nevertheless using the stronger bay level amplitudes will produce a lower agw asw which will result in a roof termination slightly farther offshore 150 m considering the bay s width of ca 150 m this favors the use of the open sea amplitudes 4 2 tidal fluctuation in a partially confined unit although exposed nearby groundwater in unit b clearly behaves the confined way in our observation boreholes with amplitudes much more similar and in phase with those found in the confined unit c than in the phreatic unit a fig 4a b therefore below we investigate into the confinement of this unit using the advantage of its lithological similarity to unit c since unit b is apparently exposed next to shore we first attempted to apply the solution of jacob 1950 for a confined unit with no offshore roof extension a gw x a sw e Ï ss kt 0 x in this solution the ratio agw asw determines the aquifer diffusivity l2t 1 k ss ratios of 0 53 0 47 at 35 40 m from the sea dor 4 and p11 imply relatively low diffusivity values of 18 000 m2day 1 table 2 however the agw asw ratio of 0 44 at 60 m from shore i e relatively small decrease between 40 and 60 m implies larger diffusivity for the same unit 30 000 m2day 1 moreover both diffusivity values are very low and could be achieved only by very low hydraulic conductivity k 1 m day 1 table 2 or by high specific storage 10 3 m 1 these values are very different from the values we used for unit c diffusivity of 2 10 6 m2day 1 table 1 which shares the same lithology with b and are in large disagreement with tests conducted on these rocks k s 20 m day specific storage 10 4 m 1 tal et al 2018 together this could suggest that although partly exposed close to shore the actual contact with seawater that affects the signal occurs farther offshore namely although unit b is partly exposed in the bay fig 1 it may still be treated as a confined layer under the sea alternatively we tried extending the roof of unit b offshore and used li and jiao s 2001 as with the above discussion of unit c since the two confined units share similar lithology and both are shallow we used similar hydraulic properties to those chosen for c i e k 20 m d 1 and ss 10 5 m 1 with these values the desired agw asw 0 53 at 35 m inland is not attained until the roof is extended more than 300 m offshore table 2 fig 7 which is not in accordance with the actual observations full exposures at the submerged ridge 200 m fig 1 and with the above conclusion about the closer exposure of the underlying unit c therefore we assume that the lower amplitudes in unit b compared with c is due to the lower confinement of the first e g trefry and johnston 1998 several papers developed models for a leaky aquifer e g jiao and tang 1999 li and jiao 2001 jeng et al 2002 xia et al 2007 which assume that the confining layer is semi permeable although leakage is not exactly the case at dor bay where the actual case is of patchy exposure it could still give an idea about the roof offshore extension i e where is the main or average hydraulic contact with seawater the equation developed by li and jiao 2001 for this configuration is a g w x a sw c e e p a x where p 1 u 2 u u l s Ï s ls k 1 b 1 is the specific leakage through the confining layer t 1 Ï 2 Ï t 0 t 1 k1 is the hydraulic conductivity of the confining layer lt 1 and b1 is its thickness l also here we used the same parameters chosen for unit c i e k 20 m d 1 and ss 10 5 m 1 amplitudes were then tuned by playing with the hydraulic conductivity of the unknown apparent semi permeable layer k1 although this leaky scenario indeed allowed simulating the amplitude in unit b table 2 the calculated difference between the amplitudes at 40 and 60 m in the 2009 measurements fig 3c was way too large if roof terminates between shore and the submerged ridge 0 150 m table 2 as in unit c above table 1 in general the higher the leakage of the roof i e conductivity of the confining unit the larger the difference between onshore observation points should be see fig 6b the amplitude difference between 40 and 60 m could be achieved only with a leaky roof extending to 300 m from shore table 2 fig 6b but this again is hard to accommodate with the shorter termination of the underlying unit c s roof using different hydraulic properties e g lower conductivity or larger specific storage for both units may change roof length but always results with unit b extending farther offshore than the deeper unit c to conclude our observations at different onshore distances do not accommodate with neither full confinement nor leaky roof for unit b accordingly we suggest that the reason for the relatively low amplitudes in this unit while not big difference between 40 and 60 m from shore is due to its onshore exposure this happens along a n s ridge just 150 m inland of the boreholes but probably more important along the ridge extending in e w direction just 50 m northwest of the observation boreholes fig 1 this large phreatic area that extends seawards from the observation boreholes probably restrains the tidal signal e g nielsen 1990 on the other hand the confinement between the shore and the boreholes still maintains a prominent tidal signal in phase with sea level fluctuations unlike the pattern observed in the phreatic unit a fig 4a b we are not aware of any analytical solutions relating to such a configuration townley 1995 did develop equations that solved for onshore no flow boundary conditions but in this case the boundary was farther offshore from the observation point and not seawards as is the main exposure at dor bay the above is supported by observations from a coastal site 6 km south of dor bay tal et al 2017 2018 which shares a very similar stratigraphy at this site a similar unit b is well confined until 300 m offshore and 300 m inland accordingly and unlike dor bay amplitudes in unit b are stronger than in unit c which is probably the combined result of unit b s confined configuration and of unit c s roof extending farther offshore we conclude that the partly phreatic nature of unit b at dor bay results in the damping of its tidal amplitudes the above discussion of unit b suggests that coastal exposures of shallow confined units may have significant impact on groundwater tidal signal which is similar to that developed in an offshore leaky aquifers this could result in wrong conclusions about either the offshore extension or the hydraulic parameters of the studied aquifer distinction between the two could be inferred by investigation of the tidal signal along a close to shore transect of observation boreholes 5 summary and conclusions tidal data from next to shore boreholes provided insight into the relations of a multi unit coastal aquifer with the sea both confined units share the same lithology which facilitated constraining their hydraulic properties the strong tidal signal an amplitude 70 that of seawater in the deeper 30 m unit c cannot be supported only by loading rather it is a clear indication of hydraulic connection with seawater not far from shore based on equations developed by li and jiao 2001 we calculated a relatively short 150 400 m termination of unit c s confining roof which is unexpected considering its roof s depth and which is highly important to the aquifer management this probably reflects on paleo coastal geomorphology e g the location of a buried ridge that marked the seaward edge of the confining clay layer coastal exposures of the shallower unit b result in weaker tidal amplitudes than in the deeper unit c common solutions used for either completely confined or for leaky aquifers could not be adequately applied to this unit this highlights the importance of characterizing coastal exposures of confined aquifers prior to the application of various leaky aquifer models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

infiltration and loading stress were considered in general the higher the hydraulic conductivity and the lower the specific storage the stronger the groundwater tidal amplitudes are it was also shown that with a long offshore roof extension one can assume an infinite extension and that with a relatively short extension one can use jacob s solution with the coast line displaced to where the roof ends li and jiao 2001 the effect of a leaky roof semi permeable is in general of decreasing groundwater table amplitudes with increasing roof permeability leakage although in the low leakage end low hydraulic conductivity there is first an increase in amplitude with increasing leakage and then pattern changes to a decreasing amplitude li and jiao 2001 in recent years there were several studies of multi layered aquifers mainly of the phreatic semipermeable confined configuration e g guo et al 2007 xia et al 2007 chuang and yeh 2011 nevertheless multi confined aquifers were hardly studied e g bresciani et al 2015a b this paper presents research into a complexed coastal aquifer which includes both a shallow partly confined unit that is exposed to seawater infiltration close to shore and a deep fully confined unit whose connection with the sea is not observed both the effect of partial confinement in the shallow unit and the connection of the deep unit with the sea are investigated by means of tidal fluctuations with the advantage of the two units sharing the same lithology and of having very close to shore observation boreholes 1 1 study site and hydrogeology the study site is located at dor bay the southern carmel coast northern israel fig 1 where a quaternary coastal aquifer about 50 m thick is underlain by cretaceous marls the quaternary aquifer is sub divided into three sub aquifers separated by thin 1 to 3 m thick clay units including a few m thick phreatic holocene sand unit which is underlain by two confined units of mixed calcareous sandstone and sand b and c fig 2 at 30 40 m from the bay the roofs of the confined units are at 4 5 and 29 31 mbsl and their thicknesses are 23 and 18 m respectively fig 2 the top of unit b is highly irregular forming ridges and depressions with the latter covered by a shallow clay unit and the phreatic sand unit a fig 3 at the study site unit b is partly exposed close to the shore 20 30 m offshore in the bay as well as along an e w ridge that borders the bay just north of the site fig 1 and is fully exposed 120 150 m offshore where it creates a submerged n s ridge parallel to shore figs 1 and 3 the offshore extension of the clay layer that separates unit b and unit c i e the location where unit c s roof terminates and is exposed to seawater infiltration is unknown in this paper we discuss the progression of the tidal signal in both units and use it to address the question of where does unit c connect with the sea in both confined units a fresh saline water interface was identified separating top slightly brackish water ec 5 ms cm 1 from bottom saline water we note that the salinity of unit c bottom water is similar to that of seawater 55 ms cm 1 while in unit b the conductivity of bottom water is 40 ms cm 1 2 methods the main body of level measurements reported in this study was taken during may sept 2012 total of 147 days in three boreholes drilled 35 m from the sea 30 40 m during high and low tide respectively two of these boreholes are opened to the confined units b and c dor 4 and dor 3 respectively figs 1 and 2 and the third dor 5 is opened to the superficial phreatic unit a we also report about measurements between feb apr 2009 conducted in two other boreholes p11 and p21 opened to unit b at 40 and 60 m from the sea groundwater levels were measured by eijkelkamp and solinst mini divers 1 h resolution fluctuation time series are shown in fig 4 a c full data could be found in the supplementary information together with sea level which was measured 2 km offshore 15 km south of dor bay the hadera iolr station we note that tidal fluctuations in the bay are in phase with those measured in the open sea as shown in fig 4d although amplitudes are usually slightly stronger in the bay therefore the agw asw ratios reported below should be regarded as maximum values 3 results dor bay levels and tidal fluctuations groundwater level in unit c was on average 54 and 58 cm higher than in units b and a respectively averages of 106 52 and 48 cm above sea level during may sept 2012 respectively fig 4a and app 1 which suggests that units b and c are hydraulically disconnected groundwater level in both units nicely correlated with the hadera iolr station sea level and showed typical bi daily daily and bi monthly tidal frequencies with clear dominance of the first in the confined units figs 4a b and 5 this was superimposed on long term trends e g low levels during may through june app 1 and level decrease between july and september 2012 fig 4a groundwater bi daily fluctuations were significantly weaker than those observed in sea level with those in c stronger than in b the may sept average of the bi daily amplitudes were 6 21 and 4 55 cm at frequency of 1 934 fig 5 which is 72 and 53 of the hadera iolr station sea level amplitudes respectively nevertheless in both units level fluctuations were in phase with sea level fig 4b unlike the confined units fluctuations in a phreatic were very small amplitudes of 1 cm fig 5 6 6 of sea level amplitudes in unit b level at 60 m from shore was slightly higher than at 40 m average difference of 4 6 cm and amplitudes were on average 44 and 47 respectively of the hadera sea level amplitudes 2009 data filtered to 1 94 d 1 due to the large non tidal fluctuations fig 4c 4 discussion the connection of deep sub aquifers with the sea along the israeli coast was doubted by kolton 1988 and yechieli et al 2009 unit c in dor bay although not very deep top at 30 m 40 m inland could serve as a case study for the existence and location of this connection which could then be applied to other deeper units along the coast assuming horizontal layering of sub surface strata and considering the local bathymetric slope 1 this unit shouldn t be exposed i e breach the seafloor closer than 3 km offshore this will be tested below against the observed tidal amplitudes in this unit on the other hand unit b although confined at the site and seawards is exposed in a patchy way at about one third of the bay and along the ridge seaward land extension that borders the bay on its north fig 1 tidal signals in this unit are compared in the discussion below with confined phreatic and leaky aquifer models to test the applicability of these models to such an irregular coastal aquifer unit in this case fine tuning is allowed due to the availability of three close so shore within 60 m boreholes that intrude and document this unit 4 1 submarine roof extension of the deeper confined unit the deep unit c at dor is apparently completely confined with its top being 30 m deep at the shore fig 2 despite of the above mentioned a priori remote contact with the sea the tidal signal in unit c is relatively strong with amplitudes significantly stronger than in unit b 0 72 and 0 53 of seawater amplitude at 35 m from shore fig 5 and with no lag behind sea level 1 h considering our resolution fig 4b below we investigate the possibility of complete detachment from the sea i e an infinite or far enough offshore extension of the confining layer against a scenario of hydraulic contact at a certain distance offshore a

is blocked at a certain distance from shore by impermeable sediments i e clays as suggested by some authors for the deeper units of the israeli coastal aquifer south of our study site e g kolton 1988 kafri and goldman 2006 nevertheless with this configuration tidal signal would probably look similar to the infinite case or with somewhat weaker amplitudes e g li et al 2007b therefore it seems that unit c has a physical connection with the sea somewhere offshore li and chen 1991 were the first to derive the equations for a confined unit with a roof that extends to a certain distance offshore we used an updated version that of li and jiao 2001 to find the roof offshore extension in their solution simplified for a no leakage case the confined unit groundwater amplitude is a g w x a sw c e e a

of dor tal et al 2018 we got a surprisingly close to shore 150 m contact with seawater table 1 fig 6 a using higher conductivity 100 m d 1 the distance changes to 380 m offshore fig 7 we also checked an ss value as low as 10 6 cm 1 e g domenico and mifflin 1965 batu 1998 which if used with the higher conductivity of 100 m d 1 as measured by one of the slug tests in the same aquifer unit at ma agan michael 6 km south of dor tal et al 2018 may even yield a contact distance of 1 300 m table 1 and fig 7 on the other hand larger ss e g 10 4 m 1 as used by tal et al 2018 will minimize the roof to less than 100 m considering the lithology involved sandstone mixed with loose sand and the shallow depths we believe that the ss value of 10 5 cm 1 is more reasonable and conclude that unit c is probably exposed to seawater infiltration within 150 400 m from shore identical numbers were derived also when assuming that the shore extends to the end of the roof using the simple solution of jacob 1950 for a confined unit that terminates at the shore and calculating for the onshore distance of the borehole a gw x a sw e Ï ss kt 0 x we note for future studies that two boreholes at different distance from shore could assist in deriving both roof distance offshore and aquifer hydraulic properties see fig 6a we suggest that unlike the above ad hoc assumption of a farther offshore termination the confining clay that separates unit b and c terminates beneath or not far from the submerged n s ridge fig 1 similar to the shallower clay layer that separates the phreatic sand a from unit b fig 8 the sandstone ridge is a fossilized pleistocene dune and the shallow clay was deposited in coastal marshes that abounded in the topographic depressions between the dunes sivan et al 2003 which in turn were covered by holocene sands this is probably also the case with the deeper unit which likewise consists of a calcareous sandstone that was apparently formed under similar environmental conditions accordingly it is suggested that the submerged ridge fig 1 is the locus of succession of older ridges and that also in the past prior to unit b deposition the clay was bounded to a topographic depression at the same location fig 8 as a result in the ridge area there is a direct hydraulic contact between the sandstone units b and c whether or not the deep clay resumes seawards of the ridge should be further studied nevertheless the implications of this close to shore contact are very important to seawater intrusion and aquifer management we note that the above calculations were based on tidal amplitudes from the more open sea conditions of the hadera iolr station 15 km to the south while the amplitudes inside the bay were probably slightly stronger fig 4d nevertheless using the stronger bay level amplitudes will produce a lower agw asw which will result in a roof termination slightly farther offshore 150 m considering the bay s width of ca 150 m this favors the use of the open sea amplitudes 4 2 tidal fluctuation in a partially confined unit although exposed nearby groundwater in unit b clearly behaves the confined way in our observation boreholes with amplitudes much more similar and in phase with those found in the confined unit c than in the phreatic unit a fig 4a b therefore below we investigate into the confinement of this unit using the advantage of its lithological similarity to unit c since unit b is apparently exposed next to shore we first attempted to apply the solution of jacob 1950 for a confined unit with no offshore roof extension a gw x a sw e Ï ss kt 0 x in this solution the ratio agw asw determines the aquifer diffusivity l2t 1 k ss ratios of 0 53 0 47 at 35 40 m from the sea dor 4 and p11 imply relatively low diffusivity values of 18 000 m2day 1 table 2 however the agw asw ratio of 0 44 at 60 m from shore i e relatively small decrease between 40 and 60 m implies larger diffusivity for the same unit 30 000 m2day 1 moreover both diffusivity values are very low and could be achieved only by very low hydraulic conductivity k 1 m day 1 table 2 or by high specific storage 10 3 m 1 these values are very different from the values we used for unit c diffusivity of 2 10 6 m2day 1 table 1 which shares the same lithology with b and are in large disagreement with tests conducted on these rocks k s 20 m day specific storage 10 4 m 1 tal et al 2018 together this could suggest that although partly exposed close to shore the actual contact with seawater that affects the signal occurs farther offshore namely although unit b is partly exposed in the bay fig 1 it may still be treated as a confined layer under the sea alternatively we tried extending the roof of unit b offshore and used li and jiao s 2001 as with the above discussion of unit c since the two confined units share similar lithology and both are shallow we used similar hydraulic properties to those chosen for c i e k 20 m d 1 and ss 10 5 m 1 with these values the desired agw asw 0 53 at 35 m inland is not attained until the roof is extended more than 300 m offshore table 2 fig 7 which is not in accordance with the actual observations full exposures at the submerged ridge 200 m fig 1 and with the above conclusion about the closer exposure of the underlying unit c therefore we assume that the lower amplitudes in unit b compared with c is due to the lower confinement of the first e g trefry and johnston 1998 several papers developed models for a leaky aquifer e g jiao and tang 1999 li and jiao 2001 jeng et al 2002 xia et al 2007 which assume that the confining layer is semi permeable although leakage is not exactly the case at dor bay where the actual case is of patchy exposure it could still give an idea about the roof offshore extension i e where is the main or average hydraulic contact with seawater the equation developed by li and jiao 2001 for this configuration is a g w x a sw c e e p a x where p 1 u 2 u u l s Ï s ls k 1 b 1 is the specific leakage through the confining layer t 1 Ï 2 Ï t 0 t 1 k1 is the hydraulic conductivity of the confining layer lt 1 and b1 is its thickness l also here we used the same parameters chosen for unit c i e k 20 m d 1 and ss 10 5 m 1 amplitudes were then tuned by playing with the hydraulic conductivity of the unknown apparent semi permeable layer k1 although this leaky scenario indeed allowed simulating the amplitude in unit b table 2 the calculated difference between the amplitudes at 40 and 60 m in the 2009 measurements fig 3c was way too large if roof terminates between shore and the submerged ridge 0 150 m table 2 as in unit c above table 1 in general the higher the leakage of the roof i e conductivity of the confining unit the larger the difference between onshore observation points should be see fig 6b the amplitude difference between 40 and 60 m could be achieved only with a leaky roof extending to 300 m from shore table 2 fig 6b but this again is hard to accommodate with the shorter termination of the underlying unit c s roof using different hydraulic properties e g lower conductivity or larger specific storage for both units may change roof length but always results with unit b extending farther offshore than the deeper unit c to conclude our observations at different onshore distances do not accommodate with neither full confinement nor leaky roof for unit b accordingly we suggest that the reason for the relatively low amplitudes in this unit while not big difference between 40 and 60 m from shore is due to its onshore exposure this happens along a n s ridge just 150 m inland of the boreholes but probably more important along the ridge extending in e w direction just 50 m northwest of the observation boreholes fig 1 this large phreatic area that extends seawards from the observation boreholes probably restrains the tidal signal e g nielsen 1990 on the other hand the confinement between the shore and the boreholes still maintains a prominent tidal signal in phase with sea level fluctuations unlike the pattern observed in the phreatic unit a fig 4a b we are not aware of any analytical solutions relating to such a configuration townley 1995 did develop equations that solved for onshore no flow boundary conditions but in this case the boundary was farther offshore from the observation point and not seawards as is the main exposure at dor bay the above is supported by observations from a coastal site 6 km south of dor bay tal et al 2017 2018 which shares a very similar stratigraphy at this site a similar unit b is well confined until 300 m offshore and 300 m inland accordingly and unlike dor bay amplitudes in unit b are stronger than in unit c which is probably the combined result of unit b s confined configuration and of unit c s roof extending farther offshore we conclude that the partly phreatic nature of unit b at dor bay results in the damping of its tidal amplitudes the above discussion of unit b suggests that coastal exposures of shallow confined units may have significant impact on groundwater tidal signal which is similar to that developed in an offshore leaky aquifers this could result in wrong conclusions about either the offshore extension or the hydraulic parameters of the studied aquifer distinction between the two could be inferred by investigation of the tidal signal along a close to shore transect of observation boreholes 5 summary and conclusions tidal data from next to shore boreholes provided insight into the relations of a multi unit coastal aquifer with the sea both confined units share the same lithology which facilitated constraining their hydraulic properties the strong tidal signal an amplitude 70 that of seawater in the deeper 30 m unit c cannot be supported only by loading rather it is a clear indication of hydraulic connection with seawater not far from shore based on equations developed by li and jiao 2001 we calculated a relatively short 150 400 m termination of unit c s confining roof which is unexpected considering its roof s depth and which is highly important to the aquifer management this probably reflects on paleo coastal geomorphology e g the location of a buried ridge that marked the seaward edge of the confining clay layer coastal exposures of the shallower unit b result in weaker tidal amplitudes than in the deeper unit c common solutions used for either completely confined or for leaky aquifers could not be adequately applied to this unit this highlights the importance of characterizing coastal exposures of

5958,the article studies axi symmetric suspension and nano colloidal transport with size distributed fines in subterranean reservoirs and presents non monotonic behaviour of the particle retention profiles rps first we introduce the averaging upscaling of the governing system for groundwater with fines over the probabilistic particle size distribution and use the analytical model for linear one dimensional flows to match the laboratory experiments one set of four tests provides breakthrough curves and post mortem retention profiles the results are closely matched another test gives retention profiles in three moments high match was achieved for two moments in all tests the number of degrees of freedom of the experimental data array is higher than the number of tuned model parameters therefore the close match validates the mathematical model subsequently we develop an upscaling procedure for axisymmetric flow providing the transport equations for averaged particle population next we solve the upscaled equations for suspension injection into a vertical well numerically it was found out that the radial flows exhibit non monotonic retention profiles nrps the upscaled equations

polyanin and manzhirov 2006 however non monotonic profiles of retained fine particles have been widely reported in the literature bradford et al 2006 bradford et al 2011 goldberg et al 2014 li et al

physics justification for the x dependency of the filtration function h x s is required goldberg et al 2014 the two particle speed approach to model nrps was undertaken by bradford et al 2011 and yuan and shapiro 2011 where the particle velocity is high in the pore centres and low near the grain walls the dispersivity Î±l for such systems has the same order of magnitude as the pore length consequently the peclet s number l Î±l has an order of magnitude of 103 105 i e the suspension concentrations of slow and fast particles become equal during the period that is negligibly smaller than the time of one pore volume injected pvi polyanin and dil man 1994 therefore two speed equations almost instantly tend to the single population transport model with the average low velocity which exhibits only monotonic rps oliveira et al 2014 yang et al 2016 recently non monotonic retention profiles nrps have been successfully matched by the upscaled multi component suspension colloidal transport model malgaresi et al 2019 here post mortem rps taken at the moment when the test is finished along with the breakthrough histories have been matched yet a model validation requires more than just a successful match a reliable prediction is essential moreover the timely evolution of retention profiles measured during suspension colloidal flow is available in the literature wang et al 2010 however the model was validated only by matching ofnon monotonic retention profiles where the multi dimension experimental data array is tuned using just few model constants the following predictions have not been performed usually the injected suspensions and colloids causing injectivity decline have wide particle size distributions wide particle size distributions have been reported

rabinovich et al 2013 rosenbrand et al 2014 the mobilised fines causing well productivity and injectivity impairment also have sizes distributed in wide ranges however the upscaled model for axi symmetric flow of size distributed colloids is not available in the current paper using analytical model for 1d linear x t flows we provide a close matching of six laboratory tests on colloidal suspension nano transport the number of degrees of freedom of the experimental data array is higher than the number of tuned model parameters for all tests which validates the model we derive upscaled governing equations for radial flows the corresponding numerical model exhibits nrps around the vertical well during the injection the upscaled governing equations allow predicting the well injectivity decline using the tuned laboratory based model parameters for binary two sized suspension stabilised rp monotonically increases from the wellbore toward the reservoir while it stabilises

governing equations for 3d flows section 2 2 2 1 assumptions of the model fig 1 shows the schematic for colloidal suspension flow of large and small particles with particle capture by the rock the particles are suspended in the carrier groundwater attached to the rock and adsorbed on the rock surface the attachment kinetics depends on the suspended and attached concentrations like in eq 2 the particles are suspended in the carrier groundwater attached to the rock and adsorbed on the rock surface the attachment kinetics depends on the suspended and attached concentrations like in eq 2 and on the flow velocity u under thermodynamic equilibrium the adsorbed concentration is determined by the suspended concentration via the sorption isotherm here we assume that the relaxation time of the adsorption kinetics is significantly smaller that the time of one pore volume injection for small time t the rate of non equilibrium adsorption is independent of velocity which is not the thermodynamic variable so the retention rate cannot be expressed via a thermodynamic potential therefore yerramilli et al 2014 and farajzadeh et al 2016 consider attachment and sorption as independent particle capture processes the fines attach and adsorb on different rock surface sites so there is no competition between the suspended particles for attachment and adsorption the model considers final particle sizes and a fraction of the pore volume inaccessible to the particles consequently the particles are transported only via Î· th fraction of the porous space and the carrier water flux through the accessible space is fraction Î± of the overall flux through the porous medium particle free water fills the inaccessible pores and flows through them we assume that Î· Î± and Î³ are constant it is assumed that the overall volume of suspended attached and adsorbed particles does not change during attachment and sorption this assumption includes incompressibility of the particles and water and the amagat s law for volume additivity bedrikovetsky 2013 if volumetric particle concentrations are negligibly small compared with the rock porosity the same equations are valid even if amagat s law is not fulfilled for the water rock particles system here we discuss large scale approximation where the advective flux of particles significantly exceeds the dispersive diffusive flux i e the model is diffusion free barenblatt et al 1989 polyanin and dil man 1994 the relaxation time of non equilibrium sorption is significantly lower than the time of one pore volume injection so equilibrium sorption is assumed we consider henry s sorption isotherm where the proportionality coefficient between the adsorbed and suspended concentrations is independent of the particle size 2 2 2 2 governing equations for 3d multi component suspension colloidal flows consider 3d transport of the fine particles that can be attached to the rock surface and adsorb on this surface the suspended

in a glass column with diameter 2 5 cm and length 15 cm packed with ottawa sand two artificial porous media with different sand sizes had pore radii rp 9 6 and 12 7 Î¼m five pvis of 3 ppm suspension of fullerene nc60 nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 120 nm were injected into a porous column containing an aqueous solution of 1 mm cacl2 and 0 065 mm nahco3 particle size varied from 92 nm to 124 nm in each porous media the injection was carried out with two velocities u 9 27 10 5 m s and u 1 20 10 5 m s so altogether four tests have been performed fig 3a shows breakthrough curves btcs fig 3b presents four rps and nrps are observed in four tests li et al 2008 used the mathematical model for single size particles 1 2 with langmuir blocking formation damage function 30 for matching therefore all four matched rps were monotonically decreasing fig 3a shows the match of four btcs by the upscaled model 16 18 for binary colloidal flow the tuning of five model coefficients Î»1 Î»2 b1

least square deviation between the laboratory and modelling data coleman and li 1996 zhou et al 2017 the tuned values of individual occupation areas b1 and b2 presented in the second line of table 1 provide relatively fast retention and occupation the filtration function h s decreases fast so the breakthrough concentration already at t 2 3 pvi becomes significantly higher than the breakthrough concentration c 1 1 that corresponds to initial value of the filtration function h 0 therefore the concentration c 1 1 at the moment of front arrival cannot be distinguished in the graph in fig 3a however zoom in fig 3a exhibits concentration jumps at the moment of front arrival fig 3b presents the match of four rps by the upscaled model for all four tests the model 16 18 reproduces nrps table

rc 2 columns eleven and twelve in table 1 alvarez et al 2007 show that small variation of filtration function h s yields small variation of rp while the btc s variation can be quite substantial it explains significantly more precise match of the rps than that for btcs for flow in two identical sand packs with two different velocities the values of filtration coefficient for large fines are higher than those for small fines the values in sixth column in lines 3 6 are higher than those in fifth column for the core length l 0 15 m the dimensional filtration coefficient Î» l varies from 56

concentration of small particles in the injected colloid is almost the same for the four tests it is expected that the higher is the velocity the lower is the filtration coefficient for attachment this is the case for small particles in both media fifth column and for large particles in the rock with 9 6 mm pores sixth column for large particles in the rock with 12 7 Î¼m pores sixth column this is not the case yet two values of filtration coefficient are almost the same the expected independence of individual occupation areas of velocities has not been observed the phenomenon could be explained by non ideal packing procedure or by low accuracy in the approximation of the injected suspension by binary mixture btcs in fig 3a can be approximated by quadratic parabolas with three free

the attempt to match the data by the traditional model 1 2 was unsuccessful btcs have not been measured due to low particle concentrations in the effluent water fig 4a shows only the threshold of

parameters obtained by matching the laboratory data presented in fig 4 the tuned model parameters are presented in the sixth line of table 1 fig 5 a presents the rp dynamics for the overall binary suspension rp monotonically decreases at the moment t1 non monotonic wave appears near the wellbore at the moment t2 zoom clearly shows this occurrence propagation of nrp into the reservoir continues at the moments t3 and t4 the rp asymptotically stabilises behind the pulse the rps at moments t3 and t4 behind the pulse almost coincide when time tends to infinity the stabilised rp monotonically increases fig 5b shows the results of downscaling i e the rps for small and large particles red and blue curves respectively like in the linear flow small particles exhibit non monotonic behaviour of rps rps for both populations monotonically decrease at the beginning of injection t t1 the rp for large particles always remains monotonically decreasing the small particle rp becomes non monotonic at

small particles b2 the less particles occupy the overall rock surface in the stabilised state and the lower is located the stabilised rp the figure shows that rp stabilisation occurs near to the injection well with the fixed number of injected particles at the moment t3 the lower stabilised attached concentration results in faster propagation of the pulse front fig 6b shows that the higher is the b2 the lower number of particles populate the surface under the stabilisation and the lower is the impedance three retention profiles almost coincide during the monotonic stage for first two moments and significantly deviate from each other during non monotonic period fig 6c shows that the higher is the fraction of small particles in the injected suspension more particles populate the overall rock surface at the stabilised state so the stabilisation value of rp is higher the rps stabilise near to the injection wellbore so the pulse propagation speed is lower consequently the impedance is higher fig 6d fig 6e shows that the higher is the filtration coefficient for small particles Î»2 the faster they attach the higher is the small particle fraction in the total retained concentration the more particles populate the rock at the stabilised state so since more particles are attached as Î»2 increases the impedance increases fig 6f 7 discussion and summary in the last two decades spatial and probabilistic averaging upscaling of transport in micro heterogeneous subterranean reservoirs has been highly developed producing effective large scale transport equations boso and tartakovsky 2016 dagan et al 2013 fiori et al 2015 hilpert and johnson 2018 rabinovich et al 2013 tartakovsky et al 2017 winter and tartakovsky 2002 we focus on an important particular case of uncorrelated stochastic properties which corresponds to zero dispersivity of the micro scale system dagan et al 2013 efendiev et al 2016 rabinovich 2017 in this text we use both terms upscaling and averaging averaging upscaling of suspension transport with size distributed particles the governing system for n component suspension consists of 2 n equations 23 24 yielding extremely computer time consuming calculations the way around this problem is averaging over the particle size distribution resulting in single population equations this procedure was developed in bedrikovetsky et al 2019 for 1d linear flows x t however this paper focus on axi symmetric flow for injection into vertical wells consequently appendix f derives the exact upscaling for radial n component flows r t yielding the large scale 3 3 system 26 28 if compared with linear flow upscaled model 16 18 the upscaled system for axi symmetric flows 26 28 contains the cross sectional area 2 xwx 1 2 in denominators of kinetic rates given by eqs 27 28 this corresponds to radial flow during the injection where the area of cross section is equal to 2Ïr non monotonic retention profiles we derived an upscaled system for 1d axi symmetric flows the main feature of the solution are non monotonic retention profiles the solution allows exhibiting time evolution of the rps for the overall suspension and its small particles all profiles are monotonically declining at the beginning of injection then rps for overall suspension and small particles translates into non monotonic asymptotically both profiles stabilise at increasing curves rps for large particles remain monotonically declining non monotonic behaviour of rps occurs for the following relationships between the filtration coefficients and individual occupation areas Î» 1 Î»2 b1 b2 it is typical that attachment of larger particles occurs faster therefore non monotonic rps are rule rather than exception quasi 3d flows in the damage free case where permeability is not affected by attached and adsorbed particles eqs 11 separate from the rest of the governing system and yield laplace equation for pressure p x1 x2 x3 t solution of laplace equation and eq 10 determines flux u so flux in eqs 7 8 and 12 13 becomes a known vector function and system 7 8 of 2 n equations determine 2 n unknowns ck and sk k 1 2 n introduction of areal coordinate along streamlines and two transversal coordinates reduces 3d problem to 1d with one areal coordinate along the streamlines bedrikovetsky 2013 polyanin and lychev 2016 the upscaling procedure presented in appendix f for axi symmetric flow and in appendix b for linear flow can be extended for 3d damage free flows integration in characteristic form of the governing equations f 1 f 2 uses coordinate x1 along the streamlines the resulting 3d system of three equations contains jacobian of streamline transformation in denominator of expressions for attaching and site occupation rates in eqs 28 and 27 respectively validation of the upscaled model we validate the averaged equations 16 18 by comparison with two sets of laboratory data the first set contains four tests exhibiting btcs and post mortem rps high match has been achieved for all tests dimension of the experimental data array for each test was at least seven while five model parameters have been tuned the high match allows claiming validity of the model 7 8 yet the model matches rps with higher accuracy than it matches btcs the coefficient of determination in twelfth column of table 1 is higher than r2 in the eleventh column small perturbations of filtration function h s yield significantly higher variations in btc s than in rp s alvarez et al 2005 alvarez et al 2007 therefore bt data are usually scattered significantly higher than the data on rps consequently the inverse problem for determination of h s from rp data is well posed while treating btcs yields ill posed inverse problems and require regularization the above speculations explain better matches of rps than those of btcs another experimental set contains injection of nps in three identical engineered porous media the rps are presented at three moments the tests exhibit the same scenario that is predicted by the upscaled model fig 4b shows monotonically declining rp at t 5 pvi non monotonic pulse at t 32 pvi and stabilisation of monotonically increasing rp behind the pulse at t 65 pvi the retention profiles provide at least eight dimensional array of laboratory data so successful match allows claiming the model validity the deviation in the second section of the core at the third moment can be explained by inhomogeneous packing of sand in the artificial core another explanation could be insufficient approximation of the injected colloid by a binary mixture the ternary mixture model would be more precise three modelling predicted btcs for all cores are below the particle counter resolution supporting the experimental observation that the particles do not appear in the effluent during the three tests the model limitations the kinetics of particle capture given by eq 18 is a generalisation of langmuir s blocking which is typical for particle attachment by the rock from the groundwater flux however size exclusion of mono sized particles in two pore sized media where the particles plug small pores and pass through large pores corresponds to linear langmuir filtration function bedrikovetsky 2008 for n particle sized suspension the filtration function h monotonically increases with respect to individual retention concentrations sk as does function h in eqs 8 and 13 approximation of size exclusion filtration function by formula used in eqs 17 18 and applying the upscaled model 16 18 for size exclusion and straining is a topic of forthcoming work we assume that inaccessible pore volume is comparable with the overall pore volume and the flux through the inaccessible pore volume is comparable with the overall flux however we assume that the differences between the accessibility factors for different populations are negligibly small if compared with the average Î· value the same corresponds to flux reduction factor Î± and henry s sorption coefficient Î³ therefore Î· Î± and Î³ are assumed to be constant in the model given by eq 7 which are the limitations of the model eqs 16 18 are valid for particles distributed by other parameters rather than size like surface charge zeta potential density shape etc yet so far we found laboratory data on deep bed filtration of particles distributed only by size 8 conclusions exact upscaling averaging of axi symmetric suspension colloidal nano transport with size distributed particles and analytical modelling of 1d flows allow concluding as follows suspension colloidal axi symmetric transport of size distributed particles corresponding to constant composition injection allows for upscaling the upscaled 3 3 system consists of mass balance equation and two kinetics equations for particle attachment and site occupation where the attachment and site occupation rates depend on radius total rps during injection of binary colloid or suspension where larger particles occupy larger areas monotonically decrease at the beginning of injection and with time translates to non monotonic curves by the time rp asymptotically tends to monotonically increasing stabilised curve rp for small particles also monotonically decrease at the beginning of injection with time the rp translates to non monotonic curve and then it tends to monotonically increasing profile as time tends to infinity rps for large particles remain monotonically decreasing during the overall injection period the numerical solution of the axi symmetric binary colloid flow problem corresponding to the injection of constant composition suspension into a vertical well exhibits monotonically increasing stabilised rp while for mono size colloid the stabilised rp is uniform the numerical solution allows calculating well injectivity decline during the colloidal suspension nano injection which permits for planning the well stimulation procedures the solution also calculates the damaged zone size which determines the volume of acid to be injected during well acidizing and perforation length for well re perforation

5958,the article studies axi symmetric suspension and nano colloidal transport with size distributed fines in subterranean reservoirs and presents non monotonic behaviour of the particle retention profiles rps first we introduce the averaging upscaling of the governing system for groundwater with fines over the probabilistic particle size distribution and use the analytical model for linear one dimensional flows to match the laboratory experiments one set of four tests provides breakthrough curves and post mortem retention profiles the results are closely matched another test gives retention profiles in three moments high match was achieved for two moments in all tests the number of degrees of freedom of the experimental data array is higher than the number of tuned model parameters therefore the close match validates the mathematical model subsequently we develop an upscaling procedure for axisymmetric flow providing the transport equations for averaged particle population next we solve the upscaled equations for suspension injection into a vertical well numerically it was found out that the radial flows exhibit non monotonic retention profiles nrps the upscaled equations

bedrikovetsky 2008 the flux reduction factor is the fraction of the overall flux that passes through the accessible porous space the initial boundary conditions for the constant concentration colloid injection into a clean bed are 4 t 0 c s 0 x 0 c c 0 where c0 is particle concentration in the injected suspension the mathematical models for suspension colloidal transport in porous media including the one given by eqs 1 3 exhibit monotonically decreasing retention profiles during colloidal suspension injection into clean bed bradford et al 2006 bradford et al 2011 polyanin and zaitsev 2012 polyanin and manzhirov 2006 however non monotonic profiles of retained fine particles have been widely reported in the literature bradford et al 2006 bradford et al 2011 goldberg et al 2014 li et al 2008 wang et al 2010 yuan and shapiro 2011 bradford et al 2006 introduced depth dependency of the filtration function h x s in eq 2 the model reproduces non monotonic retention profiles nrps yet more physics justification for the x dependency of the filtration function h x s is required goldberg et al 2014 the two particle speed approach to model nrps was undertaken by bradford et al 2011 and yuan and shapiro 2011 where the particle velocity is high in the pore centres and low near the grain walls the dispersivity Î±l for such systems has the same order of magnitude as the pore length consequently the peclet s number l Î±l has an order of magnitude of 103 105 i e the suspension concentrations of slow and fast particles become equal during the period that is negligibly smaller than the time of one pore volume injected pvi polyanin and dil man 1994 therefore two speed equations almost instantly tend to the single population transport model with the average low velocity which exhibits only monotonic rps oliveira et al 2014 yang et al 2016 recently non monotonic retention profiles nrps have been successfully matched by the upscaled multi component suspension colloidal transport model malgaresi et al 2019 here post mortem rps taken at the moment when the test is finished along with the breakthrough histories have been matched yet a model validation requires more than just a successful match a reliable prediction is essential moreover the timely evolution of retention profiles measured during suspension colloidal flow is available in the literature wang et al 2010 however the model was validated only by matching ofnon monotonic retention profiles where the multi dimension experimental data array is tuned using just few model constants the following predictions have not been performed usually the injected suspensions and colloids causing injectivity decline have wide particle size distributions wide particle size distributions have been reported in numerous water management and injection projects including low salinity water storage in aquifers enhanced geothermal developments and waterflooding in oilfields civan 2015 rabinovich et al 2015 rabinovich et al 2013 rosenbrand et al 2014 the mobilised fines causing well productivity and injectivity impairment also have sizes distributed in wide ranges however the upscaled model for axi symmetric flow of size distributed colloids is not available in the current paper using analytical model for 1d linear x t flows we provide a close matching of six laboratory tests on colloidal suspension nano transport the number of degrees of freedom of the experimental data array is higher than the number of tuned model parameters for all tests which validates the model we derive upscaled governing equations for radial flows the corresponding numerical model exhibits nrps around the vertical well during the injection the upscaled governing equations allow predicting the well injectivity decline using the tuned laboratory based model parameters for binary two sized suspension stabilised rp monotonically increases from the wellbore toward the reservoir while it stabilises uniformly during the injection of mono size suspension the upscaled model provides the formula to predict the damaged zone size which is a valuable information for well stimulation the structure of

governing equations for 3d flows section 2 2 2 1 assumptions of the model fig 1 shows the schematic for colloidal suspension flow of large and small particles with particle capture by the rock the particles are suspended in the carrier groundwater attached to the rock and adsorbed on the rock surface the attachment kinetics depends on the suspended and attached concentrations like in eq 2 the particles are suspended in the carrier groundwater attached to the rock and adsorbed on the rock surface the attachment kinetics depends on the suspended and attached concentrations like in eq 2 and on the flow velocity u under thermodynamic equilibrium the adsorbed concentration is determined by the suspended concentration via the sorption isotherm here we assume that the relaxation time of the adsorption kinetics is significantly smaller that the time of one pore volume injection for small time t the rate of non equilibrium adsorption is independent of velocity which is not the thermodynamic variable so the retention rate cannot be expressed via a thermodynamic potential therefore yerramilli et al 2014 and farajzadeh et al 2016 consider attachment and sorption as independent particle capture processes the fines attach and adsorb on different rock surface sites so there is no competition between the suspended particles for attachment and adsorption the model considers final particle sizes and a fraction of the pore volume inaccessible to the particles consequently the particles are transported only via Î· th fraction of the porous space and the carrier water flux through the accessible space is fraction Î± of the overall flux through the porous medium particle free water fills the inaccessible pores and flows through them we assume that Î· Î± and Î³ are constant it is assumed that the overall volume of suspended attached and adsorbed particles does not change during attachment and sorption this assumption includes incompressibility of the particles and water and the amagat s law for volume additivity bedrikovetsky 2013 if volumetric particle concentrations are negligibly small compared with the rock porosity the same equations are valid even if amagat s law is not fulfilled for the water rock particles system here we discuss large scale approximation where the advective flux of particles significantly exceeds the dispersive diffusive flux i e the model is diffusion free barenblatt et al 1989 polyanin and dil man 1994 the relaxation time of non equilibrium sorption is significantly lower than the time of one pore volume injection so equilibrium sorption is assumed we consider henry s sorption isotherm where the proportionality coefficient between the adsorbed and suspended concentrations is independent of the particle size 2 2 2 2 governing equations for 3d multi component suspension colloidal flows consider 3d transport of the fine particles that can be attached to the rock surface and adsorb on this surface the suspended

particle size so the expression for the overall occupied surface is 6 b x 1 x 2 x 3 t 0 b r s s r s x 1 x 2 x 3 t d r s consequently b is the ratio between the overall surface occupied by the attached

in a glass column with diameter 2 5 cm and length 15 cm packed with ottawa sand two artificial porous media with different sand sizes had pore radii rp 9 6 and 12 7 Î¼m five pvis of 3 ppm suspension of fullerene nc60 nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 120 nm were injected into a porous column containing an aqueous solution of 1 mm cacl2 and 0 065 mm nahco3 particle size varied from 92 nm to 124 nm in each porous media the injection was carried out with two velocities u 9 27 10 5 m s and u 1 20 10 5 m s so altogether four tests have been performed fig 3a shows breakthrough curves btcs fig 3b presents four rps and nrps are observed in four tests li et al 2008 used the mathematical model for single size particles 1 2 with langmuir blocking formation damage function 30 for matching therefore all four matched rps were monotonically decreasing fig 3a shows the match of four btcs by the upscaled model 16 18 for binary colloidal flow the tuning of five model coefficients Î»1 Î»2 b1

least square deviation between the laboratory and modelling data coleman and li 1996 zhou et al 2017 the tuned values of individual occupation areas b1 and b2 presented in the second line of table 1 provide relatively fast retention and occupation the filtration function h s decreases fast so the breakthrough concentration already at t 2 3 pvi becomes significantly higher than the breakthrough concentration c 1 1 that corresponds to initial value of the filtration function h 0 therefore the concentration c 1 1 at the moment of front arrival cannot be distinguished in the graph in fig 3a however zoom in fig 3a exhibits concentration jumps at the moment of front arrival fig 3b presents the match of four rps by the upscaled model for all four tests the model 16 18 reproduces nrps table

rc 2 columns eleven and twelve in table 1 alvarez et al 2007 show that small variation of filtration function h s yields small variation of rp while the btc s variation can be quite substantial it explains significantly more precise match of the rps than that for btcs for flow in two identical sand packs with two different velocities the values of filtration coefficient for large fines are higher than those for small fines the values in sixth column in lines 3 6 are higher than those in fifth column for the core length l 0 15 m the dimensional filtration coefficient Î» l varies from 56

concentration of small particles in the injected colloid is almost the same for the four tests it is expected that the higher is the velocity the lower is the filtration coefficient for attachment this is the case for small particles in both media fifth column and for large particles in the rock with 9 6 mm pores sixth column for large particles in the rock with 12 7 Î¼m pores sixth column this is not the case yet two values of filtration coefficient are almost the same the expected independence of individual occupation areas of velocities has not been observed the phenomenon could be explained by non ideal packing procedure or by low accuracy in the approximation of the injected suspension by binary mixture btcs in fig 3a can be approximated by quadratic parabolas with three free

the attempt to match the data by the traditional model 1 2 was unsuccessful btcs have not been measured due to low particle concentrations in the effluent water fig 4a shows only the threshold of

using the same tuned model coefficients the dimension of the data array for two curves is eight five model parameters have been tuned close match allows claiming that the model 16 18 is valid lines 6

suspension rp monotonically decreases at the moment t1 non monotonic wave appears near the wellbore at the moment t2 zoom clearly shows this occurrence propagation of nrp into the reservoir continues at the moments t3 and t4 the rp asymptotically stabilises behind the pulse the rps at moments t3 and t4 behind the pulse almost coincide when time tends to infinity the stabilised rp monotonically increases fig 5b shows the results of downscaling i e the rps for small and large particles red and blue curves respectively like in the linear flow small particles exhibit non monotonic behaviour of rps rps for both populations monotonically decrease at the beginning of injection t t1 the rp for large particles always remains monotonically decreasing the small particle rp becomes non monotonic at the moment t2 and asymptotically tends to increasing curve behind the pulse moments t3 and t4 calculation of injectivity decline impedance is performed based on the numerical model using the rp values for the overall colloid given a radial version of eq 3 here we use the linearized expression for formation damage k0 k s 1 Î²s where Î² is called the formation damage coefficient pressure drop between

fraction Î´ of the formation damage caused by the particle retention outside the damaged zone the smaller is the zone and the lower is the damaged zone size rd during re perforation of the damaged injected well the perforation holes must by pass the zone of formation damage so rd is the lower bound for perforation length the damage radius increases with time so choice of the perforation length must account for rd at the moment of the next planned re perforation allowing for injection into undamaged rock until the next well stimulation well acidizing removes the formation damage by dissolution of the retained particles the volume of injected acid va is determined by the damaged radius va Ïrd 2hÏ where h is the formation thickness fig 6 shows sensitivity of rp and impedance with respect to area occupied by small particles b2 fraction of small particles in the injected suspension concentration c2 0 and filtration coefficient for small particles Î»2 the basic variant corresponds to experimental study by wang et al 2010 the sixth line of table 1 presents the corresponding values of the model coefficients the range of variation of parameters b2 c2 0 and Î»2 are presented in legends in fig 6b 6d and 6f respectively other parameters and three moments t1 t2 and t3 are specified in caption in fig 6 fig 6a shows that the larger is the individual occupied area for small particles b2 the less particles occupy the overall rock surface in the stabilised state and the lower is located the stabilised rp the figure shows that rp stabilisation occurs near to the injection well with the fixed number of injected particles at the moment t3 the lower stabilised attached concentration results in faster propagation of the pulse front fig 6b shows that the higher is the b2 the lower number of particles populate the surface under the stabilisation and the lower is the impedance three retention profiles almost coincide during the monotonic stage for first two moments and significantly deviate from each other during non monotonic period fig 6c shows that the higher is the fraction of small particles in the injected suspension more particles populate the overall rock surface at the stabilised state so the stabilisation value of rp is higher the rps stabilise near to the injection wellbore so the pulse propagation speed is lower consequently the impedance is higher fig 6d fig 6e shows that the higher is the filtration coefficient for small particles Î»2 the faster they attach the higher is the small particle fraction in the total retained concentration the more particles populate the rock at the stabilised state so since more particles are attached as Î»2 increases the impedance increases fig 6f 7 discussion and summary in the last two decades spatial and probabilistic averaging upscaling of transport in micro heterogeneous subterranean reservoirs has been highly developed producing effective large scale transport equations boso and tartakovsky 2016 dagan et al 2013 fiori et al 2015 hilpert and johnson 2018 rabinovich et al 2013 tartakovsky et al 2017 winter and tartakovsky 2002 we focus on an important particular case of uncorrelated stochastic properties which corresponds to zero dispersivity of the micro scale system dagan et al 2013 efendiev et al 2016 rabinovich 2017 in this text we use both terms upscaling and averaging averaging upscaling of suspension transport with size distributed particles the governing system for n component suspension consists of 2 n equations 23 24 yielding extremely computer time consuming calculations the way around this problem is averaging over the particle size distribution resulting in single population equations this procedure was developed in bedrikovetsky et al 2019 for 1d linear flows x t however this paper focus on axi symmetric flow for injection into vertical wells consequently appendix f derives the exact upscaling for radial n component flows r t yielding the large scale 3 3 system 26 28 if compared with linear flow upscaled model 16 18 the upscaled system for axi symmetric flows 26 28 contains the cross sectional area 2 xwx 1 2 in denominators of kinetic rates given by eqs 27 28 this corresponds to radial flow during the injection where the area of cross section is equal to 2Ïr non monotonic retention profiles we derived an upscaled system for 1d axi symmetric flows the main feature of the solution are non monotonic retention profiles the solution allows exhibiting time evolution of the rps for the overall suspension and its small particles all profiles are monotonically declining at the beginning of injection then rps for overall suspension and small particles translates into non monotonic asymptotically both profiles stabilise at increasing curves rps for large particles remain monotonically declining non monotonic behaviour of rps occurs for the following relationships between the filtration coefficients and individual occupation areas Î» 1 Î»2 b1 b2 it is typical that attachment of larger particles occurs faster therefore non monotonic rps are rule rather than exception quasi 3d flows in the damage free case where permeability is not affected by attached and adsorbed particles eqs 11 separate from the rest of the governing system and yield laplace equation for pressure p x1 x2 x3 t solution of laplace equation and eq 10 determines flux u so flux in eqs 7 8 and 12 13 becomes a known vector function and system 7 8 of 2 n equations determine 2 n unknowns ck and sk k 1 2 n introduction of areal coordinate along streamlines and two transversal coordinates reduces 3d problem to 1d with one areal coordinate along the streamlines bedrikovetsky 2013 polyanin and lychev 2016 the upscaling procedure presented in appendix f for axi symmetric flow and in appendix b for linear flow can be extended for 3d damage free flows integration in characteristic form of the governing equations f 1 f 2 uses coordinate x1 along the streamlines the resulting 3d system of three equations contains jacobian of streamline transformation in denominator of expressions for attaching and site occupation rates in eqs 28 and 27 respectively validation of the upscaled model we validate the averaged equations 16 18 by comparison with two sets of laboratory data the first set contains four tests exhibiting btcs and post mortem rps high match has been achieved for all tests dimension of the experimental data array for each test was at least seven while five model parameters have been tuned the high match allows claiming validity of the model 7 8 yet the model matches rps with higher accuracy than it matches btcs the coefficient of determination in twelfth column of table 1 is higher than r2 in the eleventh column small perturbations of filtration function h s yield significantly higher variations in btc s than in rp s alvarez et al 2005 alvarez et al 2007 therefore bt data are usually scattered significantly higher than the data on rps consequently the inverse problem for determination of h s from rp data is well posed while treating btcs yields ill posed inverse problems and require regularization the above speculations explain better matches of rps than those of btcs another experimental set contains injection of nps in three identical engineered porous media the rps are presented at three moments the tests exhibit the same scenario that is predicted by the upscaled model fig 4b shows monotonically declining rp at t 5 pvi non monotonic pulse at t 32 pvi and stabilisation of monotonically increasing rp behind the pulse at t 65 pvi the retention profiles provide at least eight dimensional array of laboratory data so successful match allows claiming the model validity the deviation in the second section of the core at the third moment can be explained by inhomogeneous packing of sand in the artificial core another explanation could be insufficient approximation of the injected colloid by a binary mixture the ternary mixture model would be more precise three modelling predicted btcs for all cores are below the particle counter resolution supporting the experimental observation that the particles do not appear in the effluent during the three tests the model limitations the kinetics of particle capture given by eq 18 is a generalisation of langmuir s blocking which is typical for particle attachment by the rock from the groundwater flux however size exclusion of mono sized particles in two pore sized media where the particles plug small pores and pass through large pores corresponds to linear langmuir filtration function bedrikovetsky 2008 for n particle sized suspension the filtration function h monotonically increases with respect to individual retention concentrations sk as does function h in eqs 8 and 13 approximation of size exclusion filtration function by formula used in eqs 17 18 and applying the upscaled model 16 18 for size exclusion and straining is a topic of forthcoming work we assume that inaccessible pore volume is comparable with the overall pore volume and the flux through the inaccessible pore volume is comparable with the overall flux however we assume that the differences between the accessibility factors for different populations are negligibly small if compared with the average Î· value the same corresponds to flux reduction factor Î± and henry s sorption coefficient Î³ therefore Î· Î± and Î³ are assumed to be constant in the model given by eq 7 which are the limitations of the model eqs 16 18 are valid for particles distributed by other parameters rather than size like surface charge zeta potential density shape etc yet so far we found laboratory data on deep bed filtration of particles distributed only by size 8 conclusions exact upscaling averaging of axi symmetric suspension colloidal nano transport with size distributed particles and analytical modelling of 1d flows allow concluding as follows suspension colloidal axi symmetric transport of size distributed particles corresponding to constant composition injection allows for upscaling the upscaled 3 3 system consists of mass balance equation and two kinetics equations for particle attachment and site occupation where the attachment and site occupation rates depend on radius total rps during injection of binary colloid or suspension where larger particles occupy larger areas monotonically decrease at the beginning of injection and with time translates to non monotonic curves by the time rp asymptotically tends to monotonically increasing stabilised curve rp for small particles also monotonically decrease at the beginning of injection with time the rp translates to non monotonic curve and then it tends to monotonically increasing profile as time tends to infinity rps for large particles remain monotonically decreasing during the overall injection period the numerical solution of the axi symmetric binary colloid flow problem corresponding to the injection of constant composition suspension into a vertical well exhibits monotonically increasing stabilised rp while for mono size colloid the stabilised rp is uniform the numerical solution allows calculating well injectivity decline during the colloidal suspension nano injection which permits for planning the well stimulation procedures the solution also calculates the damaged zone size which determines the volume of acid to be injected during well acidizing and perforation length for well re perforation

5959,droughts in india affect food production gross domestic product gdp livelihood and socio economic condition of a large population associated with agriculture recent drought 2015 2018 caused groundwater depletion and affected about one fourth of the indian population however it remains unclear if the drought of 2015 2018 was among the most severe droughts that occurred in india here we use a long term 1870 2018 data to identify the top five deadly meteorological hydrological droughts based on overall severity score in the last century and half period out of a total of 18 meteorological droughts the deadly droughts occurred in 1899 1876 2000 1918 and 1965 similarly the deadly hydrological droughts occurred in 1899 2000 1876 1965 and 1918 during 1870 2018 all the five deadly droughts were associated with the positive phase of el nino southern oscillations enso results show that the relationship between enso and monsoon june to september precipitation in india has weakened while the role of indian and atlantic oceans have strengthened during the recent decades notwithstanding the longest 41 months duration the 2015 2018 drought did not feature among the deadly droughts the 2015 2018 drought affected surface reservoir storage and groundwater availability in both southern and northern parts of india and was linked to el nino and indian ocean dipole droughts and rapidly declining groundwater together can pose serious challenges to water security in india keywords drought reservoir storage groundwater grace spi sri 1 introduction droughts pose remarkable challenges on the socio economic aspects of a large population in india the vulnerability of the indian population to droughts is high as a large fraction of the population is associated with agriculture more than 80 of total annual precipitation occurs in india during the monsoon june to september season the year to year variability of the summer monsoon precipitation is linked with the large scale climate factors especially sea surface temperature sst conditions in the pacific and indian oceans kumar 1999 kumar 2003 mishra et al 2012 roxy et al 2015 india has a long history of major droughts that have had lasting impacts on water resources agriculture gross domestic product and rural livelihood bhalme and mooley 1980 mishra and singh 2010 mooley and parthasarathy 1983 mooley and pant 1981 some of the historic droughts caused famines in india that resulted in millions of deaths mishra et al 2019 the recent drought of 2015 affected crop production and water availability in the indo gangetic plain and maharashtra region mishra et al 2016 prakash 2018 the 2015 2016 drought affected a large part of south india with lower reservoir storage and hydropower production moreover about 330 million people in ten states were affected by the 2015 2016 drought unicef 2016 furthermore the 2015 16 drought caused a significant depletion in groundwater in the indo gangetic plain and southern states of india unicef 2016 considering the profound impacts of the recent droughts in india it is essential to compare the recent droughts with the most severe droughts that occurred in the past mishra et al 2019 reconstructed soil moisture droughts in india during 1870 2018 to evaluate the role of agricultural droughts in the famines that caused millions of deaths during the british period long term meteorological and hydrological droughts affect surface and groundwater resources which in turn hamper crop production leading to food insecurity funk et al 2008 recent studies reported the influence of drought on groundwater variability in india panda et al 2007 however most of the previous studies bhalme and mooley 1980 de et al 2005 gregory 1989 mallya et al 2015 mooley and parthasarathy 1983 thober et al 2015 mooley and pant 1981 are based on meteorological droughts primarily during the monsoon season and do not consider hydrological droughts in the monsoon season and water year june to may here we use the long term data to reconstruct the most severe deadly meteorological and hydrological droughts during the monsoon season and water year in india during the period of 1870 2018 understanding of the deadly meteorological and hydrological droughts in india enables to evaluate if the recent drought 2015 2018 is among the deadly droughts that occurred in india during 1870 2018 moreover the record of the major droughts in india during 1870 2018 can be useful to compare the severity of the future droughts that are likely to be driven by both monsoon season precipitation deficit and anthropogenic warming mishra and singh 2010 dai 2011 diffenbaugh et al 2015 mukherjee et al 2018 since long term droughts have implications for surface and groundwater storage we use reservoir storage and groundwater data to evaluate the impacts of the recent drought on surface and groundwater availability in india here we address three objectives i to reconstruct major meteorological and hydrological droughts in india during 1870 2018 and to compare the 2015 2018 drought against the most severe historical droughts ii to identify the linkage between seas surface temperature variability with the major droughts in india and iii to evaluate the impact of the recent drought 2015 2018 on surface and groundwater storage 2 data and methods 2 1 data we obtained 0 5 gridded daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures from mishra et al 2019 mishra et al 2019 extended precipitation data for 1870 1900 the precipitation data for the 1901 2018 period was obtained from the india meteorological department imd pai et al 2014 as mentioned in mishra et al 2019 the station data for precipitation was obtained for the period of 1870 1900 from imd which was carefully checked for quality inconsistency and missing data the number of stations varied between 517 in 1870 and 1600 in 1900 monthly precipitation climatology developed for 1870 1900 compared well with mean precipitation for post 1900 for both monsoon june september season as well as for water year june may all india averaged precipitation for 1870 2016 also compared well against the precipitation data developed at goddard institute for space science giss nasa by dai et al 1997 since imd temperature data is available only for the 1951 2018 period the temperature data for the entire period 1870 2018 was obtained from the berkeley earth which was bias corrected using temperature data from imd mishra et al 2019 monthly precipitation and temperature were used to develop daily data using resampling from 20th century reanalysis 20cr using the methodology described in wood et al 2002 further details on data development and evaluation can be obtained from mishra et al 2019 2 2 the variable infiltration capacity vic model we used the variable infiltration capacity vic model to simulate hydrologic variables total runoff surface runoff baseflow evapotranspiration et and soil moisture the vic model liang et al 1994 1996 cherkauer et al 2003 is a semi distributed macro scale hydrological model that simulates full water and energy budget for each grid cell the vic model takes soil vegetation and meteorological parameters daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and wind speed as input to simulate water and energy budget the model represents the sub grid variability of land use land cover and topography we conducted daily simulations using the vic model for the period of 1870 2018 which were aggregated to monthly scale to evaluate the hydrological droughts a detailed description of the vic model calibration and evaluation can be found in shah and mishra 2016 and mishra et al 2018 2 3 identification of major droughts we used the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 for identifying meteorological and hydrological droughts respectively spi and sri can be used to quantify precipitation total runoff surplus deficit at multiple time scales we used a non parametric approach to estimate spi sri for 12 month time scale as described in farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 we considered the 12 months from june to may to represent a water year in india about 80 of the total annual precipitation occurs during the monsoon period moreover the southern peninsula receives a significant amount of precipitation during the northeastern monsoon october to december season therefore 12 month spi sri at the end of may represents the cumulative precipitation total runoff for the entire water year and helps us to understand the hydrologic impacts of droughts we estimated the marginal probability of precipitation total runoff using the empirical gringorten plotting position gringorten 1963 to estimate spi sri the probabilities 0 1 were then converted to a standardized index using the standard normal gaussian cumulative distribution function cdf to estimate spi sri for the entire period 1870 2018 we used 1971 2000 as the reference period since the focus is on extreme droughts we used a threshold of 1 6 for identifying meteorological and hydrologic droughts svoboda et al 2002 we estimated three drought characteristics drought duration intensity and areal extent for each drought spell that was identified using all india aggregated spi sri the onset of a meteorological hydrological drought spell was considered if 12 month spi sri was below zero for more than three consecutive months the drought recovery was considered if 12 month spi sri remains above zero for more than three consecutive months we identify drought duration for each drought spell as the number of months for which 12 month spi sri intensity remains below zero we estimated the areal extent for each month using the number of grid cells with 12 month spi sri value less than or equal to 1 6 divided by the total number 1162 of grid cells in india the droughts are named based on their onset year for instance if a drought starts in year 2000 we refer it to 2000 drought regardless of the time of its peak or termination we estimated the intensity and areal extent for each month using the all india aggregated time series of 12 month spi sri we identified drought spells that occurred during 1870 2018 in india using 12 month spi sri among all the identified drought spells we selected only those that had maximum intensity 12 month spi sri higher than 1 6 and duration more than six months for the identified 12 month meteorological and hydrological droughts based on this criterion we estimated mean intensity cumulative intensity duration and drought severity for each drought spell then we estimated severity as the multiplication of mean intensity and mean areal extent during a drought spell the overall severity score was estimated by multiplying the severity and duration months of a drought spell we ranked both meteorological and hydrological droughts that occurred in each water year during 1870 2018 based on the overall severity score for instance the drought that has the highest overall severity score received the top rank among the selected droughts the five droughts with the highest overall severity score were termed as deadly droughts during the period of 1870 2017 here we assume that the large scale areal extent droughts that had high mean intensity and lasted longer caused more negative impacts however it is worth noting that drought impacts can be associated with the changes in population and economic growth rate for instance the recent droughts may be less severe but can cause more economic damage due to the development 2 4 linkage between drought and sea surface temperature sst variability we used the extended reconstructed sea surface temperature ersst v5 huang et al 2017 to evaluate the linkage between droughts and sst during 1870 2018 the global sst data is available from 1854 onwards at monthly and 2 0 temporal and spatial resolutions respectively we obtained nino 3 4 that is based on sst anomalies estimated after removing the mean sst in the tropical pacific for the period of 1870 2018 from ucar s climate data guide https www esrl noaa gov psd gcos wgsp timeseries data nino34 long datahttps www esrl noaa gov psd gcos wgsp timeseries data nino34 long data additionally we estimated sst anomalies for the nino 1 2 nino 3 and nino 4 to represent sst variability of the enso region in the pacific ocean based on the correlation analysis between sst and the monsoon season precipitation anomalies we estimated sst anomalies for the selected regions in the indian io and atlantic atl oceans 2 5 influence of drought on surface and groundwater storage in addition to spi and sri we estimated reservoir storage index rsi tiwari and mishra 2019 to identify periods of reservoir deficit observed reservoir storage data was obtained from india s water resources information systems india wris http www india wris nrsc gov in for the period of 2003 2018 central water commission cwc of india monitors reservoir storage of 91 major reservoirs in india rsi is similar to spi see tiwari and mishra 2019 for more details and can be used to monitor deficit or surplus reservoir storage condition for different time periods we used 1 month rsi to represent short term variation while 12 month rsi for long term variation in reservoir storage rsi was estimated for each of the major reservoirs and then aggregated for all the reservoirs to provide deficit surplus condition at all india level since droughts affect groundwater storage in india panda et al 2007 we used terrestrial water storage tws from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace tellus land from csr at 1 spatial and monthly temporal resolution for the period of 2002 2016 we estimated tws anomalies by removing monthly mean tws for the entire period 2002 2016 we estimated grace groundwater storage anomalies after removing soil moisture canopy storage and snow water equivalent from grace tws surface water storage total of soil moisture canopy storage snow water equivalent was obtained from the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 we obtained surface water storage from the four land surface models including vic noah clm and mosaic more information on the grace groundwater anomalies can be obtained from asoka et al 2017 since both tws and gw anomalies are influenced by groundwater pumping in india we removed trends in tws and gw anomalies using ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd huang and wu 2009 in contrast with the conventional detrending methods eemd estimates both linear and nonlinear trends in data more information on eemd and its application can be obtained from huang and wu 2009 to estimate the impacts of the deadly droughts on surface and groundwater resources long term observations of reservoir storage and groundwater are required however reservoir storage and groundwater data from grace is only available for the post 2002 period we therefore limit drought impact assessment on surface and groundwater resources to the post 2002 period only 3 results 3 1 deadly meteorological and hydrological droughts 3 1 1 major meteorological droughts 1870 2018 we identified the spells of meteorological 12 month spi and hydrological 12 month sri droughts during 1870 2018 fig 1 using all india averaged spi sri we selected only those drought spells that lasted more than six months and had maximum intensity higher than 1 6 which is used as a threshold to categorize an extreme drought svoboda et al 2002 we focused on a 12 month time scale for meteorological and hydrological droughts to avoid the influence of seasonality in the monsoon precipitation moreover the 12 month time period is important to consider the impacts of meteorological and hydrological droughts on agriculture and water resources sectors shukla and wood 2008 we identify 18 meteorological based on 12 month spi drought spells during 1870 2018 table 1 fig 1a the first such drought spell started from june 1876 and ended in july 1878 with maximum and mean intensities areal extent of 2 4 30 and 1 5 20 respectively table 1 the last meteorological drought spell during the entire record started in july 2015 and continued till december 2018 with a duration of 41 months the most recent meteorological drought the drought of 2015 2018 affected the maximum and mean area of 18 and 9 of the country respectively table 1 we also note that the most recent meteorological drought has the longest duration 41 months in the entire record of 1870 2018 the five deadly meteorological droughts 12 month spi based on overall severity score occurred in 1899 1876 2000 1918 and 1965 fig 1a table 1 the 1899 drought started in july 1899 and ended in august 1900 affecting more than 30 of the country with maximum and mean intensities of 3 0 and 2 3 respectively table 1 fig 1a the overall severity score of the 1899 drought was 1063 2 and the drought peaked based on intensity in june 1900 the second deadly meteorological drought based on 12 month spi started in june 1876 and lasted till july 1878 duration 25 months the drought affected more than 20 of the country during june 1876 and july 1878 with maximum and mean intensities of 2 5 and 1 5 respectively the 1876 drought peaked in september 1877 with the areal coverage of about 30 table 1 and fig 1a both 1899 and 1876 droughts caused famines in india mishra et al 2019 and resulted in millions of deaths the 1899 drought affected central and western parts while the 1876 drought was centered over southern and northern parts of india fig 1c d the third deadly meteorological drought started in september 2000 and ended in september 2003 table s1 the 2000 drought lasted about three years and peaked in june 2003 in june 2003 the drought affected more than 30 of the country the drought was mainly located in the central southern and northwestern parts of india bhat 2006 reported that the 2002 drought was caused by an all india precipitation deficit of 21 5 during the monsoon season and 56 deficit in july the precipitation deficit was 8 and 6 in 2000 and 2001 respectively shah et al 2009 the fourth and fifth ranked deadly meteorological droughts occurred in 1918 and 1965 with an overall severity score of 601 and 506 respectively table 1 fig 1 the 1918 drought started in september 1918 and ended in august 1919 and affected more than one fourth part a majority part of northwest india of the country the drought peaked in october 1918 with an areal extent of 38 5 and intensity of 3 table 1 the drought of 1965 started in july and ended in august of 1967 duration 25 months the drought peaked in april 1966 affecting more than 20 of the country primarily in central india fig 1 table 1 out of the top 10 meteorological droughts three 2000 2009 and 2015 occurred after 1980 and five occurred after 1950 the most recent meteorological drought started in july 2015 and continued till december 2018 duration 41 months the drought of 2015 is the longest drought in the entire record of a century and half period the drought peaked in june 2016 affecting more than 18 of the country table 1 however based on overall severity score the 2015 drought was substantially less severe ranked 9th among 18 major droughts than the deadly meteorological droughts table 1 3 1 2 major hydrological droughts 1870 2018 we identified 16 major hydrological droughts during 1870 2018 table 2 fig 1b the top five deadly hydrological droughts occurred in 1899 2000 1876 1965 and 1918 table 2 we note that at 12 month time scale most of these hydrological droughts were driven largely by meteorological droughts caused mainly due to the deficit in the monsoon season precipitation however warmer temperature and increased atmospheric demands can affect drought at shorter time scales mo and lettenmaier 2015 spatial patterns and intensity of hydrological droughts are consistent with the meteorological droughts the 2015 hydrological drought is the longest 40 months drought that affected more than 15 of the country however based on the overall severity score the 2015 hydrological drought is substantially less severe ranked 8th among 16 droughts than the deadly hydrological droughts that occurred during 1870 2018 fig 1 table 2 we note the difference in the ranking of meteorological and hydrological droughts for instance the 2003 meteorological drought was ranked third while the 2003 hydrological drought was ranked second among the major droughts similarly the 1966 meteorological drought ranked fifth while the hydrological drought of 1966 ranked fourth to further evaluate the role of precipitation and temperature on the major hydrological droughts we estimated 12 month anomalies of precipitation et total runoff and air temperature for each month considering the reference period of 1971 2000 fig 2 we find that temperature anomalies were negative for four except 2003 out of five major hydrological droughts indicating that precipitation deficit played a primary role in hydrological droughts fig 2 moreover for all the major hydrological droughts et and total runoff was anomalously low as et can be affected by both precipitation deficit and high temperature for most of the hydrological droughts lower et was largely due to the precipitation deficit the 2003 hydrological drought was caused by both precipitation deficit and positive temperature anomalies however as reported in bhat 2006 the significant deficit in the monsoon season precipitation during 2002 was a major driver of hydrological drought that peaked in 2003 our results indicate that the monsoon season precipitation remains a major contributor to hydrological droughts in india however high temperature anomalies due to anthropogenic warming can influence drought severity in the future diffenbaugh et al 2015 especially at shorter time scales mo and lettenmaier 2015 we estimated 20 major water year hydrological droughts based on 12 month sri at the end of may for 1870 2018 fig 3 we find that based on drought severity during a water year the top five hydrological droughts occurred in 1900 area 37 7 2003 22 8 1919 26 1966 23 and 1973 18 fig 3 the 2016 drought ranked 16th in the water year hydrological droughts and affected about 12 area of the country table 3 similarly monsoon season hydrological drought based on 4 month sri at the end of september 2018 and 2017 droughts ranked 12th and 17th among the top twenty droughts table s1 based on two consecutive water years hydrological droughts 2016 and 2017 ranked 10th and 19th respectively table s2 three consecutive water year hydrological drought in 2017 and 2018 ranked 17th and 13th during the entire record of 1870 2018 table s3 we estimated the frequency of major hydrological droughts fraction of the major 20 droughts for the monsoon 4 month sri and water year 12 24 and 36 month sri during the 1870 2018 fig 4 we define drought frequency for a grid point as the number of times the grid point was a part of a major hydrologic drought to the total number of major hydrologic droughts identified in the past 20 we aimed to understand if there are regions in india that were frequently affected by the major droughts at different time scales during the monsoon or water year we find that central and western regions of india were most frequently affected by the major hydrological droughts during 1870 2018 fig 4a d among the 20 major hydrological droughts that occurred after 1980 northwestern central and southern india were most frequently affected fig 4e h our results show that the southernmost part of india was most frequently affected by the major hydrological droughts that occurred for three consecutive years in the post 1980 period fig 4h 3 2 hydrological droughts at different time scales long term droughts directly impact hydrological systems streamflow groundwater runoff and water availability in india as experienced during the drought of 2015 mishra and singh 2010 mishra et al 2016 to understand the implications of hydrological droughts we identified the top five hydrological droughts that occurred in each month of the calendar year based on 12 month sri fig 5 a this allows us to benchmark the historical droughts in the context of the recent the 2015 2018 drought droughts in india we find that for most of the months except august 1899 1900 hydrological drought was the deadliest during the entire record fig 5a moreover the hydrological drought of 2002 2003 ranked second for most of the months during 1870 2018 fig 5a the 2002 hydrological drought based on 12 month sri was the worst drought that india experienced in august overall the findings show that the 1899 1900 and 2002 2003 hydrological droughts are the deadliest in the entire record 1870 2018 we identified the deadly droughts based on severity based on 4 12 24 and 36 month sri during 1870 2016 fig 5b to do so we considered hydrological drought in the monsoon season 4 month sri at the end of september and 1 3 water year hydrological droughts represented by 12 24 and 36 month sri at the end of may we find that the deadliest monsoon season hydrological droughts occurred in 1918 intensity 2 4 area 35 8 followed by 1899 2 3 33 5 1877 2 4 29 6 2002 2 3 22 5 and 1987 1 5 24 3 the 1918 hydrological drought during the monsoon season affected a large part of western india fig 5c table s1 as previously mentioned the worst water year based on 12 month sri drought occurred in 1900 2 6 37 7 which affected a majority of western and central parts of the country fig 5b d the other top four water year hydrological droughts occurred in 2003 2 6 22 8 1919 2 2 26 1966 2 5 23 and 1973 2 3 18 3 the 1967 2 3 24 3 was the deadliest hydrological drought based on the two consecutive water years fig 5b e table s2 which affected a major part of the indo gangetic plain and central india the other top four hydrological droughts for two consecutive water years occurred in 1900 2 0 24 1906 2 1 21 2 1878 1 7 20 5 and 2003 2 0 17 1 table s2 similarly the top five hydrological droughts for three consecutive years occurred in 2003 2 3 22 1968 1 87 17 2 1900 1 8 17 7 1878 1 4 20 7 and 1967 1 6 16 3 table s3 the 36 month drought in water year in 2003 affected the majority of western and southern india fig 5f we notice that 1899 1900 and 2002 2003 hydrological drought featured among the top five for 4 36 month time scales we find that the 2015 2018 meteorological hydrological drought was the longest duration drought fig 1 despite the low overall severity score mainly due to the less 9 areal extent therefore we compared the severity of the 2015 drought against the deadliest drought based on 4 36 month sri that occurred during 1870 2018 fig 5g i we find that the most severe hydrological drought in the monsoon season 4 month sri at the end of september during 2015 2018 occurred in 2018 the hydrological drought of 2018 monsoon season mainly affected eastern and northeastern parts of the country fig 5g however the 2018 monsoon season hydrological drought did not feature among the deadly droughts that occurred in the last century and half period similarly the most severe one and two water year hydrological drought during 2015 2018 occurred in 2016 may 2016 which mainly affected the northern and central parts of the country fig 5h i moreover the most severe hydrological drought based on the three consecutive water years occurred in 2018 may 2018 that affected the indo gangetic plain and the southern tip of the southern peninsula fig 5j we note that notwithstanding the longest duration of the 2015 2018 drought the severity was significantly lesser than the deadly droughts that occurred during 1870 2018 tables s2 s4 3 3 linkage between deadly meteorological droughts and sst variability since most of the hydrological droughts are driven by the meteorological droughts we evaluated the large scale sea surface temperature sst conditions that caused the deadly meteorological droughts during 1870 2018 fig 6 we used the monsoon season sst anomalies to diagnose their linkage with the deadly meteorological droughts 12 month spi fig 6 results show that 12 month spi was negative from july 1899 to august 1900 with the highest intensity in june 1900 fig 6a warmer sst anomalies in the nino 3 4 region 5n 5s 170w 120w occurred during the entire 1899 drought fig 6a moreover warmer sst anomalies during the monsoon season were present in the central and northern pacific and northern atlantic regions fig 6b however cold sst anomalies were found in the indian ocean region from june to september of 1899 the linkage between the monsoon failure in india and el nino is well established sikka 1980 kumar 1999 kumar 2003 mishra et al 2012 we show that the deadliest drought of 1899 was associated with el nino fig 6b the second deadliest meteorological drought started in 1876 which was associated with warmer sst anomalies from june to september of 1877 fig 6c d both nino 3 4 and sst anomalies indicate a strong el nino in 1877 kripalani and kulkarni 1997 singh et al 2018 moreover the 1876 drought was partly associated with the record strong indian ocean dipole fig 6d we note la nina like condition at the beginning of the 1876 drought which was later converted to strong el nino the positive phase of enso and indian ocean dipole favors precipitation during the northeastern monsoon rajeevan et al 2012 the 1876 drought was mainly centered in south india that might be linked to la nina conditions moreover the drought shifted to north india in 1877 which is attributable to the summer monsoon variability and its linkage with el nino nevertheless both 1899 and 1876 droughts caused famines in india that resulted in significant human mortality singh et al 2018 we note that both of these droughts were strongly associated with el nino during the monsoon season the third most deadly meteorological drought occurred between 2000 and 2003 in india fig 6d e we find that at the beginning of the drought cooler sst anomalies were present in the nino 3 4 region however during the monsoon season of 2002 warmer sst anomalies were present not only in the central pacific but also in the indian ocean regions therefore the drought of 2000 can be attributed to warmer sst conditions in the pacific and indian oceans the drought was caused by an unprecedented break in the monsoon during july 2002 saith and slingo 2006 saith and slingo 2006 reported that el nino and madden julian oscillation mjo played an important role in the 2002 drought in india the sst anomalies were moderately positive in the nino 3 4 region during the 1918 drought that started in september 1918 and ended in august 1919 fig 6h we find warmer sst anomalies in the eastern and northern pacific regions during the monsoon season of 1918 kripalani and kulkarni 1997 similarly the 1965 drought was caused by a strong el nino as revealed by both nino 3 4 and sst anomaly over the central pacific ocean fig 6i j overall our results show that all five most deadly meteorological droughts during 1870 2018 were associated with el nino to further establish the linkage between sst anomalies in the equatorial pacific ocean and monsoon season precipitation in india we estimated the correlation between all india monsoon season precipitation anomaly and observed sst fig 7 as reported in previous studies kumar 1999 kumar 2003 mishra et al 2012 enso remains a major driver of the year to year variability of the monsoon season precipitation during 1870 2018 fig 7a among the four enso indices nino 1 2 0 10s 90w 80w nino 3 5n 5s 150w 90w nino 3 4 5n 5s 170w 120w and nino 4 5n 5s 160e 150w nino 3 4 showed the strongest relationship correlation 0 62 with the monsoon season precipitation in india for the entire period of 1870 2018 table 4 since the monsoon season precipitation has been declining since 1950 roxy et al 2015 we performed the correlation analysis between jjas precipitation anomaly and sst for the period of 1950 2018 and found a relatively stronger relationship with the sst anomalies in the central pacific ocean fig 7b during 1950 2018 nino 3 4 was the most strongly r 0 55 correlated with the monsoon season precipitation the relationship between enso and indian summer monsoon precipitation has weakened during 1980 2018 fig 7c table 4 correlation between indian ocean sst and the monsoon season precipitation has strengthened after 1950 table 4 sst anomalies in the central atlantic ocean atlo 4s 14n 110w 150w show relatively stronger association r 0 39 with all india precipitation anomalies during the recent decades 1980 2018 figs 6 and 7 we find that out of the top 15 monsoon season droughts 12 were linked with el nino table 5 fig 8 similar to the droughts estimated at all india level we estimated the linkage between sst anomalies and monsoon season precipitation for the six homogeneous regions fig s1 our results show that at the regional scale also enso is the major driver of the monsoon season precipitation variability in india tables s4 s8 moreover for most of the regions a weakening of enso and strengthening of indian and atlantic oceans sst relationship with monsoon season precipitation was observed tables s4 s8 overall results show that the linkage between summer monsoon precipitation and indian io 4n 20s 70e 100e and atlantic ocean sst has strengthened while the relationship with enso has weakened during 1980 2018 therefore the droughts during the recent decades e g 1987 2002 2009 2015 2018 droughts may be partly associated with sst anomalies in the indian and pacific oceans table 5 figs 6 8 3 4 impacts of 2015 2018 drought on surface and groundwater resources finally we evaluate the evolution of 2015 2018 hydrological and meteorological droughts in india fig 9 we find that poor monsoon season precipitation in 2014 and 2015 contributed to hydrological drought in 2015 fig 9a b the hydrological drought based on 12 month sri peaked in march 2015 affecting indo gangetic plain and northeastern regions however we find that the intensity of drought 12 month spi sri increased significantly in 2016 primarily due to weak monsoon in 2015 a majority of india was affected by the hydrological drought in june 2016 and drought was more intense in the indo gangetic plain and maharashtra regions fig 9a b e we also find a strong positive nino 3 4 anomaly that started in 2015 and continued till may 2016 the 2015 2016 el nino was one of the strongest in the past century that affected weather and climate extremes across the globe blunden and arndt 2016 in 2017 the strong el nino was translated into moderate la nina conditions that peaked during the northeastern monsoon season october december as a result southern india experienced poor northeastern monsoon season precipitation during 2016 and 2017 causing hydrological drought in the region fig 9a b f at the end of 2018 a large part of the country including northeastern western and central parts experienced hydrological drought fig 9a b g however hydrological drought in june 2016 and september 2017 was worse than in december 2018 the 2015 2018 drought had an enormous impact on surface and groundwater resources in india we estimated 1 and 12 month rsi for the 91 major reservoirs in india to identify the impacts of 2015 2018 droughts fig 10 from 12 month rsi we find that there were four major droughts that affected reservoir storage in india fig 10a b the 2002 drought affected reservoir storage significantly across the country the deficit in reservoir storage started in january 2003 and continued till november 2005 with a duration of 35 months the peak deficit in reservoir storage in india due to the 2002 drought occurred in october 2003 the 2009 and 2012 droughts also affected reservoir storage in india reservoir storage deficit started in april 2009 and ended in december 2010 with a duration of 12 months similarly the 2012 drought affected reservoir storage for 10 months between october 2012 and july 2013 after the 2002 drought the 2015 2018 drought affected the reservoir storage for the longest duration of 31 months peak reservoir deficit occurred in august 2016 table 6 we find that the reservoir storage was greatly affected by the 2015 2018 drought as reflected by both 1 and 12 month rsi fig 10a b this was the worst drought after 2002 that affected surface water storage in india a majority of the major reservoirs experienced a deficit in the storage in 2015 2016 and 2017 fig 10c f we used grace data to examine the influence of 2015 2018 drought on tws and groundwater anomalies fig 11 however as the grcae data is only available for the period 2002 2016 the impact of drought in 2017 and 2018 was not evaluated we removed the non linear trend using eemd from tws and groundwater anomalies to exclude the effect of groundwater pumping on the long term depletion of groundwater both north and south india experienced a deficit in tws and groundwater storage due to major droughts for instance the effect of 2002 drought on tws and groundwater anomalies can be seen predominantly in south india fig 11b d on the other hand north india witnessed a significant groundwater depletion due to pumping for irrigation and changes in precipitation characteristics rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 asoka et al 2017 the 2009 drought greatly affected tws and groundwater in north india fig 11a c e f and i j however we find that the difference between raw and detrended tws and gw is not substantial during 2009 2010 which indicates relatively less influence of groundwater pumping the 2015 2018 drought affected tws and gw both in the north and south india fig 11 a substantial difference in the raw and detrended tws and groundwater storage anomalies indicate possibly a large impact of groundwater pumping during the recent years nevertheless the impacts of drought are substantial in the north and south india on both tws and groundwater storage 4 discussion we reconstructed meteorological and hydrological droughts in india for 1870 2018 the analysis points towards the three major findings first there have been a number of meteorological total 18 and hydrological total 16 drought spells in india that lasted for more than six months and with peak intensity higher than 1 6 however based on the overall severity score the five deadly meteorological droughts occurred in 1899 1876 2000 1918 and 1965 on the other hand the five deadliest hydrological droughts that affected the country were 1899 2000 1876 1965 and 1918 secondly all the five deadliest meteorological or hydrological droughts were linked with the positive phase of enso el nino the 1876 drought was affected by enso and indian ocean dipole while the recent droughts were associated with enso as well as sst conditions in the indian and atlantic oceans the role of indian and atlantic ocean sst on the monsoon season precipitation in india has increased during the recent decades 1980 2018 thirdly the longest meteorological hydrological drought in india occurred during 2015 2018 that affected various parts of india the 2015 drought was caused by strong el nino in 2015 and indian ocean dipole in 2017 and affected both north and southern parts of the country however the most recent meteorological drought ranked 9th out of total 18 during the period of 1870 2018 similarly the 2015 18 hydrological drought was ranked 8th among total 16 drought spells in the entire record of a century and half period therefore based on the overall severity score the 2015 18 drought is significantly less severe than the deadly droughts in india however based on the limited record of reservoir storage and groundwater during 2002 2018 we find that the recent drought had a significant influence on surface and groundwater availability in india the rapid decline in groundwater in north india rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 makes the region vulnerable to tackle the adverse impacts of drought droughts have had lasting impacts on socio economic conditions food and water security and gdp of india for instance the two 1899 and 1876 deadliest droughts caused famines in india and resulted in the death of millions of people mishra et al 2019 both of these droughts were linked to the positive phase of enso singh et al 2018 mishra et al 2019 gadgil and gadgil 2006 reported that severe droughts in india impact 2 5 of gdp according to the international disasters database em dat emdat be the 1965 drought that affected the entire nation except the southern part affected about 100 million people of india the drought severely affected parts of bihar and caused more than 2000 deaths in india and half of which occurred in bihar lancaster 1990 the food production declined by 19 during the 1965 drought the drought of 1965 contributed to building a reliable public distribution system pds to take care of food emergencies in india drought report 1987 the 2002 drought year was declared all india drought by the india meteorological department imd about 30 of the country was affected by drought due to more than 25 precipitation deficit during the monsoon season the drought of 2000 caused 22 reduction in rice production while the production of oilseeds and wheat was declined by 23 5 and 9 5 respectively shah et al 2009 the 2002 drought affected more than 300 million people in india em dat and gdp growth declined by 1 the 2002 drought caused about 39 000 crores inr loss in agricultural income the drought also resulted in a severe water crisis as the government had to supply about 1 5 billion liters water every day for nearly for four months mahapatra 2015 https www downtoearth org in blog drought forever 44976 overall based on the previous studies and datasets we note that the deadly droughts had significant impacts on water resources agriculture and economy of india our results also show that the 2015 2018 drought was considerably less severe in comparison to major droughts that occurred during 1870 2018 however it had lasting impacts on surface and groundwater resources unfortunately it is not possible to estimate the impacts of deadly droughts on surface and groundwater in india during 1870 2018 due to the lack of observational data however the impacts of 2015 2018 drought were clearly visible on both reservoir and groundwater storage overall we find that depletion of groundwater storage due to pumping combined with the influence of long term droughts together can pose serious challenges to water security in india 5 conclusions based on our findings the following conclusions can be made 1 we reconstructed meteorological and hydrological droughts in india for 1870 2018 period based on our selection criterion we identified 18 meteorological and 16 hydrological droughts the five deadly meteorological droughts occurred in 1899 1876 2000 1918 and 1965 while the five major hydrological droughts occurred in 1899 2000 1876 1965 and 1918 the meteorological and hydrological drought of 1899 was the most severe in the entire record of 1870 2018 2 the severity of the most recent drought 2015 2018 was considerably lesser than the deadly meteorological and hydrological droughts that affected india which can be attributed to a less areal extent however the recent drought had the longest duration 41 months among all the major droughts in india the 2015 2018 drought ranked 9th and 8th among the major meteorological and hydrological droughts 3 the most deadly top five meteorological droughts were caused by the positive sst anomalies over the pacific enso remains the major driver of the monsoon season precipitation in india however the role of sst variability in indian and atlantic oceans has increased during the recent decades 1980 2018 4 the 2015 2018 drought had a remarkable impact on reservoir and groundwater storage in india suggesting that long term droughts can

5959,droughts in india affect food production gross domestic product gdp livelihood and socio economic condition of a large population associated with agriculture recent drought 2015 2018 caused groundwater depletion and affected about one fourth of the indian population however it remains unclear if the drought of 2015 2018 was among the most severe droughts that occurred in india here we use a long term 1870 2018 data to identify the top five deadly meteorological hydrological droughts based on overall severity score in the last century and half period out of a total of 18 meteorological droughts the deadly droughts occurred in 1899 1876 2000 1918 and 1965 similarly the deadly hydrological droughts occurred in 1899 2000 1876 1965 and 1918 during 1870 2018 all the five deadly droughts were associated with the positive phase of el nino southern oscillations enso results show that the relationship between enso and monsoon june to september precipitation in india has weakened while the role of indian and atlantic oceans have strengthened during the recent decades notwithstanding the longest 41 months duration the 2015 2018 drought did not feature among the deadly droughts the 2015 2018 drought affected surface reservoir storage and groundwater availability in both southern and northern parts of india and was linked to el nino and indian ocean dipole droughts and rapidly declining groundwater together can pose serious challenges to water security in india keywords drought reservoir storage groundwater grace spi sri 1 introduction droughts pose remarkable challenges on the socio economic aspects of a large population in india the vulnerability of the indian population to droughts is high as a large fraction of the population is associated with agriculture more than 80 of total annual precipitation occurs in india during the monsoon june to september season the year to year variability of the summer monsoon precipitation is linked with the large scale climate factors especially sea surface temperature sst conditions in the pacific and indian oceans kumar 1999 kumar 2003 mishra et al 2012 roxy et al 2015 india has a long history of major droughts that have had lasting impacts on water resources agriculture gross domestic product and rural livelihood bhalme and mooley 1980 mishra and singh 2010 mooley and parthasarathy 1983 mooley and pant 1981 some of the historic droughts caused famines in india that resulted in millions of deaths mishra et al 2019 the recent drought of 2015 affected crop production and water availability in the indo gangetic plain and maharashtra region mishra et al 2016 prakash 2018 the 2015 2016 drought affected a large part of south india with lower reservoir storage and hydropower production moreover about 330 million people in ten states were affected by the 2015 2016 drought unicef 2016 furthermore the 2015 16 drought caused a significant depletion in groundwater in the indo gangetic plain and southern states of india unicef 2016 considering the profound impacts of the recent droughts in india it is essential to compare the recent droughts with the most severe droughts that occurred in the past mishra et al 2019 reconstructed soil moisture droughts in india during 1870 2018 to evaluate the role of agricultural droughts in the famines that caused millions of deaths during the british period long term meteorological and hydrological droughts affect surface and groundwater resources which in turn hamper crop production leading to food insecurity funk et al 2008 recent studies reported the influence of drought on groundwater variability in india panda et al 2007 however most of the previous studies bhalme and mooley 1980 de et al 2005 gregory 1989 mallya et al 2015 mooley and parthasarathy 1983 thober et al 2015 mooley and pant 1981 are based on meteorological droughts primarily during the monsoon season and do not consider hydrological droughts in the monsoon season and water year june to may here we use the long term data to reconstruct the most severe deadly meteorological and hydrological droughts during the monsoon season and water year in india during the period of 1870 2018 understanding of the deadly meteorological and hydrological droughts in india enables to evaluate if the recent drought 2015 2018 is among the deadly droughts that occurred in india during 1870 2018 moreover the record of the major droughts in india during 1870 2018 can be useful to compare the severity of the future droughts that are likely to be driven by both monsoon season precipitation deficit and anthropogenic warming mishra and singh 2010 dai 2011 diffenbaugh et al 2015 mukherjee et al 2018 since long term droughts have implications for surface and groundwater storage we use reservoir storage and groundwater data to evaluate the impacts of the recent drought on surface and groundwater availability in india here we address three objectives i to reconstruct major meteorological and hydrological droughts in india during 1870 2018 and to compare the 2015 2018 drought against the most severe historical droughts ii to identify the linkage between seas surface temperature variability with the major droughts in india and iii to evaluate the impact of the recent drought 2015 2018 on surface and groundwater storage 2 data and methods 2 1 data we obtained 0 5 gridded daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures from mishra et al 2019 mishra et al 2019 extended precipitation data for 1870 1900 the precipitation data for the 1901 2018 period was obtained from the india meteorological department imd pai et al 2014 as mentioned in mishra et al 2019 the station data for precipitation was obtained for the period of 1870 1900 from imd which was carefully checked for quality inconsistency and missing data the number of stations varied between 517 in 1870 and 1600 in 1900 monthly precipitation climatology developed for 1870 1900 compared well with mean precipitation for post 1900 for both monsoon june september season as well as for water year june may all india averaged precipitation for 1870 2016 also compared well against the precipitation data developed at goddard institute for space science giss nasa by dai et al 1997 since imd temperature data is available only for the 1951 2018 period the temperature data for the entire period 1870 2018 was obtained from the berkeley earth which was bias corrected using temperature data from imd mishra et al 2019 monthly precipitation and temperature were used to develop daily data using resampling from 20th century reanalysis 20cr using the methodology described in wood et al 2002 further details on data development and evaluation can be obtained from mishra et al 2019 2 2 the variable infiltration capacity vic model we used the variable infiltration capacity vic model to simulate hydrologic variables total runoff surface runoff baseflow evapotranspiration et and soil moisture the vic model liang et al 1994 1996 cherkauer et al 2003 is a semi distributed macro scale hydrological model that simulates full water and energy budget for each grid cell the vic model takes soil vegetation and meteorological parameters daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and wind speed as input to simulate water and energy budget the model represents the sub grid variability of land use land cover and topography we conducted daily simulations using the vic model for the period of 1870 2018 which were aggregated to monthly scale to evaluate the hydrological droughts a detailed description of the vic model calibration and evaluation can be found in shah and mishra 2016 and mishra et al 2018 2 3 identification of major droughts we used the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 for identifying meteorological and hydrological droughts respectively spi and sri can be used to quantify precipitation total runoff surplus deficit at multiple time scales we used a non parametric approach to estimate spi sri for 12 month time scale as described in farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 we considered the 12 months from june to may to represent a water year in india about 80 of the total annual precipitation occurs during the monsoon period moreover the southern peninsula receives a significant amount of precipitation during the northeastern monsoon october to december season therefore 12 month spi sri at the end of may represents the cumulative precipitation total runoff for the entire water year and helps us to understand the hydrologic impacts of droughts we estimated the marginal probability of precipitation total runoff using the empirical gringorten plotting position gringorten 1963 to estimate spi sri the probabilities 0 1 were then converted to a standardized index using the standard normal gaussian cumulative distribution function cdf to estimate spi sri for the entire period 1870 2018 we used 1971 2000 as the reference period since the focus is on extreme droughts we used a threshold of 1 6 for identifying meteorological and hydrologic droughts svoboda et al 2002 we estimated three drought characteristics drought duration intensity and areal extent for each drought spell that was identified using all india aggregated spi sri the onset of a meteorological hydrological drought spell was considered if 12 month spi sri was below zero for more than three consecutive months the drought recovery was considered if 12 month spi sri remains above zero for more than three consecutive months we identify drought duration for each drought spell as the number of months for which 12 month spi sri intensity remains below zero we estimated the areal extent for each month using the number of grid cells with 12 month spi sri value less than or equal to 1 6 divided by the total number 1162 of grid cells in india the droughts are named based on their onset year for instance if a drought starts in year 2000 we refer it to 2000 drought regardless of the time of its peak or termination we estimated the intensity and areal extent for each month using the all india aggregated time series of 12 month spi sri we identified drought spells that occurred during 1870 2018 in india using 12 month spi sri among all the identified drought spells we selected only those that had maximum intensity 12 month spi sri higher than 1 6 and duration more than six months for the identified 12 month meteorological and hydrological droughts based on this criterion we estimated mean intensity cumulative intensity duration and drought severity for each drought spell then we estimated severity as the multiplication of mean intensity and mean areal extent during a drought spell the overall severity score was estimated by multiplying the severity and duration months of a drought spell we ranked both meteorological and hydrological droughts that occurred in each water year during 1870 2018 based on the overall severity score for instance the drought that has the highest overall severity score received the top rank among the selected droughts the five droughts with the highest overall severity score were termed as deadly droughts during the period of 1870 2017 here we assume that the large scale areal extent droughts that had high mean intensity and lasted longer caused more negative impacts however it is worth noting that drought impacts can be associated with the changes in population and economic growth rate for instance the recent droughts may be less severe but can cause more economic damage due to the development 2 4 linkage between drought and sea surface temperature sst variability we used the extended reconstructed sea surface temperature ersst v5 huang et al 2017 to evaluate the linkage between droughts and sst during 1870 2018 the global sst data is available from 1854 onwards at monthly and 2 0 temporal and spatial resolutions respectively we obtained nino 3 4 that is based on sst anomalies estimated after removing the mean sst in the tropical pacific for the period of 1870 2018 from ucar s climate data guide https www esrl noaa gov psd gcos wgsp timeseries data nino34 long datahttps www esrl noaa gov psd gcos wgsp timeseries data nino34 long data additionally we estimated sst anomalies for the nino 1 2 nino 3 and nino 4 to represent sst variability of the enso region in the pacific ocean based on the correlation analysis between sst and the monsoon season precipitation anomalies we estimated sst anomalies for the selected regions in the indian io and atlantic atl oceans 2 5 influence of drought on surface and groundwater storage in addition to spi and sri we estimated reservoir storage index rsi tiwari and mishra 2019 to identify periods of reservoir deficit observed reservoir storage data was obtained from india s water resources information systems india wris http www india wris nrsc gov in for the period of 2003 2018 central water commission cwc of india monitors reservoir storage of 91 major reservoirs in india rsi is similar to spi see tiwari and mishra 2019 for more details and can be used to monitor deficit or surplus reservoir storage condition for different time periods we used 1 month rsi to represent short term variation while 12 month rsi for long term variation in reservoir storage rsi was estimated for each of the major reservoirs and then aggregated for all the reservoirs to provide deficit surplus condition at all india level since droughts affect groundwater storage in india panda et al 2007 we used terrestrial water storage tws from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace tellus land from csr at 1 spatial and monthly temporal resolution for the period of 2002 2016 we estimated tws anomalies by removing monthly mean tws for the entire period 2002 2016 we estimated grace groundwater storage anomalies after removing soil moisture canopy storage and snow water equivalent from grace tws surface water storage total of soil moisture canopy storage snow water equivalent was obtained from the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 we obtained surface water storage from the four land surface models including vic noah clm and mosaic more information on the grace groundwater anomalies can be obtained from asoka et al 2017 since both tws and gw anomalies are influenced by groundwater pumping in india we removed trends in tws and gw anomalies using ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd huang and wu 2009 in contrast with the conventional detrending methods eemd estimates both linear and nonlinear trends in data more information on eemd and its application can be obtained from huang and wu 2009 to estimate the impacts of the deadly droughts on surface and groundwater resources long term observations of reservoir storage and groundwater are required however reservoir storage and groundwater data from grace is only available for the post 2002 period we therefore limit drought impact assessment on surface and groundwater resources to the post 2002 period only 3 results 3 1 deadly meteorological and hydrological droughts 3 1 1 major meteorological droughts 1870 2018 we identified the spells of meteorological 12 month spi and hydrological 12 month sri droughts during 1870 2018 fig 1 using all india averaged spi sri we selected only those drought spells that lasted more than six months and had maximum intensity higher than 1 6 which is used as a threshold to categorize an extreme drought svoboda et al 2002 we focused on a 12 month time scale for meteorological and hydrological droughts to avoid the influence of seasonality in the monsoon precipitation moreover the 12 month time period is important to consider the impacts of meteorological and hydrological droughts on agriculture and water resources sectors shukla and wood 2008 we identify 18 meteorological based on 12 month spi drought spells during 1870 2018 table 1 fig 1a the first such drought spell started from june 1876 and ended in july 1878 with maximum and mean intensities areal extent of 2 4 30 and 1 5 20 respectively table 1 the last meteorological drought spell during the entire record started in july 2015 and continued till december 2018 with a duration of 41 months the most recent meteorological drought the drought of 2015 2018 affected the maximum and mean area of 18 and 9 of the country respectively table 1 we also note that the most recent meteorological drought has the longest duration 41 months in the entire record of 1870 2018 the five deadly meteorological droughts 12 month spi based on overall severity score occurred in 1899 1876 2000 1918 and 1965 fig 1a table 1 the 1899 drought started in july 1899 and ended in august 1900 affecting more than 30 of the country with maximum and mean intensities of 3 0 and 2 3 respectively table 1 fig 1a the overall severity score of the 1899 drought was 1063 2 and the drought peaked based on intensity in june 1900 the second deadly meteorological drought based on 12 month spi started in june 1876 and lasted till july 1878 duration 25 months the drought affected more than 20 of the country during june 1876 and july 1878 with maximum and mean intensities of 2 5 and 1 5 respectively the 1876 drought peaked in september 1877 with the areal coverage of about 30 table 1 and fig 1a both 1899 and 1876 droughts caused famines in india mishra et al 2019 and resulted in millions of deaths the 1899 drought affected central and western parts while the 1876 drought was centered over southern and northern parts of india fig 1c d the third deadly meteorological drought started in september 2000 and ended in september 2003 table s1 the 2000 drought lasted about three years and peaked in june 2003 in june 2003 the drought affected more than 30 of the country the drought was mainly located in the central southern and northwestern parts of india bhat 2006 reported that the 2002 drought was caused by an all india precipitation deficit of 21 5 during the monsoon season and 56 deficit in july the precipitation deficit was 8 and 6 in 2000 and 2001 respectively shah et al 2009 the fourth and fifth ranked deadly meteorological droughts occurred in 1918 and 1965 with an overall severity score of 601 and 506 respectively table 1 fig 1 the 1918 drought started in september 1918 and ended in august 1919 and affected more than one fourth part a majority part of northwest india of the country the drought peaked in october 1918 with an areal extent of 38 5 and intensity of 3 table 1 the drought of 1965 started in july and ended in august of 1967 duration 25 months the drought peaked in april 1966 affecting more than 20 of the country primarily in central india fig 1 table 1 out of the top 10 meteorological droughts three 2000 2009 and 2015 occurred after 1980 and five occurred after 1950 the most recent meteorological drought started in july 2015 and continued till december 2018 duration 41 months the drought of 2015 is the longest drought in the entire record of a century and half period the drought peaked in june 2016 affecting more than 18 of the country table 1 however based on overall severity score the 2015 drought was substantially less severe ranked 9th among 18 major droughts than the deadly meteorological droughts table 1 3 1 2 major hydrological droughts 1870 2018 we identified 16 major hydrological droughts during 1870 2018 table 2 fig 1b the top five deadly hydrological droughts occurred in 1899 2000 1876 1965 and 1918 table 2 we note that at 12 month time scale most of these hydrological droughts were driven largely by meteorological droughts caused mainly due to the deficit in the monsoon season precipitation however warmer temperature and increased atmospheric demands can affect drought at shorter time scales mo and lettenmaier 2015 spatial patterns and intensity of hydrological droughts are consistent with the meteorological droughts the 2015 hydrological drought is the longest 40 months drought that affected more than 15 of the country however based on the overall severity score the 2015 hydrological drought is substantially less severe ranked 8th among 16 droughts than the deadly hydrological droughts that occurred during 1870 2018 fig 1 table 2 we note the difference in the ranking of meteorological and hydrological droughts for instance the 2003 meteorological drought was ranked third while the 2003 hydrological drought was ranked second among the major droughts similarly the 1966 meteorological drought ranked fifth while the hydrological drought of 1966 ranked fourth to further evaluate the role of precipitation and temperature on the major hydrological droughts we estimated 12 month anomalies of precipitation et total runoff and air temperature for each month considering the reference period of 1971 2000 fig 2 we find that temperature anomalies were negative for four except 2003 out of five major hydrological droughts indicating that precipitation deficit played a primary role in hydrological droughts fig 2 moreover for all the major hydrological droughts et and total runoff was anomalously low as et can be affected by both precipitation deficit and high temperature for most of the hydrological droughts lower et was largely due to the precipitation deficit the 2003 hydrological drought was caused by both precipitation deficit and positive temperature anomalies however as reported in bhat 2006 the significant deficit in the monsoon season precipitation during 2002 was a major driver of hydrological drought that peaked in 2003 our results indicate that the monsoon season precipitation remains a major contributor to hydrological droughts in india however high temperature anomalies due to anthropogenic warming can influence drought severity in the future diffenbaugh et al 2015 especially at shorter time scales mo and lettenmaier 2015 we estimated 20 major water year hydrological droughts based on 12 month sri at the end of may for 1870 2018 fig 3 we find that based on drought severity during a water year the top five hydrological droughts occurred in 1900 area 37 7 2003 22 8 1919 26 1966 23 and 1973 18 fig 3 the 2016 drought ranked 16th in the water year hydrological droughts and affected about 12 area of the country table 3 similarly monsoon season hydrological drought based on 4 month sri at the end of september 2018 and 2017 droughts ranked 12th and 17th among the top twenty droughts table s1 based on two consecutive water years hydrological droughts 2016 and 2017 ranked 10th and 19th respectively table s2 three consecutive water year hydrological drought in 2017 and 2018 ranked 17th and 13th during the entire record of 1870 2018 table s3 we estimated the frequency of major hydrological droughts fraction of the major 20 droughts for the monsoon 4 month sri and water year 12 24 and 36 month sri during the 1870 2018 fig 4 we define drought frequency for a grid point as the number of times the grid point was a part of a major hydrologic drought to the total number of major hydrologic droughts identified in the past 20 we aimed to understand if there are regions in india that were frequently affected by the major droughts at different time scales during the monsoon or water year we find that central and western regions of india were most frequently affected by the major hydrological droughts during 1870 2018 fig 4a d among the 20 major hydrological droughts that occurred after 1980 northwestern central and southern india were most frequently affected fig 4e h our results show that the southernmost part of india was most frequently affected by the major hydrological droughts that occurred for three consecutive years in the post 1980 period fig 4h 3 2 hydrological droughts at different time scales long term droughts directly impact hydrological systems streamflow groundwater runoff and water availability in india as experienced during the drought of 2015 mishra and singh 2010 mishra et al 2016 to understand the implications of hydrological droughts we identified the top five hydrological droughts that occurred in each month of the calendar year based on 12 month sri fig 5 a this allows us to benchmark the historical droughts in the context of the recent the 2015 2018 drought droughts in india we find that for most of the months except august 1899 1900 hydrological drought was the deadliest during the entire record fig 5a moreover the hydrological drought of 2002 2003 ranked second for most of the months during 1870 2018 fig 5a the 2002 hydrological drought based on 12 month sri was the worst drought that india experienced in august overall the findings show that the 1899 1900 and 2002 2003 hydrological droughts are the deadliest in the entire record 1870 2018 we identified the deadly droughts based on severity based on 4 12 24 and 36 month sri during 1870 2016 fig 5b to do so we considered hydrological drought in the monsoon season 4 month sri at the end of september and 1 3 water year hydrological droughts represented by 12 24 and 36 month sri at the end of may we find that the deadliest monsoon season hydrological droughts occurred in 1918 intensity 2 4 area 35 8 followed by 1899 2 3 33 5 1877 2 4 29 6 2002 2 3 22 5 and 1987 1 5 24 3 the 1918 hydrological drought during the monsoon season affected a large part of western india fig 5c table s1 as previously mentioned the worst water year based on 12 month sri drought occurred in 1900 2 6 37 7 which affected a majority of western and central parts of the country fig 5b d the other top four water year hydrological droughts occurred in 2003 2 6 22 8 1919 2 2 26 1966 2 5 23 and 1973 2 3 18 3 the 1967 2 3 24 3 was the deadliest hydrological drought based on the two consecutive water years fig 5b e table s2 which affected a major part of the indo gangetic plain and central india the other top four hydrological droughts for two consecutive water years occurred in 1900 2 0 24 1906 2 1 21 2 1878 1 7 20 5 and 2003 2 0 17 1 table s2 similarly the top five hydrological droughts for three consecutive years occurred in 2003 2 3 22 1968 1 87 17 2 1900 1 8 17 7 1878 1 4 20 7 and 1967 1 6 16 3 table s3 the 36 month drought in water year in 2003 affected the majority of western and southern india fig 5f we notice that 1899 1900 and 2002 2003 hydrological drought featured among the top five for 4 36 month time scales we find that the 2015 2018 meteorological hydrological drought was the longest duration drought fig 1 despite the low overall severity score mainly due to the less 9 areal extent therefore we compared the severity of the 2015 drought against the deadliest drought based on 4 36 month sri that occurred during 1870 2018 fig 5g i we find that the most severe hydrological drought in the monsoon season 4 month sri at the end of september during 2015 2018 occurred in 2018 the hydrological drought of 2018 monsoon season mainly affected eastern and northeastern parts of the country fig 5g however the 2018 monsoon season hydrological drought did not feature among the deadly droughts that occurred in the last century and half period similarly the most severe one and two water year hydrological drought during 2015 2018 occurred in 2016 may 2016 which mainly affected the northern and central parts of the country fig 5h i moreover the most severe hydrological drought based on the three consecutive water years occurred in 2018 may 2018 that affected the indo gangetic plain and the southern tip of the southern peninsula fig 5j we note that notwithstanding the longest duration of the 2015 2018 drought the severity was significantly lesser than the deadly droughts that occurred during 1870 2018 tables s2 s4 3 3 linkage between deadly meteorological droughts and sst variability since most of the hydrological droughts are driven by the meteorological droughts we evaluated the large scale sea surface temperature sst conditions that caused the deadly meteorological droughts during 1870 2018 fig 6 we used the monsoon season sst anomalies to diagnose their linkage with the deadly meteorological droughts 12 month spi fig 6 results show that 12 month spi was negative from july 1899 to august 1900 with the highest intensity in june 1900 fig 6a warmer sst anomalies in the nino 3 4 region 5n 5s 170w 120w occurred during the entire 1899 drought fig 6a moreover warmer sst anomalies during the monsoon season were present in the central and northern pacific and northern atlantic regions fig 6b however cold sst anomalies were found in the indian ocean region from june to september of 1899 the linkage between the monsoon failure in india and el nino is well established sikka 1980 kumar 1999 kumar 2003 mishra et al 2012 we show that the deadliest drought of 1899 was associated with el nino fig 6b the second deadliest meteorological drought started in 1876 which was associated with warmer sst anomalies from june to september of 1877 fig 6c d both nino 3 4 and sst anomalies indicate a strong el nino in 1877 kripalani and kulkarni 1997 singh et al 2018 moreover the 1876 drought was partly associated with the record strong indian ocean dipole fig 6d we note la nina like condition at the beginning of the 1876 drought which was later converted to strong el nino the positive phase of enso and indian ocean dipole favors precipitation during the northeastern monsoon rajeevan et al 2012 the 1876 drought was mainly centered in south india that might be linked to la nina conditions moreover the drought shifted to north india in 1877 which is attributable to the summer monsoon variability and its linkage with el nino nevertheless both 1899 and 1876 droughts caused famines in india that resulted in significant human mortality singh et al 2018 we note that both of these droughts were strongly associated with el nino during the monsoon season the third most deadly meteorological drought occurred between 2000 and 2003 in india fig 6d e we find that at the beginning of the drought cooler sst anomalies were present in the nino 3 4 region however during the monsoon season of 2002 warmer sst anomalies were present not only in the central pacific but also in the indian ocean regions therefore the drought of 2000 can be attributed to warmer sst conditions in the pacific and indian oceans the drought was caused by an unprecedented break in the monsoon during july 2002 saith and slingo 2006 saith and slingo 2006 reported that el nino and madden julian oscillation mjo played an important role in the 2002 drought in india the sst anomalies were moderately positive in the nino 3 4 region during the 1918 drought that started in september 1918 and ended in august 1919 fig 6h we find warmer sst anomalies in the eastern and northern pacific regions during the monsoon season of 1918 kripalani and kulkarni 1997 similarly the 1965 drought was caused by a strong el nino as revealed by both nino 3 4 and sst anomaly over the central pacific ocean fig 6i j overall our results show that all five most deadly meteorological droughts during 1870 2018 were associated with el nino to further establish the linkage between sst anomalies in the equatorial pacific ocean and monsoon season precipitation in india we estimated the correlation between all india monsoon season precipitation anomaly and observed sst fig 7 as reported in previous studies kumar 1999 kumar 2003

we estimated the linkage between sst anomalies and monsoon season precipitation for the six homogeneous regions fig s1 our results show that at the regional scale also enso is the major driver of the monsoon season precipitation variability in india tables s4 s8 moreover for most of the regions a weakening of enso and strengthening of indian and atlantic oceans sst relationship with monsoon season precipitation was observed tables s4 s8 overall results show that the linkage between summer monsoon precipitation and indian io 4n 20s 70e 100e and atlantic ocean sst has strengthened while the relationship with enso has weakened during 1980 2018 therefore the droughts during the recent decades e g 1987 2002 2009 2015 2018 droughts may be partly associated with sst anomalies in the indian and pacific oceans table 5 figs 6 8 3 4 impacts of 2015 2018 drought on surface and groundwater resources finally we evaluate the evolution of 2015 2018 hydrological and meteorological droughts in india fig 9 we find that poor monsoon season precipitation in 2014 and 2015 contributed to hydrological drought in 2015 fig 9a b the hydrological drought based on 12 month sri peaked in march 2015 affecting indo gangetic plain and northeastern regions however we find that the intensity of drought 12 month spi sri increased significantly in 2016 primarily due to weak monsoon in 2015 a majority of india was affected by the hydrological drought in june 2016 and drought was more intense in the indo gangetic plain and maharashtra regions fig 9a b e we also find a strong positive nino 3 4 anomaly that started in 2015 and continued till may 2016 the 2015 2016 el nino was one of the strongest in the past century that affected weather and climate extremes across the globe blunden and arndt 2016 in 2017 the strong el nino was translated into moderate la nina conditions that peaked during the northeastern monsoon season october december as a result southern india experienced poor northeastern monsoon season precipitation during 2016 and 2017 causing hydrological drought in the region fig 9a b f at the end of 2018 a large part of the country including northeastern western and central parts experienced hydrological drought fig 9a b g however hydrological drought in june 2016 and september 2017 was worse than in december 2018 the 2015 2018 drought had an enormous impact on surface and groundwater resources in india we estimated 1 and 12 month rsi for the 91 major reservoirs in india to identify the impacts of 2015 2018 droughts fig 10 from 12 month rsi we find that there were four major droughts that affected reservoir storage in india fig 10a b the 2002 drought affected reservoir storage significantly across the country the deficit in reservoir storage started in january 2003 and continued till november 2005 with a duration of 35 months the peak deficit in reservoir storage in india due to the 2002 drought occurred in october 2003 the 2009 and 2012 droughts also affected reservoir storage in india reservoir storage deficit started in april 2009 and ended in december 2010 with a duration of 12 months similarly the 2012 drought affected reservoir storage for 10 months between october 2012 and july 2013 after the 2002 drought the 2015 2018 drought affected the reservoir storage for the longest duration of 31 months peak reservoir deficit occurred in august 2016 table 6 we find that the reservoir storage was greatly affected by the 2015 2018 drought as reflected by both 1 and 12 month rsi fig 10a b this was the worst drought after 2002 that affected surface water storage in india a majority of the major reservoirs experienced a deficit in the storage in 2015 2016 and 2017 fig 10c f we used grace data to examine the influence of 2015 2018 drought on tws and groundwater anomalies fig 11 however as the grcae data is only available for the period 2002 2016 the impact of drought in 2017 and 2018 was not evaluated we removed the non linear trend using eemd from tws and groundwater anomalies to exclude the effect of groundwater pumping on the long term depletion of groundwater both north and south india experienced a deficit in tws and groundwater storage due to major droughts for instance the effect of 2002 drought on tws and groundwater anomalies can be seen predominantly in south india fig 11b d on the other hand north india witnessed a significant groundwater depletion due to pumping for irrigation and changes in precipitation characteristics rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 asoka et al 2017 the 2009 drought greatly affected tws and groundwater in north india fig 11a c e f and i j however we find that the difference between raw and detrended tws and gw is not substantial during 2009 2010 which indicates relatively less influence of groundwater pumping the 2015 2018 drought affected tws and gw both in the north and south india fig 11 a substantial difference in the raw and detrended tws and groundwater storage anomalies indicate possibly a large impact of groundwater pumping during the recent years nevertheless the impacts of drought are substantial in the north and south india on both tws and groundwater storage 4 discussion we reconstructed meteorological and hydrological droughts in india for 1870 2018 the analysis points towards the three major findings first there have been a number of meteorological total 18 and hydrological total 16 drought spells in india that lasted for more than six months and with peak intensity higher than 1 6 however based on the overall severity score the five deadly meteorological droughts occurred in 1899 1876 2000 1918 and 1965 on the other hand the five deadliest hydrological droughts that affected the country were 1899 2000 1876 1965 and 1918 secondly all the five deadliest meteorological or hydrological droughts were linked with the positive phase of enso el nino the 1876 drought was affected by enso and indian ocean dipole while the recent droughts were associated with enso as well as sst conditions in the indian and atlantic oceans the role of indian and atlantic ocean sst on the monsoon season precipitation in india has increased during the recent decades 1980 2018 thirdly the longest meteorological hydrological drought in india occurred during 2015 2018 that affected various parts of india the 2015 drought was caused by strong el nino in 2015 and indian ocean dipole in 2017 and affected both north and southern parts of the country however the most recent meteorological drought ranked 9th out of total 18 during the period of 1870 2018 similarly the 2015 18 hydrological drought was ranked 8th among total 16 drought spells in the entire record of a century and half period therefore based on the overall severity score the 2015 18 drought is significantly less severe than the deadly droughts in india however based on the limited record of reservoir storage and groundwater during 2002 2018 we find that the recent drought had a significant influence on surface and groundwater availability in india the rapid decline in groundwater in north india rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 makes the region vulnerable to tackle the adverse impacts of drought droughts have had lasting impacts on socio economic conditions food and water security and gdp of india for instance the two 1899 and 1876 deadliest droughts caused famines in india and resulted in the death of millions of people mishra et al 2019 both of these droughts were linked to the positive phase of enso singh et al 2018 mishra et al 2019 gadgil and gadgil 2006 reported that severe droughts in india impact 2 5 of gdp according to the international disasters database em dat emdat be the 1965 drought that affected the entire nation except the southern part affected about 100 million people of india the drought severely affected parts of bihar and caused more than 2000 deaths in india and half of which occurred in bihar lancaster 1990 the food production declined by 19 during the 1965 drought the drought of 1965 contributed to building a reliable public distribution system pds to take care of food emergencies in india drought report 1987 the 2002 drought year was declared all india drought by the india meteorological department imd about 30 of the country was affected by drought due to more than 25 precipitation deficit during the monsoon season the drought of 2000 caused 22 reduction in rice production while the production of oilseeds and wheat was declined by 23 5 and 9 5 respectively shah et al 2009 the 2002 drought affected more than 300 million people in india em dat and gdp growth declined by 1 the 2002 drought caused about 39 000 crores inr loss in agricultural income the drought also resulted in a severe water crisis as the government had to supply about 1 5 billion liters water every day for nearly for four months mahapatra 2015 https www downtoearth org in blog drought forever 44976 overall based on the previous studies and datasets we note that the deadly droughts had significant impacts on water resources agriculture and economy of india our results also show that the 2015 2018 drought was considerably less severe in comparison to major droughts that occurred during 1870 2018 however it had lasting impacts on surface and groundwater resources unfortunately it is not possible to estimate the impacts of deadly droughts on surface and groundwater in india during 1870 2018 due to the lack of observational data however the impacts of 2015 2018 drought were clearly visible on both reservoir and groundwater storage overall we find that depletion of groundwater storage due to pumping combined with the influence of long term droughts together can pose serious challenges to water security in india 5 conclusions based on our findings the following conclusions can be made 1 we reconstructed meteorological and hydrological droughts in india for 1870 2018 period based on our selection criterion we identified 18 meteorological and 16 hydrological droughts the five deadly meteorological droughts occurred in 1899 1876 2000 1918 and 1965 while the five major hydrological droughts occurred in 1899 2000 1876 1965 and 1918 the meteorological and hydrological drought of 1899 was the most severe in the entire record of 1870 2018 2 the severity of the most recent drought 2015 2018 was considerably lesser than the deadly meteorological and hydrological droughts that affected india which can be attributed to a less areal extent however the recent drought had the longest duration 41 months among all the major droughts in india the 2015 2018 drought ranked 9th and 8th among the major meteorological and hydrological droughts 3 the most deadly top five meteorological droughts were caused by the positive sst anomalies over the pacific enso remains the major driver of the monsoon season precipitation in india however the role of sst variability in indian and atlantic oceans has increased during the recent decades 1980 2018 4 the 2015 2018 drought had a remarkable impact on reservoir and groundwater storage in india suggesting that long term droughts can influence water security in one of the most populous regions of the world in addition rapid groundwater depletion combined with long term droughts can pose serious challenges for water availability in
