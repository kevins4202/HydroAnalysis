19760,capacitive deionization cdi for water treatment which relies on the capture of charged species to sustain the electrical double layers edls established within porous electrodes under an applied electrical potential can be enhanced by the chemical attachment of fixed charged groups to the porous electrode electrodes ecdi it has recently been demonstrated that further improvements in capacity and energy storage can be gained by functionalization of the electrode surfaces with redox polymers in which the charge on the electrodes can be modulated through faradaic reactions under different cell voltages in a capacitive process that can be called faradaic cdi facdi here we extend recent mathematical models developed for the characterization of cdi and ecdi systems to incorporate the redox mediated contributions by allowing for the variable chemical charges generated by reactions in facdi the lumped model developed here assumes the spacer channel is well mixed with uniform electrosorption in each electrode we demonstrate that the salt adsorption performance characterization of the fixed chemical charge ecdi and variable chemical charge facdi materials can be unified within a common theoretical framework based on the point of zero charge pzc of the electrode material in the latter case the pzc is determined by the equilibrium potentials of the redox couples immobilized on the porous electrodes the new model is able to predict the experimentally observed enhanced and inverted performance of cdi cells and illuminates the benefit of choosing redox active materials for water treatment applications the deionization performance of facdi cells is shown to be superior to that of cdi and ecdi systems with equilibrium adsorption capacities 50 100 higher than attained with cdi systems and at smaller cell voltages depending on the redox potentials of the faradaic moieties keywords water treatment capacitive deionization electrical double layer theory electrochemical process modeling redox electrodes with faradaic reactions 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is an attractive technology for brackish water desalination that has received increasing attention in recent years suss et al 2015 the benefit of cdi over the current water treatment approaches such as distillation and reverse osmosis is that no heat treatment and no high pressure pumps are required and thus the operational costs for the separation process are lower in particular for low concentration brackish water in the range between 10 and 50 mm desalination techniques focused on removing the relatively few ions in solution are energetically more attractive than conventional water treatment methods that call for the removal of water from the salt containing solution cdi technology is based on ion electrosorption at the surfaces and in the pores of two closely spaced electrodes commonly composed of highly porous carbon materials when the electrodes are charged anions and cations in the saline water move towards the oppositely charged electrodes anode and cathode respectively to sustain the formation of electrical double layers edls at the electrode surfaces and are physically adsorbed in the electrode pores by electrostatic interaction the feed stream is thereby partially depleted of the salts or deionized the ions can be released to a receiving water stream by a short circuiting the electrodes or reduction of the cell voltage resulting in a concentrated brine the most commonly investigated cdi electrodes are composed of porous carbon materials because of their extraordinary chemical mechanical and thermal stability as well as their high surface areas on the order of 1000 m2 g wu et al 2015 activated carbon fibers wang et al 2012 carbon aerogels xu et al 2008 mesoporous carbon tsouris et al 2011 carbon nanotubes zhang et al 2012 and hybrid materials yin et al 2013 have all been widely studied as electrode materials for the cdi cells more recently it has been shown that chemical charges immobilized on the porous carbon materials can play an important role in the desalination performance since they change the structure of the electrical double layer and affect significantly the deionization performance the chemical charge can be introduced via the chemical immobilization of sulfonic groups or amine groups within the micropores of the electrode materials gao et al 2015a marino et al 2014 or by the generation of carboxylic groups by chemical oxidation wu et al 2015 in recent experiments it has been shown that with the introduction of a positive charge at the anode and a negative charge at the cathode enhanced cdi ecdi performance can be achieved andelman 2014 gao et al 2016 wu et al 2015 however if the electrodes are modified by the opposite charge i e anodes are modified with negatively charged moieties and cathodes with positively charged groups an inversion of the cdi process occurs in the inverted cdi icdi region ions are desorbed from the electrodes during the charging step and the cell effluent is a brine deionization only occurs during the discharge process where the cell voltage is zero cohen et al 2015 gao et al 2015b omosebi et al 2015 a quantitative theory was proposed by biesheuvel et al 2015a 2015b to explain these experimental phenomena recently another category of materials has been investigated in which redox active species are incorporated within the porous carbon matrix with these materials electrostatic interactions of salt ions with faradaically induced charges add to ions incorporated within the electric double layers formed at the electrode surfaces to provide a much higher adsorption capacity than attained in purely capacitive processes this process which was called pseudocapactive separation in the original paper achilleos and hatton 2016 is better identified as faradaic capacitive deionization facdi a naming convention we will use in this paper these redox active ligands su et al 2017a 2017b 2016 su and hatton 2017a 2017b can be considered as variable chemical charges that depend on the cell voltage as opposed to the fixed charges which have been explored recently by the cdi community andelman 2014 cohen et al 2015 gao et al 2015a 2015b marino et al 2014 omosebi et al 2015 wu et al 2015 yang et al 2013 these hybrid materials can be prepared through the modification of the carbon electrode surfaces with redox active polymers previous work published by mao et al 2013 reported the design of hybrid polyvinylferrocene carbon nanotube pvf cnt materials to increase the specific capacitance of the electrode su et al 2017b 2016 su and hatton 2017a 2017b were the first to apply this material for water treatment and further demonstrated the reversibility and selectivity of these variable oxidation state electrodes for anion adsorption and can be further used for protein separation su et al 2017a achilleos and hatton 2016 also showed that these electrodes have significantly higher capacities than reported for conventional cdi technologies intercalation based battery like electrodes such as those prepared with sodium manganese oxide na0 44mno2 smith 2017 smith and dmello 2016 involve bulk storage of ions and exhibit higher salt adsorption capacity compared with purely capacitive electrodes lee et al 2014 the salt uptake mechanisms that rely on bulk faradaic reactions are different from those governing our redox active facdi electrodes which rely on surface faradaic reactions and double layer charging for their effectiveness we limit our scope to surface functionalized redox active polymer systems the model proposed by biesheuvel et al 2015a 2015b extended the classical theory of electrosorption for microporous electrodes to include also the chemical charges immobilized within the micropores by chemical modification or treatment these charges were assumed to be fixed in value the theory was able to explain experimentally observed adsorption enhancement and inversion performance due to chemical modification with different fixed chemical charge polarities by nitric acid and ethylenediamine treatment gao et al 2016 the theory also predicts a new operating regime in which a higher equilibrium adsorption capacity than provided by current cdi processes can be obtained by extending the operation voltage window the facdi electrode materials share many common features with chemically modified fixed charge electrodes the presence of the redox active polymers within the porous carbon materials provides immobile chemical charges anionic or cationic ligands at the electrode electrolyte interface that depend on the cell voltage specifically for facdi materials in which the chemical charge is a result of the redox activity of the ligands i e of faradaic reactions the charge is not maintained at a fixed value but rather varies with the cell voltage as indicated by the nernst equation 1 δ ϕ eq δ ϕ eq θ k b t n e ln a ox a red where δ ϕ eq θ is the equilibrium potential for the faradaic reaction at the standard state k b is the boltzmann constant t is temperature e is the charge of an electron n is the number of electrons transferred and a ox and a red are the activities of the oxidized and reduced species respectively cdi models that include the variable chemical charge on the electrode surface have been proposed recently by hemmatifar et al 2017 and dykstra et al 2017 the former included the equilibrium distribution of acidic and basic groups within the carbon matrix as determined by the equilibrium constants of the individual surface functional groups p k s in the absence of faradaic reactions the latter study included the acidic or basic surface charge groups generated in accord with the equilibrium constant of water dissociation p k w and water reduction reaction both models were used to explain experimentally observed changes in ph in this work we incorporate the effect of variable chemical charge due to general faradaic reactions of redox species immobilized on the electrode surfaces and propose a suitable extension of the theory biesheuvel et al 2015a 2015b to explain the observed performance enhancement and inversion behavior the model indicates the promise of increasing the salt adsorption capacity through the use of facdi cells 2 theory the facdi cell is assumed to be composed of two redox active porous carbon electrodes separated by a spacer channel through which a monovalent binary salt e g n a and c l z z 1 solution flows the fluid is assumed to be well mixed within the spacer channel and mass transfer limitations to the electrodes are ignored these restrictions are introduced to enable a focus on the ion distribution within the pores of the electrodes and can be lifted in an extended full two dimensional transport model other cdi modes can be analyzed as special cases of this model a schematic of the model is shown in fig 1 in accord with typical assumptions made in cdi models the porous carbon material is assumed to consist of two types of pores macropores and micropores biesheuvel et al 2011 biesheuvel and bazant 2010 the macropores form free channels between the carbon particles and allow for the transport of ions across the electrode where electroneutrality is assumed i e the ion concentrations are related to the salt concentration by c ma c ma c ma electrical double layers are formed in the nanometer sized micropores distributed throughout the carbon particles allowing for preferential adsorption of counter ions and expulsion of co ions since mass transfer limitations are assumed to be negligible the concentrations of ions in the macropores are assumed to be the same as in the spacer channel in the micropores however the anion and cation concentrations are different with the difference being defined as the ionic charge within the solution i e σ ionic c mi c mi the modified donnan md model biesheuvel et al 2014 2012 2011 is utilized to describe the edl structure within the porous carbon electrodes in addition to the mobile ionic charge σ ionic allowance must be made for the carbon surface electronic charge σ elec induced by the cell voltage and the immobile chemical charge σ chem associated with either fixed charge chemical functionalities or variable potential dependent redox active moieties the md model is based on the assumption that the micropore diameter is much smaller than the debye length the length scale of the diffuse layer such that the edls formed along the pore surfaces overlap strongly to yield an almost invariant electrostatic potential and ion concentration within a micropore the concentration of ions in the micropores can therefore be considered to be volume averaged quantities expressed in terms of moles per micropore volume electroneutrality within the micropores is assured by the specification that 2 σ ionic σ elec σ chem 0 the potential drop between the outside macropores and the solution within the micropores is defined as the donnan potential δ ϕ d the micropore concentration is related to the concentration in the macropore via the boltzmann distribution 3 c j mi c ma exp z j δ ϕ d μ att j here μ att is a non electrostatic attractive interaction term arising from the image charge interactions within the porous carbon biesheuvel et al 2014 without which the predicted salt adsorption capacity can have unrealistically high values since the salt concentration considered here is as low as 20 mm where the ion crowding effect is still small we will neglect the attractive force for simplicity for a fully dissociated monovalent salt such as nacl the equations for the boltzmann equilibria for anions and cations the donnan potential δ ϕ d and the total ion concentration within the micropores c ions mi can be combined biesheuvel et al 2015a 2015b 2014 porada et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 to give 4 δ ϕ d arcsinh σ ionic 2 c ma 5 c ions mi 2 σ ionic 2 4 c ma 2 a second potential drop δ ϕ s across a nanoscopic stern layer is related to the electronic charge density σ elec in the carbon matrix via a constant capacitance c s which is the volumetric stern layer capacitance in unit of f ml assumed in the literature biesheuvel et al 2015a porada et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 to be in the range of 120 f ml to 200 f ml it is attributed to the dielectric constant of the solvent molecule and the material properties of the porous electrode 6 δ ϕ s σ elec f v t c s both δ ϕ d and δ ϕ s in the model are dimensionless potentials scaled by the thermal voltage v t k b t e 0 0257 v at 25 c in addition to these two potential drops due to the accumulation of charges an ohmic potential drop due to the ionic current passing through the electrolyte in the spacer channel and macropores also contributes to the total cell voltage the ohmic potential drop is assumed to be inversely proportional to the salt concentration c ma according to r ω α c ma where α is the charge transport resistance coefficient which depends on the geometry of the channel and the porosity and length of the macropores the overall cell potential is then 7 v cell v t δ ϕ s δ ϕ d a δ ϕ s δ ϕ d c i r ω v t the electronic charge of the two electrodes should be balanced if we do not consider asymmetric faradaic reaction rates at the two electrodes and thus 8 m a v mi a σ elec a m c v mi c σ elec c 0 for simplicity the electrode masses m e and micropore porosities v mi defined as volume per electrode mass are assumed to be the same for both electrodes i e m a m c m e v mi a v mi c v mi respectively biesheuvel et al 2015a and thus so must be the concentrations of electronic charges at the anode and the cathode i e σ elec a σ elec c the theory can be easily generalized to allow for electrodes with differences in mass and porosity the traditional enhanced cdi process ecdi relies on fixed charges within the micropores that do not respond to changes in the cell voltage this is not the case for faradaic systems however where the charge depends on the potential in accord with the nernst equation equation 1 the kinetics for generation of this chemical charge are assumed to be governed by the butler volmer equation at the anode a generic redox reaction is described as r a o a e the reduced state r a has zero charge and the oxidized state o a a charge of 1 one example is the ferrocene ferrocenium redox couple as described in ref su et al 2016 the chemical charge on the anode σ chem a is thus equivalent to the concentration of oxidized o a moieties the total number of chemical ligands within the micropore including both the reduced and oxidized states γ v can be estimated from the surface site density γ s and specific surface area a i e via γ v γ s a the concentration of functional groups in the reduced state is then c r a γ v σ chem a the rate of generation of the charged faradaic species is given in terms of these quantities by the generalized frumkin butler volmer equation 9 r f k r a σ chem a exp δ ϕ s 2 k o a γ v σ chem a exp δ ϕ s 2 r f is defined to be positive for the reduction reaction and negative for oxidation since the immobilized redox moieties are at atomic distance from the electronically conductive electrode it is the stern layer voltage drop δ ϕ s that contributes to the activation barriers assuming there is no diffuse charge contribution therefore in contrast to the empirical butler volmer equation which attributes the total driving force to the voltage drop between the electrode surface and the electrically neutral bulk solution equation 9 is applied just across the stern layer bazant et al 2005 biesheuvel et al 2009 the transfer coefficients are assumed to be α r α o 1 2 for the single electron transfer reaction and k r a and k o a are kinetic rate constants for the reduction and oxidation reactions respectively at the anode at equilibrium the potential drop across the stern layer δ ϕ s eq a is related to the chemical charge at the anode if δ ϕ s eq a θ is the standard state equilibrium potential of the redox couple where the activities of the activated and neutral states of the chemical moieties are equal i e σ chem a γ v σ chem a γ v 2 then 10 δ ϕ s eq a δ ϕ s eq a θ ln σ chem a γ v σ chem a ln k a σ chem a γ v σ chem a 11 δ ϕ s eq a θ ln k a ln k r a k o a for a symmetric cell the cathode is modified with a redox active polymer which undergoes the faradaic reaction o c e r c during the charging process the oxidized state is charge neutral and the reduced state has a negative charge of 1 if the equilibrium potential of the redox couple at the cathode has the same magnitude but opposite polarity as the couple at the anode then the equilibrium constant k c k a 1 and at equilibrium σ chem a σ chem c since it has been assumed that σ elec a σ elec c the ionic charge within the micropores of the two electrodes should also balance such that σ ionic a σ ionic c similarly the stern layer voltage drop δ ϕ s and donnan potential δ ϕ d at the anode and the cathode have the same magnitudes but are of opposite sign thus for the purposes of this analysis we can focus on the anodic variables and readily derive the results for the cathodic system using the symmetry conditions on combining equations 1 4 6 8 and 10 and recognizing that the ionic current is zero at equilibrium we can express the overall cell potential in terms of σ chem a 12 v cell 2 v t δ ϕ s a δ ϕ d a ln k a σ chem a γ v σ chem a arcsinh σ chem a σ

from which the equilibrium salt adsorption capacity eqsac can be determined defined as the total mass of salt within the micropores per unit mass of the electrodes biesheuvel et al 2015a 13 eqsac c ions mi m a v mi a m w 2 m a 1 2 c ions mi v mi a m w where each electrode has mass m a since symmetric electrodes have been assumed for practical operations the working salt adsorption capacity wsac suss et al 2015 is defined as mg salt removed per gram of the combined electrodes and is the difference between the equilibrium salt capacities at the end of the charging and the discharge operations respectively thus 14 wsac δeqsac 1 2 δ c ions mi v mi a m w this is the quantity of interest when the effectiveness of cdi operations is evaluated the dynamic adsorption desorption cycles can also be simulated to provide further insight into the effects of chemical modification variable or fixed chemical charge on the operational performance of the cell the simple model assumes again that the spacer channel is well mixed and the ion concentrations in the macropores and in the spacer channel are the same as c ma the concentrations of the inflow and outflow streams are c in and c ma respectively a mass balance over the cdi cell gives 15 v tot d c ma d t φ c in c ma 1 2 j ions a j ions c where v tot is the volume of the spacer channel and macropores φ is the stream flow rate through the cell and the residence time τ v tot φ the ionic flux j ions i i a c is from the macropores to the micropores for the anode j ions a can be related to the rate of salt concentration change within the micropores by 16 m a v mi a d c ions mi a d t j ions a the rate of generation of chemical charge is related to the faradaic reaction kinetics described in equation 9 17 d σ chem a d t r f a the volumetric rate constant k r a can be estimated from the intrinsic rate constant k r 0 the specific area a and the electrode mass m a for the oxidation rate constant we have k o a k r a k a for electrodes with no faradaic reactions the electronic current passing through the external circuit equals the ionic current passing through the electrolyte in the spacer channel and macropores and the magnitude of each is defined as the total current with faradaic reactions at the electrode however the total current i is related to the changes in electronic charge due to the development of the double layer and the faradaically driven chemical reactions but is not affected by fixed charges on the micropore surfaces and thus is equivalently related to the rate of change of the ionic charge 18 i m a v mi a f d σ elec a d t r f a d σ ionic a d t then the cell potential can be written as 19 v cell v t 2 arcsinh σ ionic a 2 c ma 2 σ ionic a σ chem a f v t c s i α v t c ma equations 15 19 and equation 5 can be combined to generate a set of differential algebraic equations for the description of the adsorption behavior within a symmetric cell 3 results and discussion the model developed in this work for the description of ion distributions in porous carbon electrodes under both equilibrium and dynamic conditions is used here to assess the enhancement in cdi performance afforded by the functionalization of the micropores with redox active moieties whose charge can be modulated by the cell voltage we compare the results for standard cdi with those for both enhanced fixed charge edci and faradaically mediated facdi processes inverted deionization scenarios are also explored the results discussed here are based on a symmetric two electrode cell with the same mass micropore volume and chemical charge albeit of opposite sign on the cathode relative to the anode for each electrode although the model can be easily extended to asymmetric cases for the calculations which are based on 1 g of electrode mass m e and a value of 0 507 ml g for the micropore volume v mi the capacitance of the electrode c s is set at 170 f ml the parameters used in the model calculations are summarized in table 1 the concentration γ v of either the fixed charges or the redox groups on the functionalized electrodes is assumed to be 0 4 m at each electrode which is a reasonable estimate for porous electrodes the equilibrium constant is determined from k a e δ ϕ s eq a θ v t equilibrium anion salt adsorption results determined at δ ϕ s eq a θ 0 1 v and δ ϕ s eq c θ 0 1 v are shown in fig 2 in fig 2 a the ion concentrations in the micropores c ions mi a of the facdi electrode with variable chemical charge σ chem a v cell σ chem c v cell are compared with the micropore concentrations in electrodes with no chemical charge σ chem a σ chem c 0 and with fixed chemical charge σ chem a σ chem c 0 4 m for the unmodified electrodes the salt adsorption capacity is symmetric depending only on the absolute magnitude of the cell voltage at 0 v the salt adsorption is at its minimum value of 2 c ma corresponding to the initial salt concentration in the spacer channel when the charge of anions and cations exactly compensate each other σ ionic 0 the electrode is said to be at the point of zero charge pzc upon application of a positive cell potential anions are preferentially adsorbed at the anode and cations at the cathode and hence ion concentration increases with v cell for the electrodes modified with a fixed chemical charge the pzc shifts towards a negative voltage of 0 45 v thus since counter ions to these fixed charges are required to maintain electroneutrality in the absence of an external potential v cell 0 v the ion concentration is not at its minimum value indeed a negative cell voltage of 0 45 v pzc is required to desorb the counter ions fully and achieve a minimum ion concentration it is of interest to note that for the chemically modified electrodes there are two pzcs biesheuvel et al 2015b one corresponding to σ ionic 0 at 0 45 v which is also the potential at which the minimum ion concentration of c ma is found and the other to σ elec 0 which occurs at around 0 15 v not shown in fig 2 a for the electrode modified with fixed chemical charge at 0 4 m we refer to the former as the pzc in the following discussion fig 2 a shows that with variable chemical charge the ion concentration in the micropores exhibits an asymmetric behavior around 0 v initially at 0 v most of the redox active ligands are in their reduced state and σ chem is small at around 0 0074 m upon application of a positive cell potential which drives the anodic faradaic reaction towards oxidation ion concentration increases with an increase in the value of σ ionic caused by both the double layer charging process and the increased σ chem induced by the faradaic reactions when the cell potential is above 0 65 v the ion concentration approaches that of the case with fixed chemical charges because the cell voltage is well above the equilibrium potential window of the redox couples at both the anode and the cathode δ ϕ s eq a θ δ ϕ s eq c θ 0 2 v the redox active ligands are almost completely oxidized at the anode and completely reduced at the cathode and both charged states approach the maximum value γ v 0 4 m as shown for the anode in fig 2 b when the cell voltage becomes more negative however the faradaic reactions responsible for generating cation ligands at the anode and anion ligands at the cathode do not proceed and thus the ion concentration curve looks similar to that of the unmodified electrodes the potential windows required to bring the ion concentration in the micropores from its minimum level of almost zero to 0 7 m are shown for the three cases of cdi ecdi and facdi in fig 2 a where it is clearly evident that the use of variable charges in the facdi case allows for performance similar to that of the other systems at much lower operating potentials the effects of the potential operating window on wsac determined from the differences in ion concentration at the charging and discharge potentials for the unmodified electrode classical cdi modified electrodes with fixed chemical charge enhanced cdi and extended cdi and redox active electrodes with variable chemical charges facdi are summarized in table 2 for a typical cdi operating window i e charging at v ch 1 2 v and discharging at v disch 0 v the wsac value for the unmodified electrodes classical cdi is 12 5 mg g for an electrode material modified with a fixed chemical charge enhanced cdi wsac is predicted to be 14 6 mg g which is about 20 higher than that for the classical cdi electrode because at 0 v there is still significant ion retention to balance the fixed charges on the electrode surfaces even though the electrical charges are zero when the discharge potential is extended to 0 45 v ecdi the equilibrium sac reaches 18 2 mg g about 50 higher than for the unmodified electrodes these results correspond well with values reported in the literature biesheuvel et al 2015a 2015b gao et al 2016 for the facdi electrodes with variable chemical charge the wsac value is predicted to be 18 2 mg g which is as high as the result predicted for the ecdi case but with a smaller operating window 1 2 v for fcdi vs 1 65 v for ecdi and therefore lower energy consumption the reason for this difference is that with the redox active electrodes the chemical charges are generated by the faradaic reaction a reversible process such that when the electrodes are discharged at 0 v the activated chemical moieties revert back to their original uncharged state and the ions are almost completely released from the micropores this will not work for the electrode modified with fixed chemical charge which must be balanced by a significant equivalent ionic charge even in the absence of an applied cell voltage for facdi cells designed specifically for selective ion separation processes the preferred adsorption of targeted ions relative to an excess of the supporting electrolyte relies on augmentation of the electrostatic interactions by specific bonding with the charged redox species su et al 2016 for these facdi electrodes where the selectivity of the electrode material is an important factor molecular discrimination can be achieved by careful choice or design of the redox active ligands in the polymers the operating window required to activate de activate the redox polymers should exceed the equilibrium potentials of the redox couples by a few thermal voltages v t 0 0257 v at 25 c and should be as narrow as possible to reduce energy expenditures during the adsorption desorption swing typically for appropriate redox couples this voltage swing is well below 1 2 v as noted in fig 2 a with the charging potential at 0 6 v and discharge at 0 v the faradaic reactions contribute an additional 51 to the total adsorption capacity relative to the capacity obtained with conventional cdi over a similar potential swing this number could be even higher for facdi electrodes with higher mass loadings of the redox polymers on the electrodes up to this point the equilibrium potential of the redox couple at the anode was set to δ ϕ s eq a θ 0 1 v and thus most of the redox groups were in their uncharged state at v cell 0 v when positive cell voltages are applied to the cell a performance enhancement is observed due to the changes in chemical charge following faradaic reactions for a redox couple at the anode with an equilibrium potential lower than 0 v the results are different however since most of the redox active ligands will already be charged at positive cell potentials this is evident from fig 3 a where the ion concentration dependence on v cell is shown for δ ϕ s eq a θ 0 3 v the corresponding charge and salt concentrations within the micropores are shown in fig 3 b in fig 3 a it can be noted that above 0 v the redox active ligands are already completely charged and the salt concentration in the micropores is as high as in the case with the fixed chemical charge i e for the ecdi system therefore within the same operating window between 1 2 v and 0 v the equilibrium sac for the facdi system at 14 6 mg g is the same as for enhanced cdi ecdi with fixed chemical charge however if the charging voltage is set at 0 45 v the micropore concentration at the end of the charging step is lower than at the beginning of this process and an inverted operating regime is observed this shows that ions in the micropores are expelled from the pores during charging and adsorption only occurs during discharge when the cell voltage returns 0 v this regime is also evident for modified electrodes with a fixed chemical charge which is a special case in which the equilibrium potential of the charged ligand is more negative than the cell operating potential thus an adsorption enhancement is observed when v ch is above 0 v and the inversion performance is observed when v ch below 0 v in summary enhanced cdi with a fixed chemical charge and the two case studies of facdi with δ ϕ s eq a θ 0 1 v and δ ϕ s eq a θ 0 3 v which has potential dependent variable chemical charges generated from the faradaic reactions demonstrate that the various operating phenomena such as performance enhancement or inversion in ecdi and facdi cells can be unified by examining the point of zero charge pzc of the electrode materials as long as the distance between the charging potential v ch and twice the pzc considering two electrodes for the symmetric cell is greater than the distance between the discharge potential v dis and twice the pzc an enhanced performance will be achieved and if the former is less than the latter inverse behavior will be observed however for the ecdi cells with fixed chemical charge the pzc is completely determined by the chemical charge density γ v while for facdi materials the pzc is affected by both γ v and the equilibrium potential of the redox couple for generating the chemical ligands which shows that one advantage of choosing facdi materials is that they can provide a route to tuning of deionization performance in cdi processes through electrochemical modification the discussion thus far has focused on the equilibrium distribution of ions between the macro and micropores under different charging conditions for the cdi ecdi and facdi systems the rates at which the adsorption and desorption occur are of interest for practical applications of capacitive deionization processes as these determine the working capacities of the electrodes we now compare the performances of different electrode materials under the assumption of well mixed fluids and no mass transport limitations from the flowing fluid to the micropores for a feed concentration of c in 20 mm the total volume of the spacer channel and macropores is taken to be fifteen times the volume of the micropores in each electrode i e v tot m e v mi 15 while the residence time used in the calculations is τ v tot φ 16 s the rate constant k r a is 1 97 s 1 and k o a k r a k a the charge transport resistance coefficient α is assumed to satisfy α m e v mi 1 10 6 ω mol biesheuvel et al 2015a the charging step is from 0 to 100 s at 0 6 v and the discharge occurs at 0 v over the period 100 200 s the dynamic simulation results are plotted in fig 4 from which it is clear that for v ch 0 6 v the effluent salt concentration drops significantly due to the electrostatic interactions with electrodes in the classical cdi and enhanced cdi with either fixed or variable chemical charges the ecdi case shows slight improvement in the salt removal from the feed stream while in the facdi process with the redox active ligands the salt adsorption performance is enhanced dramatically due to the collaborative generation of charged species during the faradaic reactions these results corroborate reported experimental observations with fixed chemical charges on the electrodes andelman 2014 cohen et al 2015 gao et al 2015a 2015b marino et al 2014 omosebi et al 2015 wu et al 2015 yang et al 2013 after 100 s the desorption process begins with a decrease in the cell voltage to zero the ions adsorbed in the micropores are released to the spacer channel and thus the salt concentration in the effluent initially increases significantly eventually leveling off to the inflow concentration when the desorption process is completed the reversible and almost complete charging and discharging of the chemical ligands during the facdi adsorption desorption cycle contribute to the enhancement of the wsac relative to the ecdi case with fixed chemical charge as shown in fig 5 a during the charging step the redox active chemical ligands are activated and approach their maximum concentration of 0 4 m at the end of this portion of the cycle during discharge the redox moieties relax to their neutral state and as electronic charges pass through the external circuit ions in the micropores are repelled almost completely to the spacer channel for the ecdi case however the fixed charges remain even as the cell potential drops to 0 v and thus incomplete expulsion of the ions occurs during the discharge phase of the sorption desorption cycle for this reason the area under the effluent concentration vs time curve for the desorption step in the facdi case is greater than that for ecdi with its fixed chemical charges the anion and cation concentrations in fig 5 b exhibit similar trends for the facdi and ecdi cases where anions are preferentially adsorbed during the charging step and released during discharge however for the redox active facdi electrode almost all the anions are released and the ion concentration within the micropores reverts to its initial value at the beginning of the charging step for the ecdi case the chemical charge is always maintained at 0 4 m and thus to ensure electroneutrality within the micropores the anion concentration at the end of the desorption step is still around 0 3 m when the electrodes are modified with redox active ligands with a redox potential lower than the initial charging potential e g δ ϕ s eq a θ 0 3 v 0 the facdi cell exhibits inversion performance as shown in fig 4 initially during the charging step the ions in the micropores are expelled to the spacer channel and the effluent concentration increases as shown in fig 6 a also shown in fig 6 a is that during the charging step at 0 45 v most of the redox moieties at the anode are still in the oxidized state only slightly below 0 4 m since the charging potential is not sufficiently negative to drive the faradaic reaction at the anode towards reduction the inversion performance during the charging step can thus be attributed mainly to the capacitive charging effect within the carbon matrix when the cell voltage increases to 0 v during the discharge phase the redox groups return to their original charged state and ions in the spacer channel are adsorbed on the electrodes resulting in decreased concentration in the effluent 4 conclusions in this article a generalized edl model is proposed to characterize redox active facdi electrodes with variable potential dependent chemical charges generated by faradaic reactions and to demonstrate differences in performance between cdi ecdi and facdi processes by careful selection design of the equilibrium potentials of the redox couples immobilized within the electrodes enhanced salt adsorption capacity can be achieved and the inversion performance can be avoided the theoretical results demonstrate that redox active facdi electrode materials that combine faradaic reactions with a double layer charging process can provide a much higher salt adsorption capacity than obtained with traditional cdi operations in the examples given here wsac values are obtained that are about 50 higher than for electrode materials without chemical modification at a cell voltage of 1 2 v and close to 100 higher at a cell voltage of 0 6 v the results are based on the assumption of a well mixed fluid in the spacer channel and mass transfer limitations within the electrodes are neglected a lumped parameter α is used to characterize the ohmic potential drop due to charge transfer resistance in many applications where the cdi cell has a high aspect ratio length height and when the thickness of the electrode is comparable to that of the spacer channel the spatial distribution of the ion concentrations and the salt adsorption rate can be important and should be considered in the optimization of the electrode cells in such cases a full two dimensional model with both spatial and temporal transport effects will be necessary this is a focus of our ongoing work in addition to their ability to enhance deionization operations the redox active electrode materials can be optimized to adsorb ions selectively from the stream due to specific interactions between the redox ligands and the targeted ions the model can be readily extended to study salt solutions with mixtures of ionic species through the inclusion of distinct faradaic reactions for each target ion with non specific electrostatic adsorption this study emphasizes that coupled with the pore size distribution of electrode materials their point of zero charge or specifically the equilibrium potential of the chemical surface charge can significantly influence the salt adsorption capacity and the charge efficiency for cdi cells in summary the redox active facdi electrodes provide a new approach for tuning the deionization performance of cdi cells and can be combined with other compounds to form hybrid materials that foster further study to understand the ion adsorption mechanisms such materials can have applications in deionization ion separation molecular recognition and energy storage 
19760,capacitive deionization cdi for water treatment which relies on the capture of charged species to sustain the electrical double layers edls established within porous electrodes under an applied electrical potential can be enhanced by the chemical attachment of fixed charged groups to the porous electrode electrodes ecdi it has recently been demonstrated that further improvements in capacity and energy storage can be gained by functionalization of the electrode surfaces with redox polymers in which the charge on the electrodes can be modulated through faradaic reactions under different cell voltages in a capacitive process that can be called faradaic cdi facdi here we extend recent mathematical models developed for the characterization of cdi and ecdi systems to incorporate the redox mediated contributions by allowing for the variable chemical charges generated by reactions in facdi the lumped model developed here assumes the spacer channel is well mixed with uniform electrosorption in each electrode we demonstrate that the salt adsorption performance characterization of the fixed chemical charge ecdi and variable chemical charge facdi materials can be unified within a common theoretical framework based on the point of zero charge pzc of the electrode material in the latter case the pzc is determined by the equilibrium potentials of the redox couples immobilized on the porous electrodes the new model is able to predict the experimentally observed enhanced and inverted performance of cdi cells and illuminates the benefit of choosing redox active materials for water treatment applications the deionization performance of facdi cells is shown to be superior to that of cdi and ecdi systems with equilibrium adsorption capacities 50 100 higher than attained with cdi systems and at smaller cell voltages depending on the redox potentials of the faradaic moieties keywords water treatment capacitive deionization electrical double layer theory electrochemical process modeling redox electrodes with faradaic reactions 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is an attractive technology for brackish water desalination that has received increasing attention in recent years suss et al 2015 the benefit of cdi over the current water treatment approaches such as distillation and reverse osmosis is that no heat treatment and no high pressure pumps are required and thus the operational costs for the separation process are lower in particular for low concentration brackish water in the range between 10 and 50 mm desalination techniques focused on removing the relatively few ions in solution are energetically more attractive than conventional water treatment methods that call for the removal of water from the salt containing solution cdi technology is based on ion electrosorption at the surfaces and in the pores of two closely spaced electrodes commonly composed of highly porous carbon materials when the electrodes are charged anions and cations in the saline water move towards the oppositely charged electrodes anode and cathode respectively to sustain the formation of electrical double layers edls at the electrode surfaces and are physically adsorbed in the electrode pores by electrostatic interaction the feed stream is thereby partially depleted of the salts or deionized the ions can be released to a receiving water stream by a short circuiting the electrodes or reduction of the cell voltage resulting in a concentrated brine the most commonly investigated cdi electrodes are composed of porous carbon materials because of their extraordinary chemical mechanical and thermal stability as well as their high surface areas on the order of 1000 m2 g wu et al 2015 activated carbon fibers wang et al 2012 carbon aerogels xu et al 2008 mesoporous carbon tsouris et al 2011 carbon nanotubes zhang et al 2012 and hybrid materials yin et al 2013 have all been widely studied as electrode materials for the cdi cells more recently it has been shown that chemical charges immobilized on the porous carbon materials can play an important role in the desalination performance since they change the structure of the electrical double layer and affect significantly the deionization performance the chemical charge can be introduced via the chemical immobilization of sulfonic groups or amine groups within the micropores of the electrode materials gao et al 2015a marino et al 2014 or by the generation of carboxylic groups by chemical oxidation wu et al 2015 in recent experiments it has been shown that with the introduction of a positive charge at the anode and a negative charge at the cathode enhanced cdi ecdi performance can be achieved andelman 2014 gao et al 2016 wu et al 2015 however if the electrodes are modified by the opposite charge i e anodes are modified with negatively charged moieties and cathodes with positively charged groups an inversion of the cdi process occurs in the inverted cdi icdi region ions are desorbed from the electrodes during the charging step and the cell effluent is a brine deionization only occurs during the discharge process where the cell voltage is zero cohen et al 2015 gao et al 2015b omosebi et al 2015 a quantitative theory was proposed by biesheuvel et al 2015a 2015b to explain these experimental phenomena recently another category of materials has been investigated in which redox active species are incorporated within the porous carbon matrix with these materials electrostatic interactions of salt ions with faradaically induced charges add to ions incorporated within the electric double layers formed at the electrode surfaces to provide a much higher adsorption capacity than attained in purely capacitive processes this process which was called pseudocapactive separation in the original paper achilleos and hatton 2016 is better identified as faradaic capacitive deionization facdi a naming convention we will use in this paper these redox active ligands su et al 2017a 2017b 2016 su and hatton 2017a 2017b can be considered as variable chemical charges that depend on the cell voltage as opposed to the fixed charges which have been explored recently by the cdi community andelman 2014 cohen et al 2015 gao et al 2015a 2015b marino et al 2014 omosebi et al 2015 wu et al 2015 yang et al 2013 these hybrid materials can be prepared through the modification of the carbon electrode surfaces with redox active polymers previous work published by mao et al 2013 reported the design of hybrid polyvinylferrocene carbon nanotube pvf cnt materials to increase the specific capacitance of the electrode su et al 2017b 2016 su and hatton 2017a 2017b were the first to apply this material for water treatment and further demonstrated the reversibility and selectivity of these variable oxidation state electrodes for anion adsorption and can be further used for protein separation su et al 2017a achilleos and hatton 2016 also showed that these electrodes have significantly higher capacities than reported for conventional cdi technologies intercalation based battery like electrodes such as those prepared with sodium manganese oxide na0 44mno2 smith 2017 smith and dmello 2016 involve bulk storage of ions and exhibit higher salt adsorption capacity compared with purely capacitive electrodes lee et al 2014 the salt uptake mechanisms that rely on bulk faradaic reactions are different from those governing our redox active facdi electrodes which rely on surface faradaic reactions and double layer charging for their effectiveness we limit our scope to surface functionalized redox active polymer systems the model proposed by biesheuvel et al 2015a 2015b extended the classical theory of electrosorption for microporous electrodes to include also the chemical charges immobilized within the micropores by chemical modification or treatment these charges were assumed to be fixed in value the theory was able to explain experimentally observed adsorption enhancement and inversion performance due to chemical modification with different fixed chemical charge polarities by nitric acid and ethylenediamine treatment gao et al 2016 the theory also predicts a new operating regime in which a higher equilibrium adsorption capacity than provided by current cdi processes can be obtained by extending the operation voltage window the facdi electrode materials share many common features with chemically modified fixed charge electrodes the presence of the redox active polymers within the porous carbon materials provides immobile chemical charges anionic or cationic ligands at the electrode electrolyte interface that depend on the cell voltage specifically for facdi materials in which the chemical charge is a result of the redox activity of the ligands i e of faradaic reactions the charge is not maintained at a fixed value but rather varies with the cell voltage as indicated by the nernst equation 1 δ ϕ eq δ ϕ eq θ k b t n e ln a ox a red where δ ϕ eq θ is the equilibrium potential for the faradaic reaction at the standard state k b is the boltzmann constant t is temperature e is the charge of an electron n is the number of electrons transferred and a ox and a red are the activities of the oxidized and reduced species respectively cdi models that include the variable chemical charge on the electrode surface have been proposed recently by hemmatifar et al 2017 and dykstra et al 2017 the former included the equilibrium distribution of acidic and basic groups within the carbon matrix as determined by the equilibrium constants of the individual surface functional groups p k s in the absence of faradaic reactions the latter study included the acidic or basic surface charge groups generated in accord with the equilibrium constant of water dissociation p k w and water reduction reaction both models were used to explain experimentally observed changes in ph in this work we incorporate the effect of variable chemical charge due to general faradaic reactions of redox species immobilized on the electrode surfaces and propose a suitable extension of the theory biesheuvel et al 2015a 2015b to explain the observed performance enhancement and inversion behavior the model indicates the promise of increasing the salt adsorption capacity through the use of facdi cells 2 theory the facdi cell is assumed to be composed of two redox active porous carbon electrodes separated by a spacer channel through which a monovalent binary salt e g n a and c l z z 1 solution flows the fluid is assumed to be well mixed within the spacer channel and mass transfer limitations to the electrodes are ignored these restrictions are introduced to enable a focus on the ion distribution within the pores of the electrodes and can be lifted in an extended full two dimensional transport model other cdi modes can be analyzed as special cases of this model a schematic of the model is shown in fig 1 in accord with typical assumptions made in cdi models the porous carbon material is assumed to consist of two types of pores macropores and micropores biesheuvel et al 2011 biesheuvel and bazant 2010 the macropores form free channels between the carbon particles and allow for the transport of ions across the electrode where electroneutrality is assumed i e the ion concentrations are related to the salt concentration by c ma c ma c ma electrical double layers are formed in the nanometer sized micropores distributed throughout the carbon particles allowing for preferential adsorption of counter ions and expulsion of co ions since mass transfer limitations are assumed to be negligible the concentrations of ions in the macropores are assumed to be the same as in the spacer channel in the micropores however the anion and cation concentrations are different with the difference being defined as the ionic charge within the solution i e σ ionic c mi c mi the modified donnan md model biesheuvel et al 2014 2012 2011 is utilized to describe the edl structure within the porous carbon electrodes in addition to the mobile ionic charge σ ionic allowance must be made for the carbon surface electronic charge σ elec induced by the cell voltage and the immobile chemical charge σ chem associated with either fixed charge chemical functionalities or variable potential dependent redox active moieties the md model is based on the assumption that the micropore diameter is much smaller than the debye length the length scale of the diffuse layer such that the edls formed along the pore surfaces overlap strongly to yield an almost invariant electrostatic potential and ion concentration within a micropore the concentration of ions in the micropores can therefore be considered to be volume averaged quantities expressed in terms of moles per micropore volume electroneutrality within the micropores is assured by the specification that 2 σ ionic σ elec σ chem 0 the potential drop between the outside macropores and the solution within the micropores is defined as the donnan potential δ ϕ d the micropore concentration is related to the concentration in the macropore via the boltzmann distribution 3 c j mi c ma exp z j δ ϕ d μ att j here μ att is a non electrostatic attractive interaction term arising from the image charge interactions within the porous carbon biesheuvel et al 2014 without which the predicted salt adsorption capacity can have unrealistically high values since the salt concentration considered here is as low as 20 mm where the ion crowding effect is still small we will neglect the attractive force for simplicity for a fully dissociated monovalent salt such as nacl the equations for the boltzmann equilibria for anions and cations the donnan potential δ ϕ d and the total ion concentration within the micropores c ions mi can be combined biesheuvel et al 2015a 2015b 2014 porada et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 to give 4 δ ϕ d arcsinh σ ionic 2 c ma 5 c ions mi 2 σ ionic 2 4 c ma 2 a second potential drop δ ϕ s across a nanoscopic stern layer is related to the electronic charge density σ elec in the carbon matrix via a constant capacitance c s which is the volumetric stern layer capacitance in unit of f ml assumed in the literature biesheuvel et al 2015a porada et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 to be in the range of 120 f ml to 200 f ml it is attributed to the dielectric constant of the solvent molecule and the material properties of the porous electrode 6 δ ϕ s σ elec f v t c s both δ ϕ d and δ ϕ s in the model are dimensionless potentials scaled by the thermal voltage v t k b t e 0 0257 v at 25 c in addition to these two potential drops due to the accumulation of charges an ohmic potential drop due to the ionic current passing through the electrolyte in the spacer channel and macropores also contributes to the total cell voltage the ohmic potential drop is assumed to be inversely proportional to the salt concentration c ma according to r ω α c ma where α is the charge transport resistance coefficient which depends on the geometry of the channel and the porosity and length of the macropores the overall cell potential is then 7 v cell v t δ ϕ s δ ϕ d a δ ϕ s δ ϕ d c i r ω v t the electronic charge of the two electrodes should be balanced if we do not consider asymmetric faradaic reaction rates at the two electrodes and thus 8 m a v mi a σ elec a m c v mi c σ elec c 0 for simplicity the electrode masses m e and micropore porosities v mi defined as volume per electrode mass are assumed to be the same for both electrodes i e m a m c m e v mi a v mi c v mi respectively biesheuvel et al 2015a and thus so must be the concentrations of electronic charges at the anode and the cathode i e σ elec a σ elec c the theory can be easily generalized to allow for electrodes with differences in mass and porosity the traditional enhanced cdi process ecdi relies on fixed charges within the micropores that do not respond to changes in the cell voltage this is not the case for faradaic systems however where the charge depends on the potential in accord with the nernst equation equation 1 the kinetics for generation of this chemical charge are assumed to be governed by the butler volmer equation at the anode a generic redox reaction is described as r a o a e the reduced state r a has zero charge and the oxidized state o a a charge of 1 one example is the ferrocene ferrocenium redox couple as described in ref su et al 2016 the chemical charge on the anode σ chem a is thus equivalent to the concentration of oxidized o a moieties the total number of chemical ligands within the micropore including both the reduced and oxidized states γ v can be estimated from the surface site density γ s and specific surface area a i e via γ v γ s a the concentration of functional groups in the reduced state is then c r a γ v σ chem a the rate of generation of the charged faradaic species is given in terms of these quantities by the generalized frumkin butler volmer equation 9 r f k r a σ chem a exp δ ϕ s 2 k o a γ v σ chem a exp δ ϕ s 2 r f is defined to be positive for the reduction reaction and negative for oxidation since the immobilized redox moieties are at atomic distance from the electronically conductive electrode it is the stern layer voltage drop δ ϕ s that contributes to the activation barriers assuming there is no diffuse charge contribution therefore in contrast to the empirical butler volmer equation which attributes the total driving force to the voltage drop between the electrode surface and the electrically neutral bulk solution equation 9 is applied just across the stern layer bazant et al 2005 biesheuvel et al 2009 the transfer coefficients are assumed to be α r α o 1 2 for the single electron transfer reaction and k r a and k o a are kinetic rate constants for the reduction and oxidation reactions respectively at the anode at equilibrium the potential drop across the stern layer δ ϕ s eq a is related to the chemical charge at the anode if δ ϕ s eq a θ is the standard state equilibrium potential of the redox couple where the activities of the activated and neutral states of the chemical moieties are equal i e σ chem a γ v σ chem a γ v 2 then 10 δ ϕ s eq a δ ϕ s eq a θ ln σ chem a γ v σ chem a ln k a σ chem a γ v σ chem a 11 δ ϕ s eq a θ ln k a ln k r a k o a for a symmetric cell the cathode is modified with a redox active polymer which undergoes the faradaic reaction o c e r c during the charging process the oxidized state is charge neutral and the reduced state has a negative charge of 1 if the equilibrium potential of the redox couple at the cathode has the same magnitude but opposite polarity as the couple at the anode then the equilibrium constant k c k a 1 and at equilibrium σ chem a σ chem c since it has been assumed that σ elec a σ elec c the ionic charge within the micropores of the two electrodes should also balance such that σ ionic a σ ionic c similarly the stern layer voltage drop δ ϕ s and donnan potential δ ϕ d at the anode and the cathode have the same magnitudes but are of opposite sign thus for the purposes of this analysis we can focus on the anodic variables and readily derive the results for the cathodic system using the symmetry conditions on combining equations 1 4 6 8 and 10 and recognizing that the ionic current is zero at equilibrium we can express the overall cell potential in terms of σ chem a 12 v cell 2 v t δ ϕ s a δ ϕ d a ln k a σ chem a γ v σ chem a arcsinh σ chem a σ

from which the equilibrium salt adsorption capacity eqsac can be determined defined as the total mass of salt within the micropores per unit mass of the electrodes biesheuvel et al 2015a 13 eqsac c ions mi m a v mi a m w 2 m a 1 2 c ions mi v mi a m w where each electrode has mass m a since symmetric electrodes have been assumed for practical operations the working salt adsorption capacity wsac

respectively thus 14 wsac δeqsac 1 2 δ c ions mi v mi a m w this is the quantity of interest when the effectiveness of cdi operations is evaluated the dynamic adsorption desorption cycles can also be simulated to provide further insight into the effects of chemical modification variable or fixed chemical charge on the operational performance of the cell the simple model assumes again that the spacer channel is well mixed and the ion concentrations in the macropores and in the spacer channel are the same as c ma the concentrations of the inflow and outflow streams are c in and c ma respectively a mass balance over the cdi cell gives 15 v tot d c ma d t φ c in c ma 1 2 j ions a j ions c where v tot is the volume of the spacer channel and macropores φ is the stream flow rate through the cell and the residence time τ v tot φ the ionic flux j ions i i a c is from the macropores to the micropores for the anode j ions a can be related to the rate of salt concentration change

the volumetric rate constant k r a can be estimated from the intrinsic rate constant k r 0 the specific area a and the electrode mass m a for the oxidation rate constant we have k o a k r a k a for electrodes with no faradaic reactions the electronic current passing through the external circuit equals the ionic current passing through the electrolyte in the spacer channel and macropores and the magnitude of each is defined as the total current with faradaic reactions at the electrode however the total current i is related to the changes in electronic charge due to the development of the double layer and the faradaically driven chemical reactions but is not affected by fixed charges on the micropore surfaces and thus is equivalently related to the rate of change of the ionic charge 18

equation 5 can be combined to generate a set of differential algebraic equations for the description of the adsorption behavior within a symmetric cell 3 results and discussion the model developed in this work for the description of ion distributions in porous carbon electrodes under both equilibrium and dynamic conditions is used here to assess the enhancement in cdi performance afforded by the functionalization of the micropores with redox active moieties whose charge can be modulated by the cell voltage we compare the results for standard cdi with those for both enhanced fixed charge edci and faradaically mediated facdi processes inverted deionization scenarios are also explored the results discussed here are based on a symmetric two electrode cell with the same mass micropore volume and chemical charge albeit of opposite sign on the cathode relative to the anode for each electrode although the model can be easily extended to asymmetric cases for the calculations which are based on 1 g of electrode mass m e and a value of 0 507 ml g for the micropore volume v mi the capacitance of the electrode c s is set at 170 f ml the parameters used in the model calculations are summarized in table 1 the concentration γ v of either the fixed charges or the redox groups on the functionalized electrodes is assumed to be 0 4 m at each electrode which is a reasonable estimate for porous electrodes the equilibrium constant is determined from k a e δ ϕ s eq a θ v t equilibrium anion salt adsorption results determined at δ ϕ s eq a θ 0 1 v and δ ϕ s eq c θ 0 1 v are shown in fig

electrodes with no chemical charge σ chem a σ chem c 0 and with fixed chemical charge σ chem a σ chem c 0 4 m for the unmodified electrodes the salt adsorption capacity is symmetric depending only on the absolute magnitude of the cell voltage at 0 v the salt adsorption is at its minimum value of 2 c ma corresponding to the initial salt concentration in the spacer channel when the charge of anions and cations exactly compensate each other σ ionic 0 the electrode is said to be at the point of zero charge pzc upon application of a positive cell potential anions are preferentially adsorbed at the anode and cations at the cathode and hence ion concentration increases with v cell for the electrodes modified with a fixed chemical charge the pzc shifts towards a negative voltage of 0 45 v thus since counter ions to these fixed charges are required to maintain electroneutrality in the absence of an external potential v cell 0 v the ion concentration is not at its minimum value indeed a negative cell voltage of 0 45 v pzc is required to desorb the counter ions fully and achieve a minimum ion concentration it is of interest to note that for the chemically modified electrodes there are two pzcs biesheuvel et al 2015b one corresponding to σ ionic 0 at 0 45 v which is also the potential at which the minimum ion concentration of c ma is found and the other to σ elec 0 which occurs at around 0 15 v not shown in fig 2 a for the electrode modified with fixed chemical charge at 0 4 m we refer to the former as the pzc in the following discussion fig 2 a shows that with variable chemical charge the ion concentration in the micropores exhibits an asymmetric behavior around 0 v initially at 0 v most of the redox active ligands are in their reduced state and σ chem is small at around 0 0074 m upon application of a positive cell potential which drives the anodic faradaic reaction towards oxidation ion concentration increases with an increase in the value of σ ionic caused by both the double layer charging process and the increased σ chem induced by the faradaic reactions when the cell potential is above 0 65 v the ion concentration approaches that of the case with fixed chemical charges because the cell voltage is well above the equilibrium potential window of the redox couples at both the anode and the cathode δ ϕ s eq a θ δ ϕ s eq c θ 0 2 v the redox active ligands are almost completely oxidized at the anode and completely reduced at the cathode and both charged states approach the maximum value γ v 0 4 m as shown for the anode in fig 2 b when the cell voltage becomes more negative however the faradaic reactions responsible for generating cation ligands at the anode and anion ligands at the cathode do not proceed and thus the ion concentration curve looks similar to that of the unmodified electrodes the potential windows required to bring the ion concentration in the micropores from its minimum level of almost zero to 0 7 m are shown for the three cases of cdi ecdi and facdi in fig 2 a where it is clearly evident that the use of variable charges in the facdi case allows for performance similar to that of the other systems at much lower operating potentials the effects of the potential operating window on wsac determined from the differences in ion concentration at the charging and discharge potentials for the unmodified electrode classical cdi modified electrodes with fixed chemical charge enhanced cdi and extended cdi and redox active electrodes with variable chemical charges facdi are summarized in table 2 for a typical cdi operating window i e charging at v ch 1 2 v and discharging at v disch 0 v the wsac value for the unmodified electrodes classical cdi is 12 5 mg g for an electrode material modified with a fixed chemical charge enhanced cdi wsac is predicted to be 14 6 mg g which is about 20 higher than that for the classical cdi electrode because at 0 v there is still significant ion retention to balance the fixed charges on the electrode surfaces even though the electrical charges are zero when the discharge potential is extended to 0 45 v ecdi the equilibrium sac reaches 18 2 mg g about 50 higher than for the unmodified electrodes these results correspond well with values reported in the literature biesheuvel et al 2015a 2015b gao et al 2016 for the facdi electrodes with variable chemical charge the wsac value is predicted to be 18 2 mg g which is as high as the result predicted for the ecdi case but with a smaller operating window 1 2 v for fcdi vs 1 65 v for ecdi and therefore lower energy consumption the reason for this difference is that with the redox active electrodes the chemical charges are generated by the faradaic reaction a reversible process such that when the electrodes are discharged at 0 v the activated chemical moieties revert back to their original uncharged state and the ions are almost completely released from the micropores this will not work for the electrode modified with fixed chemical charge which must be balanced by a significant equivalent ionic charge even in the absence of an applied cell voltage for facdi cells designed specifically for selective ion separation processes the preferred adsorption of targeted ions relative to an excess of the supporting electrolyte relies on augmentation of the electrostatic interactions by specific bonding with the charged redox species su et al 2016 for these facdi electrodes where the selectivity of the electrode material is an important factor molecular discrimination can be achieved by careful choice or design of the redox active ligands in the polymers the operating window required to activate de activate the redox polymers should exceed the equilibrium potentials of the redox couples by a few thermal voltages v t 0 0257 v at 25 c and should be as narrow as possible to reduce energy expenditures during the adsorption desorption swing typically for appropriate redox couples this voltage swing is well below 1 2 v as noted in fig 2 a with the charging potential at 0 6 v and discharge at 0 v the faradaic reactions contribute an additional 51 to the total adsorption capacity relative to the capacity obtained with conventional cdi over a similar potential swing this number could be even higher for facdi electrodes with higher mass loadings of the redox polymers on the electrodes up to this point the equilibrium potential of the redox couple at the anode was set to δ ϕ s eq a θ 0 1 v and thus most of the redox groups were in their uncharged state at v cell 0 v when positive cell voltages are applied to the cell a performance enhancement is observed due to the changes in chemical charge following faradaic reactions for a redox couple at the anode with an equilibrium potential lower than 0 v the results are different however since most of the redox active ligands will already be charged at positive cell potentials this is evident from fig 3 a where the ion concentration dependence on v cell is shown for δ ϕ s eq a θ 0 3 v the corresponding charge and salt concentrations within the micropores are shown in fig 3 b in fig 3 a it can be noted that above 0 v the redox active ligands are already completely charged and the salt concentration in the micropores is as high as in the case with the fixed chemical charge i e for the ecdi system therefore within the same operating window between 1 2 v and 0 v the equilibrium sac for the facdi system at 14 6 mg g is the same as for enhanced cdi ecdi with fixed chemical charge however if the charging voltage is set at 0 45 v the micropore concentration at the end of the charging step is lower than at the beginning of this process and an inverted operating regime is observed this shows that ions in the micropores are expelled from the pores during charging and adsorption only occurs during discharge when the cell voltage returns 0 v this regime is also evident for modified electrodes with a fixed chemical charge which is a special case in which the equilibrium potential of the charged ligand is more negative than the cell operating potential thus an adsorption enhancement is observed when v ch is above 0 v and the inversion performance is observed when v ch below 0 v in summary enhanced cdi with a fixed chemical charge and the two case studies of facdi with δ ϕ s eq a θ 0 1 v and δ ϕ s eq a θ 0 3 v which has potential dependent variable chemical charges generated from the faradaic reactions demonstrate that the various operating phenomena such as performance enhancement or inversion in ecdi and facdi cells can be unified by examining the point of zero charge pzc of the electrode materials as long as the distance between the charging potential v ch and twice the pzc considering two electrodes for the symmetric cell is greater than the distance between the discharge potential v dis and twice the pzc an enhanced performance will be achieved and if the former is less than the latter inverse behavior will be observed however for the ecdi cells with fixed chemical charge the pzc is completely determined by the chemical charge density γ v while for facdi materials the pzc is affected by both γ v and the equilibrium potential of the redox couple for generating the chemical ligands which shows that one advantage of choosing facdi materials is that they can provide a route to tuning of deionization performance in cdi processes through electrochemical modification the discussion thus far has focused on the equilibrium distribution of ions between the macro and micropores under different charging conditions for the cdi ecdi and facdi systems the rates at which the adsorption and desorption occur are of interest for practical applications of capacitive deionization processes as these determine the working capacities of the electrodes we now compare the performances of different electrode materials under the assumption of well mixed fluids and no mass transport limitations from the flowing fluid to the micropores for a feed concentration of c in 20 mm the total volume of the spacer channel and macropores is taken to be fifteen times the volume of the micropores in each electrode i e v tot m e v mi 15 while the residence time used in the calculations is τ v tot φ 16 s the rate constant k r a is 1 97 s 1 and k o a k r a k a the charge transport resistance coefficient α is assumed to satisfy α m e v mi 1 10 6 ω mol biesheuvel et al 2015a the charging step is from 0 to 100 s at 0 6 v and the discharge occurs at 0 v over the period 100 200 s the dynamic simulation results are plotted in fig 4 from which it is clear that for v ch 0 6 v the effluent salt concentration drops significantly due to the electrostatic interactions with electrodes in the classical cdi and enhanced cdi with either fixed or variable chemical charges the ecdi case shows slight improvement in the salt removal from the feed stream while in the facdi process with the redox active ligands the salt adsorption performance is enhanced dramatically due to the collaborative generation of charged species during the faradaic reactions these results corroborate reported experimental observations with fixed chemical charges on the electrodes andelman 2014 cohen et al 2015 gao et al 2015a 2015b marino et al 2014 omosebi et al 2015 wu et al 2015 yang et al 2013 after 100 s the desorption process begins with a decrease in the cell voltage to zero the ions adsorbed in the micropores are released to the spacer channel and thus the salt concentration in the effluent initially increases significantly eventually leveling off to the inflow concentration when the desorption process is completed the reversible and almost complete charging and discharging of the chemical ligands during the facdi adsorption desorption cycle contribute to the enhancement of the wsac relative to the ecdi case with fixed chemical charge as shown in fig 5 a during the charging step the redox active chemical ligands are activated and approach their maximum concentration of 0 4 m at the end of this portion of the cycle during discharge the redox moieties relax to their neutral state and as electronic charges pass through the external circuit ions in the micropores are repelled almost completely to the spacer channel for the ecdi case however the fixed charges remain even as the cell potential drops to 0 v and thus incomplete expulsion of the ions occurs during the discharge phase of the sorption desorption cycle for this reason the area under the effluent concentration vs time curve for the desorption step in the facdi case is greater than that for ecdi with its fixed chemical charges the anion and cation concentrations in fig 5 b exhibit similar trends for the facdi and ecdi cases where anions are preferentially adsorbed during the charging step and released during discharge however for the redox active facdi electrode almost all the anions are released and the ion concentration within the micropores reverts to its initial value at the beginning of the charging step for the ecdi case the chemical charge is always maintained at 0 4 m and thus to ensure electroneutrality within the micropores the anion concentration at the end of the desorption step is still around 0 3 m when the electrodes are modified with redox active ligands with a redox potential lower than the initial charging potential e g δ ϕ s eq a θ 0 3 v 0 the facdi cell exhibits inversion performance as shown in fig 4 initially during the charging step the ions in the micropores are expelled to the spacer channel and the effluent concentration increases as shown in fig 6 a also shown in fig 6 a is that during the charging step at 0 45 v most of the redox moieties at the anode are still in the oxidized state only slightly below 0 4 m since the charging potential is not sufficiently negative to drive the faradaic reaction at the anode towards reduction the inversion performance during the charging step can thus be attributed mainly to the capacitive charging effect within the carbon matrix when the cell voltage increases to 0 v during the discharge phase the redox groups return to their original charged state and ions in the spacer channel are adsorbed on the electrodes resulting in decreased concentration in the effluent 4 conclusions in this article a generalized edl model is proposed to characterize redox active facdi electrodes with variable potential dependent chemical charges generated by faradaic reactions and to demonstrate differences in performance between cdi ecdi and facdi processes by careful selection design of the equilibrium potentials of the redox couples immobilized within the electrodes enhanced salt adsorption capacity can be achieved and the inversion performance can be avoided the theoretical results demonstrate that redox active facdi electrode materials that combine faradaic reactions with a double layer charging process can provide a much higher salt adsorption capacity than obtained with traditional cdi operations in the examples given here wsac values are obtained that are about 50 higher than for electrode materials without chemical modification at a cell voltage of 1 2 v and close to 100 higher at a cell voltage of 0 6 v the results are based on the assumption of a well mixed fluid in the spacer channel and mass transfer limitations within the electrodes are neglected a lumped parameter α is used to characterize the ohmic potential drop due to charge transfer resistance in many applications where the cdi cell has a high aspect ratio length height and when the thickness of the electrode is comparable to that of the spacer channel the spatial distribution of the ion concentrations and the salt adsorption rate can be important and should be considered in the optimization of the electrode cells in such cases a full two dimensional model with both spatial and temporal transport effects will be necessary this is a focus of our ongoing work in addition to their ability to enhance deionization operations the redox active electrode materials can be optimized to adsorb ions selectively from the stream due to specific interactions between the redox ligands and the targeted ions the model can be readily extended to study salt solutions with mixtures of ionic species through the inclusion of distinct faradaic reactions for each target ion with non specific electrostatic adsorption this study emphasizes that coupled with the pore size distribution of electrode materials their point of zero charge or specifically the equilibrium potential of the chemical surface charge can significantly influence the salt adsorption capacity and the charge efficiency for cdi cells in summary the redox active facdi electrodes provide a new approach for tuning the deionization performance of cdi cells and can be combined with other compounds to form hybrid materials that foster further study to understand the ion adsorption mechanisms such materials can have applications in deionization ion separation molecular recognition and energy storage 
19761,the primary objective of this research was to remove recalcitrant nutrients from anaerobically digested sludge dewatering centrate a struvite precipitation methodology is proposed where salt crystals are encouraged to ballast colloidal particles through heterogeneous nucleation and subsequent crystal growth the secondary objective was to assess presence of micropollutants in precipitates four biologically unique dewatering centrates were used to test the precipitation methodology on the variety of anaerobic digester configurations that can be expected from municipal wastewater treatment plant the effect of digestion sludge retention time 2 day 20 day and digestion temperature 35 c 55 c on the removal of dissolved unreactive phosphorus p and nitrogen n was monitored averaged across all four centrates the precipitation methodology resulted in dissolved unreactive p and n removal of 82 4 and 66 6 respectively antimicrobial contaminants triclosan triclocarban were observed in the precipitates at minute concentrations 18 ng g dry solids therefore mass struvite precipitation can provide a means of recalcitrant nutrient treatment and reactive nutrient recovery without the micropollutant burden of biosolids land application graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion sidestream struvite non reactive dissolved phosphorus dissolved organic nitrogen micropollutant 1 introduction phosphorus p and nitrogen n are wastewater effluent constituents that cause eutrophication in receiving watersheds howarth and marino 2006 jarvie et al 2006 schindler et al 2016 as population and nutrient loading to surface water increases the risk of eutrophication also increases to mitigate increasing nutrient load wastewater treatment facilities wwtfs are targeting more stringent nutrient discharge regulations bott et al 2012 biological nutrient removal bnr and tertiary filtration are commonly used processes that achieve low effluent nutrient concentrations without the need for consumable chemical reagents barnard 1975 bott et al 2012 qin et al 2015 li and brett 2015 although these processes are effective at removing inorganic and particulate nutrient species small colloidal material containing bound n or p can persist through the treatment processes and end up in the final effluent as nutrient pollution neethling and stensel 2013 galvagno et al 2016 metal salt addition may be used to control recalcitrant n and p upstream of tertiary filters arnaldos and pagilla 2010 but the high metal p ratio required passes on significant cost to the wwtf operator especially for facilities targeting ultra low discharge concentrations smith et al 2008 gu et al 2013 colloidal n and p can become bioavailable once introduced to the environment and will contribute to eutrophication for example algal bioassay tests done on tertiary effluent originating from a wwtf using bnr and tertiary filtration found that non reactive dissolved phosphorus nrdp can become 73 7 80 bioavailable to algal and microbial species qin et al 2015 li and brett 2015 similarly studies have demonstrated dissolved organic nitrogen don bioavailability from bnr effluent was between 19 and 68 after bioassays urgun demirtas et al 2008 sattayatewa et al 2009 as watershed management practices develop and nutrient discharge regulations become more stringent it will become necessary to develop treatment strategies that prevent nrdp and don from being discharged in the final effluent management of nutrient species is complicated by the anaerobic digestion ad process ad is used to stabilize organic residuals through a biological process that includes hydrolysis of organic material appels et al 2008 however when secondary sludge from the bnr process is used as substrate for an ad process nutrients are solubilized into the liquid phase and recirculated back to the bnr process through a sidestream centrate flow in this scenario uncontrolled phosphorus release leads to two sources for process failure blockage of piping conveyance through scaling build up bhattarai et al 1989 and phosphorus bleed through in the mainstream bnr process murakami et al 1987 pitman 1999 an ancillary issue associated with the hydrolysis of secondary sludge from a bnr process is the release of colloidal nutrients such as nrdp and don galvagno et al 2014 for example table 1 compares colloidal nutrient concentration from centrate produced at a 35 ml day bnr wwtf no ad to centrates produced from bench scale ad using residuals from the same wwtf in each case the dewatering polymer zetag 7553 is dosed to achieve maximum cake total solids ts furthermore the nrdp and don data in table 1 is used to compare the mass loading from centrate and final effluent streams using a 0 51 centrate mainstream flow and a final effluent nutrient concentration of 0 055 mg nrdp l and 1 57 mg don l galvagno et al 2016 as seen in table 1 ad adds 410 and 529 more nrdp into the mainstream than undigested centrate for mesophilic and thermophilic ad respectively the nrdp and don in ad centrates can be a significant mass load to a wwtf therefore targeted removal of nrdp and don in the ad dewatering centrate may be an efficient strategy when considering the ultimate goal of minimizing final effluent nutrient pollution orthophosphate op and ammonia are abundant in ad centrates especially when residuals originating from a bnr wwtf are digested marti et al 2008 bolzonella et al 2012 galvagno et al 2016 sidestream op treatment using struvite precipitation is a well established technology that has been demonstrated at the full scale ueno and fujii 2001 münch and barr 2001 the removal of op as struvite has an added benefit of producing fertilizer uysal et al 2010 which has the potential to reduce global demand on phosphate ore reserves by 1 6 shu et al 2006 struvite precipitation may be implemented using two main crystal morphology methodologies a visual description of each type of precipitation mechanism is shown in fig 1 precipitation morphology can be controlled by maintaining the solution in the metastable zone or the labile zone within the metastable zone a solution will precipitate onto existing crystals lewis et al 2015 however without the presence of crystal surface a metastable solution is not likely to precipitate because it does not contain enough solute entities or ions contributing to supersaturation to develop a nuclei cluster capable of overcoming the gibbs free energy requirement to produce a crystal nucleus lewis et al 2015 within the labile zone solution supersaturation conditions overcome the gibbs free energy requirement and the solution can form crystal nuclei as the extent of solution supersaturation increases the rate of struvite precipitation accelerates rapidly according to second order growth kinetics bouropoulos and koutsoukos 2000 kofina and koutsoukos 2005 in this research struvite is precipitated from ad centrate in a manner that encourages solution supersaturation and mass struvite precipitation mass struvite precipitation is intended to selectively target centrate colloidal impurities through heterogeneous nucleation a foreign surface facilitates nucleation by reducing the gibbs free energy needed to produce a crystal nucleus kalikmanov 2013 therefore it is probable that crystals produced during mass precipitation will nucleate onto colloidal impurities subsequent crystal growth is expected to encase or otherwise fixate the crystal nucleus to the colloidal material after sufficient crystal growth the gravity force of the larger mass may overcome surface charge repulsion the primary objective of the experiment is to demonstrate removal of nrdp and don through mass precipitation of struvite onto colloidal material and subsequent settling fig 1 upper row in effect this process allows for simultaneous treatment of soluble reactive nutrients and colloidal recalcitrant nutrients the precipitation methodology has the potential to introduce forms of pollution that may have an adverse impact on the quality of struvite micropollutants have not been observed to sorb onto struvite crystals precipitated from a crystallizer that targets metastable supersaturation fig 1 lower row butkovskyi et al 2015 or from synthetic urine with dosed micropollutants huang et al 2016 however micropollutants may become a part of the struvite crystal through heterogeneous attachment of colloidal particles that contain sorbed micropollutants a survey of wwtfs across the united states has found a 70 correlation between micropollutants found in human and wastewater samples venkatesan and halden 2014 suggesting that human excretion is a major source of micropollutant contamination found at the wwtf unfortunately as little as 12 micropollutant removal occurs at a modern wwtf luo et al 2014 which can affect fish in the aquatic environment brodin et al 2013 and lead to pathways for human exposure triclosan tcs and triclocarban tcc are widely used as ingredients in many household and personal care products such as shampoos soaps cosmetics plastic additives and toys mainly for disinfection and sanitation purposes halden 2014 they have a large presence in the wwtf solid residual stream are resistant to anaerobic biodegradation and are highly hydrophobic ying et al 2007 therefore tcs and tcc are likely micropollutant compounds that will persist through ad and end up sorbed onto the organic colloids targeted for removal in this experiment and can serve as a surrogate for micropollutants in wastewater and sludge these compounds and many of their degradation by products are found to be persistent in agricultural soils kwoon and xia 2011 prosser et al 2014 while several studies have shown uptake of these compounds from biosolids amended soils and translocation of tcs and tcc from plant roots into plant stems leaves and edible portions of a number of common fruits and vegetables aryal and reinhold 2011 prosser et al 2014 therefore a secondary objective of the experiment is to explore the struvite micropollutant contamination potential 2 materials methodology 2 1 sample preparation and precipitation procedure bench scale ad vessels with total and effective volumes ranging from 1 to 4 l were operated at steady state for 8 months ad vessels were considered at steady state when less than 10 variation in volatile solids removal and biogas production was observed substrate consisted of a 0 33 0 67 volumetric ratio of mixed fermented primary sludge total solids ts 56 7 g dry l to thickened waste activated sludge ts 34 82 g dry l obtained weekly from the kelowna wastewater treatment facility kwwtf in british columbia canada that employs a five stage modified bardenpho bnr process the sludge retention time srt for the bnr process varies between 6 and 13 d during the summer and winter seasons respectively the sludge ratio used was representative of the full scale kwwtf sludge production four biologically unique dewatering centrates were used to test the precipitation methodology on the variety of anaerobic digester configurations that can be expected from typical municipal wastewater treatment plants acid gas ad srt 20 d and acid ad srt 2 d was used to produce ad effluent at mesophilic 35 c and thermophilic 55 c operating temperature acid gas ads simulated conventional single stage ad where hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis were co occurring while acid ad vessels favoured hydrolysis and acidogenesis mesophilic inoculum was sampled from the effluent of a 7 l new brunswick automated fermenter the bench scale fermenter had been operating using kwwtf mixed sludge for over three years originally the mesophilic inoculum was sourced from the city of penticton s british columbia canada mesophilic ad tanks thermophilic inoculum was obtained from ad effluent produced from a bench scale ad experiment operating for 8 months the experiment used mixed sludge from the westside regional municipal treatment facility which operates similar to the kwwtf originally the thermophilic inoculum from the experiment was sourced from full scale ad tanks at the annacis island municipal wwtf vancouver canada digesters were fed manually in a semi continuous mode once a day 7 days week and kept in temperature controlled shakers rotating at 120 rpm details on ad operation and performance may be found in the supplementary material fig s1 table s1 and are consistent with published literature demirel and yenigün 2002 wahidunnabi and eskicioglu 2014 effluent from ad vessels was dewatered using zetag 7553 polyacrylamide dewatering polymer zetag 7553 was chosen because it was being used at the kwwtf during the time of experimentation initially dewatering polymer was applied to achieve the maximum cake ts concentration low dose and the second iteration applied dewatering polymer to achieve maximum solids capture yielding the lowest tss concentration in centrate high dose the applied polymer doses are presented in table 2 nutrient precipitation testing was performed on centrates taken from ad vessels during steady state struvite was precipitated from centrate samples in beakers containing 1 l of centrate a phipps bird pb 900 jar tester was used to provide controlled mixing while stirring at 120 rpm a 1 5 m solution as mg2 from acs grade mgcl2 6h2o was quickly injected to target a 1 1 5 p mg molar ratio within 30 s of subsequent mixing the ph was rapidly adjusted to 9 0 1 by injecting a pre determined volume of 10 m naoh solution acs grade the mixing was then reduced to 30 rpm to avoid shearing and a final dose of 10 m naoh solution was slowly injected to raise the ph to 10 the solution was mixed gently at 30 rpm for a further 5 min and then allowed to settle for 30 min after settling the supernatant was sampled 2 2 solids analysis characterization of colloidal and particulate solids provides evidence that mass struvite precipitation and subsequent settling was the mechanism for colloidal nutrient removal scanning election microscope imaging of the resulting precipitates has been included in the supplementary material solids were characterized by the sequenced measurement of total suspended solids tss and dynamic light scattering dls on the filtrate of the tss measurement tss was measured according to standard methods procedure 2540d apha 2005 using prewashed glass microfiber filters that retain particle sizes greater than 1 5 μm vwr cat no 28333 129 a malvern zetasizer nano zs was used to characterize the colloids in the filtrate of the tss measurement the zetasizer was used to measure the zeta potential of colloidal solids using dls while applying an electric field to the fluid sample all zetasizer measurements were done at 25 c 2 3 nutrient analysis all phosphorus testing has been described in previous research galvagno et al 2016 in the testing procedures nrdp is further characterized into organic dissolved phosphorus orgdp and acid hydrolyzable dissolved phosphorus dissolved polyphosphates polydp are considered to be the same as the acid hydrolyzable phosphorus fraction for the purpose of discussion however slight discrepancy between polyphosphate and acid hydrolysable phosphorus are noted in the literature apha 2005 fig s2 the 0 45 μm pore sized membrane filter has been used to distinguish between dissolved and suspended material total nitrogen was measured using the persulfate digestion method apha 4500 p j for this method 4 ml of sample was autoclaved at 140 170 kpa for 1 h in the presence of an alkali 0 2 m persulphate solution from acs grade k2s2o8 undigested samples and digested samples were measured for nitrate using a dionex ion chromatograph model ics 2100 equipped with an as11 hc column 4 250 mm a matching guard column potassium hydroxide eluent and a thermal conductivity detector nitrite was measured using the colourimetric method apha no2 b and ammonia was measured using apha 4500 nh3 f apha 2005 dissolved organic nitrogen was interpreted as the difference between dissolved total nitrogen and the sum of nitrite nitrate and ammonia nitrate and nitrite were considered negligible after two batches of testing on each experimental centrate did not detect any analytes limit of detection for the ion chromatography method was considered as three times the signal versus the background noise in the blank samples 2 4 micropollutant analysis tcs and tcc were measured in both precipitates and post precipitation treated centrate samples to observe if the mass precipitation procedure caused the precipitates to become significantly contaminated with micropollutants blank samples were carried through the sample preparation procedure in replicates of three one blank replicate was left unchanged to ensure the sample preparation procedure or column carryover did not introduce contamination the second replicate was spiked with isotopically labelled tcc tcc d4 as an internal standard and the third replicate was spiked with 100 μl of 1 5 ppm tcc d4 internal standard and 100 μl of 500 ppb of native micropollutants in high purity methanol sand that had been preheated to 550 c for 30 min was used as the blank for precipitates and the 5 μm filtered fraction of peat moss extract solution was used as the blank for centrate samples the precipitate samples were dried in a thermotron environmental chamber for several days at 50 1 1 c to avoid mass loss from the crystal structure above a temperature of 50 c ammonia and moisture has been observed to volatilize from struvite ali 2007 once at steady mass samples were crushed using an agate mortar and pestle that was thoroughly cleaned between samples a 0 5 g mass of sample was suspended in 15 ml of acetonitrile bdh chemical acs grade within clean high density polyethylene containers at this point 100 μl of 1 5 ppm tcc d4 solution was added to each sample and 100 μl of 500 ppb natural analyte was added to one replicate of each sample the solution was agitated in a vortex mixer for 30 min and then left to settle overnight the supernatant was transferred to glass cuvettes submersed in a 55 c water bath and evaporated to near dryness under nitrogen gas finally the extract was reconstituted in methanol to 1 5 ml and filtered into injection vials through a syringe style 0 22 μm polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf filter membrane the centrate effluent samples were dosed with internal standard and natural analyte similar to precipitate samples analyte in each sample was concentrated in a conditioned waters oasis solid phase extraction hlb cartridge after concentration each cartridge was washed with ultra pure water and then eluted with high purity methanol methanol extract was evaporated to near dryness under nitrogen gas in a 55 c water bath and then reconstituted to a total volume of 1 5 ml using methanol and filtered through 0 22 μm pvdf filter membranes analyte recovery for each sample matrix was assessed according to eq 1 by using the difference in concentrations ternes and joss 2007 the recovery of each matrix is documented in the supplementary material table s2 1 recovery c spike c sample c added 100 where cspike is the concentration in the spiked sample csample is the concentration in the natural sample and cadded is the concentration dosed to the spiked sample after sample preparation each sample was analysed using a waters acquity ultra performance liquid chromatograph attached to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer uplc ms ms equipped with an electrospray ionization probe running in negative ionization mode esi separation was achieved using a waters beh c18 1 7 μm column using a gradient elution with 5 mm ammonium acetate in hplc grade water and lc ms grade methanol provided by sigma aldrich and fisher scientific respectively high purity reference standards were used to optimize each analyte s response at the beginning of the project and to prepare a multi point calibration curve to quantify each compound isotope dilution was used to account for analyte losses during sample preparation and for instrumental error during analysis detection of analyte was confirmed by retention time off the column the mass of the precursor ion and the subsequent detection of at least one fragment ion a summary of the chemical supplier compound purity retention time precursor ion mass and fragment ion mass es used for analyte quantification are summarized in the supplementary material table s3 3 results discussion 3 1 centrate characterization centrate characterization is presented in table 3 comparison among centrates shows significantly higher op concentrations in acid ad vessels furthermore mesophilic ad has a higher op concentration than the respective thermophilic ad this may be explained by the uncontrolled precipitation of struvite and calcium phosphate that may occur within an ad vessel marti et al 2008 aage et al 1997 determined that the struvite solubility increased from 1 6 10 14 to 3 4 10 14 between a temperature of 30 and 50 c and borgerding 1972 observed similar solubility trends with regards to temperature furthermore borgerding 1972 reported that struvite solubility in a solution at a ph of 4 5 was greater than 5000 mg l which rapidly decreased to 100 mg l at a ph change of 7 5 the temperature and ph solubility trends found in the literature are supportive of the op data observed in the centrate characterization from a scaling prevention and struvite recovery perspective it would be optimal to perform struvite precipitation on mesophilic acid ad when considering the other ad options for all the centrates characterized a reduction in nrdp is observed as the polymer dose increases don is observed to increase in the mesophilic centrates as the polymer dose increases increased polymer dose has led to an increase in solids capture rate as demonstrated by the tss measurements in fig 3 it is presumed that the mechanism for removal of nrdp through increased polymer dose is solid capture however the production of don in the mesophilic centrates is stipulated to be a by product of the dewatering polymer the dewatering polymer zetag 7553 is marketed as a polyacrylamide flocculent one of the functional groups in polyacrylamide flocculants are nitrogen containing amines through centrifugal dewatering amines and fractions of the polymer backbone may be sheared and solubilized into solution although table 3 shows a significant increase in don for the mesophilic ad centrates it is unclear why thermophilic centrate don concentrations were not significantly affected by the polymer dose further investigation into the effect polyacrylamide polymer has on don through centrifuge dewatering is required to arrive at a definitive conclusion the dissolved nutrient centrate characterization suggests that nrdp may be reduced by increasing polyacrylamide polymer dose one final remark on the centrate characterization is the comparison between acid ad and acid gas ad nrdp concentrations higher concentrations of nrdp in the acid ad centrates are consistent with the concept that hydrolysis reactions are expected to solubilize particulate solids barker and stuckey 1999 however reduction in nrdp concentration in the acid gas ad centrate suggest there is a removal mechanism during methanogenesis table 3 kuo andparkin 1996 have demonstrated that anaerobic biological growth srt 40 day produces soluble microbial products that chelated 44 mg l of nickel from solution it is possible that as anaerobic srt increases from 2 day acid ad to 20 day acid gas ad soluble microbial products are produced that chelate nrdp from solution as observed in table 3 however the acid gas ad effluent is dosed with significantly more polymer than acid ad which may also be the contributing factor to lower nrdp concentration 3 2 solids analysis a visual example of turbidity removal is shown in fig 2 the image shows the same thermophilic acid ad centrate prior to precipitation and 5 min after the precipitation procedure right the reduction in turbidity is clear because the baseboard in the fume hood is visible in the treated centrate turbidity reduction suggests solids are being removed analysis of tss on treated and untreated centrate samples indicates that the salt precipitation methodology can be used as a solids removal strategy fig 3 shows paired tss concentrations of each centrate before and after precipitation it appears that the greatest reduction in tss occurs at an initial tss concentration of around 0 08 and 0 15 g l and a reduction below 0 02 g tss l was not achieved in this experiment tss data can be an indication of removal of nutrients bound to solid sizes greater than 1 5 μm one mechanism for removal of colloidal particles is surface charge neutralization in order to confirm that the mechanism of solids removal was not surface charge neutralization zeta potential was measured on untreated and treated samples from precipitation in most samples the zeta potential became stronger i e deviated more from neutral however in the only case where the zeta potential became weaker through precipitation the difference was not found to be statistically significant using a paired t test p 184 05 the zeta potential data which is shown in the supplementary material fig s3 helped reinforce the hypothesis that charge neutralization is not the mechanism of colloidal material removal 3 3 colloidal nutrient removal the removal of nrdp from ad centrate using heterogeneous nucleation was successfully demonstrated through nutrient testing on the untreated and treated centrates fig 4 by comparing untreated and treated centrate concentrations average nrdp removal was found to be 81 6 for 32 batch runs 8 58 speciation of nrdp showed that the polydp fraction displayed a reproducible removal of 92 8 5 6 while orgdp removal displayed lower average removal of 74 4 with considerable variability 12 4 a linear analysis of variance between the factors involved in the experiment revealed that the ad operating temperature p 094 0 05 and srt p 356 0 05 did not significantly influence nrdp removal on the other hand polymer dose p 004 0 05 had a significant influence on the nrdp removal lower polymer dose yielded a greater nrdp removal as summarized in the discussion of table 3 centrates dewatered with higher polymer dose experience a higher reduction in nrdp in the untreated centrate this may explain the significant effect of polymer dose as a reduction in untreated centrate nrdp will reduce the magnitude of nrdp removal during chemical precipitation in general the precipitation methodology can be applied to any of the biological centrates used in this study without sacrificing nrdp removal efficiency but the upstream dewatering polymer dose optimization may be needed for the desirable process performance the robust removal of polydp is assumed to be because of hydrolysis reactions that are catalyzed by the abundance of magnesium ions divalent cations such as magnesium can cleave phosphate from a polyphosphate molecule through a chelation mechanism rashchi and finch 2000 although the polydp removal is consistent for the acid gas ad centrates between the high polymer and low polymer dose experiments the acid ad centrates are affected by polymer dose with respect to polydp removal this may be a result of the effect that polymer dose has on the untreated centrate polydp concentration in the acid ad centrates the untreated centrate polydp concentration decreases from 8 4 to 4 6 mg polydp l and 11 3 to 3 5 mg polydp l for mesophilic and thermophilic acid ad respectively table 3 however this effect is also observed in the acid gas ad centrates in a similar magnitude it is unclear why the acid ad centrate is affected by polymer dose more than the acid gas ad centrates and further research is required to investigate this topic removal of don was also demonstrated using the precipitation methodology fig 5 the average removal efficiency was 65 7 20 1 in comparison to nrdp don experienced consistently lower removal rates through the struvite precipitation process this observation is assumed to be caused by the hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics of nrdp and don qin et al 2015 characterized the hydrophobic properties of final effluent nrdp and don using resin separation and found that don and nrdp was 72 2 and 19 3 hydrophilic respectively this means that don is much more likely to exist as a solute in solution while nrdp is more likely to be adsorbed in colloidal particles therefore the greater removal of nrdp is expected considering that the theoretical removal mechanism used in the chemical precipitation is heterogeneous nucleation onto colloids the srt p 166 was not found to be significantly affecting the don removal however ad temperature p 001 and polymer dose p 049 did have a significant effect on don removal in a study done by ahuja et al 2015 the temperature of thermal hydrolysis prior to ad was found to influence the hydrophilic fraction of don in the centrate sidestream it is presumed that the temperature of ad will similarly impact the fraction of hydrophilic and hydrophobic don and subsequently influence the removal rates observed in the downstream centrate treatment a definitive characterization of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic fraction of don in mesophilic and thermophilic ad vessels is required to verify this assumption 3 4 micropollutants micropollutants were measured through the high polymer dose experiment for precipitate and treated centrate samples the measured concentrations of tcs and tcc are presented in fig 6 the magnitude of concentration for tcs and tcc was similar within the precipitate matrix fig 6a however tcs concentration in the treated centrate samples was an order of magnitude greater than the tcc concentration fig 6b tcs and tcc concentrations were larger in the acid ad treated centrate samples it is theorized that the antimicrobials which were originally part of the sludge structure were released into the liquid soluble phase as a result of hydrolysis but did not have sufficient retention time to undergo biodegradation in acid ad vessels there are multiple methods of handling struvite post precipitation two common methods to remove water from struvite slurry include thermal drying and dewatering thickening although chemical drying has also become an established method bowers 2016 at the full scale the fate of micropollutant contamination will change depending on the method of water removal the micropollutant contamination found in fig 6a is representative of struvite micropollutant contamination using thermal drying techniques however if interstitial fluid is removed via centrifugation micropollutants are expected to be removed using the average micropollutant concentrations in precipitates fig 6a treated centrate fig 6b and ts data table s4 a prediction of the micropollutant contamination that would be found in struvite precipitates that are dewatered prior to drying may be reported according to eq 2 where c denotes the concentrate of tcs or tcc and ts represents the solids concentration of the struvite precipitates prior to drying 2 c precipitates dewatered c precipitates dried c treated centrate 1 ts struvite slurry the calculation yields concentrations of tcs and tcc between 2 and 18 ng g dry fig 7 the negative micropollutant contamination in the mesophilic acid gas sample is presumed to be a result of the low tss removal and small initial tss concentration in the centrate sample fig 3b in comparison tcs and tcc can be found in biosolids being land applied to food crops in concentrations of 9280 and 7060 ng g dry for tcc and tcs respectively cha and cupples 2009 therefore mass flux of micropollutant contamination to agricultural lands can be reduced by applying struvite fertilizer instead of biosolids and dispose biosolids via different methods e g incineration 4 conclusions based on the study of centrate treatment using heterogeneous struvite precipitation the following summary conclusions were drawn struvite precipitation can be used to remove nrdp and don from ad dewatering centrate increasing the dose of polyacrylamide polymer to ad effluent during centrifugal dewatering will have a reducing effect on nrdp in the product dewatering centrate the untreated dewatering centrate tss concentration has a non linear impact on colloidal removal during heterogeneous struvite precipitation with an optimal initial tss concentration observed around 0 15 g l of tss and micropollutants modeled as tcs and tcc may be present in resultant struvite precipitates but at minor concentrations in comparison to land applied biosolids acknowledgements this research was made possible by nserc engage grant f15 00588 the sponsor did not have a role in

19761,the primary objective of this research was to remove recalcitrant nutrients from anaerobically digested sludge dewatering centrate a struvite precipitation methodology is proposed where salt crystals are encouraged to ballast colloidal particles through heterogeneous nucleation and subsequent crystal growth the secondary objective was to assess presence of micropollutants in precipitates four biologically unique dewatering centrates were used to test the precipitation methodology on the variety of anaerobic digester configurations that can be expected from municipal wastewater treatment plant the effect of digestion sludge retention time 2 day 20 day and digestion temperature 35 c 55 c on the removal of dissolved unreactive phosphorus p and nitrogen n was monitored averaged across all four centrates the precipitation methodology resulted in dissolved unreactive p and n removal of 82 4 and 66 6 respectively antimicrobial contaminants triclosan triclocarban were observed in the precipitates at minute concentrations 18 ng g dry solids therefore mass struvite precipitation can provide a means of recalcitrant nutrient treatment and reactive nutrient recovery without the micropollutant burden of biosolids land application graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion sidestream struvite non reactive dissolved phosphorus dissolved organic nitrogen micropollutant 1 introduction phosphorus p and nitrogen n are wastewater effluent constituents that cause eutrophication in receiving watersheds howarth and marino 2006 jarvie et al 2006 schindler et al 2016 as population and nutrient loading to surface water increases the risk of eutrophication also increases to mitigate increasing nutrient load wastewater treatment facilities wwtfs are targeting more stringent nutrient discharge regulations bott et al 2012 biological nutrient removal bnr and tertiary filtration are commonly used processes that achieve low effluent nutrient concentrations without the need for consumable chemical reagents barnard 1975 bott et al 2012 qin et al 2015 li and brett 2015 although these processes are effective at removing inorganic and particulate nutrient species small colloidal material containing bound n or p can persist through the treatment processes and end up in the final effluent as nutrient pollution neethling and stensel 2013 galvagno et al 2016 metal salt addition may be used to control recalcitrant n and p upstream of tertiary filters arnaldos and pagilla 2010 but the high metal p ratio required passes on significant cost to the wwtf operator especially for facilities targeting ultra low discharge concentrations smith et al 2008 gu et al 2013 colloidal n and p can become bioavailable once introduced to the environment and will contribute to eutrophication for example algal bioassay tests done on tertiary effluent originating from a wwtf using bnr and tertiary filtration found that non reactive dissolved phosphorus nrdp can become 73 7 80 bioavailable to algal and microbial species qin et al 2015 li and brett 2015 similarly studies have demonstrated dissolved organic nitrogen don bioavailability from bnr effluent was between 19 and 68 after bioassays urgun demirtas et al 2008 sattayatewa et al 2009 as watershed management practices develop and nutrient discharge regulations become more stringent it will become necessary to develop treatment strategies that prevent nrdp and don from being discharged in the final effluent management of nutrient species is complicated by the anaerobic digestion ad process ad is used to stabilize organic residuals through a biological process that includes hydrolysis of organic material appels et al 2008 however when secondary sludge from the bnr process is used as substrate for an ad process nutrients are solubilized into the liquid phase and recirculated back to the bnr process through a sidestream centrate flow in this scenario uncontrolled phosphorus release leads to two sources for process failure blockage of piping conveyance through scaling build up bhattarai et al 1989 and phosphorus bleed through in the mainstream bnr process murakami et al 1987 pitman 1999 an ancillary issue associated with the hydrolysis of secondary sludge from a bnr process is the release of colloidal nutrients such as nrdp and don galvagno et al 2014 for example table 1 compares colloidal nutrient concentration from centrate produced at a 35 ml day bnr wwtf no ad to centrates produced from bench scale ad using residuals from the same wwtf in each case the dewatering polymer zetag 7553 is dosed to achieve maximum cake total solids ts furthermore the nrdp and don data in table 1 is used to compare the mass loading from centrate and final effluent streams using a 0 51 centrate mainstream flow and a final effluent nutrient concentration of 0 055 mg nrdp l and 1 57 mg don l galvagno et al 2016 as seen in table 1 ad adds 410 and 529 more nrdp into the mainstream than undigested centrate for mesophilic and thermophilic ad respectively the nrdp and don in ad centrates can be a significant mass load to a wwtf therefore targeted removal of nrdp and don in the ad dewatering centrate may be an efficient strategy when considering the ultimate goal of minimizing final effluent nutrient pollution orthophosphate op and ammonia are abundant in ad centrates especially when residuals originating from a bnr wwtf are digested marti et al 2008 bolzonella et al 2012 galvagno et al 2016 sidestream op treatment using struvite precipitation is a well established technology that has been demonstrated at the full scale ueno and fujii 2001 münch and barr 2001 the removal of op as struvite has an added benefit of producing fertilizer uysal et al 2010 which has the potential to reduce global demand on phosphate ore reserves by 1 6 shu et al 2006 struvite precipitation may be implemented using two main crystal morphology methodologies a visual description of each type of precipitation mechanism is shown in fig 1 precipitation morphology can be controlled by maintaining the solution in the metastable zone or the labile zone within the metastable zone a solution will precipitate onto existing crystals lewis et al 2015 however without the presence of crystal surface a metastable solution is not likely to precipitate because it does not contain enough solute entities or ions contributing to supersaturation to develop a nuclei cluster capable of overcoming the gibbs free energy requirement to produce a crystal nucleus lewis et al 2015 within the labile zone solution supersaturation conditions overcome the gibbs free energy requirement and the solution can form crystal nuclei as the extent of solution supersaturation increases the rate of struvite precipitation accelerates rapidly according to second order growth kinetics bouropoulos and koutsoukos 2000 kofina and koutsoukos 2005 in this research struvite is precipitated from ad centrate in a manner that encourages solution supersaturation and mass struvite precipitation mass struvite precipitation is intended to selectively target centrate colloidal impurities through heterogeneous nucleation a foreign surface facilitates nucleation by reducing the gibbs free energy needed to produce a crystal nucleus kalikmanov 2013 therefore it is probable that crystals produced during mass precipitation will nucleate onto colloidal impurities subsequent crystal growth is expected to encase or otherwise fixate the crystal nucleus to the colloidal material after sufficient crystal growth the gravity force of the larger mass may overcome surface charge repulsion the primary objective of the experiment is to demonstrate removal of nrdp and don through mass precipitation of struvite onto colloidal material and subsequent settling fig 1 upper row in effect this process allows for simultaneous treatment of soluble reactive nutrients and colloidal recalcitrant nutrients the precipitation methodology has the potential to introduce forms of pollution that may have an adverse impact on the quality of struvite micropollutants have not been observed to sorb onto struvite crystals precipitated from a crystallizer that targets metastable supersaturation fig 1 lower row butkovskyi et al 2015 or from synthetic urine with dosed micropollutants huang et al 2016 however micropollutants may become a part of the struvite crystal through heterogeneous attachment of colloidal particles that contain sorbed micropollutants a survey of wwtfs across the united states has found a 70 correlation between micropollutants found in human and wastewater samples venkatesan and halden 2014 suggesting that human excretion is a major source of micropollutant contamination found at the wwtf unfortunately as little as 12 micropollutant removal occurs at a modern wwtf luo et al 2014 which can affect fish in the aquatic environment brodin et al 2013 and lead to pathways for human exposure triclosan tcs and triclocarban tcc are widely used as ingredients in many household and personal care products such as shampoos soaps cosmetics plastic additives and toys mainly for disinfection and sanitation purposes halden 2014 they have a large presence in the wwtf solid residual stream are resistant to anaerobic biodegradation and are highly hydrophobic ying et al 2007 therefore tcs and tcc are likely micropollutant compounds that will persist through ad and end up sorbed onto the organic colloids targeted for removal in this experiment and can serve as a surrogate for micropollutants in wastewater and sludge these compounds and many of their degradation by products are found to be persistent in agricultural soils kwoon and xia 2011 prosser et al 2014 while several studies have shown uptake of these compounds from biosolids amended soils and translocation of tcs and tcc from plant roots into plant stems leaves and edible portions of a number of common fruits and vegetables aryal and reinhold 2011 prosser et al 2014 therefore a secondary objective of the experiment is to explore the struvite micropollutant contamination potential 2 materials methodology 2 1 sample preparation and precipitation procedure bench scale ad vessels with total and effective volumes ranging from 1 to 4 l were operated at steady state for 8 months ad vessels were considered at steady state when less than 10 variation in volatile solids removal and biogas production was observed substrate consisted of a 0 33 0 67 volumetric ratio of mixed fermented primary sludge total solids ts 56 7 g dry l to thickened waste activated sludge ts 34 82 g dry l obtained weekly from the kelowna wastewater treatment facility kwwtf in british columbia canada that employs a five stage modified bardenpho bnr process the sludge retention time srt for the bnr process varies between 6 and 13 d during the summer and winter seasons respectively the sludge ratio used was representative of the full scale kwwtf sludge production four biologically unique dewatering centrates were used to test the precipitation methodology on the variety of anaerobic digester configurations that can be expected from typical municipal wastewater treatment plants acid gas ad srt 20 d and acid ad srt 2 d was used to produce ad effluent at mesophilic 35 c and thermophilic 55 c operating temperature acid gas ads simulated conventional single stage ad where hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis were co occurring while acid ad vessels favoured hydrolysis and acidogenesis mesophilic inoculum was sampled from the effluent of a 7 l new brunswick automated fermenter the bench scale fermenter had been operating using kwwtf mixed sludge for over three years originally the mesophilic inoculum was sourced from the city of penticton s british columbia canada mesophilic ad tanks thermophilic inoculum was obtained from ad effluent produced from a bench scale ad experiment operating for 8 months the experiment used mixed sludge from the westside regional municipal treatment facility which operates similar to the kwwtf originally the thermophilic inoculum from the experiment was sourced from full scale ad tanks at the annacis island municipal wwtf vancouver canada digesters were fed manually in a semi continuous mode once a day 7 days week and kept in temperature controlled shakers rotating at 120 rpm details on ad operation and performance may be found in the supplementary material fig s1 table s1 and are consistent with published literature demirel and yenigün 2002 wahidunnabi and eskicioglu 2014 effluent from ad vessels was dewatered using zetag 7553 polyacrylamide dewatering polymer zetag 7553 was chosen because it was being used at the kwwtf during the time of experimentation initially dewatering polymer was applied to achieve the maximum cake ts concentration low dose and the second iteration applied dewatering polymer to achieve maximum solids capture yielding the lowest tss concentration in centrate high dose the applied polymer doses are presented in table 2 nutrient precipitation testing was performed on centrates taken from ad vessels during steady state struvite was precipitated from centrate samples in beakers containing 1 l of centrate a phipps bird pb 900 jar tester was used to provide controlled mixing while stirring at 120 rpm a 1 5 m solution as mg2 from acs grade mgcl2 6h2o was quickly injected to target a 1 1 5 p mg molar ratio within 30 s of subsequent mixing the ph was rapidly adjusted to 9 0 1 by injecting a pre determined volume of 10 m naoh solution acs grade the mixing was then reduced to 30 rpm to avoid shearing and a final dose of 10 m naoh solution was slowly injected to raise the ph to 10 the solution was mixed gently at 30 rpm for a further 5 min and then allowed to settle for 30 min after settling the supernatant was sampled 2 2 solids analysis characterization of colloidal and particulate solids provides evidence that mass struvite precipitation and subsequent settling was the mechanism for colloidal nutrient removal scanning election microscope imaging of the resulting precipitates has been included in the supplementary material solids were characterized by the sequenced measurement of total suspended solids tss and dynamic light scattering dls on the filtrate of the tss measurement tss was measured according to standard methods procedure 2540d apha 2005 using prewashed glass microfiber filters that retain particle sizes greater than 1 5 μm vwr cat no 28333 129 a malvern zetasizer nano zs was used to characterize the colloids in the filtrate of the tss measurement the zetasizer was used to measure the zeta potential of colloidal solids using dls while applying an electric field to the fluid sample all zetasizer measurements were done at 25 c 2 3 nutrient analysis all phosphorus testing has been described in previous research galvagno et al 2016 in the testing procedures nrdp is further characterized into organic dissolved phosphorus orgdp and acid hydrolyzable dissolved phosphorus dissolved polyphosphates polydp are considered to be the same as the acid hydrolyzable phosphorus fraction for the purpose of discussion however slight discrepancy between polyphosphate and acid hydrolysable phosphorus are noted in the literature apha 2005 fig s2 the 0 45 μm pore sized membrane filter has been used to distinguish between dissolved and suspended material total nitrogen was measured using the persulfate digestion method apha 4500 p j for this method 4 ml of sample was autoclaved at 140 170 kpa for 1 h in the presence of an alkali 0 2 m persulphate solution from acs grade k2s2o8 undigested samples and digested samples were measured for nitrate using a dionex ion chromatograph model ics 2100 equipped with an as11 hc column 4 250 mm a matching guard column potassium hydroxide eluent and a thermal conductivity detector nitrite was measured using the colourimetric method apha no2 b and ammonia was measured using apha 4500 nh3 f apha 2005 dissolved organic nitrogen was interpreted as the difference between dissolved total nitrogen and the sum of nitrite nitrate and ammonia nitrate and nitrite were considered negligible after two batches of testing on each experimental centrate did not detect any analytes limit of detection for the ion chromatography method was considered as three times the signal versus the background noise in the blank samples 2 4 micropollutant analysis tcs and tcc were measured in both precipitates and post precipitation treated centrate samples to observe if the mass precipitation procedure caused the precipitates to become significantly contaminated with micropollutants blank samples were carried through the sample preparation procedure in replicates of three one blank replicate was left unchanged to ensure the sample preparation procedure or column carryover did not introduce contamination the second replicate was spiked with isotopically labelled tcc tcc d4 as an internal standard and the third replicate was spiked with 100 μl of 1 5 ppm tcc d4 internal standard and 100 μl of 500 ppb of native micropollutants in high purity methanol sand that had been preheated to 550 c for 30 min was used as the blank for precipitates and the 5 μm filtered fraction of peat moss extract solution was used as the blank for centrate samples the precipitate samples were dried in a thermotron environmental chamber for several days at 50 1 1 c to avoid mass loss from the crystal structure above a temperature of 50 c ammonia and moisture has been observed to volatilize from struvite ali 2007 once at steady mass samples were crushed using an agate mortar and pestle that was thoroughly cleaned between samples a 0 5 g mass of sample was suspended in 15 ml of acetonitrile bdh chemical acs grade within clean high density polyethylene containers at this point 100 μl of 1 5 ppm tcc d4 solution was added to each sample and 100 μl of 500 ppb natural analyte was added to one replicate of each sample the solution was agitated in a vortex mixer for 30 min and then left to settle overnight the supernatant was transferred to glass cuvettes submersed in a 55 c water bath and evaporated to near dryness under nitrogen gas finally the extract was reconstituted in methanol to 1 5 ml and filtered into injection vials through a syringe style 0 22 μm polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf filter membrane the centrate effluent samples were dosed with internal standard and natural analyte similar to precipitate samples analyte in each sample was concentrated in a conditioned waters oasis solid phase extraction hlb cartridge after concentration each cartridge was washed with ultra pure water and then eluted with high purity methanol methanol extract was evaporated to near dryness under nitrogen gas in a 55 c water bath and then reconstituted to a total volume of 1 5 ml using methanol and filtered through 0 22 μm pvdf filter membranes analyte recovery for each sample matrix was assessed according to eq 1 by using the difference in concentrations ternes and joss 2007 the recovery of each matrix is documented in the supplementary material table s2 1 recovery c spike c sample c added 100 where cspike is the concentration in the spiked sample csample is the concentration in the natural sample and cadded is the concentration dosed to the spiked sample after sample preparation each sample was analysed using a waters acquity ultra performance liquid chromatograph attached to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer uplc ms ms equipped with an electrospray ionization probe running in negative ionization mode esi separation was achieved using a waters beh c18 1 7 μm column using a gradient elution with 5 mm ammonium acetate in hplc grade water and lc ms grade methanol provided by sigma aldrich and fisher scientific respectively high purity reference standards were used to optimize each analyte s response at the beginning of the project and to prepare a multi point calibration curve to quantify each compound isotope dilution was used to account for analyte losses during sample preparation and for instrumental error during analysis detection of analyte was confirmed by retention time off the column the mass of the precursor ion and the subsequent detection of at least one fragment ion a summary of the chemical supplier compound purity retention time precursor ion mass and fragment ion mass es used for analyte quantification are summarized in the supplementary material table s3 3 results discussion 3 1 centrate characterization centrate characterization is presented in table 3 comparison among centrates shows significantly higher op concentrations in acid ad vessels furthermore mesophilic ad has a higher op concentration than the respective thermophilic ad this may be explained by the uncontrolled precipitation of struvite and calcium phosphate that may occur within an ad vessel marti et al 2008 aage et al 1997 determined that the struvite solubility increased from 1 6 10 14 to 3 4 10 14 between a temperature of 30 and 50 c and borgerding 1972 observed similar solubility trends with regards to temperature furthermore borgerding 1972 reported that struvite solubility in a solution at a ph of 4 5 was greater than 5000 mg l which rapidly decreased to 100 mg l at a ph change of 7 5 the temperature and ph solubility trends found in the literature are supportive of the op data observed in the centrate characterization from a scaling prevention and struvite recovery perspective it would be optimal to perform struvite precipitation on mesophilic acid ad when considering the other ad options for all the centrates characterized a reduction in nrdp is observed as the polymer dose increases don is observed to increase in the mesophilic centrates as the polymer dose increases increased polymer dose has led to an increase in solids capture rate as demonstrated by the tss measurements in fig 3 it is presumed that the mechanism for removal of nrdp through increased polymer dose is solid capture however the production of don in the mesophilic centrates is stipulated to be a by product of the dewatering polymer the dewatering polymer zetag 7553 is marketed as a polyacrylamide flocculent one of the functional groups in polyacrylamide flocculants are nitrogen containing amines through centrifugal dewatering amines and fractions of the polymer backbone may be sheared and solubilized into solution although table 3 shows a significant increase in don for the mesophilic ad centrates it is unclear why thermophilic centrate don concentrations were not significantly affected by the polymer dose further investigation into the effect polyacrylamide polymer has on don through centrifuge dewatering is required to arrive at a definitive conclusion the dissolved nutrient centrate characterization suggests that nrdp may be reduced by increasing polyacrylamide polymer dose one final remark on the centrate characterization is the comparison between acid ad and acid gas ad nrdp concentrations higher concentrations of nrdp in the acid ad centrates are consistent with the concept that hydrolysis reactions are expected to solubilize particulate solids barker and stuckey 1999 however reduction in nrdp concentration in the acid gas ad centrate suggest there is a removal mechanism during methanogenesis table 3 kuo andparkin 1996 have demonstrated that anaerobic biological growth srt 40 day produces soluble microbial products that chelated 44 mg l of nickel from solution it is possible that as anaerobic srt increases from 2 day acid ad to 20 day acid gas ad soluble microbial products are produced that chelate nrdp from solution as observed in table 3 however the acid gas ad effluent is dosed with significantly more polymer than acid ad which may also be the contributing factor to lower nrdp concentration 3 2 solids analysis a visual example of turbidity removal is shown in fig 2 the image shows the same thermophilic acid ad centrate prior to precipitation and 5 min after the precipitation procedure right the reduction in turbidity is clear because the baseboard in the fume hood is visible in the treated centrate turbidity reduction suggests solids are being removed analysis of tss on treated and untreated centrate samples indicates that the salt precipitation methodology can be used as a solids removal strategy fig 3 shows paired tss concentrations of each centrate before and after precipitation it appears that the greatest reduction in tss occurs at an initial tss concentration of around 0 08 and 0 15 g l and a reduction below 0 02 g tss l was not achieved in this experiment tss data can be an indication of removal of nutrients bound to solid sizes greater than 1 5 μm one mechanism for removal of colloidal particles is surface charge neutralization in order to confirm that the mechanism of solids removal was not surface charge neutralization zeta potential was measured on untreated and treated samples from precipitation in most samples the zeta potential became stronger i e deviated more from neutral however in the only case where the zeta potential became weaker through precipitation the difference was not found to be statistically significant using a paired t test p 184 05 the zeta potential data which is shown in the supplementary material fig s3 helped reinforce the hypothesis that charge neutralization is not the mechanism of colloidal material removal 3 3 colloidal nutrient removal the removal of nrdp from ad centrate using heterogeneous nucleation was successfully demonstrated through nutrient testing on the untreated and treated centrates fig 4 by comparing untreated and treated centrate concentrations average nrdp removal was found to be 81 6 for 32 batch runs 8 58 speciation of nrdp showed that the polydp fraction displayed a reproducible removal of 92 8 5 6 while orgdp removal displayed lower average removal of 74 4 with considerable variability 12 4 a linear analysis of variance between the factors involved in the experiment revealed that the ad operating temperature p 094 0 05 and srt p 356 0 05 did not significantly influence nrdp removal on the other hand polymer dose p 004 0 05 had a significant influence on the nrdp removal lower polymer dose yielded a greater nrdp removal as summarized in the discussion of table 3 centrates dewatered with higher polymer dose experience a higher reduction in nrdp in the untreated centrate this may explain the significant effect of polymer dose as a reduction in untreated centrate nrdp will reduce the magnitude of nrdp removal during chemical precipitation in general the precipitation methodology can be applied to any of the biological centrates used in this study without sacrificing nrdp removal efficiency but the upstream dewatering polymer dose optimization may be needed for the desirable process performance the robust removal of polydp is assumed to be because of hydrolysis reactions that are catalyzed by the abundance of magnesium ions divalent cations such as magnesium can cleave phosphate from a polyphosphate molecule through a chelation mechanism rashchi and finch 2000 although the polydp removal is consistent for the acid gas ad centrates between the high polymer and low polymer dose experiments the acid ad centrates are affected by polymer dose with respect to polydp removal this may be a result of the effect that polymer dose has on the untreated centrate polydp concentration in the acid ad centrates the untreated centrate polydp concentration decreases from 8 4 to 4 6 mg polydp l and 11 3 to 3 5 mg polydp l for mesophilic and thermophilic acid ad respectively table 3 however this effect is also observed in the acid gas ad centrates in a similar magnitude it is unclear why the acid ad centrate is affected by polymer dose more than the acid gas ad centrates and further research is required to investigate this topic removal of don was also demonstrated using the precipitation methodology fig 5 the average removal efficiency was 65 7 20 1 in comparison to nrdp don experienced consistently lower removal rates through the struvite precipitation process this observation is assumed to be caused by the hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics of nrdp and don qin et al 2015 characterized the hydrophobic properties of final effluent nrdp and don using resin separation and found that don and nrdp was 72 2 and 19 3 hydrophilic respectively this means that don is much more likely to exist as a solute in solution while nrdp is more likely to be adsorbed in colloidal particles therefore the greater removal of nrdp is expected considering that the theoretical removal mechanism used in the chemical precipitation is heterogeneous nucleation onto colloids the srt p 166 was not found to be significantly affecting the don removal however ad temperature p 001 and polymer dose p 049 did have a significant effect on don removal in a study done by ahuja et al 2015 the temperature of thermal hydrolysis prior to ad was found to influence the hydrophilic fraction of don in the centrate sidestream it is presumed that the temperature of ad will similarly impact the fraction of hydrophilic and hydrophobic don and subsequently influence the removal rates observed in the downstream centrate treatment a definitive characterization of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic fraction of don in mesophilic and thermophilic ad vessels is required to verify this assumption 3 4 micropollutants micropollutants were measured through the high polymer dose experiment for precipitate and treated centrate samples the measured concentrations of tcs and tcc are presented in fig 6 the magnitude of concentration for tcs and tcc was similar within the precipitate matrix fig 6a however tcs concentration in the treated centrate samples was an order of magnitude greater than the tcc concentration fig 6b tcs and tcc concentrations were larger in the acid ad treated centrate samples it is theorized that the antimicrobials which were originally part of the sludge structure were released into the liquid soluble phase as a result of hydrolysis but did not have sufficient retention time to undergo biodegradation in acid ad vessels there are multiple methods of handling struvite post precipitation two common methods to remove water from struvite slurry include thermal drying and dewatering thickening although chemical drying has also become an established method bowers 2016 at the full scale the fate of micropollutant contamination will change depending on the method of water removal the micropollutant contamination found in fig 6a is representative of struvite micropollutant contamination using thermal drying techniques however if interstitial fluid is removed via centrifugation micropollutants are expected to be removed using the average micropollutant concentrations in precipitates fig 6a treated centrate fig 6b and ts data table s4 a prediction of the micropollutant contamination that would be found in struvite precipitates that are dewatered prior to drying may be reported according to eq 2 where c denotes the concentrate of tcs or tcc and ts represents the solids concentration of the struvite precipitates prior to drying 2 c precipitates dewatered c precipitates dried c treated centrate 1 ts struvite slurry the calculation yields concentrations of tcs and tcc between 2 and 18 ng g dry fig 7 the negative micropollutant contamination in the mesophilic acid gas sample is presumed to be a result of the low tss removal and small initial tss concentration in the centrate sample fig 3b in comparison tcs and tcc can be found in biosolids being land applied to food crops in concentrations of 9280 and 7060 ng g dry for tcc and tcs respectively cha and cupples 2009 therefore mass flux of micropollutant contamination to agricultural lands can be reduced by applying struvite fertilizer instead of biosolids and dispose biosolids via different methods e g incineration 4 conclusions based on the study of centrate treatment using heterogeneous struvite precipitation the following summary conclusions were drawn struvite precipitation can be used to remove nrdp and don from ad dewatering centrate increasing the dose of polyacrylamide polymer to ad effluent during centrifugal dewatering will have a reducing effect on nrdp in the product dewatering centrate the untreated dewatering centrate tss concentration has a non linear impact on colloidal removal during heterogeneous struvite precipitation with an optimal initial tss concentration observed around 0 15 g l of tss and micropollutants modeled as tcs and tcc may be present in resultant struvite precipitates but at minor concentrations in comparison to land applied biosolids acknowledgements this research was made possible by nserc engage grant f15 00588 the sponsor did not have a role in

19762,waste stabilization ponds wsp are one of the most common forms of wastewater treatment for smaller communities globally but have poor phosphorus removal it is known that wsp algae can accumulate polyphosphate within their cells in excess of that needed for cell function if polyphosphate accumulation could be triggered at the higher range of wsp cell concentrations phosphorus removal from domestic wastewater could be significantly improved however this phenomenon is sporadic and still not fully understood with a view of building a fundamental understanding to underpin the engineering of a new phosphorus removal process this paper examines eight previously untested variables that may influence the cellular phosphorus content of wsp biomass although calcium magnesium and potassium are key constituents of polyphosphate granules the concentrations tested were not limiting to polyphosphate accumulation while literature also pointed to inoculum characteristics as potentially having an impact no significance was found in this research conversely three important new triggers where identified that significantly 90 confidence affected the cellular phosphorus content of wsp biomass an increase in cellular phosphorus content was triggered by decreasing the organic load or allowing the ph to increase as compared to ph control by contrast the presence of mixing decreased the phosphorus content of the wsp biomass graphical abstract image 1 keywords luxury uptake microalgae nutrient removal phosphorus polyphosphate waste stabilization pond 1 introduction waste stabilization ponds wsp are used by thousands of small communities around the world due to their low cost and simplistic operation although wsps can be effective at removing organic pollutants and pathogens phosphorus p removal is typically low with removal rates of between 15 and 50 garcia et al 2000 ghazy et al 2008 mburu et al 2013 with regulators becoming stricter on p discharge wsp operators globally are being faced with costly upgrades to improve p removal currently two main upgrade options are available to improve p removal in wsps addition of chemical dosing or a shift to enhanced biological p removal ebpr chemical dosing with coagulants such as aluminium sulphate alum or ferric salts is the most common upgrade option due to its consistently high p removal however the increased operating costs associated with the coagulants and disposal of the resulting chemical sludge is a drawback for smaller communities instead of using chemicals for p removal it is possible to utilise microorganisms ebpr uses microorganisms to accumulate p as polyphosphate and thereby reduce the p concentration in the effluent however ebpr is a complex system that requires aeration and careful control to achieve p removal when we reflect on why small communities selected wsps to start with i e low operating costs and simple operation the combined operating and capital costs of an ebpr system makes this option often seen as an inappropriate replacement for wsps this leaves a problem for these smaller communities relying on wsps instead of focusing on alternatives to wsps consideration should be given to improving wsp design in order to optimise the processes that are already naturally occurring an important natural process occurring in wsps is algal assimilation of p for normal cellular growth algae typically have a p content of less than 1 gp gss goldman 1980 kaplan et al 1986 however in wsps algae have shown an ability to accumulate p as polyphosphate granules within their cells far in excess of that needed for cellular growth this phenomena known as luxury uptake sees the algal p content increase from 1 up to 3 8 gp gss powell et al 2011 although luxury uptake in wsp algae has been observed its occurrence is sporadic and the conditions to trigger the phenomena are not fully understood previous research has given some insights into the trigger variables for luxury uptake in a wsp environment as expected based on p uptake kinetics yao et al 2011 increasing the p concentration had a positive effect on luxury uptake powell et al 2009 schmidt et al 2016 nitrogen concentration had no effect on luxury uptake powell et al 2006 suggesting that nitrogen is not limiting under the typical wsp conditions tested by powell et al 2006 increasing temperatures above 15 c had a positive effect on luxury uptake powell et al 2009 while varying temperature at or below 15 c had no effect schmidt et al 2016 increasing the light intensity had a positive effect on luxury uptake powell et al 2009 schmidt et al 2016 however light intensity also increases growth rate which as observed by powell et al 2009 can cause a subsequent consumption of internal p stores and therefore a reduction in luxury uptake however the literature is still very limited with regard to the potential triggers to provide a more comprehensive understanding the effect on luxury uptake of commonly manipulated process variables mixing intensity inoculum biomass concentration organic loading and ph and variables identified from literature as potentially influencing luxury uptake p content of the inoculum biomass and concentration of calcium magnesium and potassium cations needs to be understood the research in this paper aims to improve our understanding of luxury uptake in algae by identifying for the first time the effect of these new variables on the cellular p content of algal biomass under wsp conditions while the effects of these variables on algal growth and or p removal have generally been identified table 1 their link to the cellular p content of the biomass remains unknown understanding the effect of these potential luxury uptake triggers will aid in underpinning the development of a new algal based p removal process 2 methodology a two litre inoculum reactor was started from a facultative wsp in ashhurst new zealand collection of the sample was within the algal band below the surface but no more than 30 cm deep near the outlet of the secondary pond at ashhurst the reactor was mixed using a magnetic stirrer in a constant temperature room at 25 c the light source consisted of two florescent lights philips daylight bulbs 36 w producing a light intensity of 100 μe m2 s irradiance sensor biospherical instruments qsl 2101 at the surface of the reactor every seven days one litre of culture was removed and replaced with one litre of fresh synthetic wastewater davis and wilcomb 1967 with the composition of the wastewater shown in table 2 and table 3 the synthetic wastewater contained chelating chemicals to prevent p precipitation and no organic carbon to limit heterotrophic bacterial growth in order to obtain a consistent inoculum culture for the experimental reactors the inoculum was maintained in the laboratory under the constant environmental conditions mentioned previously the consistency of the inoculum culture was checked through microscopic observation at the start and end of the experimental period the culture was dominated by the scenedesmus genus throughout the experimental period the experimental reactors used to test the variables were one litre in volume these reactors were given the same conditions as the inoculum reactor described above and started with 10 inoculum with the remaining 90 volume comprised of synthetic wastewater composition shown in tables 2 and 3 unless otherwise stated eight variables were tested in duplicate at three levels resulting in 48 individual reactors each of the 48 reactors were run for seven days and analysed daily for suspended solids using a 0 45 μ m membrane filter lee and shen 2007 and phosphate concentration using ion chromatography dionex ics 2000 powell et al 2008 the seven day experimental time was used as previous work by powell et al 2009 showed that for batch cultures the effect of changing variable levels on the cellular p content will be observed within seven days the variable levels can be seen in table 4 with further explanation given in the subsection below 2 1 variable selection 2 1 1 organic loading the organic load was manipulated by adding cod in the form of glucose to the reactors to achieve concentrations of 0 1070 and 2140 mg cod l glucose was used as the cod source to allow for rapid heterotrophic growth during the batch experiments an organic load of 0 mg cod l ensured the culture was dominated by autotrophs and represents the wastewater at the end of a wsp series in a tertiary maturation pond 1070 mg cod l is at the high range for standard domestic wastewater rani and dahiya 2008 and 2140 mg cod l represents a domestic wastewater with industrial inputs carrera et al 2004 2 1 2 concentration of calcium magnesium and potassium the concentration of calcium potassium and magnesium cations used in these experiments were based on concentrations suggested by davis and wilcomb 1967 calcium hydroxide magnesium sulphate and potassium sulphate were used to manipulate the cation concentrations as these compounds were already present in the synthetic wastewater in smaller quantities 2 1 3 p content of inoculum biomass the p content of the inoculum cultures was manipulated by changing the wastewater p concentration of the inoculum as suggested by powell et al 2009 to manipulate the p content of the biomass three separate portions of the original inoculum reactor were fed with the following p concentrations 0 mg p l 5 mg p l and 15 mg p l these cultures were maintained for one week before being used as the inoculum for these experiments equation 1 was used to determine the p content of the inoculum reactors 1 p g p g s s t p g p l d p g p l s s g s s l where p is the p content in the biomass gp gss tp is the total p g p l dp is the dissolved phosphate in the solution g p l and ss is the biomass suspended solids g ss l tp was determined using sulphuric acid nitric acid digestion with ascorbic acid colourimetry eaton et al 1995 2 1 4 inoculum biomass concentration the biomass concentration in wsps is dependent on a multitude of factors such as light intensity ph and biomass recycle from literature the biomass concentrations was found to vary from as low as 25 mg ss l up to 350 mg ss l with an average value of about 140 mg ss l arauzo et al 2000 furtado et al 2009 at local wsps in rongotea and halcombe new zealand the biomass concentration was found to vary from 25 to 250 mg ss l with an average of 100 mg ss l due to these experiments being batch operated biomass concentration in the low to average range were used to allow growth to occur in the reactors the inoculum biomass concentrations used in these experiments were controlled to 22 33 and 73 mgss l by varying the amount of inoculum culture added to ensure the same concentration of wastewater components for all reactors the inoculum was centrifuged 3000 rcf for 5 min and part of the filtrate removed to produce an inoculum volume of 100 ml 10 reactor volume for all inoculum biomass concentrations 2 1 5 wastewater ph ph control was achieved using addition of 5 co2 in air with a thermo scientific alpha 190 series ph controller 5 co2 in air represents typical co2 concentrations in combustion flue gas arbib et al 2013 due to the direct effect of co2 on photosynthesis controlled addition of 10 hydrochloric acid hcl was tested as an alternative ph control method although the volume of hcl used was less than 5 of the reactor volume corrections to the measurements were applied to account for dilution 2 1 6 mixing intensity the mixing intensity in a wsp is difficult to measure and represent at laboratory scale therefore estimates based on the typical flow patterns were used circulating flow just suspends the algae in the wastewater where surface aerators supply rapid localised mixing at laboratory scale using a 1 l conical flask with a magnetic stir bar length 38 1 mm diameter 9 5 mm 0 rpm resulted in unmixed 100 rpm just suspend the biomass and 500 rpm resulted in rapid mixing the unmixed reactor was only mixed immediately prior to taking a sample to ensure the sample was representative of the entire reactor contents 2 2 data analysis equation 2 was used to identify the influence of variables on the cellular p content of the biomass 2 c e l l u l a r p c o n t e n t g p g s s d p t 0 d p t s s t s s t 0 where cellular p content is the amount of p removed per amount of biomass produced gp gss dp is the dissolved phosphate concentration in the solution mg p l ss is the biomass dry weight mg ss l and t is the time days equation 2 allows differences in the cellular p content of the biomass to be identified for the levels of a variable an average cellular p content of the biomass from day 1 to day 7 inclusive was used to account for time in the analysis day 0 was not included as this represents the inoculum conditions rather than the experimental conditions a control reactor was used to estimate the experimental error in the cellular p content of the biomass the control reactor was 1 l in volume started with 10 inoculum and given the same conditions as the inoculum reactor the control reactor was replicated nine times to produce a 90 confidence level of 0 21 this 90 confidence level is shown on all cellular p content figures figs 1 6 as the error bars a variable is considered a trigger variable 90 confidence if the error bars of the different levels do not overlap 3 results and discussion the effect on cellular p content of the eight variables studied in this research have been summarised in table 5 and discussed in more detail in the following sections the growth and p removal data used to produce the cellular p content graphs have been summarised in table 5 and discussed in more detail in the supplementary material 3 1 organic loading it was hypothesised that increasing the organic loading would cause a reduction in cellular p content through increased heterotrophic growth as shown in fig 1 this hypothesis was confirmed 90 confidence and increasing the organic loading resulted in about 200 mg ss l of extra growth fig s1a a secondary effect may also be due to changes in the light intensity although the light intensity at the surface of the reactor was kept constant the light attenuation in the reactors would change due to the relationship between light attenuation and biomass concentration cornet et al 1994 1995 pottier et al 2005 pruvost et al 2009 as shown in fig s1a increasing the organic load was observed to increase the biomass concentration which would consequently reduce the light received by individual cells this reduced light was previously linked to a reduction in cellular p content by powell et al 2009 this result shows for the first time increasing the organic load reduces cellular p content in wsp biomass 3 2 concentration of calcium magnesium and potassium cations fig 2 shows for the first time that changing the concentration of calcium magnesium or potassium within the typical wsp levels tested had no statistically significant effect on cellular p content 90 confidence this result was unexpected as these cations are key components required for the stabilization of polyphosphate granules formed during luxury uptake diaz et al 2009 schonborn et al 2001 for example under freshwater conditions for both chlamydomonas sp and chlorella sp calcium was present within polyphosphate granules at a p ca molar ratio of 8 31 2 00 90 confidence diaz et al 2009 the fact that there was no effect indicates that the concentration of the cations used in these experiments was above the limiting concentration required for polyphosphate granule formation analysing calcium in particular the p ca molar ratios used in this experiment were based on typical secondary wastewater characteristics davis and wilcomb 1967 resulting in p ca molar ratios of 0 15 0 30 in the wastewater while this is not the p ca ratio in the polyphosphate granules based on the results from this experiment the typical calcium concentrations in wastewater should not limit polyphosphate granule formation since the concentrations of magnesium and potassium also had no significant effect it is likely that the typical wsp concentrations of cations tested are sufficient for polyphosphate granule formation 3 3 p content of the inoculum biomass the results from fig 3 show that for the first time the p content of the inoculum biomass has no statistical effect 90 confidence on cellular p content in wsp biomass this was unexpected as previous experiments on natural water systems found p starved chlorella had increased polyphosphate storage compared to p replete chlorella after being exposed to a p spike eixler et al 2006 the discrepancies between these results might be due to the degree of p starvation the research presented in this paper used a range of biomass p contents from 0 2 to 2 6 gp gss while the lowest level tested was below 1 gp gss suggesting p starvation goldman 1980 kaplan et al 1986 the duration of the starvation period may have been insufficient to allow for a significant increase in cellular p content to be observed aitchison and butt 1973 observed that longer starvation periods in chlorella allow for increased cellular p content after a p spike furthermore chlorella exposed to a p spike without a starvation period showed either no significant increase aitchison and butt 1973 or a significantly reduced increase in polyphosphate eixler et al 2006 compared to p starved cells p starvation in wsps is unlikely to occur due to the typically low p removal of 15 50 garcia et al 2000 ghazy et al 2008 mburu et al 2013 therefore irrespective of any p starvation effect the results from this research suggest that the p content of the inoculum biomass will not significantly 90 confidence influence the future cellular p content in wsp algae 3 4 inoculum biomass concentration it was hypothesised that increasing the biomass concentration would increase cellular competition for p resulting in less p available for individual cells and a reduction in cellular p content however as shown in fig 4 varying the inoculum biomass concentration had no statistical effect on cellular p content 90 confidence this result was unexpected especially when considering the final biomass concentration in the 73 mg ss l reactor reached 340 mg ss l which is in the high range of suspended solids for wsps arauzo et al 2000 furtado et al 2009 for the first time this suggests that typical wsp biomass concentrations as tested in this paper will have no effect 90 confidence on the cellular p content this finding has a large impact on the p removal in a wsp system as mentioned previously increasing the inoculum biomass concentration had no effect on the cellular p content of the biomass gp gss therefore if the biomass concentration gss is increased i e through biomass recycle then p removal gp must also increase due to the same cellular p content gp gss 3 5 wastewater ph the results from fig 5 show for the first time ph control has a negative effect on the cellular p content in wsp biomass for co2 addition fig 5a the effect was significant between the uncontrolled and controlled ph 7 8 and ph 8 9 conditions whereas for hcl addition fig 5b the effect was only significant between the uncontrolled and ph 7 8 controlled conditions 90 confidence this negative effect is likely due to an increased biomass yield when controlling the ph figs s5a and c algal photosynthesis consumes aqueous co2 from the wastewater if the wastewater is co2 limited the carbonate equilibrium shifts to replace co2 through consumption of carbonate and h ions causing an increase in ph this was observed in these experiments with the ph increasing to above 10 in the uncontrolled reactors suggesting co2 limitation was occurring using ph control reduced co2 limitation in these experiments either directly through co2 dissolution or indirectly through interactions between hcl and the carbonate equilibrium this allowed for an increased biomass yield of 38 for co2 addition and 22 for hcl addition figs s5a and c similar increases in biomass yields of around 30 have previously been reported for wastewater algae when the ph was controlled to 7 8 with co2 addition park and craggs 2010 zhou et al 2012 changes in ph can also influence p uptake kinetics through changes in membrane permeability and ionic form of phosphate cembella et al 1982 however no effect on p removal from the wastewater was observed at the levels tested in this experiment s1 5 3 6 mixing intensity as seen in fig 6 for the first time it was shown that introducing mixing has a significant negative effect on the cellular p content however further increasing the mixing beyond a just suspended state has no statistical effect on the cellular p content 90 confidence this negative effect on the cellular p content is due to an increased biomass concentration fig s6a when increasing mixing intensity while p removal was also improved with mixing fig s6b the amount of extra growth exceeded the increased p removal resulting in the negative effect on cellular p content of the wsp biomass this effect of mixing increasing the biomass concentration has previously been observed in literature kim et al 2014 sutherland et al 2014 and is suggested to be due to improved distribution and therefore more efficient utilisation of the light across the cells in the culture hadiyanto et al 2013 sutherland et al 2014 mixing can also improve p uptake kinetics through reductions in nutrient gradients and boundary layers hadiyanto et al 2013 sutherland et al 2014 improved p removal has previously been observed for scenedesmus obliquus martinez et al 2000 chlorella vulgaris kim et al 2014 and mixed high rate algal pond cultures sutherland et al 2014 this result shows for the first time introducing mixing reduces the cellular p content in wsp biomass 4 potential implications for design and operation of an algal luxury uptake pond it should be noted that these implications for design and operation are currently based on the best available information that is centred on small scale batch laboratory experiments further research is required into the complex interrelations between these variables as well as upscaling experiments to continuous laboratory and pilot scale to prove concepts proposed here before being implemented at full scale the research presented in this paper significantly advances our understanding of luxury uptake in wsp systems by identifying key trigger variables for increasing the cellular p content of wsp biomass using the results presented in this paper and from literature potential implications for design and operation of an algal luxury uptake pond have been proposed from literature powell et al 2009 previously described a luxury uptake pond based on the effects of p concentration temperature and light intensity on algal luxury uptake according to powell et al 2009 the luxury uptake pond requires 1 a small size luxury uptake pond at the start of the wsp system to reduce dispersion and dilution of influent p into the larger main wsp pond 2 high algal biomass which could be achieved through recycling of algal biomass from the main wsp 3 vertical mixing to optimise the light exposure for individual algae and 4 harvesting of the high p content algal biomass immediately following the luxury uptake pond the research presented in this paper builds on this previous understanding by accounting for the effects of organic load ph and mixing intensity the results in this paper show that a low organic load is required to increase the cellular p content low organic load is typically present at the end of a wsp system suggesting the luxury uptake pond be placed at the end of the wsp system however the luxury uptake pond also needs a high p concentration powell et al 2009 schmidt et al 2016 suggesting the luxury uptake pond should be at the start of the wsp series to meet both requirements an anaerobic pond at the start of the wsp system can be used prior to the luxury uptake pond anaerobic ponds typically have high organic load removal with low p removal allowing for both the low organic load and high p concentration requirements to be met although ph control is not typically used in traditional wsp systems high rate algal ponds are known to use ph control to increase biomass concentrations park and craggs 2010 zhou et al 2012 while ph control could be used in the main pond system it should be avoided in the luxury uptake pond mixing should be minimised to increase the cellular p content in the algae conversely while powell et al 2009 did not study the effects of mixing they proposed to introduce vertical mixing in the luxury uptake pond to increase light exposure for individual algae while these interactions are complex and require further research an initial pragmatic compromise is to use low intensity vertical mixing if stratification is occurring 5 conclusions the research presented in this paper provides an advance in our understanding of luxury uptake in wsp systems by identifying key trigger variables for increasing the cellular p content of wsp biomass of the eight potentially influential variables studied in this research only three variables were found to significantly 90 confidence effect the cellular p content in algae while through literature increasing p concentration light intensity or temperature were identified to increase the cellular p content the results from this work show that for the first time the cellular p content in wsp biomass is also increased 90 confidence by reduced organic loading reduced mixing intensity or increased ph these findings provide a foundation for development of a new algal based wastewater

19762,waste stabilization ponds wsp are one of the most common forms of wastewater treatment for smaller communities globally but have poor phosphorus removal it is known that wsp algae can accumulate polyphosphate within their cells in excess of that needed for cell function if polyphosphate accumulation could be triggered at the higher range of wsp cell concentrations phosphorus removal from domestic wastewater could be significantly improved however this phenomenon is sporadic and still not fully understood with a view of building a fundamental understanding to underpin the engineering of a new phosphorus removal process this paper examines eight previously untested variables that may influence the cellular phosphorus content of wsp biomass although calcium magnesium and potassium are key constituents of polyphosphate granules the concentrations tested were not limiting to polyphosphate accumulation while literature also pointed to inoculum characteristics as potentially having an impact no significance was found in this research conversely three important new triggers where identified that significantly 90 confidence affected the cellular phosphorus content of wsp biomass an increase in cellular phosphorus content was triggered by decreasing the organic load or allowing the ph to increase as compared to ph control by contrast the presence of mixing decreased the phosphorus content of the wsp biomass graphical abstract image 1 keywords luxury uptake microalgae nutrient removal phosphorus polyphosphate waste stabilization pond 1 introduction waste stabilization ponds wsp are used by thousands of small communities around the world due to their low cost and simplistic operation although wsps can be effective at removing organic pollutants and pathogens phosphorus p removal is typically low with removal rates of between 15 and 50 garcia et al 2000 ghazy et al 2008 mburu et al 2013 with regulators becoming stricter on p discharge wsp operators globally are being faced with costly upgrades to improve p removal currently two main upgrade options are available to improve p removal in wsps addition of chemical dosing or a shift to enhanced biological p removal ebpr chemical dosing with coagulants such as aluminium sulphate alum or ferric salts is the most common upgrade option due to its consistently high p removal however the increased operating costs associated with the coagulants and disposal of the resulting chemical sludge is a drawback for smaller communities instead of using chemicals for p removal it is possible to utilise microorganisms ebpr uses microorganisms to accumulate p as polyphosphate and thereby reduce the p concentration in the effluent however ebpr is a complex system that requires aeration and careful control to achieve p removal when we reflect on why small communities selected wsps to start with i e low operating costs and simple operation the combined operating and capital costs of an ebpr system makes this option often seen as an inappropriate replacement for wsps this leaves a problem for these smaller communities relying on wsps instead of focusing on alternatives to wsps

content will be observed within seven days the variable levels can be seen in table 4 with further explanation given in the subsection below 2 1 variable selection 2 1 1 organic loading the organic

concentration of calcium magnesium and potassium the concentration of calcium potassium and magnesium cations used in these experiments were based on concentrations suggested by davis and wilcomb 1967

the p content of the biomass three separate portions of the original inoculum reactor were fed with the following p concentrations 0 mg p l 5 mg p l and 15 mg p l these cultures were maintained for

and biomass recycle from literature the biomass concentrations was found to vary from as low as 25 mg ss l up to 350 mg ss l with an average value of about 140 mg ss l arauzo et al 2000 furtado et al 2009 at local wsps in rongotea and halcombe new zealand the biomass concentration was found to vary from 25 to 250 mg ss l with an average of 100 mg ss l due to these experiments being batch operated biomass concentration in the low to average range were used to allow growth to occur in the reactors the inoculum biomass concentrations used in these experiments were controlled to 22 33 and 73 mgss l by varying the amount of inoculum culture added to ensure the same concentration of wastewater components for all reactors the inoculum was centrifuged 3000 rcf for 5 min and part of the filtrate removed to produce an inoculum volume of 100 ml 10 reactor volume for all inoculum biomass concentrations 2 1 5 wastewater ph ph control was achieved using addition of 5 co2 in air with a thermo scientific alpha 190 series ph controller 5 co2 in air represents typical co2 concentrations in combustion flue gas arbib et al 2013 due to the direct effect of co2 on photosynthesis controlled addition of 10 hydrochloric acid hcl was tested as an alternative ph control method although the volume of hcl used was less than 5 of the reactor volume corrections to the measurements were applied

eight variables studied in this research have been summarised in table 5 and discussed in more detail in the following sections the growth and p removal data used to produce the cellular p content

cellular p content through increased heterotrophic growth as shown in fig 1 this hypothesis was confirmed 90 confidence and increasing the organic loading resulted in about 200 mg ss l of extra growth fig s1a a secondary effect may also be due to changes in the light intensity although the light intensity at the surface of the reactor was kept constant the light attenuation in the reactors would change due to the relationship between light attenuation and biomass concentration cornet et al 1994 1995 pottier et al 2005 pruvost et al 2009 as shown in fig s1a increasing the organic load was observed to increase the biomass concentration which would consequently reduce the light received by individual cells this reduced light was previously linked to a reduction in cellular p content by powell et al 2009 this result shows for the first time increasing the organic load reduces cellular p content in wsp biomass 3 2 concentration of calcium magnesium and potassium cations fig 2 shows for the first time that changing the concentration of calcium magnesium or potassium within the typical wsp levels tested had no statistically significant effect on cellular p content 90 confidence this result was unexpected as these cations are key components required for the stabilization of polyphosphate granules formed during luxury uptake diaz et al 2009 schonborn et al 2001 for example under freshwater conditions for both chlamydomonas sp and chlorella sp calcium was present within polyphosphate granules at a p ca molar ratio of 8 31 2 00 90 confidence diaz et al 2009 the fact that there was no effect indicates that the concentration of the cations used in these experiments was above the limiting concentration required for polyphosphate granule formation analysing calcium in particular the p ca molar ratios used in this experiment were based on typical secondary wastewater characteristics davis and wilcomb 1967 resulting in p ca molar ratios of 0 15 0 30 in the wastewater while this is not the p ca ratio in the polyphosphate granules based on the results from this experiment the typical calcium concentrations in wastewater should not limit polyphosphate granule formation since the concentrations of magnesium and potassium also had no significant effect it is likely that the typical wsp concentrations of cations tested are sufficient for polyphosphate granule formation 3 3 p content of the inoculum biomass the results from fig 3 show that for the first time the p content of the inoculum biomass has no statistical effect 90 confidence on cellular p content in wsp biomass this was unexpected as previous experiments on natural water systems found p starved chlorella had increased polyphosphate storage compared to p replete chlorella after being exposed to a p spike eixler et al 2006 the discrepancies between these results might be due to the degree of p starvation the research presented in this paper used a range of biomass p contents from 0 2 to 2 6 gp gss while the lowest level tested was below 1 gp gss suggesting p starvation goldman 1980 kaplan et al 1986 the duration of the starvation period may have been insufficient to allow for a significant increase in cellular p content to be observed aitchison and butt 1973 observed that longer starvation periods in chlorella allow for increased cellular p content after a p spike furthermore chlorella exposed to a p spike without a starvation period showed either no significant increase aitchison and butt 1973 or a significantly reduced increase in polyphosphate eixler et al 2006 compared to p starved cells p starvation in wsps is unlikely to occur due to the typically low p removal of 15 50 garcia et al 2000 ghazy et al 2008 mburu et al 2013 therefore irrespective of any p starvation effect the results from this research suggest that the p content of the inoculum biomass will not significantly 90 confidence influence the future cellular p content in wsp algae 3 4 inoculum biomass concentration it was hypothesised that increasing the biomass concentration would increase cellular competition for p resulting in less p available for individual cells and a reduction in cellular p content however as shown in fig 4 varying the inoculum biomass concentration had no statistical effect on cellular p content 90 confidence this result was unexpected especially when considering the final biomass concentration in the 73 mg ss l reactor reached 340 mg ss l which is in the high range of suspended solids for wsps arauzo et al 2000 furtado et al 2009 for the first time this suggests that typical wsp biomass concentrations as tested in this paper will have no effect 90 confidence on the cellular p content this finding has a large impact on the p removal in a wsp system as mentioned previously increasing the inoculum biomass concentration had no effect on the cellular p content of the biomass gp gss therefore if the biomass concentration gss is increased i e through biomass recycle then p removal gp must also increase due to the same cellular p content gp gss 3 5 wastewater ph the results from fig 5 show for the first time ph control has a negative effect on the cellular p content in wsp biomass for co2 addition fig 5a the effect was significant between the uncontrolled and controlled ph 7 8 and ph 8 9 conditions whereas for hcl addition fig 5b the effect was only significant between the uncontrolled and ph 7 8 controlled conditions 90 confidence this negative effect is likely due to an increased biomass yield when controlling the ph figs s5a and c algal photosynthesis consumes aqueous co2 from the wastewater if the wastewater is co2 limited the carbonate equilibrium shifts to replace co2 through consumption of carbonate and h ions causing an increase in ph this was observed in these experiments with the ph increasing to above 10 in the uncontrolled reactors suggesting co2 limitation was occurring using ph control reduced co2 limitation in these experiments either directly through co2 dissolution or indirectly through interactions between hcl and the carbonate equilibrium this allowed for an increased biomass yield of 38 for co2 addition and 22 for hcl addition figs s5a and c similar increases in biomass yields of around 30 have previously been reported for wastewater algae when the ph was controlled to 7 8 with co2 addition park and craggs 2010 zhou et al 2012 changes in ph can also influence p uptake kinetics through changes in membrane permeability and ionic form of phosphate cembella et al 1982 however no effect on p removal from the wastewater was observed at the levels tested in this experiment s1 5 3 6 mixing intensity as seen in fig 6 for the first time it was shown that introducing mixing has a significant negative effect on the cellular p content however further increasing the mixing beyond a just suspended state has no statistical effect on the cellular p content 90 confidence this negative effect on the cellular p content is due to an increased biomass concentration fig s6a when increasing mixing intensity while p removal was also improved with mixing fig s6b the amount of extra growth exceeded the increased p removal resulting in the negative effect on cellular p content of the wsp biomass this effect of mixing increasing the biomass concentration has previously been observed in literature kim et al 2014 sutherland et al 2014 and is suggested to be due to improved distribution and therefore more efficient utilisation of the light across the cells in the culture hadiyanto et al 2013 sutherland et al 2014 mixing can also improve p uptake kinetics through reductions in nutrient gradients and boundary layers hadiyanto et al 2013 sutherland et al 2014 improved p removal has previously been observed for scenedesmus obliquus martinez et al 2000 chlorella vulgaris kim et al 2014 and mixed high rate algal pond cultures sutherland et al 2014 this result shows for the first time introducing mixing reduces the cellular p content in wsp biomass 4 potential implications for design and operation of an algal luxury uptake pond it should be noted that these implications for design and operation are currently based on the best available information that is centred on small scale batch laboratory experiments further research is required into the complex interrelations between these variables as well as upscaling experiments to continuous laboratory and pilot scale to prove concepts proposed here before being implemented at full scale the research presented in this paper significantly advances our understanding of luxury uptake in wsp systems by identifying key trigger variables for increasing the cellular p content of wsp biomass using the results presented in this paper and from literature potential implications for design and operation of an algal luxury uptake pond have been proposed from literature powell et al 2009 previously described a luxury uptake pond based on the effects of p concentration temperature and light intensity on algal luxury uptake according to powell et al 2009 the luxury uptake pond requires 1 a small size luxury uptake pond at the start of the wsp system to reduce dispersion and dilution of influent p into the larger main wsp pond 2 high algal biomass which could be achieved through recycling of algal biomass from the main wsp 3 vertical mixing to optimise the light exposure for individual algae and 4 harvesting of the high p content algal biomass immediately following the luxury uptake pond the research presented in this paper builds on this previous understanding by accounting for the effects of organic load ph and mixing intensity the results in this paper show that a low organic load is required to increase the cellular p content low organic load is typically present at the end of a wsp system suggesting the luxury uptake pond be placed at the end of the wsp system however the luxury uptake pond also needs a high p concentration powell et al 2009 schmidt et al 2016 suggesting the luxury uptake pond should be at the start of the wsp series to meet both requirements an anaerobic pond at the start of the wsp system can be used prior to the luxury uptake pond anaerobic ponds typically have high organic load removal with low p removal allowing for both the low organic load and high p concentration requirements to be met although ph control is not typically used in traditional wsp systems high rate algal ponds are known to use ph control to increase biomass concentrations park and craggs 2010 zhou et al 2012 while ph control could be used in the main pond system it should be avoided in the luxury uptake pond mixing should be minimised to increase the cellular p content in the algae conversely while powell et al 2009 did not study the effects of mixing they proposed to introduce vertical mixing in the luxury uptake pond to increase light exposure for individual algae while these interactions are complex and require further research an initial pragmatic compromise is to use low intensity vertical mixing if stratification is occurring 5 conclusions the research presented in this paper provides an advance in our understanding of luxury uptake in wsp systems by identifying key trigger variables for increasing the cellular p content of wsp biomass of the eight potentially influential variables studied in this research only three variables were found to significantly 90 confidence effect the cellular p content in algae while through literature increasing p concentration light intensity or temperature were identified to increase the cellular p content the results from this work show that for the first time the cellular p content in wsp biomass is also increased 90 confidence by reduced organic loading reduced mixing intensity or increased ph these findings provide a foundation for development of a new algal based wastewater

19763,the cyanotoxins released into waters during cyanobacterial blooms can pose serious hazards to humans and animals apart from their toxicological mechanisms cyanotoxins have been shown to be involved in estrogenic activity by in vivo and in vitro assays however there is limited information on the change in estrogenicity of cyanotoxins following chemical oxidation in this study the estrogenic activity of cylindrospermopsin cyl and anatoxin a ana at concentrations ranging from 2 4 10 7 m to 2 4 10 12 m cyl and 7 1 10 6 m to 7 1 10 11 m ana and after treatment by the feiii b h2o2 catalyst system was investigated by the yeast estrogen screen yes assay the results indicate that cyl and ana acted as agonists in the yes assay cyl logec50 8 901 ana logec50 6 789 their binding affinity to estrogen receptors is associated with their intrinsic properties including ring structures and toxicant properties cyl and ana were shown to simulate endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs to modulate the 17β estradiol induced estrogenic activity resulting in non monotonic dose responses the treated cyl showed a significantly altered estrogenicity compared to the untreated cyl t 2 8 168 p 05 while the estrogenicity of the treated ana was not significantly different to the untreated ana t 2 1 295 p 05 intermediate products generated from cyl and ana oxidized by feiii b h2o2 were identified using q exactive tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms treatment with feiii b h2o2 yielded open ring by products which likely resulted in cyl s reduced binding affinity to estrogen receptors the insignificant change in the estrogenicity of treated ana was possibly a result of its multiple ring structure products which were likely able to bind to estrogen receptors the comparisons for the estrogenicity of these cyanotoxins before and after feiii b h2o2 treatment suggest that the reductions in estrogenicity achieved by oxidation were dependent on the levels of cyanotoxins removed as well as the estrogenicity of the degradation products this is the first study on the change in the estrogenicity of cyl and ana upon oxidation by feiii b h2o2 a high activity catalyst system graphical abstract image 1 keywords estrogenicity cyanotoxins endocrine disrupting chemical modulation feiii taml degradation products 1 introduction cyanotoxins in the form of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites carmichael 1992 have been the subject of many studies over recent decades due to their wide distribution pelaez et al 2010 and high toxicity duy et al 2000 they can be categorized into cyclic peptides including microcystins and nodularin and alkaloids including cylindrospermopsin cyl fig 1 a and anatoxin a ana fig 1b svrcek and smith 2004 the widespread cyl and ana duy et al 2000

nodularin r induced weak estrogenic potency in cultured mammalian cells oziol and bouaïcha 2010 and the endocrine disrupting effect of microcystin lr has also been reported by in vivo assay rogers et al 2011 however information on the estrogenic potency by cyl and ana is limited cyl and ana oxidative degradation have been conducted by chlorine ozone and other oxidizing agents resulting in varying degrees of efficiencies and shortcomings rodríguez et al 2007a 2007b in our study on the oxidative degradation of cyl and ana we attempted the catalytic oxidative degradation of cyl and ana using a high activity catalyst system the iron iii tetra amido macrocyclic ligand feiii taml designated as feiii b h2o2 catalyst system cyl and ana degradation were achieved by feiii b h2o2 however the effect of oxidation by feiii b h2o2 on the estrogenicity of the cyanotoxins was unclear in this study the yeast estrogen screen yes assay one of the most robust and widely used in vitro assays balsiger et al 2010 leusch et al 2010 was applied to measure the estrogenic potency of cyanotoxin samples yeast cell based assay has been used previously to detect the estrogenicity of samples from wastewater sewage and surface water murk et al 2002 aerni et al 2004 rutishauser et al 2004 however some issues have been raised about the yes assay beresford et al 2000 especially in relation to the toxicity of samples to yeast cells citulski and farahbakhsh 2012 the latter study investigated the toxicity of cyl and ana to yeast cells by assessing yeast cell viability while also establishing reliable estrogenic dose response curves our aim in this study was to investigate the potential estrogenic activity of cyl and ana using the yes assay explore the modulating effect of cyanotoxin on e2 induced estrogenic activity and assess the feiii b h2o2 catalyst system in remediating cyanotoxin induced estrogenicity 2 methodology 2 1 reagents and materials cylindrospermopsin from sapphire bioscience nz

receptor gene and expression plasmids carrying an estrogen responsive element controlling the expression of the reporter gene lac z encoding the enzyme β galactosidase routledge and sumpter 1996 the intensity of the colorimetric response induced by β galactosidase quantifies the amount of β galactosidase and so the level of estrogenic activity campbell et al 2006 the yes assay protocol used was

with logec50 means and corresponding standard deviations the significant difference between two samples was compared using t test in graphpad prism version 5 0 with logec50 means and corresponding standard error of the mean 3 results and discussion 3 1 cytotoxicity of cyanotoxins to yeast cells the viability of yeast exposed to cyanotoxin was detected using flow cytometry fig 2 to determine the toxicity effect on the yeast cells the viability of yeast cells incubated with cyl at concentrations ranging from 1 8 10 9 m to 3 6 10 6 m was not significantly different from yeast cells in the blank fig 2a f 5 12 0 219 p 05 implying cyl is not significantly toxic to the yeast cells there was no significant difference in the viability of yeast cells incubated with ana at 9 1 10 5 m and ana at 4 5 10 6 m or less compared to the blank while yeast cells cultured with ana at 4 5 10 5 m showed a reduced population fig 2b f 5 12 9 332 p 05 the significant impact of zncl2 at 7 0 10 2 m on cell viability fig 2c can be associated with cytolysis due to the highly concentrated zinc salt hosiner et al 2014 f 4 10 1 805 102 p 001 the viability of cell exposing to decreased zinc salt concentration showed similar values to the blank suggesting that zinc at 7 0 10 3 m or less had no toxicity to yeast cells over 24 h despite the very slight difference induced by ana on yeast cells at 4 5 10 5 m both ana at 4 5 10 5 m and zncl2 at 7 0 10 2 m were excluded in the yes assay to minimize the potential effect of these candidates at higher concentrations 3 2 estrogenic activity of cyanotoxins fig 3 a shows that the β galactosidase responses of cyanotoxins followed the same profile as for the e2 standard but with differing slopes f 12 40 2 351 1012 p 0001 fig 3b indicates that the logec50 induced by cyl was not significantly different to the logec50 induced by e2 while the logec50 values for ana and zncl2 were significantly different from the logec50 induced by e2 f 3 5 74 830 p 001 as shown previously denier et al 2009 the results for e2 and zncl2 indicate that the yes assay is reliable for assessing the estrogenicity of both endogenous hormone and endocrine disrupting chemicals the signals identified from cyl and ana suggest that both cyanotoxins can effectively bind to the estrogen receptors to form the complex that initiates the production of β galactosidase we associated the binding affinity of cyanotoxins to estrogen receptors and the actions of cyanotoxins as agonists with the intrinsic properties identified for cyl and ana toxicants can interact with receptors and lead to agonist or antagonist mechanisms mailman 2008 which is analogous to the way endocrine disrupters function in endocrine systems crisp et al 1998 mueller 2004 cyl as a potent protein synthesis inhibitor in vitro froscio et al 2003 is also suggested as a potential endocrine disruptor due to its binding affinity to progesterone receptors young et al 2008 cyl s potential as an endocrine disruptor is also implied by its typical target organs hawkins et al 1985 organs commonly affected by known endocrine disrupting chemicals mueller 2004 ana can irreversibly bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors osswald et al 2007 although the agonist effect of ana on estrogen receptors has not been elucidated in the literature the affinity of ana for estrogen receptors has been suggested based on its known binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors campos et al 2006 accordingly ana may function as a neuroendocrine disruptor through its action with both nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and estrogen receptors kavlock et al 1996 crisp et al 1998 when characterising their action as agonists in the yes assay the ring structures of both cyanotoxins are key factors in their affinity to estrogen receptors their ring component can favour estrogen receptor binding by increasing the rigidity of the structure as well as the steric centre blair et al 2000 fang et al 2001 safe et al 2001 due to the high correlation between relative binding affinities and structural features blair et al 2000 nishihara et al 2000 the lower logec50 value induced by cyl compared to ana can be explained by cyl s multiple rings cyl fig 1a has a tricyclic guanidine moiety and hydroxymethyl uracil ohtani et al 1992 while ana fig 1b on the other hand is a bicyclic secondary amine carmichael 1992 3 3 modulation of e2 activity by cyanotoxins to investigate the effect of cyl and ana on the estrogenic activity of natural estrogen e2 induced estrogenicity was measured when exposed to cyanotoxin the competition assay demonstrated that the co exposure of e2 to different concentrations of cyl resulted in variations in the β galactosidase slope shift fig 4 a f 16 50 2 309 1012 p 0001 fig 4a and b shows that cyl had a dose dependent effect in the potency of e2 induced β galactosidase in the yes assay contrary to the profile for the e2 control fig 4a adding cyl at high concentrations e g 2 4 10 5 m to e2 resulted in a left slope shift while cyl at low concentrations e g 2 4 10 8 m resulted in a right slope shift the shift in slopes can also be seen in fig 4b which shows a significant difference between the half maximum effective concentration logec50 of e2 e2 logec50 and the half maximum effective concentration of e2 exposed to cyl e2 cyl logec50 f 4 10 8 031 1012 p 0001 these results show cyl can act either as an agonist or an antagonist depending on its concentration in the case of ana the competition assay fig 5 a showed that adding different concentrations of ana to e2 e2 ana resulted in differences in the β galactosidase induced estrogenicity slope shift compared to the e2 positive control f 16 50 2 971 1011 p 0001 the right slope shift resulted from the reduced potency of the β galactosidase induced estrogenicity following the co exposure of e2 to ana accordingly ana can be categorized as an e2 antagonist these differences can be seen more clearly in fig 5b f 4 10 5 411 1011 m p 0001 where the co exposure of e2 to different concentrations of ana resulted in a higher half maximum effective concentration e2 ana logec50 than the half maximum effective concentration logec50 seen for e2 e2 logec50 however ana did not behave as a classic antagonist in the yes assay because an inverse dose response effect was observed by the antagonist effect of ana on the e2 induced β galactosidase in the yes assay the competition assay for zncl2 added at different concentrations to e2 also resulted in differences in the β galactosidase induced estrogenicity slope shift fig 6 a f 16 50 7 055 1011 p 0001 the half maximum effective concentration logec50 for e2 e2 logec50 was significantly different from the half maximum effective concentration of e2 exposed to zncl2 e2 zncl2 logec50 fig 6b f 4 10 1 632 1012 p 0001 the observations for zncl2 are in agreement with results from the study by denier et al 2009 further validating the use of zncl2 as an external control for this experiment overall the dose response experiments demonstrated that cyl and ana induced non monotonic dose responses in the yes assay such non monotonic dose response behaviours are common to chemicals or pollutants known as estrogen active chemicals eacs that have the ability to interfere with or disrupt the function of endogenous hormones almstrup et al 2002 li et al 2007 vandenberg et al 2012 owen et al 2014 the causes of non monotonic dose responses are not completely understood some equation based computational models have proposed that the co presence of an endogenous ligand and an exogenous ligand such as eacs and the concentration of each ligand can result in mixed ligand dimers kohn and portier 1993 conolly and lutz 2004 li et al 2007 the relative abundance of endogenous ligand receptor homodimers exogenous ligand receptor homodimers and mixed ligand heterodimers will influence the ratio of corepressor cor and coactivator coa in the cell resulting in either agonist or antagonist effects conolly and lutz 2004 li et al 2007 these effects could explain the dose dependent response for cyl observed in this work the agonist response seen with high concentrations of cyl i e 2 4 10 5 m and 2 4 10 6 m is a result of cyl competing against e2 however when cyl concentrations are reduced to 2 4 10 7 m the chances of cyl binding to receptor will be reduced by e2 competition resulting in a cumulative reduction effect the dose response behaviours also show that cyl at low concentrations i e 2 4 10 8 m had an antagonist effect the antagonist effect may be associated with the affinity changes of the receptors when exposed to very low cyl concentrations in the presence of e2 future dose response studies will be directed towards determining the lowest concentration of cyl that reduces estrogen induced β galactosidase assay the non monotonic dose response behaviours by eacs can also be explained by the phosphorylation status of the receptor atanaskova et al 2002 rochette egly 2003 li et al 2007 as well as the auto inhibitory effect of a high dose of the ligand on receptor expression webb et al 1992 in both cases the presence of high concentration of cyanotoxins may lead to a regulation of the receptor further ana may affect protein kinases by acting as ion channels arias 2006 the modulation of protein kinase by ana combined with the auto inhibitory effect on receptor expression with high concentrations of ana may explain the inverse antagonist dose response seen for ana running this experiment for this paper future dose response studies will be directed towards determining the lowest concentration of ana showing an agonistic effect some earlier studies reported that estrogenicity of samples measured by the yes assay varied against the values predicted by the concentration addition model or estrogenicity calculated by chemical analysis beck et al 2006 thorpe et al 2006 there are a wide range of suggested causes of such deviations including chemicals disrupting the activation of estrogen response elements thorpe et al 2006 anti estrogenic compounds and or unknown compounds with estrogenicity beck et al 2006 estrogen receptor antagonists snyder et al 2001 weak estrogens rajapakse et al 2001 and non estrogenic toxicants frische et al 2009 the influence of cyanotoxins should also be considered when analysing the estrogenic activity of natural samples by yes assay according to new zealand ministry of health s 2016 guidelines the concentrations of cyl and ana in drinking water should not exceed 0 001 mg l 2 4 10 9 m and 0 006 mg l 3 6 10 8 m respectively epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between environmental exposure to edcs and human disease and disability vandenberg et al 2012 the findings of this work suggest the possibility of chronic consequences for humans of cyl and ana exposure at guideline values or below 3 4 estrogenicity of treated cyanotoxins by feiii b h2o2 to evaluate the effect of feiii b h2o2 on the estrogenicity of cyanotoxin the estrogenicity of oxidized cyl and ana was investigated by the yes assay fig 7 a shows the difference between slopes for cyl and cyl treated by feiii b h2o2 f 8 30 1 292 1013 p 0001 the difference is also evident when their logec50 values are compared in fig 7b f 2 3 52 180 p 01 fig 8 a shows the different slopes for the β galactosidase responses of untreated ana and then ana treated by feiii b h2o2 f 8 30 2 163 1013 p 0001 however the comparison logec50 values in fig 8b indicate no significant difference f 2 3 6 290 p 05 similarly the t test result for the estrogenicity of treated cyl was significantly different from untreated cyl t 2 8 168 p 05 while no significant difference was seen between the estrogenic activity of untreated ana and treated ana t 2 1 295 p 05 feiii b has been reported to produce non estrogenic activity ellis et al 2010 further the influence of the catalase on estrogenicity quantification can be excluded due to its rapid exhaustion by h2o2 by 1 min because of the negligible influence of feiii b h2o2 and its evident oxidation efficiency si fig s1 oxidized cyanotoxin was strongly associated with the measured estrogenicity indicating that oxidized cyanotoxin may act as agonist or antagonist and or induce synergistic or antagonistic modulation of the parent cyanotoxin for both mechanisms the influence of oxidized cyanotoxin on the estrogenicity detected was related to its relative binding affinity to estrogen receptors which can be highly dependent on constructional transformation by oxidation the intermediates of cyl and ana mediated by feiii b h2o2 were identified by q exactive tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms and a series of cyanotoxin degradation products was proposed cyl was generally transformed into products with destroyed tricyclic and uracil rings table 3 resulting in a decrease in its binding affinity to estrogen receptors furthermore it appears that the majority of cyl by products had destroyed rings hence showed little or no binding affinity to estrogen receptors overall a reduced estrogenic activity of cyl was achieved by feiii b h2o2 via catalytic oxidative degradation ana degradation was mainly via unsaturated carbon bond oxidation and loss of ammonia to produce a large number of ana products with rings table 4 although the estrogenicity induced by parent ana decreased ana breakdown products with ring structures likely produced estrogenicity by binding to estrogen receptors increasing the overall estrogenic level a previous study of estrogenicity induced by edc oxidation products reported that one ee2 oxidation product may have higher estrogenicity than ee2 itself chen et al 2012 the resulting reduced estrogenicity of the parent ana but induced estrogenicity of ana products likely explains the changed logec50 value observed while no significant corresponding difference in

19763,the cyanotoxins released into waters during cyanobacterial blooms can pose serious hazards to humans and animals apart from their toxicological mechanisms cyanotoxins have been shown to be involved in estrogenic activity by in vivo and in vitro assays however there is limited information on the change in estrogenicity of cyanotoxins following chemical oxidation in this study the estrogenic activity of cylindrospermopsin cyl and anatoxin a ana at concentrations ranging from 2 4 10 7 m to 2 4 10 12 m cyl and 7 1 10 6 m to 7 1 10 11 m ana and after treatment by the feiii b h2o2 catalyst system was investigated by the yeast estrogen screen yes assay the results indicate that cyl and ana acted as agonists in the yes assay cyl logec50 8 901 ana logec50 6 789 their binding affinity to estrogen receptors is associated with their intrinsic properties including ring structures and toxicant properties cyl and ana were shown to simulate endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs to modulate the 17β estradiol induced estrogenic activity resulting in non monotonic dose responses the treated cyl showed a significantly altered estrogenicity compared to the untreated cyl t 2 8 168 p 05 while the estrogenicity of the treated ana was not significantly different to the untreated ana t 2 1 295 p 05 intermediate products generated from cyl and ana oxidized by feiii b h2o2 were identified using q exactive tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms treatment with feiii b h2o2 yielded open ring by products which likely resulted in cyl s reduced binding affinity to estrogen receptors the insignificant change in the estrogenicity of treated ana was possibly a result of its multiple ring structure products which were likely able to bind to estrogen receptors the comparisons for the estrogenicity of these cyanotoxins before and after feiii b h2o2 treatment suggest that the reductions in estrogenicity achieved by oxidation were dependent on the levels of cyanotoxins removed as well as the estrogenicity of the degradation products this is the first study on the change in the estrogenicity of cyl and ana upon oxidation by feiii b h2o2 a high activity catalyst system graphical abstract image 1 keywords estrogenicity cyanotoxins endocrine disrupting chemical modulation feiii taml degradation products 1 introduction cyanotoxins in the form of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites carmichael 1992 have been the subject of many studies over recent decades due to their wide distribution pelaez et al 2010 and high toxicity duy et al 2000 they can be categorized into cyclic peptides including microcystins and nodularin and alkaloids including cylindrospermopsin cyl fig 1 a and anatoxin a ana fig 1b svrcek and smith 2004 the widespread cyl and ana duy et al 2000

extracts of cyanobacteria have been shown to be estrogenic by human breast carcinoma cell line mvln in vitro assay štěpánková et al 2011 sychrová et al 2012 jonas et al 2015 further microcystin lr and nodularin r induced weak estrogenic potency in cultured mammalian cells oziol and bouaïcha 2010 and the endocrine disrupting effect of microcystin lr has also been reported by in vivo assay rogers et al 2011 however information on the estrogenic potency by cyl and ana is limited cyl and ana oxidative degradation have been conducted by chlorine ozone and other oxidizing agents resulting in varying degrees of efficiencies and shortcomings rodríguez et al 2007a 2007b in our study on the oxidative degradation of cyl and ana we attempted the catalytic oxidative degradation of cyl and ana using a high activity catalyst system the iron iii tetra amido macrocyclic ligand feiii taml designated as feiii b h2o2 catalyst system cyl and ana degradation were achieved by feiii b h2o2 however the effect of oxidation by feiii b h2o2 on the estrogenicity of the cyanotoxins was unclear in this study the yeast estrogen screen yes assay one of the most robust and widely used in vitro assays balsiger et al 2010 leusch et al 2010 was applied to measure the estrogenic potency of cyanotoxin samples yeast cell based assay has been used previously to detect the estrogenicity of samples from wastewater sewage and surface water murk et al 2002 aerni et al 2004 rutishauser et al 2004 however some issues have been raised about the yes assay beresford et al 2000 especially in relation to the toxicity of samples to yeast cells citulski and farahbakhsh 2012 the latter study investigated the toxicity of cyl and ana to yeast cells by assessing yeast cell viability while also establishing reliable estrogenic dose response curves our aim in this study was to investigate the potential estrogenic activity of cyl and ana using the yes assay explore the modulating effect of cyanotoxin on e2 induced estrogenic activity and assess the feiii b h2o2 catalyst system in remediating cyanotoxin induced estrogenicity 2 methodology 2 1 reagents and materials cylindrospermopsin from sapphire bioscience nz

compounds and sc uw medium 2 2 yeast estrogen screen assay a genetically modified strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae dsy 219 was employed in the yes assay which is engineered with the human estrogen receptor gene and expression plasmids carrying an estrogen responsive element controlling the expression of the reporter gene lac z encoding the enzyme β galactosidase routledge and sumpter 1996 the intensity of the colorimetric response induced by β galactosidase quantifies the amount of β galactosidase and so the level of estrogenic activity campbell et al 2006 the yes assay protocol used was modified from balsiger et al 2010 in brief dsy219 was incubated overnight in sc uw media at 30 c the following day the yeast cells were diluted with sc uw media to an optical density at 600 nm 1 cm path length od600 of 0 08 and incubated at 30 c to an od600 of 0 1 the yeast cells were then harvested by centrifugation 4000 rpm 2 min and re suspended in 2 5 sc uw media to obtain the yeast inoculum for the yes assay every 750 μl sample for estrogenicity testing table 1 was exposed to the yeast cell solution 250 μl for 2 h after which 100 μl of the mixture was transferred to a 96 well micro plate

with logec50 means and corresponding standard deviations the significant difference between two samples was compared using t test in graphpad prism version 5 0 with logec50 means and corresponding standard error of the mean 3 results and discussion 3 1 cytotoxicity of cyanotoxins to yeast cells the viability of yeast exposed to cyanotoxin was detected using flow cytometry fig 2 to determine the toxicity effect on the yeast cells the viability of yeast cells incubated with cyl at concentrations ranging from 1 8 10 9 m to 3 6 10 6 m was not significantly different from yeast cells in the blank fig 2a f 5 12 0 219 p 05 implying cyl is not significantly toxic to the yeast cells there was no significant difference in the viability of yeast cells incubated with ana at 9 1 10 5 m and ana at 4 5 10 6 m or less compared to the blank while yeast cells cultured with ana at 4 5 10 5 m showed a reduced population fig 2b f 5 12 9 332 p 05 the significant impact of zncl2 at 7 0 10 2 m on cell viability fig 2c can be associated with cytolysis due to the highly concentrated zinc salt hosiner et al 2014 f 4 10 1 805 102 p 001 the viability of cell exposing to decreased zinc salt concentration showed similar values to the blank suggesting that zinc at 7 0 10 3 m or less had no toxicity to yeast cells over 24 h despite the very slight difference induced by ana on yeast cells at 4 5 10 5 m both ana at 4 5 10 5 m and zncl2 at 7 0 10 2 m were excluded in the yes assay to minimize the potential effect of these candidates at higher concentrations 3 2 estrogenic activity of cyanotoxins fig 3 a shows that the β galactosidase responses of cyanotoxins followed the same profile as for the e2 standard but with differing slopes f 12 40 2 351 1012 p 0001 fig 3b indicates that the logec50 induced by cyl was not significantly different to the logec50 induced by e2 while the logec50 values for ana and zncl2 were significantly different from the logec50 induced by e2 f 3 5 74 830 p 001 as shown previously denier et al 2009 the results for e2 and zncl2 indicate that the yes assay is reliable for assessing the estrogenicity of both endogenous hormone and endocrine disrupting chemicals the signals identified from cyl and ana suggest that both cyanotoxins can effectively bind to the estrogen receptors to form the complex that initiates the production of β galactosidase we associated the binding affinity of cyanotoxins to estrogen receptors and the actions of cyanotoxins as agonists with the intrinsic properties identified for cyl and ana toxicants can interact with receptors and lead to agonist or antagonist mechanisms mailman 2008 which is analogous to the way endocrine disrupters function in endocrine systems crisp et al 1998 mueller 2004 cyl as a potent protein synthesis inhibitor in vitro froscio et al 2003 is also suggested as a potential endocrine disruptor due to its binding affinity to progesterone receptors young et al 2008 cyl s potential as an endocrine disruptor is also implied by its typical target organs hawkins et al 1985 organs commonly affected by known endocrine disrupting chemicals mueller 2004 ana can irreversibly bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors osswald et al 2007 although the agonist effect of ana on estrogen receptors has not been elucidated in the literature the affinity of ana for estrogen receptors has been suggested based on its known binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors campos et al 2006 accordingly ana may function as a neuroendocrine disruptor through its action with both nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and estrogen receptors kavlock et al 1996 crisp et al 1998 when characterising their action as agonists in the yes assay the ring structures of both cyanotoxins are key factors in their affinity to estrogen receptors their ring component can favour estrogen receptor binding by increasing the rigidity of the structure as well as the steric centre blair et al 2000 fang et al 2001 safe et al 2001 due to the high correlation between relative binding affinities and structural features blair et al 2000 nishihara et al 2000 the lower logec50 value induced by cyl compared to ana can be explained by cyl s multiple rings cyl fig 1a has a tricyclic guanidine moiety and hydroxymethyl uracil ohtani et al 1992 while ana fig 1b on the other hand is a bicyclic secondary amine carmichael 1992 3 3 modulation of e2 activity by cyanotoxins to investigate the effect of cyl and ana on the estrogenic activity of natural estrogen e2 induced estrogenicity was measured when exposed to cyanotoxin the competition assay demonstrated that the co exposure of e2 to different concentrations of cyl resulted in variations in the β galactosidase slope shift fig 4 a f 16 50 2 309 1012 p 0001 fig 4a and b shows that cyl had a dose dependent effect in the potency of e2 induced β galactosidase in the yes assay contrary to the profile for the e2 control fig 4a adding cyl at high concentrations e g 2 4 10 5 m to e2 resulted in a left slope shift while cyl at low concentrations e g 2 4 10 8 m resulted in a right slope shift the shift in slopes can also be seen in fig 4b which shows a significant difference between the half maximum effective concentration logec50 of e2 e2 logec50 and the half maximum effective concentration of e2 exposed to cyl e2 cyl logec50 f 4 10 8 031 1012 p 0001 these results show cyl can act either as an agonist or an antagonist depending on its concentration in the case of ana the competition assay fig 5 a showed that adding different concentrations of ana to e2 e2 ana resulted in differences in the β galactosidase induced estrogenicity slope shift compared to the e2 positive control f 16 50 2 971 1011 p 0001 the right slope shift resulted from the reduced potency of the β galactosidase induced estrogenicity following the co exposure of e2 to ana accordingly ana can be categorized as an e2 antagonist these differences can be seen more clearly in fig 5b f 4 10 5 411 1011 m p 0001 where the co exposure of e2 to different concentrations of ana resulted in a higher half maximum effective concentration e2 ana logec50 than the half maximum effective concentration logec50 seen for e2 e2 logec50 however ana did not behave as a classic antagonist in the yes assay because an inverse dose response effect was observed by the antagonist effect of ana on the e2 induced β galactosidase in the yes assay the competition assay for zncl2 added at different concentrations to e2 also resulted in differences in the β galactosidase induced estrogenicity slope shift fig 6 a f 16 50 7 055 1011 p 0001 the half maximum effective concentration logec50 for e2 e2 logec50 was significantly different from the half maximum effective concentration of e2 exposed to zncl2 e2 zncl2 logec50 fig 6b f 4 10 1 632 1012 p 0001 the observations for zncl2 are in agreement with results from the study by denier et al 2009 further validating the use of zncl2 as an external control for this experiment overall the dose response experiments demonstrated that cyl and ana induced non monotonic dose responses in the yes assay such non monotonic dose response behaviours are common to chemicals or pollutants known as estrogen active chemicals eacs that have the ability to interfere with or disrupt the function of endogenous hormones almstrup et al 2002 li et al 2007 vandenberg et al 2012 owen et al 2014 the causes of non monotonic dose responses are not completely understood some equation based computational models have proposed that the co presence of an endogenous ligand and an exogenous ligand such as eacs and the concentration of each ligand can result in mixed ligand dimers kohn and portier 1993 conolly and lutz 2004 li et al 2007 the relative abundance of endogenous ligand receptor homodimers exogenous ligand receptor homodimers and mixed ligand heterodimers will influence the ratio of corepressor cor and coactivator coa in the cell resulting in either agonist or antagonist effects conolly and lutz 2004 li et al 2007 these effects could explain the dose dependent response for cyl observed in this work the agonist response seen with high concentrations of cyl i e 2 4 10 5 m and 2 4 10 6 m is a result of cyl competing against e2 however when cyl concentrations are reduced to 2 4 10 7 m the chances of cyl binding to receptor will be reduced by e2 competition resulting in a cumulative reduction effect the dose response behaviours also show that cyl at low concentrations i e 2 4 10 8 m had an antagonist effect the antagonist effect may be associated with the affinity changes of the receptors when exposed to very low cyl concentrations in the presence of e2 future dose response studies will be directed towards determining the lowest concentration of cyl that reduces estrogen induced β galactosidase assay the non monotonic dose response behaviours by eacs can also be explained by the phosphorylation status of the receptor atanaskova et al 2002 rochette egly 2003 li et al 2007 as well as the auto inhibitory effect of a high dose of the ligand on receptor expression webb et al 1992 in both cases the presence of high concentration of cyanotoxins may lead to a regulation of the receptor further ana may affect protein kinases by acting as ion channels arias 2006 the modulation of protein kinase by ana combined with the auto inhibitory effect on receptor expression with high concentrations of ana may explain the inverse antagonist dose response seen for ana running this experiment for this paper future dose response studies will be directed towards determining the lowest concentration of ana showing an agonistic effect some earlier studies reported that estrogenicity of samples measured by the yes assay varied against the values predicted by the concentration addition model or estrogenicity calculated by chemical analysis beck et al 2006 thorpe et al 2006 there are a wide range of suggested causes of such deviations including chemicals disrupting the activation of estrogen response elements thorpe et al 2006 anti estrogenic compounds and or unknown compounds with estrogenicity beck et al 2006 estrogen receptor antagonists snyder et al 2001 weak estrogens rajapakse et al 2001 and non estrogenic toxicants frische et al 2009 the influence of cyanotoxins should also be considered when analysing the estrogenic activity of natural samples by yes assay according to new zealand ministry of health s 2016 guidelines the concentrations of cyl and ana in drinking water should not exceed 0 001 mg l 2 4 10 9 m and 0 006 mg l 3 6 10 8 m respectively epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between environmental exposure to edcs and human disease and disability vandenberg et al 2012 the findings of this work suggest the possibility of chronic consequences for humans of cyl and ana exposure at guideline values or below 3 4 estrogenicity of treated cyanotoxins by feiii b h2o2 to evaluate the effect of feiii b h2o2 on the estrogenicity of cyanotoxin the estrogenicity of oxidized cyl and ana was investigated by the yes assay fig 7 a shows the difference between slopes for cyl and cyl treated by feiii b h2o2 f 8 30 1 292 1013 p 0001 the difference is also evident when their logec50 values are compared in fig 7b f 2 3 52 180 p 01 fig 8 a shows the different slopes for the β galactosidase responses of untreated ana and then ana treated by feiii b h2o2 f 8 30 2 163 1013 p 0001 however the comparison logec50 values in fig 8b indicate no significant difference f 2 3 6 290 p 05 similarly the t test result for the estrogenicity of treated cyl was significantly different from untreated cyl t 2 8 168 p 05 while no significant difference was seen between the estrogenic activity of untreated ana and treated ana t 2 1 295 p 05 feiii b has been reported to produce non estrogenic activity ellis et al 2010 further the influence of the catalase on estrogenicity quantification can be excluded due to its rapid exhaustion by h2o2 by 1 min because of the negligible influence of feiii b h2o2 and its evident oxidation efficiency si fig s1 oxidized cyanotoxin was strongly associated with the measured estrogenicity indicating that oxidized cyanotoxin may act as agonist or antagonist and or induce synergistic or antagonistic modulation of the parent cyanotoxin for both mechanisms the influence of oxidized cyanotoxin on the estrogenicity detected was related to its relative binding affinity to estrogen receptors which can be highly dependent on constructional transformation by oxidation the intermediates of cyl and ana mediated by feiii b h2o2 were identified by q exactive tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms and a series of cyanotoxin degradation products was proposed cyl was generally transformed into products with destroyed tricyclic and uracil rings table 3 resulting in a decrease in its binding affinity to estrogen receptors furthermore it appears that the majority of cyl by products had destroyed rings hence showed little or no binding affinity to estrogen receptors overall a reduced estrogenic activity of cyl was achieved by feiii b h2o2 via catalytic oxidative degradation ana degradation was mainly via unsaturated carbon bond oxidation and loss of ammonia to produce a large number of ana products with rings table 4 although the estrogenicity induced by parent ana decreased ana breakdown products with ring structures likely produced estrogenicity by binding to estrogen receptors increasing the overall estrogenic level a previous study of estrogenicity induced by edc oxidation products reported that one ee2 oxidation product may have higher estrogenicity than ee2 itself chen et al 2012 the resulting reduced estrogenicity of the parent ana but induced estrogenicity of ana products likely explains the changed logec50 value observed while no significant corresponding difference in statistical values was found when comparing the estrogenic activities of cyanotoxins before and after treatment the reduction in levels of cyanotoxin estrogenicity should be correlated with removal level concentrations and also related to its degradation by products further the daughter by products of cyanotoxin may be significant when evaluating the removal efficiency of estrogenicity via oxidation 4 conclusions cyl and ana were shown for the first time to induce estrogenic activity as agonists in the yes assay further they can also be considered as potential endocrine disrupting chemicals due to their modulations on e2 activity the non monotonic dose responses by cyanotoxin were also discussed the results found for the estrogenicity of cyanotoxin mediated by feiii b h2o2

with the steady state concentrations of hydroxyl radical oh ss maeng et al 2015 reported that srnom exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect than l tyrosine on cimetidine photocatalytic decomposition by tio2 nanofibers possibly due to its stronger oh quenching capability resulted from its higher suva254 value in addition the potential impact of nom on the formation of transformation products tps of organic compounds during photolysis was investigated recently for instance a humic acid extracted from modified coal hacm increased the concentration of tps with the enhancement of cip degradation under uva irradiation porras et al 2016 during photolysis of benzotriazoles new nitrogenous organic molecules were formed when they were irradiated under simulated sunlight in the presence of srfa weidauer et al 2016 the formation of new tps were also reported for metoprolol in the presence of natural fulvic acid fa extracted from vouga river portugal under simulated sunlight filipe et al 2017 in addition the yields of tps from solar photolysis of ibuprofen were compared in the presence of pony lake fa plfa srfa and old woman creek fa owcfa jacobs et al 2011 they found that plfa significantly increased the production of the major tps compared with direct photolysis and addition of the other two nom surrogates however in spite of the above mentioned studies research on the impact of different characteristics of nom on photolysis and photocatalysis is still quite limited no study was found on investigating the effect of nom properties on tps from photocatalysis to our best knowledge it is still largely unknown how different properties of nom will affect the formation of tps of antibiotics and whether nom characteristics are related to their reactivity during photolytic and photocatalytic decomposition the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of nom characteristics on the formation of tps and transformation pathways of cip during photolytic and photocatalytic decomposition three nom isolates including sigma aldrich humic acid saha srha and srnom were selected in this study which differ in origin functional groups degrees of aromaticity and optical properties uva light emitting diode uva led was used as an alternative light source to the traditional mercury uva lamps because it is mercury free shock resistant and energy efficient dominguez et al 2015 li and hu 2016 xiong and hu 2013 firstly comparison of the three nom isolates affecting degradation kinetics of cip by photolysis and photocatalysis was made then mineralization rates and formation of tps were investigated in the presence of different nom isolates to help understand how the characteristics of nom would influence the transformation pathways of cip by photolysis and photocatalysis finally the relationship between nom properties and formation of tps was tentatively deduced to elucidate the importance of nom in affecting photolytic and photocatalytic processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials non porous titanium dioxide tio2 99 5 degussa p25 germany was employed as received without further treatment it is a mixed phase containing

concentrations of nom were expressed as total organic carbon toc and determined by a toc vcsh analyzer shimadzu japan spectroscopic characterization of nom and calculation of suva254 e2 e3 ratio and fluorescence index fi are given in text s1 in the supplementary data 2 2 photolytic and photocatalytic decomposition experiments photolytic and tio2 100 mg l photocatalytic decompositon of cip 20 mg l were conducted in a pyrex crystallizing dish 325 ml diameter 100 mm height 50 mm aldrich singapore which was placed at a distance of 2 cm under uva led lamp 3 w 365 nm taoyuan electron hk the spectrum of the uva led lamp is shown in fig s1 twelve uva led lamps were connected as three in series four parallel groups and powered by a direct current dc power supply iso tech ips 2303 singapore incident light intensity was adjusted to 10 mw cm2 by changing the current of the dc power supply as measured by a radiometer ilt1400 international light technologies inc usa aliquots of each nom solution 15 mg l were spiked into the solutions to investigate the effects of nom characteristics ffa 0 15 mm methanol 100 mm and ki 2 mm were spiked into solutions as scavengers of 1o2 oh and h with reaction constants of 1 2 108 m 1s 1 1 0 109 m 1s 1 and 1 1 1010 m 1s 1 respectively chen et al 2005 haag et al 1984 li and hu 2016 van doorslaer et al 2012 the initial ph values were adjusted to 6 00 0 10 with 0 10 m hcl or naoh the suspensions were magnetically stirred under darkness for at least 30 min prior to irradiation at selected time intervals samples were taken out and filtered through a 0 22 μm ptfe syringe filter olim peak usa to remove the residual tio2 before analysis each experiment was conducted in triplicates temperature of the solution was slightly increased during the experiments fig s2 2 3 analysis of cip and its tps cip was quantified by a shimadzu 8030 series high performance liquid chromatography hplc in tandem with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ms shimadzu japan equipped with an electrospray ionization esi source the analyses were performed with an agilent zorbax sb c18 column 2 1 150 mm 3 5 μm at 40 c the mobile phase composition was acetonitrile a and water containing 0 1 formic acid b 25 75 v v at a flow rate of 0 25 ml min the injection volume was 10 μl positive ionization mode was used for isolation of m z 314 m h ion the limit of detection and limit of quantitation for cip were 8 38 μg l and 27 92 μg l with a signal to noise ratio of 3 and 10 respectively for elucidation of the intermediates the mobile phase composition a b started at 10 90 v v

volume was 100 μl and the detection limit of f was 0 05 mg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical and spectroscopic characteristics of nom the elemental compositions functional groups and optical properties of nom isolates are shown in table 1 and fig 1 the highest suva254 value and the lowest e2 e3 ratio were observed in saha indicating that saha has higher aromaticity than srha and srnom sharpless et al 2014 sun et al 2012 weishaar et al 2003 in contrast the calculated o c ratio for saha was lower than srha and srnom due to its lower concentration of carboxyl moieties two fluorophores including region i humic like species λ ex 300 nm and region ii fulvic like compounds λ ex 300 nm were observed in eem fluorescence spectra of nom isolates fig 1b d the peak maxima wavelengths followed the order of saha srha srnom in agreement with their order of degrees of aromatic polycondensation and conjugated chromophores chen et al 2002 liu et al 2015 senesi et al 1989 the fi values of nom isolates followed the order of srnom srha saha table 1 indicating the higher degree of aromaticity in saha than srha and srnom mcknight et al 2001 3 2 decomposition of cip by uva led and uva led tio2 decomposition of cip by uva led and uva led tio2 could be well fitted by pseudo first order kinetic model r 2 0 99 fig 1a and b the rate constants k min 1 were calculated from the slope of the plots of ln c c 0 versus the irradiation time it was 0 0091 0 0011 min 1 during photolysis photolysis of cip was then performed by spiking methanol as oh scavenger chen et al 2005 and ffa as 1o2 quencher haag et al 1984 into solutions cip decomposition was insignificantly affected by these scavengers fig 1a p 05 t test indicating the dominant role of direct photolysis ge et al 2010 li et al 2011 during photocatalysis cip was rapidly decomposed fig 1b with a k value at 0 2217 0 0179 min 1 the elimination of cip was mainly caused by its reactions with radicals because the contribution of direct photolysis was negligible text s2 and fig s1 participation of radicals in cip photocatalysis was then clarified by adding methanol and ki as scavengers of free oh chen et al 2005 and photogenerated h chen et al 2005 van doorslaer et al 2012 respectively as seen from fig 1b the addition of methanol and ki exhibited strong inhibition on cip decomposition suggesting the participation of oh and h in cip photocatalysis an et al 2010 3 3 decomposition kinetics of cip in the presence of different nom isolates as shown in fig 2 a the addition of three nom isolates insignificantly affected cip decomposition by uva led p 05 t test previous studies suggested that light screening and photosensitization effects of nom could contribute to photolysis li and hu 2016 the insignificant influence of nom on cip photolysis may be attributed to two reasons firstly light shielding by nom probably did not play a dominant role in cip photolysis secondly the counteracting influences photosentization and light competition of nom appeared to reach equilibrium during photolysis an insignificant effect of five fas from different natural water and soil samples on photolysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was also reported xia et al 2009 however the addition of the nom isolates negatively affected cip decomposition by uva led tio2 fig 2b consistent with previous studies for the removal of moxifloxacin van doorslaer et al 2015 and other antibiotics carbonaro et al 2013 hu et al 2007 by tio2 photocatalysis the degrees of inhibition on cip photocatalysis by different nom isolates followed the order of saha 49 6 srha 29 9 srnom 21 2 suggesting the dependence on nom characteristics similarly saha was reported to show a stronger inhibitory effect than srnom on photocatalysis of moxifloxacin van doorslaer et al 2015 the inhibitory effect of nom on photocatalysis may be resulted from surface deactivation of tio2 by adsorption and or oh quenching doll and frimmel 2005 li and hu 2016 van doorslaer et al 2015 found that nom could significantly promote the adsorption of moxifloxacin on tio2 due to the formation of nom tio2 complexes it could be then inferred that competitive adsorption by nom was insignificant in view of the structure similarity between cip and moxifloxacin therefore the greatly suppressed photocatalytic decomposition of cip with nom was probably due to oh quenching the reactivity of different nom isolates with oh was evaluated with the help of a probe pcba oh ss was obtained by dividing the pseudo first order rate constant of pcba degradation by its reaction rate constant with oh k oh pcba 5 2 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 text s3 and fig s3 the dramatic decrease in oh ss table s1 confirmed the role of nom as oh scavenger thus protecting cip from oxidation the inhibition on oh ss followed the order of saha srha srnom which is in accordance with their degrees of aromaticity the highest suva254 value in saha table 1 reflects a stronger oh quenching ability than srha and srnom leading to the most pronounced retardation on cip photocatalytic degradation these results agree with prior studies in which the oh quenching ability of nom was correlated with suva254 values batista et al 2016 maeng et al 2015 rosario ortiz et al 2008 thus these results suggest that the characteristics of nom could influence photocatalysis through the changes in their oh quenching ability 3 4 mineralization of cip in the presence of different nom isolates during photolysis 7 of toc was removed whereas 76 of cip was decomposed after 240 min of irradiation fig s4 similar mineralization percentage around 7 of cip photolysis was reported in spite of rapid consumption of cip haddad and kümmerer 2014 during photocatalysis the removal efficiency of toc was approximately 63 after 40 min of irradiation whereas cip was completely removed fig s4 toc removal in the presence of nom isolates was not studied because nom isolates have high carbon contents 50 70 63 15 table 1 mineralization rates of cip with or without nom isolates as represented by the formation of inorganic f ion in uva led and uva led tio2 systems are presented in fig 3 a the f concentration was 0 0282 0 0017 mm after 240 min of irradiation by uva led without the presence of nom and an insignificant influence of nom on f formation was observed in uva led tio2 system the f concentration was 0 0596 0 0008 mm after 40 min of irradiation without the presence of nom the defluorination ratio was 98 7 indicating that defluorination is an important pathway for cip photocatalsis calza et al 2008 paul et al 2010 the evolution kinetics and the maximum concentrations of f were adversely affected by nom isolates after 120 min of irradiation the maximum concentrations of f were 0 0327 0 0008 0 0488 0 0016 and 0 0568 0 0017 mm in the presence of saha srha and srnom respectively the order of inhibition on f release by different nom isolates saha srha srnom agrees with their degrees of aromaticity and the order of their inhibition on decomposition kinetics of cip photocatalysis these results reveal the role of nom characteristics on the defluorination pathway of cip the ph values of the solution suspension in the absence and presence of nom isolates were monitored during photolysis and photocatalysis of cip fig 3b the ph values generally decreased during both photolytic and photocatalytic processes the decrease in the ph values could be attributed to the formation of hf coming from cip defluorination porras et al 2016 and the formation of other acidic intermediates li et al 2011 3 5 formation of tps by uva led and uva led tio2 formation of tps during photolysis and photocatalysis of cip without the presence of nom is summarized in table 2 in the absence of nom ten tps by uva led were observed including tp245 tp263 tp288 tp316a tp316b tp330a tp330b tp344 tp346 and tp348a whereas nine tps were detected from uva led tio2 system including tp263 tp291 tp306 tp330a tp334a tp334b tp348a tp348b and tp362 the structures of tps were proposed based on their retention time ms2 fragmentation pattern table s2 fig s5 and fig s6 and the information from prior studies an et al 2010 calza et al 2008 haddad and kümmerer 2014 paul et al 2010 perini et al 2014 vasconcelos et al 2009 quinolone ring and piperazine moiety were the main reaction sites in cip during photolysis only tp263 and tp348a possessed f atom whereas all the other eight tps were defluorination products indicating that defluorination is a dominant transformation pathway of cip under uva led irradiation six transformation pathways of cip were elucidated during photolysis and photocatalysis fig 4 these two processes shared three pathways including photoinduced solvolytic defluorination pathway 1 hydroxylation pathway 2 and dealkylation of piperazine ring pathway 4 tp330a was identified from pathway 1 which was formed by photosubstitution of the fluorine atom on c6 by a hydroxyl group batchu et al 2014 calza et al 2008 haddad and kümmerer 2014 paul et al 2010 sturini et al 2012 wei et al 2013 in pathway 2 two monohydroxyl products of tp348a and tp348b were formed via hydroxylation corresponding to the most reactive sites for the addition of hydroxyl group an et al 2010 calza et al 2008 in pathway 4 tp306 tp263 and tp245 could be formed by cleavage of c2h2 and c4h7n groups from the piperazine ring and a subsequent cleavage of the c f bond on c6 an et al 2010 paul et al 2010 in addition pathways 3 and 5 were only observed from cip photolysis tp346 was produced through self sensitized oxidation with the loss of f and oxidation of the quinolone ring wei et al 2013 defluorination and rupture of piperazine ring yielded tp344 tp330b tp316a tp316b and tp288 haddad and kümmerer 2014 sturini et al 2012 wei et al 2013 one characteristic pathway pathway 6 of cip was identified during uva led tio2 process where tp362 tp334a tp334b and tp291 were identified as oxidation products of piperazine ring with consequent decarbonylation and n dealkylation calza et al 2008 liu et al 2012 paul et al 2010 compared to cip the toxicity of these tps was decreased as predicted by the usepa test model text s4 and table s3 the reduction in the toxicity may result from the changes in the quinolone structure shen et al 1989 and the transformation of f molecule and n piperazine ring moiety paul et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 3 6 formation of tps in the presence of different nom isolates in uva led and uva led tio2 systems almost identical tps were formed in the presence of nom isolates during photolytic decomposition of cip compared to that in di water except for the disappearance of tp330b and the generation of tp306 table 2 during cip photocatalysis the majority of the tps were observed in the presence of nom isolates except for tp348a and tp348b table 2 the difference in the species of tps is likely due to the modification of reaction mechanisms by nom addition calza et al 2014 caupos et al 2011 filipe et al 2017 time dependent evolution profiles of tps in the absence and presence of nom during uva led and uva led tio2 processes are shown in figs 5 and 6 and figs s7 s10 due to the lack of analytical standards of tps quantification of each product is impossible to achieve thus the peak area of each tp was normalized to the initial peak area of the parent cip for semi quantification on the basis of the structural similarity of cip and its tps the maximum abundances and the formation decay kinetics of tps were significantly affected by nom addition see below 3 6 1 solvolytic defluorination and oxidation of quinolone ring the abundances of tp330a as a solvolytic defluorination product were slightly reduced with the addition of three nom isolates in uva led and uva led tio2 systems fig s7 the abundances of tp346 corresponding to defluorination and oxidation of quinolone ring were greatly decreased in the presence of srha and srnom under uva led irradiation and tp346 was not observed signal to noise ratio s n 3 in the presence of saha fig s8 scavenging of oh by methanol and 1o2 by ffa led to a decrease in the abundance of tp346 fig s8 implying the role of oh and 1o2 in the formation of tp346 thus oxidation of quinolone ring was suppressed by nom probably due to its role as radical quencher 3 6 2 hydroxylation the formation of the hydroxylation products of tp348a and tp348b was depressed by nom addition in uva led and uva led tio2 systems fig s9 in particular tp348a was not observed under uva led irradiation in the presence of three nom isolates fig s9b scavenging of free oh by methanol resulted in the depressed formation of tp348a figs s9a and s9b indicating the role of free oh in transforming cip into tp348a in comparison tp348b was found in the presence of srnom only at much lower abundance compared to that without the presence of nom fig s9c the abundance of tp348b was strongly retarded by the addition of ki hole scavenger suggesting the participation of photogenerated holes in the formation of tp348b the decrease in the abundances of tp348b with the presence of nom could be probably attributed to the competition between nom and cip for holes during uva led tio2 process therefore the suppressed formation of tp348a and tp348b in the presence of nom suggests that oh h induced hydroxylation pathways of cip are inhibited by nom during uva led and uva led tio2 processes 3 6 3 dealkylation of piperazine ring the reaction of piperazine ring dealkylation was favored by nom addition with elevated abundances of tp306 tp263 and tp245 during uva led fig 5a c and uva led tio2 processes fig 5d e the addition of methanol oh scavenger hardly affected the evolution profiles of these tps fig 5a e however ki addition favored the generation of tp263 and tp306 in uva led tio2 system fig 5d e as an effective scavenger for h ki may result in the accumulation of electrons thus promoting the reaction of cip with electron or nom related species the abundances of these tps were enhanced in the presence of nom likely due to its electron donating ability 3 6 4 simultaneous defluorination and oxidation of piperazine ring under uva led irradiation tps arising from cleavage of the c f bond and oxidation of piperazine ring pathway 5 fig 4 were generally suppressed by nom fig s10 tp330b was not observed with three nom isolates fig s10d the abundances of tp288 fig s10a tp316a fig s10b tp316b fig s10c and tp344 fig s10e were more significantly decreased in the presence of saha and srha compared to srnom these results show the significance of nom characteristics in affecting the transformation pathways of cip 3 6 5 oxidation of piperazine ring tps generated from oxidation of piperazine ring pathway 6 fig 4 were significantly enhanced in uva led tio2 system fig 6 moreover srnom showed the strongest promoting effect among three nom isolates followed by srha and saha for example the maximum abundances of tp291 were approximately 4 3 and 2 times higher in the presence of srnom srha and saha respectively than that without the presence of nom this result implies that nom could facilitate the ring opening reactions on the piperazine moiety during uva led tio2 process in addition scavenging of free oh and h promoted the generation of tp291 tp334a tp334b and tp362 indicating the role of other reactive species in their formation in summary the presence of nom isolates caused significant modification of reaction mechanisms of cip in uva led and uva led tio2 systems all of the defluorination pathways were inhibited by nom under uva led irradiation including photoinduced solvolysis pathway 1 simultaneous defluorination and oxidation of quinolone ring pathway 3 and simultaneous defluorination with oxidation of piperazine ring pathway 5 additionally hydroxylation on quinolone ring pathway 2 was suppressed probably due to oh quenching by nom in contrast piperazine ring dealkylation pathway 4 was promoted by nom during photolytic decomposition during uva led tio2 process reactions of oh hole induced defluorination pathway 1 and hydroxylation pathway 2 were inhibited by nom as a result of oh hole competition in contrast the other two parallel reaction pathways including dealkylation pathway 4 and oxidation pathway 6 of piperazine ring were intensified by nom 3 7 relationship between nom properties and their effects on cip decomposition by uva led and uva led tio2 processes the apparent formation kinetics of tps k app were simulated by an exponential equation when plotting normalized abundance of tps below their maxima versus lnt r 2 0 85 fig s11 k app for tp306 tp330a tp330b tp348a and tp348b under uva led and uva led tio2 were not calculated due to the disappearance of these tps or limited datasets available for model simulation comparison of k app in the absence and presence of nom is shown in fig 7 in the presence of nom k app values of tp316a tp316b and tp346 were decreased while tp245 and tp263 were increased under uva led fig 7a under uva led tio2 k app values of tp263 tp291 tp334a tp334b and tp362 were promoted by nom fig 7b in addition the inhibitory effect of different nom isolates on k app tp316a k app tp316b and k app tp346 under uva led followed the order of saha srha srnom therefore saha showed the strongest inhibitory effect on tps formation from defluorination pathways including oxidation of quinolone ring and piperazine ring during photolysis compared to srha and srnom they are likely attributed to their different abilities of light attenuation and radical quenching in contrast the enhancement in k app tp291 k app tp334a k app tp334b and k app tp362 under uva led tio2 followed the order of srnom srha saha probably resulted from their composition dependent photoinductive abilities these results highlight the variations of nom characteristics in affecting the formation of tps during photolysis and photocatalysis compared to saha and srha srnom has higher o c ratio and more carboxyl groups which are known as the characteristics of photoreactive chromophores zhan et al 2006 therefore srnom may have higher photoinductive ability than saha and srha resulting in stronger promotion in dealkylation and oxidation of piperazine ring as evidenced by enhanced k app values of tp245 tp291 tp334a tp334b and tp362 this finding is consistent with a previous study by xu et al 2011 who found that srnom exhibited higher photosensitization effect than saha and srha on photolytic decomposition of amoxicillin under simulated sunlight in addition strong positive relationships were observed between k app tp245 k app tp362 and o c p 05 k app tp291 and carboxyl content of nom p 05 and k app tp245 k app tp362 and carboxyl content of nom p 01 table 3 these results confirm that o c and carboxyl content may serve as possible surrogates of photoinductive ability of nom moreover most of k app values of tp245 tp291 tp334a tp334b and tp362 were negatively correlated with suva254 and positively correlated with e2 e3 and fi p 05 under uva led irradiation negative relationship between k app and suva254 and positive relationship k app and fi were found for tp288 tp316a tp316b tp344 and tp346 p 05 additionally e2 e3 was correlated with k app tp288 and k app tp344 these results reveal that suva254 e2 e3 and fi values of nom are also important indicators of the reactivity of different nom isolates during photolysis and photocatalysis 4 conclusion the mechanistic effects of saha srha and srnom on cip decomposition were investigated in uva led and uva led tio2 systems photolytic decomposition kinetics of cip were insignificantly affected by three nom isolates p 05 while photocatalytic decomposition kinetics was strongly retarded the degrees of inhibition on cip photocatalysis followed the order of saha 49 6 srha 29 9 srnom 21 2 mainly due to the differences in their oh quenching abilities in addition the release of f ion from cip photocatalysis was inhibited by nom with the order of saha srha srnom the degrees of inhibitory effect and oh quenching abilities were consistent with the orders of suva254 values and nom aromaticity saha srha srnom the formation of tps of cip were also affected by nom addition in both uva led and uva led tio2 systems transformation pathways of hydroxylation and defluorination were generally suppressed by nom but those of piperazine ring dealkylation and oxidation were favored by nom with enhanced k app values of tp245 tp263 tp291 tp334a tp334b and tp362 srnom showed stronger promoting effect than srha and saha on these k app values except for tp263 indicating the importance of nom characteristics in influencing the transformation pathways of antibiotics generally k app values of most tps were positively correlated with e2 e3 ratios and fi of different nom isolates p 05 whereas they were negatively correlated to suva254 values p 05 therefore optical and physicochemical properties of nom are important parameters to be taken into account in evaluating their influence on photolysis and photocatalysis acknowledgements we acknowledge the financial support from the singapore peking oxford research enterprise the economic development board singapore

19764,the role of natural organic matter nom in contaminants removal by photolysis and photocatalysis has aroused increasing interest however evaluation of the influence of nom characteristics on the transformation products tps formation and transformation pathways of contaminants has rarely been performed this study investigated the decomposition kinetics mineralization tps formation and transformation pathways of antibiotic ciprofloxacin cip during photolysis and photocatalysis in the presence of three commercial nom isolates sigma aldrich humic acid saha suwannee river humic acid srha and suwannee river nom srnom by using uva light emitting diode uva led as an alternative light source nom isolates insignificantly affected cip photolysis but strongly inhibited cip photocatalysis due to competitive radical quenching the inhibitory effect followed the order of saha 49 6 srha 29 9 srnom 21 2 consistent with their oh quenching abilities suva254 values and orders of aromaticity mineralization rates as revealed by f release were negatively affected by nom during cip photocatalysis tps arising from hydroxylation and defluorination were generally suppressed by nom isolates in uva led and uva led tio2 systems in contrast dealkylation and oxidation of piperazine ring were promoted by nom the enhancement in the apparent formation kinetics k app of tp245 tp291 tp334a tp334b and tp362 followed the order of srnom srha saha k app values were positively correlated with o c ratio carboxyl content e2 e3 and fluorescence index fi of nom and negatively related with suva254 values the observed correlations indicate that nom properties are important in determining the fate and transformation of organic contaminants during photolysis and photocatalysis graphical

photolytic and photocatalytic reactions li and hu 2016 porras et al 2016 yan and song 2014 firstly the absorption of light by the photoinductive constituents of nom could generate singlet 1nom and triplet excited states of nom 3nom from which reactive oxygen species ros could be further formed such as hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 peroxyl radical oor and superoxide anion radical o2 batista et al 2016 caupos et al 2011 yan and song 2014 zhan et al 2006 therefore the presence of nom could initiate the indirect transformation of organic contaminants however some light absorbing but non photoinductive components in nom may act as inner filter thus blocking the photochemically active light caupos et al 2011 gieguzynska et al 2009 nom are also capable of scavenging ros and deactivating the surface of catalysts li and hu 2016 maeng et al 2015 as a result nom could promote or inhibit photolytic and photocatalytic reactions depending on the contaminant and on the nature and concentration of nom andreozzi et al 2003 hu et al 2007 ji et al 2013 li and hu 2016 li and sun 2014 xia et al 2009 xu et al 2011 nom consists of a range of aromatic and aliphatic organic compounds including humic substances and biomolecules caupos et al 2011 matilainen et al 2011 therefore the physicochemical and optical properties of nom such as elemental composition functional groups aromaticity specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 and fluorescence intensity vary widely according to their origins matilainen et al 2011 the importance of nom characteristics in influencing degradation rates of organic compounds and abundances of ros during photolysis batista et al 2016 jacobs et al 2011 xu et al 2011 zeng et al 2012 and photocatalysis ji et al 2013 maeng et al 2015 van doorslaer et al 2015 was reported in some recent studies for example suwannee river natural organic matter srnom suwannee river humic acid srha and aldrich humic acid aha were shown to enhance photolysis of sulfamerazine smr under simulated sunlight mainly by facilitated formation of 3nom whereas suwannee river fulvic acid srfa inhibited photolysis batista et al 2016 their results showed that smr degradation rate constant was correlated with the steady state concentrations of 3nom 3nom ss for srnom srha and aha in addition suva254 and aromaticity showed potential correlations with the steady state concentrations of hydroxyl radical oh ss maeng et al 2015 reported that srnom exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect than l tyrosine on cimetidine photocatalytic decomposition by tio2 nanofibers possibly due to its stronger oh quenching capability resulted from its higher suva254 value in addition the potential impact of nom on the formation of transformation products tps of organic compounds during photolysis was investigated recently for instance a humic acid extracted from modified coal hacm increased the concentration of tps with the enhancement of cip degradation under uva irradiation porras et al 2016 during photolysis of benzotriazoles new nitrogenous organic molecules were formed when they were irradiated under simulated sunlight in the presence of srfa weidauer et al 2016 the formation of new tps were also reported for metoprolol in the presence of natural fulvic acid fa extracted from vouga river portugal under simulated sunlight filipe et al 2017 in addition the yields of tps from solar photolysis of ibuprofen were compared in the presence of pony lake fa plfa srfa and old woman creek fa owcfa jacobs et al 2011 they found that plfa significantly increased the production of the major tps compared with direct photolysis and addition of the other two nom surrogates however in spite of the above mentioned studies research on the impact of different characteristics of nom on photolysis and photocatalysis is still quite limited no study was found on investigating the effect of nom properties on tps from photocatalysis to our best knowledge it is still largely unknown how different properties of nom will affect the formation of tps of antibiotics and whether nom characteristics are related to their reactivity during photolytic and photocatalytic decomposition the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of nom characteristics on the formation of tps and transformation pathways of cip during photolytic and photocatalytic decomposition three nom isolates including sigma aldrich humic acid saha srha and srnom were selected in this study which differ in origin functional groups degrees of aromaticity and optical properties uva light emitting diode uva led was used as an alternative light source to the traditional mercury uva lamps because it is mercury free shock resistant and energy efficient dominguez et al 2015 li and hu 2016 xiong and hu 2013 firstly comparison of the three nom isolates affecting degradation kinetics of cip by photolysis and photocatalysis was made then mineralization rates and formation of tps were investigated in the presence of different nom isolates to help understand how the characteristics of nom would influence the transformation pathways of cip by photolysis and photocatalysis finally the relationship between nom properties and formation of tps was tentatively deduced to elucidate the importance of nom in affecting photolytic and photocatalytic processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials non porous titanium dioxide tio2 99 5 degussa p25 germany was employed as received without further treatment it is a mixed phase containing

concentrations of nom were expressed as total organic carbon toc and determined by a toc vcsh analyzer shimadzu japan spectroscopic characterization of nom and calculation of suva254 e2 e3 ratio and fluorescence index fi are given in text s1 in the supplementary data 2 2 photolytic and photocatalytic decomposition experiments photolytic and tio2 100 mg l photocatalytic decompositon of cip 20 mg l were conducted in a pyrex crystallizing dish 325 ml diameter 100 mm height 50 mm aldrich singapore which was placed at a distance of 2 cm under uva led lamp 3 w 365 nm taoyuan electron hk the spectrum of the uva led lamp is shown in fig s1 twelve uva led lamps were connected as three in series four parallel groups and powered by a direct current dc power supply iso tech ips 2303 singapore incident light intensity was adjusted to 10 mw cm2 by changing the current of the dc power supply as measured by a radiometer ilt1400 international light technologies inc usa aliquots of each nom solution 15 mg l were spiked into the solutions to investigate the effects of nom characteristics ffa 0 15 mm methanol 100 mm and ki 2 mm were spiked into solutions as scavengers of 1o2 oh and h with reaction constants of 1 2 108 m 1s 1 1 0 109 m 1s 1 and 1 1 1010 m 1s 1 respectively chen et al 2005 haag et al 1984 li and hu 2016 van doorslaer et al 2012 the initial ph values were adjusted to 6 00 0 10 with 0 10 m hcl or naoh the suspensions were magnetically stirred under darkness for at least 30 min prior to irradiation at selected time intervals samples were taken out and filtered through a 0 22 μm ptfe syringe filter olim peak usa to remove the residual tio2 before analysis each experiment was conducted in triplicates temperature of the solution was slightly increased during the experiments fig s2 2 3 analysis of cip and its tps cip was quantified by a shimadzu 8030 series high performance liquid chromatography hplc in tandem with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ms shimadzu japan equipped with an electrospray ionization esi source the analyses were performed with an agilent zorbax sb c18 column 2 1 150 mm 3 5 μm at 40 c the mobile phase composition was acetonitrile a and water containing 0 1 formic acid b 25 75 v v at a flow rate of 0 25 ml min the injection volume was 10 μl positive ionization mode was used for isolation of m z 314 m h ion the limit of detection and limit of quantitation for cip were 8 38 μg l and 27 92 μg l with a signal to noise ratio of 3 and 10 respectively for elucidation of the intermediates the mobile phase composition a b started at 10 90 v v

volume was 100 μl and the detection limit of f was 0 05 mg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical and spectroscopic characteristics of nom the elemental compositions functional groups and optical properties of nom isolates are shown in table 1 and fig 1 the highest suva254 value and the lowest e2 e3 ratio were observed in saha indicating that saha has higher aromaticity than srha and srnom sharpless et al 2014 sun et al 2012 weishaar et al 2003 in contrast the calculated o c ratio for saha was lower than srha and srnom due to its lower concentration of carboxyl moieties two fluorophores including region i humic like species λ ex 300 nm and region ii fulvic like compounds λ ex 300 nm were observed in eem fluorescence spectra of nom isolates fig 1b d the peak maxima wavelengths followed the order of saha srha srnom in agreement with their order of degrees of aromatic polycondensation and conjugated chromophores chen et al 2002 liu et al 2015 senesi et al 1989 the fi values of nom isolates followed the order of srnom srha saha table 1 indicating the higher degree of aromaticity in saha than srha and srnom mcknight et al 2001 3 2 decomposition of cip by uva led and uva led tio2 decomposition of cip by uva led and uva led tio2 could be well fitted by pseudo first order kinetic model r 2 0 99 fig 1a and b the rate constants k min 1 were calculated from the slope of the plots of ln c c 0 versus the irradiation time it was 0 0091 0 0011 min 1 during photolysis photolysis of cip was then performed by spiking methanol as oh scavenger chen et al 2005 and ffa as 1o2 quencher haag et al 1984 into solutions cip decomposition was insignificantly affected by these scavengers fig 1a p 05 t test indicating the dominant role of direct photolysis ge et al 2010 li et al 2011 during photocatalysis cip was rapidly decomposed fig 1b with a k value at 0 2217 0 0179 min 1 the elimination of cip was mainly caused by its reactions with radicals because the contribution of direct photolysis was negligible text s2 and fig s1 participation of radicals in cip photocatalysis was then clarified by adding methanol and ki as scavengers of free oh chen et al 2005 and photogenerated h chen et al 2005 van doorslaer et al 2012 respectively as seen from fig 1b the addition of methanol and ki exhibited strong inhibition on cip decomposition suggesting the participation of oh and h in cip photocatalysis an et al 2010 3 3 decomposition kinetics of cip in the presence of different nom isolates as shown in fig 2 a the addition of three nom isolates insignificantly affected cip decomposition by uva led p 05 t test previous studies suggested that light screening and photosensitization effects of nom could contribute to photolysis li and hu 2016 the insignificant influence of nom on cip photolysis may be attributed to two reasons firstly light shielding by nom probably did not play a dominant role in cip photolysis secondly the counteracting influences photosentization and light competition of nom appeared to reach equilibrium during photolysis an insignificant effect of five fas from different natural water and soil samples on photolysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was also reported xia et al 2009 however the addition of the nom isolates negatively affected cip decomposition by uva led tio2 fig 2b consistent with previous studies for the removal of moxifloxacin van doorslaer et al 2015 and other antibiotics carbonaro et al 2013 hu et al 2007 by tio2 photocatalysis the degrees of inhibition on cip photocatalysis by different nom isolates followed the order of saha 49 6 srha 29 9 srnom 21 2 suggesting the dependence on nom characteristics similarly saha was reported to show a stronger inhibitory effect than srnom on photocatalysis of moxifloxacin van doorslaer et al 2015 the inhibitory effect of nom on photocatalysis may be resulted from surface deactivation of tio2 by adsorption and or oh quenching doll and frimmel 2005 li and hu 2016 van doorslaer et al 2015 found that nom could significantly promote the adsorption of moxifloxacin on tio2 due to the formation of nom tio2 complexes it could be then inferred that competitive adsorption by nom was insignificant in view of the structure similarity between cip and moxifloxacin therefore the greatly suppressed photocatalytic decomposition of cip with nom was probably due to oh quenching the reactivity of different nom isolates with oh was evaluated with the help of a probe pcba oh ss was obtained by dividing the pseudo first order rate constant of pcba degradation by its reaction rate constant with oh k oh pcba 5 2 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 text s3 and fig s3 the dramatic decrease in oh ss table s1 confirmed the role of nom as oh scavenger thus protecting cip from oxidation the inhibition on oh ss followed the order of saha srha srnom which is in accordance with their degrees of aromaticity the highest suva254 value in saha table 1 reflects a stronger oh quenching ability than srha and srnom leading to the most pronounced retardation on cip photocatalytic degradation these results agree with prior studies in which the oh quenching ability of nom was correlated with suva254 values batista et al 2016 maeng et al 2015 rosario ortiz et al 2008 thus these results suggest that the characteristics of nom could influence photocatalysis through the changes in their oh quenching ability 3 4 mineralization of cip in the presence of different nom isolates during photolysis 7 of toc was removed whereas 76 of cip was decomposed after 240 min of irradiation fig s4 similar mineralization percentage around 7 of cip photolysis was reported in spite of rapid consumption of cip haddad and kümmerer 2014 during photocatalysis the removal efficiency of toc was approximately 63 after 40 min of irradiation whereas cip was completely removed fig s4 toc removal in the presence of nom isolates was not studied because nom isolates have high carbon contents 50 70 63 15 table 1 mineralization rates of cip with or without nom isolates as represented by the formation of inorganic f ion in uva led and uva led tio2 systems are presented in fig 3 a the f concentration was 0 0282 0 0017 mm after 240 min of irradiation by uva led without the presence of nom and an insignificant influence of nom on f formation was observed in uva led tio2 system the f concentration was 0 0596 0 0008 mm after 40 min of irradiation without the presence of nom the defluorination ratio was 98 7 indicating that defluorination is an important pathway for cip photocatalsis calza et al 2008 paul et al 2010 the evolution kinetics and the maximum concentrations of f were adversely affected by nom isolates after 120 min of irradiation the maximum concentrations of f were 0 0327 0 0008 0 0488 0 0016 and 0 0568 0 0017 mm in the presence of saha srha and srnom respectively the order of inhibition on f release by different nom isolates saha srha srnom agrees with their degrees of aromaticity and the order of their inhibition on decomposition kinetics of cip photocatalysis these results reveal the role of nom characteristics on the defluorination pathway of cip the ph values of the solution suspension in the absence and presence of nom isolates were monitored during photolysis and photocatalysis of cip fig 3b the ph values generally decreased during both photolytic and photocatalytic processes the decrease in the ph values could be attributed to the formation of hf coming from cip defluorination porras et al 2016 and the formation of other acidic intermediates li et al 2011 3 5 formation of tps by uva led and uva led tio2 formation of tps during photolysis and photocatalysis of cip without the presence of nom is summarized in table 2 in the absence of nom ten tps by uva led were observed including tp245 tp263 tp288 tp316a tp316b tp330a tp330b tp344 tp346 and tp348a whereas nine tps were detected from uva led tio2 system including tp263 tp291 tp306 tp330a tp334a tp334b tp348a tp348b and tp362 the structures of tps were proposed based on their retention time ms2 fragmentation pattern table s2 fig s5 and fig s6 and the information from prior studies an et al 2010 calza et al 2008 haddad and kümmerer 2014 paul et al 2010 perini et al 2014 vasconcelos et al 2009 quinolone ring and piperazine moiety were the main reaction sites in cip during photolysis only tp263 and tp348a possessed f atom whereas all the other eight tps were defluorination products indicating that defluorination is a dominant transformation pathway of cip under uva led irradiation six transformation pathways of cip were elucidated during photolysis and photocatalysis fig 4 these two processes shared three pathways including photoinduced solvolytic defluorination pathway 1 hydroxylation pathway 2 and dealkylation of piperazine ring pathway 4 tp330a was identified from pathway 1 which was formed by photosubstitution of the fluorine atom on c6 by a hydroxyl group batchu et al 2014 calza et al 2008 haddad and kümmerer 2014 paul et al 2010 sturini et al 2012 wei et al 2013 in pathway 2 two monohydroxyl products of tp348a and tp348b were formed via hydroxylation corresponding to the most reactive sites for the addition of hydroxyl group an et al 2010 calza et al 2008 in pathway 4 tp306 tp263 and tp245 could be formed by cleavage of c2h2 and c4h7n groups from the piperazine ring and a subsequent cleavage of the c f bond on c6 an et al 2010 paul et al 2010 in addition pathways 3 and 5 were only observed from cip photolysis tp346 was produced through self sensitized oxidation with the loss of f and oxidation of the quinolone ring wei et al 2013 defluorination and rupture of piperazine ring yielded tp344 tp330b tp316a tp316b and tp288 haddad and kümmerer 2014 sturini et al 2012 wei et al 2013 one characteristic pathway pathway 6 of cip was identified during uva led tio2 process where tp362 tp334a tp334b and tp291 were identified as oxidation products of piperazine ring with consequent decarbonylation and n dealkylation calza et al 2008 liu et al 2012 paul et al 2010 compared to cip the toxicity of these tps was decreased as predicted by the usepa test model text s4 and table s3 the reduction in the toxicity may result from the changes in the quinolone structure shen et al 1989 and the transformation of f molecule and n piperazine ring moiety paul et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 3 6 formation of tps in the presence of different nom isolates in uva led and uva led tio2 systems almost identical tps were formed in the presence of nom isolates during photolytic decomposition of cip compared to that in di water except for the disappearance of tp330b and the generation of tp306 table 2 during cip photocatalysis the majority of the tps were observed in the presence of nom isolates except for tp348a and tp348b table 2 the difference in the species of tps is likely due to the modification of reaction mechanisms by nom addition calza et al 2014 caupos et al 2011 filipe et al 2017 time dependent evolution profiles of tps in the absence and presence of nom during uva led and uva led tio2 processes are shown in figs 5 and 6 and figs s7 s10 due to the lack of analytical standards of tps quantification of each product is impossible to achieve thus the peak area of each tp was normalized to the initial peak area of the parent cip for semi quantification on the basis of the structural similarity of cip and its tps the maximum abundances and the formation decay kinetics of tps were significantly affected by nom addition see below 3 6 1 solvolytic defluorination and oxidation of quinolone ring the abundances of tp330a as a solvolytic defluorination product were slightly reduced with the addition of three nom isolates in uva led and uva led tio2 systems fig s7 the abundances of tp346 corresponding to defluorination and oxidation of quinolone ring were greatly decreased in the presence of srha and srnom under uva led irradiation and tp346 was not observed signal to noise ratio s n 3 in the presence of saha fig s8 scavenging of oh by methanol and 1o2 by ffa led to a decrease in the abundance of tp346 fig s8 implying the role of oh and 1o2 in the formation of tp346 thus oxidation of quinolone ring was suppressed by nom probably due to its role as radical quencher 3 6 2 hydroxylation the formation of the hydroxylation products of tp348a and tp348b was depressed by nom addition in uva led and uva led tio2 systems fig s9 in particular tp348a was not observed under uva led irradiation in the presence of three nom isolates fig s9b scavenging of free oh by methanol resulted in the depressed formation of tp348a figs s9a and s9b indicating the role of free oh in transforming cip into tp348a in comparison tp348b was found in the presence of srnom only at much lower abundance compared to that without the presence of nom fig s9c the abundance of tp348b was strongly retarded by the addition of ki hole scavenger suggesting the participation of photogenerated holes in the formation of tp348b the decrease in the abundances of tp348b with the presence of nom could be probably attributed to the competition between nom and cip for holes during uva led tio2 process therefore the suppressed formation of tp348a and tp348b in the presence of nom suggests that oh h induced hydroxylation pathways of cip are inhibited by nom during uva led and uva led tio2 processes 3 6 3 dealkylation of piperazine ring the reaction of piperazine ring dealkylation was favored by nom addition with elevated abundances of tp306 tp263 and tp245 during uva led fig 5a c and uva led tio2 processes fig 5d e the addition of methanol oh scavenger hardly affected the evolution profiles of these tps fig 5a e however ki addition favored the generation of tp263 and tp306 in uva led tio2 system fig 5d e as an effective scavenger for h ki may result in the accumulation of electrons thus promoting the reaction of cip with electron or nom related species the abundances of these tps were enhanced in the presence of nom likely due to its electron donating ability 3 6 4 simultaneous defluorination and oxidation of piperazine ring under uva led irradiation tps arising from cleavage of the c f bond and oxidation of piperazine ring pathway 5 fig 4 were generally suppressed by nom fig s10 tp330b was not observed with three nom isolates fig s10d the abundances of tp288 fig s10a tp316a fig s10b tp316b fig s10c and tp344 fig s10e were more significantly decreased in the presence of saha and srha compared to srnom these results show the significance of nom characteristics in affecting the transformation pathways of cip 3 6 5 oxidation of piperazine ring tps generated from oxidation of piperazine ring pathway 6 fig 4 were significantly enhanced in uva led tio2 system fig 6 moreover srnom showed the strongest promoting effect among three nom isolates followed by srha and saha for example the maximum abundances of tp291 were approximately 4 3 and 2 times higher in the presence of srnom srha and saha respectively than that without the presence of nom this result implies that nom could facilitate the ring opening reactions on the piperazine moiety during uva led tio2 process in addition scavenging of free oh and h promoted the generation of tp291 tp334a tp334b and tp362 indicating the role of other reactive species in their formation in summary the presence of nom isolates caused significant modification of reaction mechanisms of cip in uva led and uva led tio2 systems all of the defluorination pathways were inhibited by nom under uva led irradiation including photoinduced solvolysis pathway 1 simultaneous defluorination and oxidation of quinolone ring pathway 3 and simultaneous defluorination with oxidation of piperazine ring pathway 5 additionally hydroxylation on quinolone ring pathway 2 was suppressed probably due to oh quenching by nom in contrast piperazine ring dealkylation pathway 4 was promoted by nom during photolytic decomposition during uva led tio2 process reactions of oh hole induced defluorination pathway 1 and hydroxylation pathway 2 were inhibited by nom as a result of oh hole competition in contrast the other two parallel reaction pathways including dealkylation pathway 4 and oxidation pathway 6 of piperazine ring were intensified by nom 3 7 relationship between nom properties and their effects on cip decomposition by uva led and uva led tio2 processes the apparent formation kinetics of tps k app were simulated by an exponential equation when plotting normalized abundance of tps below their maxima versus lnt r 2 0 85 fig s11 k app for tp306 tp330a tp330b tp348a and tp348b under uva led and uva led tio2 were not calculated due to the disappearance of these tps or limited datasets available for model simulation comparison of k app in the absence and presence of nom is shown in fig 7 in the presence of nom k app values of tp316a tp316b and tp346 were decreased while tp245 and tp263 were increased under uva led fig 7a under uva led tio2 k app values of tp263 tp291 tp334a tp334b and tp362 were promoted by nom fig 7b in addition the inhibitory effect of different nom isolates on k app tp316a k app tp316b and k app tp346 under uva led followed the order of saha srha srnom therefore saha showed the strongest inhibitory effect on tps formation from defluorination pathways including oxidation of quinolone ring and piperazine ring during photolysis compared to srha and srnom they are likely attributed to their different abilities of light attenuation and radical quenching in contrast the enhancement in k app tp291 k app tp334a k app tp334b and k app tp362 under uva led tio2 followed the order of srnom srha saha probably resulted from their composition dependent photoinductive abilities these results highlight the variations of nom characteristics in affecting the formation of tps during photolysis and photocatalysis compared to saha and srha srnom has higher o c ratio and more carboxyl groups which are known as the characteristics of photoreactive chromophores zhan et al 2006 therefore srnom may have higher photoinductive ability than saha and srha resulting in stronger promotion in dealkylation and oxidation of piperazine ring as evidenced by enhanced k app values of tp245 tp291 tp334a tp334b and tp362 this finding is consistent with a previous study by xu et al 2011 who found that srnom exhibited higher photosensitization effect than saha and srha on photolytic decomposition of amoxicillin under simulated sunlight in addition strong positive relationships were observed between k app tp245 k app tp362 and o c p 05 k app tp291 and carboxyl content of nom p 05 and k app tp245 k app tp362 and carboxyl content of nom p 01 table 3 these results confirm that o c and carboxyl content may serve as possible surrogates of photoinductive ability of nom moreover most of k app values of tp245 tp291 tp334a tp334b and tp362 were negatively correlated with suva254 and positively correlated with e2 e3 and fi p 05 under uva led irradiation negative relationship between k app and suva254 and positive relationship k app and fi were found for tp288 tp316a tp316b tp344 and tp346 p 05 additionally e2 e3 was correlated with k app tp288 and k app tp344 these results reveal that suva254 e2 e3 and fi values of nom are also important indicators of the reactivity of different nom isolates during photolysis and photocatalysis 4 conclusion the mechanistic effects of saha srha and srnom on cip decomposition were investigated in uva led and uva led tio2 systems photolytic decomposition kinetics of cip were insignificantly affected by three nom isolates p 05 while photocatalytic decomposition kinetics was strongly retarded the degrees of inhibition on cip photocatalysis followed the order of saha 49 6 srha 29 9 srnom 21 2 mainly due to the differences in their oh quenching abilities in addition the release of f ion from cip photocatalysis was inhibited by nom with the order of saha srha srnom the degrees of inhibitory effect and oh quenching abilities were consistent with the orders of suva254 values and nom aromaticity saha srha srnom the formation of tps of cip were also affected by nom addition in both uva led and uva led tio2 systems transformation pathways of hydroxylation and defluorination were generally suppressed by nom but those of piperazine ring dealkylation and oxidation were favored by nom with enhanced k app values of tp245 tp263 tp291 tp334a tp334b and tp362 srnom showed stronger promoting effect than srha and saha on these k app values except for tp263 indicating the importance of nom characteristics in influencing the transformation pathways of antibiotics generally k app values of most tps were positively correlated with e2 e3 ratios and fi of different nom isolates p 05 whereas they were negatively correlated to suva254 values p 05 therefore optical and physicochemical properties of nom are important parameters to be taken into account in evaluating their influence on photolysis and photocatalysis acknowledgements we acknowledge the financial support from the singapore peking oxford research enterprise the economic development board singapore
