isotopes biogeochemical processes 1 introduction karst stratum covers 1 3 of the earth s terrestrial parts and approximately 25 of the world s population relies on karst groundwater as the primary source for drinking and irrigation olarinoye et al 2020 in china karst accounts for 14 of the country s land surface and nearly a quarter of the country s groundwater resources is of karstic origin yuan 1994 karst aquifers constituting the main potable water resource is of heightened significance due to the increasing water demands and depletion of water resources gao 2016 karst aquifers exhibit heterogeneous distribution characteristics of porosity including solution sinkholes fissures conduits caves faults and fractures which act as large pathways for subsurface flow in the karstic terrain and permit a quick introduction of contaminants the particular significance of the susceptibility of karst aquifers to degradation makes it imperative to acquire adequate knowledge of the karst groundwater hydrology the karstic hydrological system has been studied extensively with main focus on groundwater vulnerability assessment klaas et al 2017 shrestha et al 2017 contaminant

hydrogeochemical evolution jiang et al 2018 pu et al 2012 shamsi et al 2019 yang et al 2019 however to data little work has been done on the seasonal and spatial distribution of groundwater hydrogeochemistry without such knowledge we cannot assess accurately the processes controlling groundwater evolution in time and space and their effect degrees further understanding natural biogeochemical and anthropogenic processes taking part in hydrochemical evolution has great implications for groundwater systems and effective evaluation and management of water resources husic et al 2019 mikac et al 2011 rivett et al 2008 shanxi province is the most typical representative of northern karst regions in china with over 75 of the land surface occupied by carbonate terrains liang et al 2013 qian et al 2003 there are abundant coal resources in the area the most distinctive geologic feature of coal bearing strata overlying carbonate rocks renders karst aquifers highly vulnerable to irreversible influences through coal mining activities this is most pronounced in jinci spring area which has a long history of coal mining activity with a total of 57 coal mines and a coal bearing area of 1598 km2 karst aquifers in jinci are also greatly impact by large scale intensive domestic industrial and agricultural activities rapid economic growth urbanization and industrialization has led to wastewater emissions coal mine drainage and untreated wastewater are reinjected into rivers and affect groundwater quality through surface leakage wang et al 2019 which prevail in karst areas

and 14c dna sequence analysis as well as hydrochemical parameters the objectives of this study are to 1 elucidate the variations of groundwater hydrogeochemistry and microbial community during surface water leakage and the controlling biogeochemical processes and 2 quantitatively assess the influence extent of surface water leakage on groundwater this study would further the understanding and management of the karst aquifers 2 study area located in the central part of shanxi province jinci karst catchment covers an area of over 2000 km2 stretching from latitudes 37 33 to 38 19 n and longitudes 111 54 to 112 33 e fig 1 as the largest river in the catchment fenhe river flows from eastward and then turns southward after reaching the low permeability quaternary formation along the eastern margin of the catchment with a population of over 4 million the study area has a typical temperate continental climate controlled by semi arid monsoon annual precipitation in the catchment

sediments q the study area shows a wide elevation range 752 2160 m ordovician carbonates are widely distributed in the northern and western boundaries where syncline in dustpan shape leans to the south thereby producing a recharge area for groundwater due to the existence of shiqianfeng syncline carboniferous permian coal bearing sandstone and shale outcrop across both southern and northern sides of the fenhe river the well developed gujiao fault zones extending nee sww direction are hydraulic permeable with steep inclination and pass through fenhe river surface water coal mine drainage and contaminants from other anthropogenic sources input into groundwater via these faulting structures and or river channel leakage the length of main leakage sections is 44 km from luojiaqu to zhenchengdi section i ii iii iv and v fig 1 and from hekou to saoshi section vi vii and viii fig 1 with 70 80 of the river water leaking into groundwater iv leakage section is considered to be the largest connection of the river and jinci spring table s2 wang et al 2019 groundwater as the most important local source of water supply occurs in three major aquifers the shallow quaternary aquifers karst aquifers of ordovician carbonate rocks and fractured bedrock aquifers being the main aquifers in the jinci karst catchment the middle ordovician limestone strata contains interlayers of thin lenses of gypsum groundwater moves from northwest to southeast with precipitation being the main recharge source and penetrating the bared carbonate formations to the north of the fenhe river additional recharges occur due to the leakage from overlying aquifers and the fenhe river water the regional major discharge points are the jinci springs and the pingquan springs fig 1 artificial exploitation and subsurface flows into quaternary aquifers in taiyuan basin are other discharge ways 3 methods 3 1 sampling and geochemical analysis to delineate the seasonal and spatial distribution of groundwater at jinci hydrochemical sampling campaigns were conducted over two seasons with a total of 53 water samples collected in september 2017 wet season and in april 2018 dry season fig 1 five surface water samples were collected along the fenhe river in each of the season where leakage had been detected among the seventeen karst groundwater samples collected in each of the season five samples were from wells situated close to the river leakage sections another twelve samples were collected along the regional groundwater flow paths eight groundwater of quaternary aquifers were sampled from the nearby of the fenhe river in dry season one rainfall sample was collected in gujiao county in wet season water samples were collected in polythene bottles that had been thoroughly washed with deionized water and the extracted water three times li et al 2019 samples of surface and ground water were filtered through 0 22 µm cellulose acetate membranes on site during sampling

hydrochemistry the minimum maximum and median values for physicochemical and isotopic characteristics analyzed for surface and ground water in both dry and wet seasons have been presented along with their standard deviation in table 1 figs 2 and 3 hydrochemical parameters for rain water sample collected in wet season are shown in table s1 the rainfall sample has ph value of 7 84 with total dissolved solids tds of 56 mg l typically belonging to na ca hco3 type water almost all the parameters in river and groundwater fluctuate over a wide range in both the seasons the median values of temperature t in wet seasons for both river water and groundwater are much higher than those in dry seasons fig 2 a this is due to the high surface temperature in wet seasons which occurs in summer in the study area river water and groundwater samples are generally neutral to slightly alkaline with ph values ranging from 7 67 to 8 5 and from 7 01 to 9 21 respectively fig 2 b in comparison to the dry season a slight increase is observed in the wet season as evident from the median value of ph 8 23 and 7 57 for river water and karst groundwater respectively enrichment of ph in the wet season is likely due to supply of high ph recharge water from rain subramanian saxena 1983 tds values of river water have smaller extent variation ranging from 485 mg l to 911 mg l and 280 mg l to 556 mg l in the dry and wet season respectively fig 2 c increase of tds in the dry season is most likely due to that salts are accumulated by the evaporation effect extensively varying ranges and high standard deviation in groundwater tds for both dry and wet seasons indicate the spatial variability of dissolution and dilution during recharging water infiltrating into the subsurface as well as of surface water infiltration in addition to high water rock interactions discharge of surface contaminants during the infiltration and percolation of rainfall partly result in much enriched groundwater tds values in the wet season in the river water samples lower concentrations are found for major ions in wet seasons due to the dilution by enriched amounts of precipitation additionally high median values and wide ranges of na and cl are observed in the river waters for both the seasons fig 2 d and i in stark contrast to the river water karst groundwater show higher concentrations of most of the chemical components analyzed in the wet season than the dry season this apparently suggests the enhancement of solute load due to the rising water table in wet seasons which dissolves more salts from the soils in the groundwater ca and mg are generally the dominant cation with wide ranges fig 2 e and f reflecting varying degrees of carbonates dissolution concentrations of na are commonly low in median values but high in terms of range the higher contents of na in some groundwater are also accompanied by elevated cl bicarbonate and sulfate dominate over chloride in groundwater irrespective of the seasons fig 2 g i groundwater so4 2 values span over a wide range in both wet and dry seasons probably due to contribution from dissolution of gypsum occurring locally in the stratum 4 2 oxygen and hydrogen isotopes the stable isotopic behaviors of surface and ground water have been studies in both dry and wet seasons surface waters are characterized by enriched isotopic compositions with δ18o and δ2h values ranging from 9 4 to 7 9 and from 66 6 to 60 5 respectively fig 3 a and b the heavier isotopic signatures are indicative of strong evaporative enrichment of water from mean isotopic compositions it is clear to note that the surface waters become remarkably enriched in the wet season it can be reasonably explained by the mutual effect of temperature and rainfall amount with the former predominating over the latter the large variation of isotopes in wet season show the fast replenishment of river water during the wet season period more depleted compositions of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are found in karst groundwater in both season δ18o 10 1 to 8 6 δ2h 72 5 to 64 3 in dry season and δ18o 10 1 to 8 4 δ2h 72 6 to 64 3 in wet season unlike the surface waters little difference in isotopic signatures is observed in karst groundwater in dry and wet seasons the stable isotopic composition in the quaternary groundwater vary from 9 6 to 7 7 and from 70 3 to 60 9 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the median values of quaternary groundwater isotopic compositions are similar to those of river waters therefore from the point of view of stable isotopic compositions quaternary groundwater has a close relationship with river water 4 3 strontium and sr isotopes the strontium concentrations of surface water samples along the fenhe river range from 801 µg l to 1330 µg l in dry season and from 456 µg l to 846 µg l in wet season fig 2 j the sr isotopic compositions of river waters are constantly high with ratios varying from 0 71169 to 0 71222 in dry season and from 0 71169 to 0 71218 in wet season fig 3 c lowest 87sr 86sr ratios are observed in karst groundwater samples median 0 71104 in dry season and 0 71038 in wet season with high variable sr concentrations 257 µg l 7518 µg l in dry season and 230 µg l 6102 µg l in wet season it is also surprising to note that high 87sr 86sr signatures up to 0 7119 in dry season and 0 71185 in wet season are recognized in some karst groundwater in the study area the higher than expected 87sr 86sr ratios in groundwater from carbonate aquifers 0 707 0 710 gao et al 2019 are reasonably explained by the mixing of water with a more radiogenic 87sr 86sr ratio the median value of strontium in quaternary groundwater is 941 µg l with the variation over a smaller range accompanied highest 87sr 86sr ratios up to 0 71285 in these groundwater are identical with the dominance of silicate weathering 4 4 isotopic composition of dic isotopic behaviors of dic of surface water and karst groundwater have been studied for the wet season distinct variations of δ13c are observed in surface waters with the values varying from 12 2 to 5 6 fig 3 d most of the surface water samples have δ13c values in the range of 10 0 to 6 0 which is the expected range of δ13c values given by weathering of calcite the lowest δ13c value 12 2 in surface water is presumably due to contamination process of anthropogenic activities mediated by microorganisms caesar et al 2019 zoppini et al 2018 karst groundwater have δ13c values of 10 4 to 6 6 within the range of those of calcite dissolution such wide range of δ13c values in these groundwater implied different intensity of corrosion effect and or distinct mixing ratios with fenhe river water considering the similar δ13c value range in surface waters 4 5 sulfur isotope of dissolved sulfate sulfur isotopic compositions of dissolved sulfate have been analyzed for ten water samples in the wet season including one surface water from fenhe reservoir and nine karst groundwater the δ34s value in the surface water is 7 7 fig 3 e karst groundwater show large sulfur isotopic variations 1 8 17 3 although the median δ34s value is similar to that in the surface water 4 6 water ages the 14c age in surface waters range from modern to 150 years representing very recent recharge fig 3 f karst groundwater ages are very variable 60 11 085 years with a median value of 3250 years most of the groundwater samples have 14c age in the range of 3080 7410 years with the oldest 11 085 years in the discharge area and the youngest 60 1845 years along the leakage section of fenhe river 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater recharge residence times and flow paths stable isotopes of the water molecule have widely been employed as natural tracers in hydrogeologic studies binder et al 2019 montalván et al 2017 generally it is considered that the stable isotopic composition of oxygen and hydrogen are transported conservatively in aquifers their variations occur due to evaporation rainfall recharge climate and mixing cartwright et al 2010 clark and fritz 1997 kim et al 2020 hence δ18o and δ2h can provide valuable information on water cycles sources of water and solutes recharge conditions flow patterns residence times as well as surface ground water interactions in groundwater systems the relationships between δ18o and δ2h for surface and ground water samples are shown in fig 4 along with global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and local meteoric water line lmwl jia et al 2015 for comparison the distribution of δ18o and δ2h in surface and ground waters is generally close to gmwl and lmwl suggesting a meteoric origin of water in the study area river waters especially several samples in wet seasons tend to be isotopically enriched indicating a typical evaporation pattern evaporation line el δ2h 3 61δ18o 32 76 majority of groundwater in both seasons have relatively depleted isotopic signatures a most noticed finding is that several karst groundwater no 1 2 10 and quaternary groundwater samples no 3 27 have an enrichment of δ18o and δ2h that are similar to river water samples conferring the sampling sites of these groundwater the similarity in δ18o and δ2h values for river water and these groundwater is likely due to high angle fractures and joints structure along the fenhe river and reflects rapid recharge of the groundwater both in ordovician aquifers and unconsolidated quaternary aquifers by the evaporated river water as a mean of water dating carbon 14 activity coupled with oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are applied to provide additional information for groundwater cycles ages and recharge in the study area fig 5 groundwater samples from the northern highland recharge area are relatively young 14c ages 3000 years with the most depleted δ18o and δ2h values this is most likely due to that at higher altitude groundwater is supplied by precipitation with depleted isotopes which moves quickly to bared carbonate stratum similar 14c ages and relatively higher δ18o and δ2h values are observed in most of the groundwater from the flow through area it is also noticed that three groundwater samples no 1 2 10 show remarkable enrichment of δ18o and δ2h and apparent younger 14c ages 60 1845 years the close agreement among oxygen hydrogen and carbon 14 values for these groundwater and surface water signifies recently communicating with surficial environment mostly likely the fenhe river karst features e g solution sinkholes fissures conduits caves faults and fractures may provide large pathways for the downward leakage of surface water groundwater with residence times of 5460 11 085 years from the discharge area in the western border mount zone are associated with relatively depleted oxygen and hydrogen values this is most pronounced in groundwater samples no 14 16 and 18 with much older ages these characteristics reflect that other than modern precipitation in the northern recharge area additional recharge sources from higher altitude and or palaeo climate occur in the jinci karst catchment during the last 7000 11 000 years 5 2 surface water leakage and the input of nutrients major ion chemistry of water samples can be important indicators for determining solute sources describing water evolution as well as interpreting histories of mixing in karst areas chandrajith et al 2016 koit et al 2020 trilinear piper diagram is presented for the water samples in the study area fig 6 chemical spatial evolution of waters along flow direction in both wet and dry seasons is also shown for furthering understanding of the interaction between surface and ground water fig 7 groundwater samples in both seasons are dominated by ca mg hco3 and so4 accounting for up to 90 of total cations and anions most karst groundwater evolves from ca mg hco3 to ca mg hco3 so4 and or ca mg so4 hco3 type along groundwater flow direction groundwater in the quaternary aquifer is mainly ca hco3 so4 type surface water samples in the study area in both seasons are either ca na hco3 so4 cl or ca na mg so4 hco3 type with na and cl comprising up to 35 and 26 of the total cations and anions respectively this pattern of data clearly shows the additional inputs of na and cl into the surface water halite dissolution which provides substantial sodium and chloride can be discounted on the grounds that there has been no field data reporting halite outcropping in the rock formations the other possibility involving na and cl enrichment is the anthropogenic inputs e g municipal sewage the discharge of large amounts of municipal sewage induced by rapid urbanization contributes substantially to the sodium and chloride contamination in river water distinct differences in na and cl contents between surface and ground water therefore can be indicative of interrelationships among water samples it is interesting to note that close to and or within the range of surface water samples on the piper diagram are karst groundwater samples no 1 2 5 7 and 10 with higher sodium and chloride contents these five samples are located along the fenhe river channel where widely distributed soluble carbonates of middle ordovician are exposed to the surface thereby providing favorable conditions for surface downward leakage if no mixing happens to these karst groundwater samples along its flow path their sodium and chloride concentrations should be between those in groundwater from the recharge and discharge areas following a normal evolution trends of major ion chemistry under isolated hydrogeological conditions chebotarev 1955 wang et al 2001 the most reasonable explanation for the enrichment of sodium and chloride as well as salinity contents figs 6 and 7 a f is that these karst groundwater are inordinately recharged by fenhe river waters via faulting structures and or river channel leakage this hypothesis is also reinforced by the large river leakages in these places 0 11 m3 s to 1 13 m3 s wang et al 2019 table s2 quaternary groundwater sample no 3 is also characterized by an elevated na concentration with no accompanying increase in cl value the anisochronous increase of na and cl is probably mainly due to cation exchange process another exception to the quaternary groundwater evolution sequence is sample no 27 with highest tds ca and so4 contents fig 7 a b and g j this chemical composition seems to be caused by that the water arises from gypsiferous layers and dissolves substantial gypsum other than dissolved constituents nutrients flux via surface water leakages into groundwater brauns et al 2016 schoumans et al 2014 spatial distribution patterns of the nutrient concentrations along water flow direction for the wet season sampling fig 8 b and d show that peak levels of doc and no3 n both occur at the leakage section along fenhe river their distributions in these localities are in good agreement with those in river waters concentrations of these nutrients drop dramatically both upstream and downstream reflecting the inputs of nutrients mainly through leakage section into groundwater in contrast there is a general decline of dic concentrations along the leakage section fig 8 a and b illustrating the probable interaction between organic doc and inorganic carbon source dic at these sites this trend is most noticeable in the wet season when the interaction has been enhanced due to the enriched amounts of precipitation nutrient no3 n patterns in dry season are similar with higher concentrations fig 8 c nh4 n and no2 n are lower than detect limitation in surface and ground waters for both seasons leakage flux of fenhe river is qualitatively assessed by the sr isotope 87sr 86sr balance it was assumed that groundwater sr isotopic composition is identical to that of the host aquifer rocks and is absence of isotopic fractionation during natural processes i e precipitation evaporation and biological uptake in the environment sahib et al 2016 leakage flux of fenhe river p for 87sr 86sr mass balance is calculated by the following eq 1 1 p 87 s r 86 s r karst 87 s r 86 s r sample 87 s r 86 s r sample 87 s r 86 s r river where p is the leakage flux of fenhe river 87sr 86sr river is the strontium isotopic composition of fenhe river water 87sr 86sr karst represents the strontium isotopic composition of karst groundwater in the northern recharge area and 87sr 86sr sample is the strontium isotopic composition in possible affected groundwater calculated leakage flux for the possible affected groundwater no 1 2 7 and 10 range from 61 to 87 enforcing the effect of fenhe river leakage on these groundwater hekou county no 10 shows the most serious leakage with 87 leakage flux from the fenhe river it is worth noting that due to the probable effect of other factors 87sr 86sr could only be a qualitative index for the leakage flux of river water 5 3 hydrogeochemical processes involved in karst areas the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater are primarily determined by dissolution precipitation of carbonates and sulfate minerals which should be a research priority related dissolution precipitation reactions can be expressed as follows 1 caco 3 co 2 h 2 o ca 2 2 hco 3 2 camg co 3 2 2 co 2 2 h 2 o ca 2 mg 2 4 hco 3 3 caco 3 camg co 3 2 3 co 2 3 h 2 o 2 ca 2 mg 2 6 hco 3 4 caso 4 ca 2 so 4 2 in order to evaluate the dissolution precipitation reactions in karstic groundwater molar ratios of mg2 ca2 so4 2 along groundwater flow direction are present in fig 9 here we define calcium involved in the carbonate reactions by subtracting the amount so4 2 from the total ca2 deficit of ca2 and or extra sources of so4 2 are indicated by ca2 so4 2 0 theoretically if dolomite dissolution is the sole source of mg2 in groundwater the molar ratio of mg2 ca2 so4 2 should be equal to 1 if the dissolution of calcite and dolomite have occurred simultaneously mg2 ca2 so4 2 ratio is close to 0 5 in this study negative mg2 ca2 so4 2 ratios in river waters in dry season fig 9 a are most likely due to the emission of high sulfur mine drainages generated by the widely distributed coal mines along the fenhe river heavy rainfall in the wet season attenuates the influence of coal mines on river waters where relatively lower so4 2 ratios and positive mg2 ca2 so4 2 ratios are detected fig 7 j and fig 9 b groundwater samples in the recharge area lie consistently along the line of mg2 ca2 so4 2 0 5 indicating the crucial role of calcite and dolomite dissolution to groundwater calcium and magnesium this is consistent with jia et al 2017 who report dissolution of calcite and dolomite being the major hydrogeochemical processes based on mass balance and reaction path modeling most of the points in flow through area spread on the line of mg2 ca2 so4 2 1 reflecting the dominance of dolomite dissolution while several points in the fenhe river leakage section lie beyond the 1 0 line the most evident possibility for the elevated mg2 ca2 so4 2 ratio in these groundwater is the mixing of high so4 2 river water it is interesting to note that the most negative mg2 ca2 so4 2 ratios are found in groundwater samples in the discharge area suggesting additional so4 2 input sources and or a deficiency of ca2 apart from gypsum dissolution cation exchange between adsorbed na in the rock and dissolved ca2 in the water can be discounted on the grounds that the calcium deficiency is not accompanied by an increase in na ca ratios fig 9 c and d mine drainage is likely to be a significant source for the elevated sulfate contents considering the widely distributed coal fields in the discharge area molar ratios of mg2 hco3 can provide additional insight into the sources of magnesium in groundwater according to the eqs 2 and 3 the molar mg2 hco3 ratio of dolomite dissolution and congruent dissolution of calcite and dolomite is 1 4 and 1 6 respectively river water samples in both seasons display high mg hco3 ratio 1 4 fig 9 e and f suggesting a potential source of mg probably anthropogenic other than carbonates dissolution karst groundwater in the northern high mountain areas and several quaternary groundwater samples fall around the line with mg2 hco3 ratio of 1 6 reinforcing the dominance of congruent dissolution of calcite and dolomite at recharge areas along groundwater flow direction the mg2 hco3 ratio continuously increases most points in the flow through area lie along or close to the 1 4 line reflecting that the concentration of magnesium and bicarbonate are largely controlled by dolomite dissolution several outliers located in the fenhe river leakage section show relatively higher mg2 hco3 ratio and follow the similar trend of river water supporting the leakage of river water consistent with the assumption discussed above karst groundwater in the discharge area are characterized by the highest mg2 hco3 ratios for both seasons demonstrating the extra sources of mg and or attenuation of hco3 in groundwater the most evident possibility is that dolomitization may occur that the mg2 is gradually released due to the common ion effect of calcium presence of gypsum within the carbonates may lead to oversaturation and precipitation of calcite and subsequent under saturation and dissolution of dolomite appelo and postma 2005 a process known as dedolomitization the net result of the dedolomitization is the conversion of dolomite to calcite in the rock and the enrichment of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 concentrations in the water 5 4 anthropogenic influences elevated contents of sodium in the water are ubiquitous in urban areas of many countries and therefore can be indicative of natural and anthropogenic inputs into the surface ground water system in general water contaminated by sludge wastewater show high na concentrations application of extensively used nacl in agricultural seed selection would lead to the enrichment of na in surface and ground water additionally acid coal mines with relatively lower ph values is more prone to dissolve na minerals as a consequence water affected by discharge and or leaking recharge of coal mining drainage display high na contents therefore variations of na sr2 versus 87sr 86sr are demonstrated to reveal the effect of anthropogenic activities on surface and ground water hydrogeochemistry most groundwater from quaternary aquifer display a general positive correlation between na sr2 and more radiogenic 87sr 86sr ratios fig 10 a implying a major contribution of silicate weathering majority of the karst groundwater are characterized by a relatively low 87sr 86sr signature coupled with low na sr2 ratio figs 10 a and 11 b signifying the extensive dissolution of carbonates this is most pronounced in waters from the discharge areas along flow path several karst groundwater no 6 12 and 21 in the flow through area evolves from carbonates dominated 87sr 86sr to a relatively higher 87sr 86sr with no accompanying variation of na sr2 ratio probably due to seepage of water in gullies all the surface water and karst groundwater located in the fenhe river leakage section in both seasons reveal large changes in na sr2 ratio without significant variation in 87sr 86sr fig 10 a and b highlighting anthropogenic sources of na and sr2 in the water the sulfur isotope is a useful tool in elucidating the influences of anthropogenic activities on groundwater mahlknecht et al 2017 otero and soler 2002 in general characteristics of sulfate contents and sulfur isotopic composition in groundwater are determined by its origins as well as by the formation mechanisms dissolution of evaporates such as gypsum anhydrite will produce elevated sulfate levels combined with highest δ34s values ranging from 10 to 30 brenot et al 2007 claypool et al 1980 whereas sulfate isotopic composition for sedimentary rocks span over a wide range δ34s 40 to 50 sulfate minerals dissolution does not alter the original δ34s signature in groundwater however the pristine sulfate isotopic composition can be modified by oxidation reduction process the oxidation of sulfide i e pyrite frequently happening in coal mines would induce increasing so4 concentrations whilst decreasing the remaining so4 in δ34s values dogramaci et al 2017 harrison and thode 1957 a graph of δ34s so4 for the studied water samples is illustrated in fig 10 c along with some limited area on sulfate and sulfur isotopic compositions for gypsum so4 2 2500 mg l 3000 mg l δ34s 20 and coal mine drainage so4 2 762 mg l δ34s 1 0 most groundwater so4 and δ34s values progressively increase along flow paths towards the end member of gypsum dissolution in the right upper corner this enrichment gives clues to the growing role of gypsum dissolution in the groundwater sulfate chemistry along the direction of flow the negative saturation index for gypsum and its simultaneous increase with increasing so4 concentrations are also supporting the major involvement of gypsum dissolution fig 10 d another interesting finding is that three karst groundwater in the flow through area no 7 10 and 21 characterized by relatively lower δ34s values 1 8 4 7 deviate from other groundwater the so4 and δ34s characteristics in these three groundwater delineate a distribution compatible with a mixing process with the sulfide oxidation end member evidencing that the karst aquifers have been polluted by sulfur enriched coal mine drainages this reasoning concurs with the observations of pu et al 2012 who report the groundwater contamination in chongqing karst areas by coal mine wastewaters assuming no other process is modifying the δ34s characteristics quantitative assessment of the significance that coal mine drainages have in these karst groundwater is obtained by the sulfur isotopic mass balance the calculated values of coal mine drainage contribution are 15 0 36 4 and 23 5 for no 7 10 and 21 respectively groundwater sample no 10 with the highest value was found in hekou village along fenhe river the infiltration and overflow of coal mine drainages in the widely distributed coal industry areas nearby induce the pollution of karst water eventually through the downstream carbonate seepage section or other ways due to the distinct δ13c values in the various carbon reservoirs in some cases the δ13c of dic can be applied to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic sources generally weathering of carbonates would produce a much higher δ13c values of 2 to 5 li et al 2010 however oxidation and decomposition of easily biodegradable organic matter occurring in domestic sewage lead to a depletion of δ13c values 12 5 wachniew 2006 additionally domestic sewage is characterized by an enriched oxygen and hydrogen isotopic signature that is more highly evaporated hence a δ18o and δ2h δ13c approach is applied to give additional information for the anthropogenic inputs into the jinci karst system majority of the studied groundwater show δ13c composition enrichment along the direction of flow with δ18o and δ2h values increase initially and decrease afterwards fig 10 e and f this trend illustrates carbonate weathering prevailing in the study area it is interesting to note that three water samples groundwater no 10 in the flow through area groundwater no 15 in the discharge zone and surface water no 30 have relatively lower δ13c values 12 2 to 10 4 which are similar to those of samples in the recharge area if no mixing dilution occurs in these three water samples their δ13c values should be more and more enriched along flow paths towards the discharge zone this depletion of δ13c values and the associated high oxygen and hydrogen isotopic contents point towards the addition of isotopically light carbon 13 from another sources most probably domestic sewage which could also contribute to enriched heavier δ18o and δ2h values unregulated disposal of domestic sewage via percolation reclamation poses greatest threats to surface and ground water quality if other influential processes are ruled out the δ13c values in the two groundwater samples can be achieved by mixing 3 9 8 6 of domestic sewage and 91 4 96 1 of natural origin surface water sample no 30 located in densely populated gujiao city is more influenced by the disposal of wastewater effluent with an input up to 69 of domestic sewage considering the absence of natural nitrate in most geologic formations higher no3 concentrations in groundwater generally indicated contamination from agricultural practices and served as an important indicator for groundwater pollution heaton 1986 in contrast to those areas with scarce agricultural practices surface and ground water samples collected from jinci contain low to medium high no3 concentrations the hco3 normalized values no3 hco3 are relatively higher in surface water and parts of quaternary groundwater fig 9 g and h reflecting their vulnerability to agricultural point and non point pollution this affection is more pronounced in dry season with higher no3 hco3 ratios detected most likely due to the less frequently dilution compared with that of wet season limited karst groundwater along the fenhe river channel with no3 10 mg l are more or less affected by the agricultural contamination 5 5 biogeochemical processes involved microbial community composition of karst groundwater samples are also elaborated for further interpretation of biogeochemical processes involved in the jinci karst system in this study during the leakage of river water and domestic sewage along the fenhe river the accompanied inputs of nutrients doc and no3 n could induce the enhancement of microbial activities in the karst water aquifer system this assumption is supported by the composition of microbial community at the phylum and family levels for karst water samples in leakage section no 2 and non leakage area no 22 fig 11 remarkable distinctions in bacterial community in phylum level are observed between no 2 and no 22 although proteobacteria being the most abundance phylum in both samples its relative abundance is lower in no 2 than that in no 22 correspondingly other bacterial phyla e g firmicutes actinobacteria nitrospirae bacteroidetes acidobacteria and a uncultured lineage designated od1 occur at higher abundances in the groundwater sample from leakage section heat maps are further drawn to describe the distribution of the predominant families in the samples fig 11 b the deeper color represents the higher abundance dominant bacterial families in this study are clustered into three groups both samples show similar lower abundance of families in group one in contrast the richness of the families in group two and three shows significant differences in no 2 and no 22 samples i relative abundance of families in group two is much higher in no 2 66 1 than that in no 22 13 4 ii pseudomonadaceae group three occurs at much lower abundance in no 2 2 5 than that in no 22 83 6 as a whole groundwater samples in leakage and non leakage sections display distinct signatures of microbial community enhancement of microbial activities at the leakage section is expressed in two ways on the one hand growth of heterotrophic microorganisms is promoted by the utilization and conversion of available doc into dic farjalla et al 2006 this interpretation is corroborated by the accompanied decrease of doc values with increasing dic contents at the leakage section on the other hand no3 n can be utilized by microorganisms for dual purposes i nitrogen source nitrate can be used as a nitrogen nutrient by part of bacteria actinomycetes and mycete a process known as assimilatory nitrate reduction fariduddin et al 2018 no 3 nh 4 organic nitrogen on i respiratory electron acceptor denitrifying bacteria can mediate reduction of nitrate into nitrogen releasing the energy needed by vital activities known as denitrification li et al 2019 no 3 no 2 n 2 under anaerobic conditions sulfate in the environment can be utilized and reduced to hydrogen sulfide by microbes which is termed as bacteria sulfate reduction bsr rasool et al 2016 however in this study karst groundwater samples are collected from bared and or shallow buried carbonate areas fig 1 measured dissolved oxygen do in the samples reflect slightly aerobic conditions in the groundwater system throughout the year evidencing that no bsr takes place in the leakage section this reasoning is also supported by the concentration and isotopic composition of dissolved so4 in groundwater since 32s of solid and dissolved sulfur compounds are preferentially consumed compared to 34s during bsr and bacterial processes associated with the recycling of sulfide δ34s values of residual sulfate gradually increase with an association of so4 depletion as reduction proceeds in the jinci karst system elevated δ34s values in some groundwater are not accompanied by depletion of so4 concentrations illustrating bsr being inhibited in these bared and or shallow buried karst areas during the utilization of carbon and nitrogen sources by microbes bioweathering processes of minerals e g carbonates gypsum and silicates intensify significantly thereby promoting the release of dissolved constituents in aquifers to a great extent and modifying the characteristics of groundwater hydrochemistry 6 conclusions integrated analysis of multiple isotopic tracers and hydrogeochemical parameters provides important information on groundwater residence time recharge hydrogeochemical evolution in time and space controlling biogeochemical processes surface water leakage as well as anthropogenic influences in jinci karst water system major conclusions are drawn as follows 1 groundwater samples from the northern highland recharge area have relatively young 14c ages 3000 years with the most depleted δ18o and δ2h values indicating modern precipitation recharge at higher altitude several karst groundwater along the fenhe river channel show remarkable enrichment of oxygen and hydrogen and young apparent 14c ages 60 1845 years signifying recently communicating with surficial environment oldest 14c ages up to 11 085 years together with depleted oxygen and hydrogen compositions in the groundwater from discharge area show that apart from modern precipitation in the northern recharge area additional recharge sources from higher altitude and or palaeo climate occur in the catchment 2 the hydrogeochemical compositions of surface and ground water are dominated by ca mg hco3 and so4 lower concentrations are found for major ions in surface waters in wet season due to the dilution by enriched amounts of precipitation whilst karst groundwater show higher concentrations of most of the chemical components in the wet season resulted from the enhancement of solute load due to the rising water table based on major chemical compositions the hydrogeochemical evolution of surface and ground water in the study area are largely controlled by simultaneous dissolution of calcite and dolomite with gypsiferous layers in karst aquifers with solutes deriving from silicate weathering limited on quaternary groundwater evidenced by highest mg hco3 ratios dedolomitization precipitation of calcite and dissolution of dolomite driven by the dissolution of gypsum occurs locally mainly in groundwater from the discharge area of the system 3 surface water could leak vertically along river channel inputting dissolved constituents and nutrients into groundwater trilinear diagram shows that several groundwater along the fenhe river channel are characterized by elevated na and cl and clustered around the surface waters reflecting the influence of leaking recharge on their chemistry additionally surface water leakage induces the variation of microbial community in phylum and family level with the main phylum proteobacteria and family pseudomonadaceae being less abundant calculated river water leakage flux for the possible affected groundwater range from 61 to 87 with the highest serious leakage found in hekou county 4 surface water leakage could induce discharge of coal mine drainages and unregulated disposal of domestic sewage into the groundwater system affected groundwater samples along the fenhe river would show relatively lower δ34s values depleted δ13c compositions and enriched δ18o and δ2h values based on the δ34s and δ13c mass balance human activity in the study area contributes to groundwater with 15 36 4 inputs of coal mine drainage and 3 9 8 6 of domestic sewage 5 river channel and geological characteristics such as faults and synclines offer favorable paths for the recharge of surface water and contaminants from anthropogenic activities into the groundwater influencing the overall water chemistry credit authorship contribution statement chengcheng li conceptualization

associate editor surface water leakage and anthropogenic inputs into groundwater prevail in karst areas in china in this paper surface and ground water were collected and multiple isotopic tracers were integrated with hydrogeochemical parameters to characterize the residence time recharge history biogeochemical processes surface leakage and anthropogenic influences in jinci karst system most karst groundwater have depleted δ18o and δ2h values together with 14c ages of 3000 11 085 years several karst groundwater along the fenhe river channel show remarkable enrichment of oxygen and hydrogen and young apparent 14c ages 60 1845 years signifying recently communicating with surficial environment major anthropogenic components in the surface water na cl and no3 and nutrients leak into groundwater along fenhe river additionally surface water leakage changes the microbial community in phylum and family levels for groundwater the calculated river water leakage flux for the possible affected groundwater range from 61 to 87 with the highest serious leakage found in hekou county dominated by ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 the hydrogeochemical evolution of surface and ground water in the study area are largely controlled by dissolution of calcite dolomite with gypsum and dedolomitization discharge of coal mine drainages and unregulated disposal of domestic sewage also contribute substantially to the groundwater hydrogeochemistry along the river leakage section confirmed by lower δ34s values 1 8 4 7 depleted δ13c compositions 12 2 to 10 4 and enriched δ18o and δ2h values karst groundwater in hekou county show the highest contribution of coal mine drainage 36 4 and moderate contribution of domestic sewage 8 6 keywords karst water leakage of surface water isotopes biogeochemical processes 1 introduction karst stratum covers 1 3 of the earth s terrestrial parts and approximately 25 of the world s population relies on karst groundwater as the primary source for drinking and irrigation olarinoye et al 2020 in china karst accounts for 14 of the country s land surface and nearly a quarter of the country s groundwater resources is of karstic origin yuan 1994 karst aquifers constituting the main potable water resource is of heightened significance due to the increasing water demands and depletion of water resources gao 2016 karst aquifers exhibit heterogeneous distribution characteristics of porosity including solution sinkholes fissures conduits caves faults and fractures which act as large pathways for subsurface flow in the karstic terrain and permit a quick introduction of contaminants the particular significance of the susceptibility of karst aquifers to degradation makes it imperative to acquire adequate knowledge of the karst groundwater hydrology the karstic hydrological system has been studied extensively with main focus on groundwater vulnerability assessment klaas et al 2017 shrestha et al 2017 contaminant transformation processes katz 2019 liu et al 2019 torres et al 2018 effects of land cover and climate change on groundwater recharge jeannin et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 groundwater flow and hydrogeochemical evolution jiang et al 2018 pu et al 2012 shamsi et al 2019 yang et al 2019 however to data little work has been done on the seasonal and spatial distribution of groundwater hydrogeochemistry without such knowledge we cannot assess accurately the processes controlling groundwater evolution in time and space and their effect degrees further understanding natural biogeochemical and anthropogenic processes taking part in hydrochemical evolution has great implications for groundwater systems and effective evaluation and management of water resources husic et al 2019 mikac et al 2011 rivett et al 2008 shanxi province is the most typical representative of northern karst regions in china with over 75 of the land surface occupied by carbonate terrains liang et al 2013 qian et al 2003 there are abundant coal resources in the area the most distinctive geologic feature of coal bearing strata overlying carbonate rocks renders karst aquifers highly vulnerable to irreversible influences through coal mining activities this is most pronounced in jinci spring area which has a long history of coal mining activity with a total of 57 coal mines and a coal bearing area of 1598 km2 karst aquifers in jinci are also greatly impact by large scale intensive domestic industrial and agricultural activities rapid economic growth urbanization and industrialization has led to wastewater emissions coal mine drainage and untreated wastewater are reinjected into rivers and affect groundwater quality through surface leakage wang et al 2019 which prevail in karst areas with inadequate research this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of jinci karst water system by the integrated approach of multiple isotopic tracers δ18o h2o δ2h h2o 87sr 86sr δ34s so4 δ13c dic and 14c dna sequence analysis as well as hydrochemical parameters the objectives of this study are to 1 elucidate the variations of groundwater hydrogeochemistry and microbial community during surface water leakage and the controlling biogeochemical processes and 2 quantitatively assess the influence extent of surface water leakage on groundwater this study would further the understanding and management of the karst aquifers 2 study area located in the central part of shanxi province jinci karst catchment covers an area of over 2000 km2 stretching from latitudes 37 33 to 38 19 n and

sides of the fenhe river the well developed gujiao fault zones extending nee sww direction are hydraulic permeable with steep inclination and pass through fenhe river surface water coal mine drainage and contaminants from other anthropogenic sources input into groundwater via these faulting structures and or river channel leakage the length of main leakage sections is 44 km from luojiaqu to zhenchengdi section i ii iii iv and v fig 1 and from hekou to saoshi section vi vii and viii fig 1 with 70 80 of the river water leaking into groundwater iv leakage section is considered to be the largest connection of the river and jinci spring table s2 wang et al 2019 groundwater as the most important local source of water supply occurs in three major aquifers the shallow quaternary aquifers karst aquifers of ordovician carbonate rocks and fractured bedrock aquifers being the main aquifers in the jinci karst catchment the middle ordovician limestone strata contains interlayers of thin lenses of gypsum groundwater moves from northwest to southeast with precipitation being the main recharge source and penetrating the bared carbonate formations to the north of the fenhe river additional recharges occur due to the leakage from overlying aquifers and the fenhe river water the regional major discharge points are the jinci springs and the pingquan springs fig 1 artificial exploitation and subsurface flows into quaternary aquifers in taiyuan basin are other discharge ways 3 methods 3 1 sampling and geochemical analysis to delineate the seasonal and spatial distribution of groundwater at jinci hydrochemical sampling campaigns were conducted over two seasons with a total of 53 water samples collected in september 2017 wet season and in april 2018 dry season fig 1 five surface water samples were collected along the fenhe river in each of the season where leakage had been detected among the seventeen karst groundwater samples collected in each of the season five samples were from wells situated close to the river leakage sections another twelve samples were collected along the regional groundwater flow paths eight groundwater of quaternary aquifers were sampled from the nearby of the fenhe river in dry season one rainfall sample was collected in gujiao county in wet season water samples were collected in polythene bottles that had been thoroughly washed with deionized water and the extracted water three times li et al 2019 samples of surface and ground water were filtered through 0 22 µm cellulose acetate membranes on site during sampling

hydrochemistry the minimum maximum and median values for physicochemical and isotopic characteristics analyzed for surface and ground water in both dry and wet seasons have been presented along with their standard deviation in table 1 figs 2 and 3 hydrochemical parameters for rain water sample collected in wet season are shown in table s1 the rainfall sample has ph value of 7 84 with total dissolved solids tds of 56 mg l typically belonging to na ca hco3 type water almost all the parameters in river and groundwater fluctuate over a wide range in both the seasons the median values of temperature t in wet seasons for both river water and groundwater are much higher than those in dry seasons fig 2 a this is due to the high surface temperature in wet seasons which occurs in summer in the study area river water and groundwater samples are generally neutral to slightly alkaline with ph values ranging from 7 67 to 8 5 and from 7 01 to 9 21 respectively fig 2 b in comparison to the dry season a slight increase is observed in the wet season as evident from the median value of ph 8 23 and 7 57 for river water and karst groundwater respectively enrichment of ph in the wet season is likely due to supply of high ph recharge water from rain subramanian saxena 1983 tds values of river water have smaller extent variation ranging from 485 mg l to 911 mg l and 280 mg l to 556 mg l in the dry and wet season respectively fig 2 c increase of tds in the dry season is most likely due to that salts are accumulated by the evaporation effect extensively varying ranges and high standard deviation in groundwater tds for both dry and wet seasons indicate the spatial variability of dissolution and dilution during recharging water infiltrating into the subsurface as well as of surface water infiltration in addition to high water rock interactions discharge of surface contaminants during the infiltration and percolation of rainfall partly result in much enriched groundwater tds values in the wet season in the river water samples lower concentrations are found for major ions in wet seasons due to the dilution by enriched amounts of precipitation additionally high median values and wide ranges of na and cl are observed in the river waters for both the seasons fig 2 d and i in stark contrast to the river water karst groundwater show higher concentrations of most of the chemical components analyzed in the wet season than the dry season this apparently suggests the enhancement of solute load due to the rising water table in wet seasons which dissolves more salts from the soils in the groundwater ca and mg are generally the dominant cation with wide ranges fig 2 e and f reflecting varying degrees of carbonates dissolution concentrations of na are commonly low in median values but high in terms of range the higher contents of na in some groundwater are also accompanied by elevated cl bicarbonate and sulfate dominate over chloride in groundwater irrespective of the seasons fig 2 g i groundwater so4 2 values span over a wide range in both wet and dry seasons probably due to contribution from dissolution of gypsum occurring locally in the stratum 4 2 oxygen and hydrogen isotopes the stable isotopic behaviors of surface and ground water have been studies in both dry and wet seasons surface waters are characterized by enriched isotopic compositions with δ18o and δ2h values ranging from 9 4 to 7 9 and from 66 6 to 60 5 respectively fig 3 a and b the heavier isotopic signatures are indicative of strong evaporative enrichment of water from mean isotopic compositions it is clear to note that the surface waters become remarkably enriched in the wet season it can be reasonably explained by the mutual effect of temperature and rainfall amount with the former predominating over the latter the large variation of isotopes in wet season show the fast replenishment of river water during the wet season period more depleted compositions of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are found in karst groundwater in both season δ18o 10 1 to 8 6 δ2h 72 5 to 64 3 in dry season and δ18o 10 1 to 8 4 δ2h 72 6 to 64 3 in wet season unlike the surface waters little difference in isotopic signatures is observed in karst groundwater in dry and wet seasons the stable isotopic composition in the quaternary groundwater vary from 9 6 to 7 7 and from 70 3 to 60 9 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the median values of quaternary groundwater isotopic compositions are similar to those of river waters therefore from the point of view of stable isotopic compositions quaternary groundwater has a close relationship with river water 4 3 strontium and sr isotopes the strontium concentrations of surface water samples along the fenhe river range from 801 µg l to 1330 µg l in dry season and from 456 µg l to 846 µg l in wet season fig 2 j the sr isotopic compositions of river waters are constantly high with ratios varying from 0 71169 to 0 71222 in dry season and from 0 71169 to 0 71218 in wet season fig 3 c lowest 87sr 86sr ratios are observed in karst groundwater samples median 0 71104 in dry season and 0 71038 in wet season with high variable sr concentrations 257 µg l 7518 µg l in dry season and 230 µg l 6102 µg l in wet season it is also surprising to note that high 87sr 86sr signatures up to 0 7119 in dry season and 0 71185 in wet season are recognized in some karst groundwater in the study area the higher than expected 87sr 86sr ratios in groundwater from carbonate aquifers 0 707 0 710 gao et al 2019 are reasonably explained by the mixing of water with a more radiogenic 87sr 86sr ratio the median value of strontium in quaternary groundwater is 941 µg l with the variation over a smaller range accompanied highest 87sr 86sr ratios up to 0 71285 in these groundwater are identical with the dominance of silicate weathering 4 4 isotopic composition of dic isotopic behaviors of dic of surface water and karst groundwater have been studied for the wet season distinct variations of δ13c are observed in surface waters with the values varying from 12 2 to 5 6 fig 3 d most of the surface water samples have δ13c values in the range of 10 0 to 6 0 which is the expected range of δ13c values given by weathering of calcite the lowest δ13c value 12 2 in surface water is presumably due to contamination process of anthropogenic activities mediated by microorganisms caesar et al 2019 zoppini et al 2018 karst groundwater have δ13c values of 10 4 to 6 6 within the range of those of calcite dissolution such wide range of δ13c values in these groundwater implied different intensity of corrosion effect and or distinct mixing ratios with fenhe river water considering the similar δ13c value range in surface waters 4 5 sulfur isotope of dissolved sulfate sulfur isotopic compositions of dissolved sulfate have been analyzed for ten water samples in the wet season including one surface water from fenhe reservoir and nine karst groundwater the δ34s value in the surface water is 7 7 fig 3 e karst groundwater show large sulfur isotopic variations 1 8 17 3 although the median δ34s value is similar to that in the surface water 4 6 water ages the 14c age in surface waters range from modern to 150 years representing very recent recharge fig 3 f karst groundwater ages are very variable 60 11 085 years with a median value of 3250 years most of the groundwater samples have 14c age in the range of 3080 7410 years with the oldest 11 085 years in the discharge area and the youngest 60 1845 years along the leakage section of fenhe river 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater recharge residence times and flow paths stable isotopes of the water molecule have widely been employed as natural tracers in hydrogeologic studies binder et al 2019 montalván et al 2017 generally it is considered that the stable isotopic composition of oxygen and hydrogen are transported conservatively in aquifers their variations occur due to evaporation rainfall recharge climate and mixing cartwright et al 2010 clark and fritz 1997 kim et al 2020 hence δ18o and δ2h can provide valuable information on water cycles sources of water and solutes recharge conditions flow patterns residence times as well as surface ground water interactions in groundwater systems the relationships between δ18o and δ2h for surface and ground water samples are shown in fig 4 along with global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and local meteoric water line lmwl jia et al 2015 for comparison the distribution of δ18o and δ2h in surface and ground waters is generally close to gmwl and lmwl suggesting a meteoric origin of water in the study area river waters especially several samples in wet seasons tend to be isotopically enriched indicating a typical evaporation pattern evaporation line el δ2h 3 61δ18o 32 76 majority of groundwater in both seasons have relatively depleted isotopic signatures a most noticed finding is that several karst groundwater no 1 2 10 and quaternary groundwater samples no 3 27 have an enrichment of δ18o and δ2h that are similar to river water samples conferring the sampling sites of these groundwater the similarity in δ18o and δ2h values for river water and these groundwater is likely due to high angle fractures and joints structure along the fenhe river and reflects rapid recharge of the groundwater both in ordovician aquifers and unconsolidated quaternary aquifers by the evaporated river water as a mean of water dating carbon 14 activity coupled with oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are applied to provide additional information for groundwater cycles ages and recharge in the study area fig 5 groundwater samples from the northern highland recharge area are relatively young 14c ages 3000 years with the most depleted δ18o and δ2h values this is most likely due to that at higher altitude groundwater is supplied by precipitation with depleted isotopes which moves quickly to bared carbonate stratum similar 14c ages and relatively higher δ18o and δ2h values are observed in most of the groundwater from the flow through area it is also noticed that three groundwater samples no 1 2 10 show remarkable enrichment of δ18o and δ2h and apparent younger 14c ages 60 1845 years the close agreement among oxygen hydrogen and carbon 14 values for these groundwater and surface water signifies recently communicating with surficial environment mostly likely the fenhe river karst features e g solution sinkholes fissures conduits caves faults and fractures may provide large pathways for the downward leakage of surface water groundwater with residence times of 5460 11 085 years from the discharge area in the western border mount zone are associated with relatively depleted oxygen and hydrogen values this is most pronounced in groundwater samples no 14 16 and 18 with much older ages these characteristics reflect that other than modern precipitation in the northern recharge area additional recharge sources from higher altitude and or palaeo climate occur in the jinci karst catchment during the last 7000 11 000 years 5 2 surface water leakage and the input of nutrients major ion chemistry of water samples can be important indicators for determining solute sources describing water evolution as well as interpreting histories of mixing in karst areas chandrajith et al 2016 koit et al 2020 trilinear piper diagram is presented for the water samples in the study area fig 6 chemical spatial evolution of waters along flow direction in both wet and dry seasons is also shown for furthering understanding of the interaction between surface and ground water fig 7 groundwater samples in both seasons are dominated by ca mg hco3 and so4 accounting for up to 90 of total cations and anions most karst groundwater evolves from ca mg hco3 to ca mg hco3 so4 and or ca mg so4 hco3 type along groundwater flow direction groundwater in the quaternary aquifer is mainly ca hco3 so4 type surface water samples in the study area in both seasons are either ca na hco3 so4 cl or ca na mg so4 hco3 type with na and cl comprising up to 35 and 26 of the total cations and anions respectively this pattern of data clearly shows the additional inputs of na and cl into the surface water halite dissolution which provides substantial sodium and chloride can be discounted on the grounds that there has been no field data reporting halite outcropping in the rock formations the other possibility involving na and cl enrichment is the anthropogenic inputs e g municipal sewage the discharge of large amounts of municipal sewage induced by rapid urbanization contributes substantially to the sodium and chloride contamination in river water distinct differences in na and cl contents between surface and ground water therefore can be indicative of interrelationships among water samples it is interesting to note that close to and or within the range of surface water samples on the piper diagram are karst groundwater samples no 1 2 5 7 and 10 with higher sodium and chloride contents these five samples are located along the fenhe river channel where widely distributed soluble carbonates of middle ordovician are exposed to the surface thereby providing favorable conditions for surface downward leakage if no mixing happens to these karst groundwater samples along its flow path their sodium and chloride concentrations should be between those in groundwater from the recharge and discharge areas following a normal evolution trends of major ion chemistry under isolated hydrogeological conditions chebotarev 1955 wang et al 2001 the most reasonable explanation for the enrichment of sodium and chloride as well as salinity contents figs 6 and 7 a f is that these karst groundwater are inordinately recharged by fenhe river waters via faulting structures and or river channel leakage this hypothesis is also reinforced by the large river leakages in these places 0 11 m3 s to 1 13 m3 s wang et al 2019 table s2 quaternary groundwater sample no 3 is also characterized by an elevated na concentration with no accompanying increase in cl value the anisochronous increase of na and cl is probably mainly due to cation exchange process another exception to the quaternary groundwater evolution sequence is sample no 27 with highest tds ca and so4 contents fig 7 a b and g j this chemical composition seems to be caused by that the water arises from gypsiferous layers and dissolves substantial gypsum other than dissolved constituents nutrients flux via surface water leakages into groundwater brauns et al 2016 schoumans et al 2014 spatial distribution patterns of the nutrient concentrations along water flow direction for the wet season sampling fig 8 b and d show that peak levels of doc and no3 n both occur at the leakage section along fenhe river their distributions in these localities are in good agreement with those in river waters concentrations of these nutrients drop dramatically both upstream and downstream reflecting the inputs of nutrients mainly through leakage section into groundwater in contrast there is a general decline of dic concentrations along the leakage section fig 8 a and b illustrating the probable interaction between organic doc and inorganic carbon source dic at these sites this trend is most noticeable in the wet season when the interaction has been enhanced due to the enriched amounts of precipitation nutrient no3 n patterns in dry season are similar with higher concentrations fig 8 c nh4 n and no2 n are lower than detect limitation in surface and ground waters for both seasons leakage flux of fenhe river is qualitatively assessed by the sr isotope 87sr 86sr balance it was assumed that groundwater sr isotopic composition is identical to that of the host aquifer rocks and is absence of isotopic fractionation during natural processes i e precipitation evaporation and biological uptake in the environment sahib et al 2016 leakage flux of fenhe river p for 87sr 86sr mass balance is calculated by the following eq 1 1 p 87 s r 86 s r karst 87 s r 86 s r sample 87 s r 86 s r sample 87 s r 86 s r river where p is the leakage flux of fenhe river 87sr 86sr river is the strontium isotopic composition of fenhe river water 87sr 86sr karst represents the strontium isotopic composition of karst groundwater in the northern recharge area and 87sr 86sr sample is the strontium isotopic composition in possible affected groundwater calculated leakage flux for the possible affected groundwater no 1 2 7 and 10 range from 61 to 87 enforcing the effect of fenhe river leakage on these groundwater hekou county no 10 shows the most serious leakage with 87 leakage flux from the fenhe river it is worth noting that due to the probable effect of other factors 87sr 86sr could only be a qualitative index for the leakage flux of river water 5 3 hydrogeochemical processes involved in karst areas the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater are primarily determined by dissolution precipitation of carbonates and sulfate minerals which should be a research priority related dissolution precipitation reactions can be expressed as follows 1 caco 3 co 2 h 2 o ca 2 2 hco 3 2 camg co 3 2 2 co 2 2 h 2 o ca 2 mg 2 4 hco 3 3 caco 3 camg co 3 2 3 co 2 3 h 2 o 2 ca 2 mg 2 6 hco 3 4 caso 4 ca 2 so 4 2 in order to evaluate the dissolution precipitation reactions in karstic groundwater molar ratios of mg2 ca2 so4 2 along groundwater flow direction are present in fig 9 here we define calcium involved in the carbonate reactions by subtracting the amount so4 2 from the total ca2 deficit of ca2 and or extra sources of so4 2 are indicated by ca2 so4 2 0 theoretically if dolomite dissolution is the sole source of mg2 in groundwater the molar ratio of mg2 ca2 so4 2 should be equal to 1 if the dissolution of calcite and dolomite have occurred simultaneously mg2 ca2 so4 2 ratio is close to 0 5 in this study negative mg2 ca2 so4 2 ratios in river waters in dry season fig 9 a are most likely due to the emission of high sulfur mine drainages generated by the widely distributed coal mines along the fenhe river heavy rainfall in the wet season attenuates the influence of coal mines on river waters where relatively lower so4 2 ratios and positive mg2 ca2 so4 2 ratios are detected fig 7 j and fig 9 b groundwater samples in the recharge area lie consistently along the line of mg2 ca2 so4 2 0 5 indicating the crucial role of calcite and dolomite dissolution to groundwater calcium and magnesium this is consistent with jia et al 2017 who report dissolution of calcite and dolomite being the major hydrogeochemical processes based on mass balance and reaction path modeling most of the points in flow through area spread on the line of mg2 ca2 so4 2 1 reflecting the dominance of dolomite dissolution while several points in the fenhe river leakage section lie beyond the 1 0 line the most evident possibility for the elevated mg2 ca2 so4 2 ratio in these groundwater is the mixing of high so4 2 river water it is interesting to note that the most negative mg2 ca2 so4 2 ratios are found in groundwater samples in the discharge area suggesting additional so4 2 input sources and or a deficiency of ca2 apart from gypsum dissolution cation exchange between adsorbed na in the rock and dissolved ca2 in the water can be discounted on the grounds that the calcium deficiency is not accompanied by an increase in na ca ratios fig 9 c and d mine drainage is likely to be a significant source for the elevated sulfate contents considering the widely distributed coal fields in the discharge area molar ratios of mg2 hco3 can provide additional insight into the sources of magnesium in groundwater according to the eqs 2 and 3 the molar mg2 hco3 ratio of dolomite dissolution and congruent dissolution of calcite and dolomite is 1 4 and 1 6 respectively river water samples in both seasons display high mg hco3 ratio 1 4 fig 9 e and f suggesting a potential source of mg probably anthropogenic other than carbonates dissolution karst groundwater in the northern high mountain areas and several quaternary groundwater samples fall around the line with mg2 hco3 ratio of 1 6 reinforcing the dominance of congruent dissolution of calcite and dolomite at recharge areas along groundwater flow direction the mg2 hco3 ratio continuously increases most points in the flow through area lie along or close to the 1 4 line reflecting that the concentration of magnesium and bicarbonate are largely controlled by dolomite dissolution several outliers located in the fenhe river leakage section show relatively higher mg2 hco3 ratio and follow the similar trend of river water supporting the leakage of river water consistent with the assumption discussed above karst groundwater in the discharge area are characterized by the highest mg2 hco3 ratios for both seasons demonstrating the extra sources of mg and or attenuation of hco3 in groundwater the most evident possibility is that dolomitization may occur that the mg2 is gradually released due to the common ion effect of calcium presence of gypsum within the carbonates may lead to oversaturation and precipitation of calcite and subsequent under saturation and dissolution of dolomite appelo and postma 2005 a process known as dedolomitization the net result of the dedolomitization is the conversion of dolomite to calcite in the rock and the enrichment of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 concentrations in the water 5 4 anthropogenic influences elevated contents of sodium in the water are ubiquitous in urban areas of many countries and therefore can be indicative of natural and anthropogenic inputs into the surface ground water system in general water contaminated by sludge wastewater show high na concentrations application of extensively used nacl in agricultural seed selection would lead to the enrichment of na in surface and ground water additionally acid coal mines with relatively lower ph values is more prone to dissolve na minerals as a consequence water affected by discharge and or leaking recharge of coal mining drainage display high na contents therefore variations of na sr2 versus 87sr 86sr are demonstrated to reveal the effect of anthropogenic activities on surface and ground water hydrogeochemistry most groundwater from quaternary aquifer display a general positive correlation between na sr2 and more radiogenic 87sr 86sr ratios fig 10 a implying a major contribution of silicate weathering majority of the karst groundwater are characterized by a relatively low 87sr 86sr signature coupled with low na sr2 ratio figs 10 a and 11 b signifying the extensive dissolution of carbonates this is most pronounced in waters from the discharge areas along flow path several karst groundwater no 6 12 and 21 in the flow through area evolves from carbonates dominated 87sr 86sr to a relatively higher 87sr 86sr with no accompanying variation of na sr2 ratio probably due to seepage of water in gullies all the surface water and karst groundwater located in the fenhe river leakage section in both seasons reveal large changes in na sr2 ratio without significant variation in 87sr 86sr fig 10 a and b highlighting anthropogenic sources of na and sr2 in the water the sulfur isotope is a useful tool in elucidating the influences of anthropogenic activities on groundwater mahlknecht et al 2017 otero and soler 2002 in general characteristics of sulfate contents and sulfur isotopic composition in groundwater are determined by its origins as well as by the formation mechanisms dissolution of evaporates such as gypsum anhydrite will produce elevated sulfate levels combined with highest δ34s values ranging from 10 to 30 brenot et al 2007 claypool et al 1980 whereas sulfate isotopic composition for sedimentary rocks span over a wide range δ34s 40 to 50 sulfate minerals dissolution does not alter the original δ34s signature in groundwater however the pristine sulfate isotopic composition can be modified by oxidation reduction process the oxidation of sulfide i e pyrite frequently happening in coal mines would induce increasing so4 concentrations whilst decreasing the remaining so4 in δ34s values dogramaci et al 2017 harrison and thode 1957 a graph of δ34s so4 for the studied water samples is illustrated in fig 10 c along with some limited area on sulfate and sulfur isotopic compositions for gypsum so4 2 2500 mg l 3000 mg l δ34s 20 and coal mine drainage so4 2 762 mg l δ34s 1 0 most groundwater so4 and δ34s values progressively increase along flow paths towards the end member of gypsum dissolution in the right upper corner this enrichment gives clues to the growing role of gypsum dissolution in the groundwater sulfate chemistry along the direction of flow the negative saturation index for gypsum and its simultaneous increase with increasing so4 concentrations are also supporting the major involvement of gypsum dissolution fig 10 d another interesting finding is that three karst groundwater in the flow through area no 7 10 and 21 characterized by relatively lower δ34s values 1 8 4 7 deviate from other groundwater the so4 and δ34s characteristics in these three groundwater delineate a distribution compatible with a mixing process with the sulfide oxidation end member evidencing that the karst aquifers have been polluted by sulfur enriched coal mine drainages this reasoning concurs with the observations of pu et al 2012 who report the groundwater contamination in chongqing karst areas by coal mine wastewaters assuming no other process is modifying the δ34s characteristics quantitative assessment of the significance that coal mine drainages have in these karst groundwater is obtained by the sulfur isotopic mass balance the calculated values of coal mine drainage contribution are 15 0 36 4 and 23 5 for no 7 10 and 21 respectively groundwater sample no 10 with the highest value was found in hekou village along fenhe river the infiltration and overflow of coal mine drainages in the widely distributed coal industry areas nearby induce the pollution of karst water eventually through the downstream carbonate seepage section or other ways due to the distinct δ13c values in the various carbon reservoirs in some cases the δ13c of dic can be applied to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic sources generally weathering of carbonates would produce a much higher δ13c values of 2 to 5 li et al 2010 however oxidation and decomposition of easily biodegradable organic matter occurring in domestic sewage lead to a depletion of δ13c values 12 5 wachniew 2006 additionally domestic sewage is characterized by an enriched oxygen and hydrogen isotopic signature that is more highly evaporated hence a δ18o and δ2h δ13c approach is applied to give additional information for the anthropogenic inputs into the jinci karst system majority of the studied groundwater show δ13c composition enrichment along the direction of flow with δ18o and δ2h values increase initially and decrease afterwards fig 10 e and f this trend illustrates carbonate weathering prevailing in the study area it is interesting to note that three water samples groundwater no 10 in the flow through area groundwater no 15 in the discharge zone and surface water no 30 have relatively lower δ13c values 12 2 to 10 4 which are similar to those of samples in the recharge area if no mixing dilution occurs in these three water samples their δ13c values should be more and more enriched along flow paths towards the discharge zone this depletion of δ13c values and the associated high oxygen and hydrogen isotopic contents point towards the addition of isotopically light carbon 13 from another sources most probably domestic sewage which could also contribute to enriched heavier δ18o and δ2h values unregulated disposal of domestic sewage via percolation reclamation poses greatest threats to surface and ground water quality if other influential processes are ruled out the δ13c values in the two groundwater samples can be achieved by mixing 3 9 8 6 of domestic sewage and 91 4 96 1 of natural origin surface water sample no 30 located in densely populated gujiao city is more influenced by the disposal of wastewater effluent with an input up to 69 of domestic sewage considering the absence of natural nitrate in most geologic formations higher no3 concentrations in groundwater generally indicated contamination from agricultural practices and served as an important indicator for groundwater pollution heaton 1986 in contrast to those areas with scarce agricultural practices surface and ground water samples collected from jinci contain low to medium high no3 concentrations the hco3 normalized values no3 hco3 are relatively higher in surface water and parts of quaternary groundwater fig 9 g and h reflecting their vulnerability to agricultural point and non point pollution this affection is more pronounced in dry season with higher no3 hco3 ratios detected most likely due to the less frequently dilution compared with that of wet season limited karst groundwater along the fenhe river channel with no3 10 mg l are more or less affected by the agricultural contamination 5 5 biogeochemical processes involved microbial community composition of karst groundwater samples are also elaborated for further interpretation of biogeochemical processes involved in the jinci karst system in this study during the leakage of river water and domestic sewage along the fenhe river the accompanied inputs of nutrients doc and no3 n could induce the enhancement of microbial activities in the karst water aquifer system this assumption is supported by the composition of microbial community at the phylum and family levels for karst water samples in leakage section no 2 and non leakage area no 22 fig 11 remarkable distinctions in bacterial community in phylum level are observed between no 2 and no 22 although proteobacteria being the most abundance phylum in both samples its relative abundance is lower in no 2 than that in no 22 correspondingly other bacterial phyla e g firmicutes actinobacteria nitrospirae bacteroidetes acidobacteria and a uncultured lineage designated od1 occur at higher abundances in the groundwater sample from leakage section heat maps are further drawn to describe the distribution of the predominant families in the samples fig 11 b the deeper color represents the higher abundance dominant bacterial families in this study are clustered into three groups both samples show similar lower abundance of families in group one in contrast the richness of the families in group two and three shows significant differences in no 2 and no 22 samples i relative abundance of families in group two is much higher in no 2 66 1 than that in no 22 13 4 ii pseudomonadaceae group three occurs at much lower abundance in no 2 2 5 than that in no 22 83 6 as a whole groundwater samples in leakage and non leakage sections display distinct signatures of microbial community enhancement of microbial activities at the leakage section is expressed in two ways on the one hand growth of heterotrophic microorganisms is promoted by the utilization and conversion of available doc into dic farjalla et al 2006 this interpretation is corroborated by the accompanied decrease of doc values with increasing dic contents at the leakage section on the other hand no3 n can be utilized by microorganisms for dual purposes i nitrogen source nitrate can be used as a nitrogen nutrient by part of bacteria actinomycetes and mycete a process known as assimilatory nitrate reduction fariduddin et al 2018 no 3 nh 4 organic nitrogen on i respiratory electron acceptor denitrifying bacteria can mediate reduction of nitrate into nitrogen releasing the energy needed by vital activities known as denitrification li et al 2019 no 3 no 2 n 2 under anaerobic conditions sulfate in the environment can be utilized and reduced to hydrogen sulfide by microbes which is termed as bacteria sulfate reduction bsr rasool et al 2016 however in this study karst groundwater samples are collected from bared and or shallow buried carbonate areas fig 1 measured dissolved oxygen do in the samples reflect slightly aerobic conditions in the groundwater system throughout the year evidencing that no bsr takes place in the leakage section this reasoning is also supported by the concentration and isotopic composition of dissolved so4 in groundwater since 32s of solid and dissolved sulfur compounds are preferentially consumed compared to 34s during bsr and bacterial processes associated with the recycling of sulfide δ34s values of residual sulfate gradually increase with an association of so4 depletion as reduction proceeds in the jinci karst system elevated δ34s values in some groundwater are not accompanied by depletion of so4 concentrations illustrating bsr being inhibited in these bared and or shallow buried karst areas during the utilization of carbon and nitrogen sources by microbes bioweathering processes of minerals e g carbonates gypsum and silicates intensify significantly thereby promoting the release of dissolved constituents in aquifers to a great extent and modifying the characteristics of groundwater hydrochemistry 6 conclusions integrated analysis of multiple isotopic tracers and hydrogeochemical parameters provides important information on groundwater residence time recharge hydrogeochemical evolution in time and space controlling biogeochemical processes surface water leakage as well as anthropogenic influences in jinci karst water system major conclusions are drawn as follows 1 groundwater samples from the northern highland recharge area have relatively young 14c ages 3000 years with the most depleted δ18o and δ2h values indicating modern precipitation recharge at higher altitude several karst groundwater along the fenhe river channel show remarkable enrichment of oxygen and hydrogen and young apparent 14c ages 60 1845 years signifying recently communicating with surficial environment oldest 14c ages up to 11 085 years together with depleted oxygen and hydrogen compositions in the groundwater from discharge area show that apart from modern precipitation in the northern recharge area additional recharge sources from higher altitude and or palaeo climate occur in the catchment 2 the hydrogeochemical compositions of surface and ground water are dominated by ca mg hco3 and so4 lower concentrations are found for major ions in surface waters in wet season due to the dilution by enriched amounts of precipitation whilst karst groundwater show higher concentrations of most of the chemical components in the wet season resulted from the enhancement of solute load due to the rising water table based on major chemical compositions the hydrogeochemical evolution of surface and ground water in the study area are largely controlled by simultaneous dissolution of calcite and dolomite with gypsiferous layers in karst aquifers with solutes deriving from silicate weathering limited on quaternary groundwater evidenced by highest mg hco3 ratios dedolomitization precipitation of calcite and dissolution of dolomite driven by the dissolution of gypsum occurs locally mainly in groundwater from the discharge area of the system 3 surface water could leak vertically along river channel inputting dissolved constituents and nutrients into groundwater trilinear diagram shows that several groundwater along the fenhe river channel are characterized by elevated na and cl and clustered around the surface waters reflecting the influence of leaking recharge on their chemistry additionally surface water leakage induces the variation of microbial community in phylum and family level with the main phylum proteobacteria and family pseudomonadaceae being less abundant calculated river water leakage flux for the possible affected groundwater range from 61 to 87 with the highest serious leakage found in hekou county 4 surface water leakage could induce discharge of coal mine drainages and unregulated disposal of domestic sewage into the groundwater system affected groundwater samples along the fenhe river would show relatively lower δ34s values depleted δ13c compositions and enriched δ18o and δ2h values based on the δ34s and δ13c mass balance human activity in the study area contributes to groundwater with 15 36 4 inputs of coal mine drainage and 3 9 8 6 of domestic sewage 5 river channel and geological characteristics such as faults and synclines offer favorable paths for the recharge

4746,the epikarst is an area of complex interactions and processes and is an important component of the critical zone understanding how processes in the epikarst are similar and different between sites is of the utmost importance in determining how information about these systems can be used to understand broader concepts and implications in the unsaturated zone of karst systems we looked at two sites in separate karst regions of kentucky usa to assess patterns in storm response of epikarst systems using discharge and analytes including ph temperature specific conductance and turbidity as markers of epikarst processes we assessed how each of these parameters responded to storm pulses comparing between sites and seasons leaf on vs leaf off our results show that hysteresis patterns vary between analyte and season but there are consistent patterns between sites regression modeling of cross correlation results show that storm intensity drives the timing of storm responses whereas precipitation total drives how strongly the analytes correlate to discharge response across both sites analytes respond similarly with the lag in response likely tied to the size of the basin the similarity in response of the study sites suggests that the processes controlling transport through the epikarst are consistent across sites the influence of a storm event and season on these responses highlight the importance of further study of soil and near surface processes on controlling geochemical responses in the epikarst keywords epikarst groundwater dynamics karst springs hysteresis 1 introduction critical zone studies have been the focus of many research endeavors in recent years focusing on the dynamic surface and near surface of the earth from the tops of the trees to active moving groundwater white et al 2015 the behavior of this part of earth s surface and near surface is critical to our understanding of how anthropogenic activities impact the environment richter and mobley 2009 in carbonate terrain epikarst is an integral part of the critical zone williams 1983 2004 2008 and research on it has been ongoing since the 1970 s often highlighting its role in the overall behavior of karst groundwater systems kiraly et al 1995 bakalowicz 2004 the epikarst plays a crucial role in the geochemical evolution of groundwater pronk et al 2008 speleogenesis klimchouk 1995 2000 2004 subsurface ecosystem dynamics pipan and culver 2013 fluxes of sediment and nutrients through the system and maintenance of low flow conditions in the vadose zone of karst aquifers williams 2008 although considered to be part of the unsaturated zone the epikarst provides significant water storage perrin et al 2003 jacob et al 2009 the lack of evaporative signal in drip water isotopes in caves indicates that water leaves the root zone quickly polk et al 2013 schwartz et al 2013 and can be stored for months hu et al 2015 the amount of storage in these systems is likely driven by the overall thickness of the epikarst zhang et al 2013 however how these systems respond to precipitation is likely driven by some combination of rainfall intensity liu et al 2007 and antecedent conditions schwartz et al 2013 in addition seasonal variability in soil and vegetation dynamics may play a significant role in how water moves through and is stored in the epikarst yang et al 2012 researchers studying solute and particulate movement through the epikarst have not found a consistent relationship between water response to storms and other monitored parameters research suggests that particulates arrive at monitoring points ahead of solutes pronk et al 2008 however solutes do not show a consistent pattern in how they move through the system total organic carbon toc fecal coliform and agricultural contaminants all have differing responses relative to each other pronk et al 2008 found that both fecal coliform and toc were delayed relative to discharge peaks with fecal coliform preceding toc lerch et al 2018 found that atrazine lagged two months from surface application to arrival at an epikarst monitoring site with only a small amount of the contaminant being mobilized in that period indicating that additional processes may control its mobility other research has suggested that the response of solutes as with discharge may be driven by rainfall intensity liu et al 2007 and seasonality yang et al 2012 understanding these controls is critical in describing how water solutes and particulates move through the subsurface with projections of climate change indicating significant changes to precipitation patterns understanding the relationships between precipitation water solute and particulate transfer through the unsaturated zone is critical in protecting groundwater resources although the epikarst is known to play a significant role in critical zone processes conceptual models still fall short in conceptualizing the relationship between fluxes through the epikarst at scale larger than a single site liu et al 2007 pronk et al 2008 polk et al 2013 schwartz et al 2013 hu et al 2015 as climate change drives more intense extreme weather patterns understanding this relationship is critical to predicting how karst systems as a whole will respond to changing precipitation regimes we used the storm response behaviors of two epikarst systems to determine how storm intensity frequency and season drive fluxes through the epikarst critical zone 2 methodology 2 1 study sites to assess the storm responses of perennial epikarst systems we focused on two sites that have continuous flow from subsurface storage areas 30 m thick one is a small cave spring and the other is an in cave waterfall fig 1 both sites are located in flat lying mississippian limestones in central kentucky the high density of sinkholes in the area are indicative of a well developed and soil mantled epikarst system as the dominant source of water storage for the spring this has resulted in a well developed epikarst and four primary storage areas in the subsurface soil epikarst bedrock and conduits fig 2 winters december march are cold with lows reaching below freezing summers june september are warm with high temperatures regularly exceeding 30c there is a slight seasonality to precipitation with september and october slightly drier 8 10 cm standard deviation 4 46 cm than the rest of the year 10 84 cm per month standard deviation 4 98 cm based on records from 1895 to 2016 kentucky climate center data 2020 most vegetation in the region is deciduous which results in a large difference in plant water use between leaf on april october and leaf off november march seasons since irrigation is not typically used in this region we assumed that there is a greater impact on recharge to the epikarst due to seasonality of transpiration as opposed to seasonality of precipitation 2 1 1 homeplace farm homeplace on green river is a working farm that is owned and operated as a 501 c 3 nonprofit organization near campbellsville kentucky the majority of the land is agricultural with limited forested land along the incised drainages leading to the green river to the south karst development on the farm occurs in the reef member of the fort payne formation the reef member is a thin limestone unit that is intermittent throughout the region and is underlain by shales krause and meyer 2004 as a result there are numerous sinkholes in the study site as well as numerous springs emerging at the contact between the limestone and shale unit this has resulted in a relatively thin area of karstification with the springs emerging 20 m in elevation below the top of the sinkholes taylor and tobin 2020 dye tracing in the area following the procedures of currens 2013 delineated the groundwater basin for cave spring the largest spring in the area taylor and tobin 2020 dye tracing efforts also highlighted that all of the spring flow is generated by recharge through aquifers however no shallow aquifer is documented in the region 2 1 2 crumps cave crumps cave is a preserve owned and managed by western kentucky university located 1 km northwest of the town of smiths grove in northern warren county kentucky at an elevation of 194 m the cave is formed within the upper part of the st louis limestone previous studies have established a connection between drainage infiltrating from an adjacent row crop field and the in cave waterfall study site waterfall 1 wf1 extensive dye tracing has established flowtimes of minutes to hours from the surface to wf1 and indicates an estimated recharge area of 100 m2 which varies based on antecedent moisture conditions and storm magnitude miller 2011 lerch et al 2018 the waterfall is 25 m below the surface and emerges from the ceiling of crumps cave where water drains from the bottom of the epikarst water also moves 200 m laterally flowing westward along the dip of the bedrock between the surface and ceiling of crumps cave transport times from the surface are dependent upon soil pathways and thickness approximately 3 m varying within the epikarst and complex flowpaths governing the hydraulic regime based on head pressure dynamics under seasonal and storm conditions bandy et al 2017 lerch et al 2018 jackson and polk 2019 land cover in the vicinity of the cave is predominantly pasture and cropland usda nass 2011 additional site details are provided in miller 2011 and the supplemental materials in lerch et al 2018 2 2 field data collection 2 2 1 karst hydrogeologic inventory prior to this study karst at crumps cave has been documented through a series of previous studies groves et al 2005 miller 2011 vanderhoff 2011 polk et al 2013 lerch et al 2018 however research on the karst at homeplace at green river has been limited a thorough karst hydrogeologic inventory of the site and provided a basic overview of the hydrogeology of the system taylor and tobin 2020 2 2 2 instrumentation both sites were instrumented to measure precipitation discharge and water quality at homeplace precipitation was monitored using a tipping bucket rain gage located in the agricultural area of the farm a data logger was maintained at the cave spring to continuously measure temperature turbidity specific conductance oxidation reduction potential nitrate concentration and total suspended solids these data were coupled with one of three discharge measurements using an h flume compound weir or a stage discharge rating curve because successive floods destroyed the previous gaging instrumentation taylor and tobin 2020 all instruments were calibrated on a biweekly schedule for the duration of the study within the groundwater basin of cave spring a tipping bucket rain gage was installed for the duration of the project collecting data at a 10 min resolution at the crumps cave research site a weather station was installed to continuously measure meteorological conditions within the drainage area of the cave at 10 min resolution groves et al 2013 inside the cave at waterfall 1 wf1 a custom designed weir described in groves et al 2013 was used to monitor discharge flow from wf1 is directed into a reservoir beneath the structure supporting the weir within the reservoir two multiparameter water quality sondes continuously measured geochemistry parameters at 10 min resolution the parameters measured were ph specific conductance temperature and turbidity the method of using two sondes was employed as a redundancy data downloading and sonde calibrations were completed weekly and all data corrections were applied to the annual dataset 2 3 data analysis previous work has shown that storm discharge responses lag behind precipitation events depending on antecedent conditions and storm intensity schwartz et al 2013 in order to look at dominant components of the hydrologic system during flood pulses we assumed this lag exists and tested to determine what patterns control other responses in the system relative to the hydrograph response including temperature ph specific conductance and turbidity storm events during the study period february 2018 january 2019 were separated into leaf on may october and leaf off november april periods and then the hysteresis of each parameter was plotted following the methods of toran and reisch 2013 these plots were then categorized based on the classification of evans and davies 1998 based on the direction and pattern of responses non looping patterns were identified as linear simple loops were classified based on direction of loop clockwise vs counterclockwise and more complex loops were classified as a figure eight or complex these responses were then classified based on the seasonality of plant water use leaf on vs leaf off in addition to hysteresis plotting the cross correlation between all analytes and discharge was calculated the resulting peak lag time and correlation coefficient at the time of peak lag were used as response variables in separate linear regression models with metrics of precipitation antecedent conditions season hysteretic response and site used as predictors table 1 site was included in models as both an additive and interactive variable to account for potential impacts that site would have on both the slope and intercept of these relationships the lag time of the cross correlation represents how long it took each analyte to respond the fit of the correlation represents how similar the analyte response was to the discharge response the predictors for precipitation storm event total and intensity and antecedent conditions seven and 30 day precipitation totals were quantitative values all other predictors were treated as categorical data the value of the cross correlation fit was squared to address a large number of values with strong negative and strong positive correlation values and the cross correlation lag was square rooted to address skewness in the data for each response variable multiple linear regression models were run and akaike information criterion aic was conducted to determine the best fit model burnham and anderson 2002 3 results 3 1 storm response patterns during the winter fig 3 discharge and turbidity have similar responses an initial increase followed by a long recession temperature and specific conductance have the opposite response a steep decrease during the storm pulse followed by a gradual return to pre storm conditions a similar but more complex pattern occurs for ph as for temperature and specific conductance initial drop and gradual return to pre storm conditions however the gradual rise is punctuated by occasional drops in ph summer storm responses are typically more complex and responsive to smaller events than those of winter storms fig 4 although the general pattern is the same for all parameters the patterns typically exhibit more variability in how the system returns to baseflow conditions after a storm event 3 2 hysteresis responses hysteresis response differed between season and analyte and no analyte responded identically to every storm event leaf off responses tended to be simpler fig 5 whereas leaf on responses had a tendency to be more complex fig 6 with a wider variety of response times for each analyte whereas leaf off responses were more consistent for each analyte table 2 all analytes assessed in table 2 had a minimum of two different types of responses and a maximum of five different 3 3 regression modeling of 25 regression models of cross correlation lag time aic results showed one likely model within two aic units the model included event intensity analytes site and an interaction between site and analyte as predictor variables table 3 the model was significant p 0 001 with an r2 value of 0 492 this model shows that each site and analyte have different response lag times to storm events these variables show that crumps cave has a shorter lag time than homeplace of the analytes ph has the fastest response followed by specific conductance turbidity and then temperature the analytes also vary in the relationship between response time based on site all analytes have a steeper slope at homeplace as indicated by the analyte site variable in table 3 in addition at both sites lag time is also driven by storm intensity more intense storms have a quicker response the fit of the cross correlation at the peak lag time shows one likely model 2 aic unit difference table 4 the best fit model includes analyte season and total event precipitation this model was significant p 0 001 with an r2 value of 0 22 the fit of the analyte response to storm events varied by analyte fit of the cross correlation decreased during leaf on seasons each analyte showed different fits with specific conductance showing the strongest fit between discharge and analyte response and temperature showing the weakest fit total event precipitation showed that with increasing event totals there was a decrease in fit of the analyte relative to the discharge curve the inclusion of site in the lag time model but not the correlation fit model suggests that the timing of the response varied between sites but not in the way the system responds 4 discussion many studies discuss the epikarst being a transition zone that plays a role in both storage and recharge klimchouk 2000 aquilina et al 2006 the evolution of allogenic water and dissolution processes being formative to the karst landscape williams 2008 gabrovšek et al 2018 while our data shows that the geochemical behavior of flow through the system varies substantially table 2 figs 5 and 6 it also suggests that these functions are relatively consistent between sites and are governed by a set of feedback processes likely associated with the activated hydrologic pathways hysteresis models suggest that we are primarily dealing with two flow paths in the system which can be interpreted as slower flow path ways through the epikarst and faster flow path ways through conduits davies and beven 2015 differences in hysteretic response is likely driven by a combination of antecedent conditions storm amount and storm intensity when epikarst storage has been flushed prior to the observed storm event then a change in the hysteresis response is expected toran and reisch 2013 additionally the total storm amount and intensity will drive the relative responses of the epikarst and the conduit flow tritz et al 2011 zhang et al 2020 the interaction of these factors is the likely cause of the numerous small hysteretic loops seen in the storm responses at both sites figs 5 and 6 our regression models support this and show that storm intensity and site likely representing dominant flow lengths are critical variables in understanding how quickly a site will respond to a storm event conversely how physiochemical variables respond is more closely tied to the total quantity of precipitation and plant water use based on the leaf on vs leaf off response however how the system responds is independent of site this suggests that while activation of epikarst pathways is linked to storm characteristics season how the system response is similar across sites while the timing is variable it is clear that when responses occur they alter the hydrologic and geochemical nature of the system for a period these processes can be complex and spatially heterogeneous seasonality of responses highlights the impacts of climate and near surface critical zone processes evapotranspiration carbon cycling etc on the response of the epikarst system 4 1 conceptual model the regression models of cross correlation data suggest there is consistency in how each analyte responds during a storm pulse across sites but the timing of that response varies by site and season this variability in lag is likely tied to the difference in scale of the basins feeding each site although the homeplace site responses are larger in scale their response times have more lag than the crumps cave responses this can likely be explained by the travel time through the system with a larger basin more time is needed for the geochemical responses to propagate through the system though responses are fairly rapid at both sites although this difference is real the actual fit of the geochemical response relative to the hydrograph response is consistent between sites figs 3 and 4 these sites differ slightly in geology and discharge magnitude but the response of the epikarst system to storm events is similar at both sites the measured parameters individually respond differently but consistently to storms depending on season and storm size and intensity this indicates that not only is each variable influenced by different processes within the subsurface but that there are common governing processes within the epikarst as a system these responses allowed us to develop a conceptual model fig 7 for how these myriad factors interplay precipitation amount and intensity simplified into major and minor storms is the initial driver of the outflow response once precipitation is on the ground the storm event signal is then driven by infiltration and flowpath interactions the activation of these flowpaths vary seasonally likely a result of changes in evapotranspiration rates associated with plant water use these patterns result in feedback loops that ultimately control the physiochemical responses of the epikarst fig 7 4 1 1 storm event influences rainfall magnitude and intensity are the ultimate drivers of whether or not fast flow or slow flow pathways dominate the storm response signal in the resulting water geochemistry the intensity and magnitude of a recharge event and resultant hydraulic head created within the system will dictate the signal of the water draining from the epikarst system this signal will in turn be driven by mixing between fast and slow flow pathways baker et al 2020 during larger and more intense events the fast flow paths may activate more quickly whereas recharging low flow paths that become saturated during an event may cause a delay in low flow signals fig 7 our results indicate that more intense faster flow events create a larger response that also reduces the lag time based on the intensity of the event the response and recovery pattern seen in the hydrographs for both study sites indicate that during multiple events fig 4 the system attempts to recover to baseflow and the speed of this is likely dictated by the antecedent moisture conditions preceding each event 4 1 2 epikarst flowpaths multiple flowpaths within the epikarst govern the rate amount and connectivity between the surface and the ultimate drains that contribute to the groundwater flow regime the heterogeneity of the epikarst its connection to the broader regional aquifer and the complexity of modeling recharge dynamics have been studied in detail labat et al 2000 aquilina et al 2006 williams 2008 yet few studies isolate and examine the interrelationship between these factors on the hydrologic and geochemical behavior of this part of the system within the context of season storm and surface influences our results suggest that the epikarst is a nested scaled down version of the regional karst aquifer with similar processes governing the system response regression models of the response of each parameter to storm events show that intensity and season a proxy for near surface processes are important factors in explaining the response of each parameter similar to what other research has shown ollivier et al 2020 the pathway through which water moves through the soil column determines how that water contributes to vadose recharge into primary matrix and secondary fracture permeability zones which have slow and fast flow responses respectively these zones reach maximum flow and storage capabilities based on storm intensity and duration and seasonality although our results do not show antecedent conditions as a primary predictor of response other research e g schwartz et al 2013 has clearly shown antecedent conditions to also be a critical factor in governing epikarst system response because variability in antecedent conditions during our study period was minimal our data may have been insufficient to identify these conditions as a controlling factor 4 1 3 seasonal influences our conceptual model which is layered in its presentation of the epikarst flow system considers seasonality a dominating driver of how the system responds based on the influence of evapotranspiration temperature and antecedent moisture conditions storage homogenizes well during the leaf off season which coincides with the start of the drier season slower flow conditions allow matrix drainage to dominate the epikarst system ollivier et al 2020 baker et al 2020 at the start of the leaf on season storage amounts are higher than at the beginning of the leaf off season this results in a reduced threshold to activate fast flow pathways and the epikarst drainage becomes more heterogeneous however as the season proceeds evapotranspiration can modify pressure differentials in the subsurface altering the response of the epikarst system to storm events the feedback between evapotranspiration and water storage can even have a measurable effect during fall and winter months despite primarily leaf off conditions intensity continues to be a primary driver during all seasons because even during baseflow conditions following a prolonged drought such as in late summer 2018 storms of a certain intensity can overcome the evapotranspiration threshold and exceed the storage flow rate to activate secondary pathways and result in a direct increase in discharge and geochemical change to the epikarst groundwater system 4 1 4 physiochemical responses physiochemical responses are more complex and often influenced by conditions beyond recharge for example ph has a highly complex response and previous work has suggested the added influence of evapotranspiration and surface temperature which can play a role in the amount of co2 produced within the system can be a driver in how this analyte responds jackson and polk 2019 their findings suggest these soil and surface processes drive the annual variability in co2 the signal of this in the epikarst waters is then superimposed by storm event responses to cause short term changes this complexity provides a potential explanation for lagged responses in our model turbidity in contrast to ph has a much more consistent response increasing with increasing storm intensity likely from fast flow paths being activated however during smaller events in which water enters storage turbidity responses may lag storm recharge or have almost no response within the system this further supports the concept of differing flow pathways being a driver of lag times and hydrogeochemical responses within the epikarst specific conductance tends to respond quickly along with temperature during intense events regardless of season albeit with a more attenuated magnitude during smaller events or drier periods although variable responses of physio chemical parameters has often been documented li et al 2008 jackson and polk 2019 this study demonstrated a common response in these parameters in the epikarst system between sites furthering the concept that it is the zone governing many of these processes due to the complex interactions within the critical surface soil rock zone regardless of site variability our data indicate that the primary drivers of physiochemical responses are seasonality and storm events even though each analyte responds differently our results indicate that the soil rock interface processes tend to lead the response of the vadose drains within the epikarst thus indicating that the lag in geochemical parameters in part can be attributed to whether slow or fast flow pathways dominate the event and the amount of homogenization occurring which may influence the piston effect to lead the storm response this agrees with other studies attempting to model the geochemical pathways of epikarstic and epiphreatic flow aquilina et al 2006 gabrovšek et al 2018 while also demonstrating these pathways result in similar responses between sites an important aspect of the conceptual model regarding lead and lag times is that often the geochemical parameters do not return to their original baseflow value as the falling limb continues to recede figs 3 4 7 the system tends not to recover as smoothly or quickly to its previous steady state instead becoming more chaotic and responsive based on additional influencing factors such as future storms particularly during leaf on conditions more simply stated certain parameters in the system such as temperature ph and discharge do not return to their original baseflow values and therefore predispose the system to have a lead on responding to the next event during leaf on conditions this is clearly visible in the storm response figs 3 6 as such the epikarst should be viewed as a staged response system that shifts in equilibrium over time and conditions to accommodate the storage discharge potential dictated by the current level of saturation which can change rapidly on the order of days to weeks due to the efficiency of the well developed pathways and reservoirs in the system that both store and transmit recharge under varying hydrologic conditions fig 7 4 2 feedback systems the epikarst conceptual model presented here fig 7 accounts for a complex system of lead and lag responses affecting both hydrologic and geochemical responses we suggest that the epikarst serves as a nested aquifer system that acts in many ways like a broader regional aquifer albeit at a smaller scale klimchouk 2000 ollivier et al 2020 responses are both direct and indirect and must be examined at a broader temporal scale to account for the nature of the lead lag response of the system both seasonally and during individual storm events under baseflow conditions the system achieves a steady state condition that creates a potential for lags in certain parameters e g discharge response temperature ph caused by precipitation entering storage unless a certain storm event threshold is exceeded to cause direct flow through the epikarst in fractures to immediate drains into the broader aquifer system leads occur during conditions of higher saturation when the system is primed to have more rapid response in discharge conductivity pulses of storage water leading the storm event and turbidity more turbulent flow the important aspect of the conceptual model presented here fig 7 is the integration of the cross correlation parameters that identify the epikarst response across these conditions when the system is in flux which is typically during seasonal change or variability in the intensity or magnitude of storm events when affected by high evapotranspiration et effective recharge may be attenuated by et even during winter if storm events are low in intensity and duration and storage is available in the system when thresholds of intensity duration and storage are not reached by a given storm event little to no discharge response occurs in the epikarst drains during precipitation events because of the water entering storage or undergoing et processes in the soil interface zone the rapid and immediate effects of surface factors such as temperature and soil thickness are consistent across sites and apparent in our results as indicated in other recent studies examining the hydrogeochemical response over varying seasons lerch et al 2018 jackson and polk 2019 the responses seen in the monitored parameters must be considered within the three dimensional nature of the epikarst system and account for how varying pathways are activated both during baseflow and saturated conditions for example as storage reservoirs fill during a storm event and begin to spill over into faster drainage pathways their contribution will have a different geochemical signature of storage recharge water aquilina et al 2006 because of mixing this mixing of water causes changes in the epikarstic flow during storm events and careful scrutiny of the hydrograph is required in order to determine the pulses of storage versus storm water and their respective geochemical signature these pulses can even occur multiple times during an event based on fluctuating intensity storage water will typically have a higher ph and specific conductance because of longer residence time whereas storm pulses tend to drive the values lower for both as meteoric water saturated with co2 enters the system and fast flows through diffuse pathways storage pulses lead the rainfall and lags are created during baseflow conditions in which slowly leaking matrix flow feeds epikarst drains and maintains a relatively steady geochemical signature until a storm event arrives even so smaller storm events under dry conditions may cause no change in the system s discharge or geochemical parameters thus the epikarst serves as a system of storage areas and drains similar to documented patterns of karst aquifer development at a larger scale palmer 2007 5 conclusion collectively the results presented here suggest the epikarst is governed by a complex system of annual seasonal and storm event responses that lead and lag depending on the parameter being examined and thus should be studied both temporally and spatially while keeping in mind the concurrent processes affecting the hydrogeochemical responses additional factors that include soil thickness insoluble layers and secondary calcite precipitation may also influence the hysteretic relationships within the epikarst on a local scale the epikarst aquifer system is governed by a series of feedback systems supported by the data presented herein which suggest that a multi state model for epikarst flow dynamics is most appropriate when trying to predict responsiveness during any given condition the epikarst system is more complex and convoluted than typical conduit flow systems at depth because of the influence of these myriad factors which indicate that recharge discharge dynamics are influenced by both hydrogeologic and surface factors combined with the ability for these fast and slow flow components of the system to act as both storage locations and conduits for flow depending on storage conditions storm intensity and season the epikarst can present as a highly complex black box system that makes quantifying its critical zone processes challenging but conceptually it is an issue of scale and data resolution in being able to model its broader processes as demonstrated herein and generalizing them in a way that accurately represents the input output processes fig 6 collectively these dynamics of the system are important to account for when examining various processes related to carbon flux contaminant storage and transport paleoclimate reconstructions and flooding although there is complexity it is likely consistently complex between sites our results suggest that the time it takes the signal to reach our monitoring points differs between study sites however the pattern of how the system responds is similar this difference in timing of the response is likely a result of the scale of these basins each measured analyte has a different response to a storm event but as suggested by liu et al 2007 and yang et al 2012 these responses are driven by seasonality and rainfall intensity these similarities between systems may allow for a deeper understanding of biogeochemical cycling and contaminant transport through the critical zone pronk et al 2008 lerch et al 2018 our results suggest that the shallow subsurface soil and vegetation may play an important role in controlling fluxes through the karst system as research continues on epikarst applying these methods to other sites in different climates and lithologies is needed to determine if the findings are more broadly applicable additionally understanding the role of soils will be critical in developing more broadly applicable conceptual models of subsurface processes in karst understanding the role these parts of the unsaturated zone play in modifying flux signals will improve our understanding of the impact of critical zone processes on the saturated zone of karst

4746,the epikarst is an area of complex interactions and processes and is an important component of the critical zone understanding how processes in the epikarst are similar and different between sites is of the utmost importance in determining how information about these systems can be used to understand broader concepts and implications in the unsaturated zone of karst systems we looked at two sites in separate karst regions of kentucky usa to assess patterns in storm response of epikarst systems using discharge and analytes including ph temperature specific conductance and turbidity as markers of epikarst processes we assessed how each of these parameters responded to storm pulses comparing between sites and seasons leaf on vs leaf off our results show that hysteresis patterns vary between analyte and season but there are consistent patterns between sites regression modeling of cross correlation results show that storm intensity drives the timing of storm responses whereas precipitation total drives how strongly the analytes correlate to discharge response across both sites analytes respond similarly with the lag in response likely tied to the size of the basin the similarity in response of the study sites suggests that the processes controlling transport through the epikarst are consistent across sites the influence of a storm event and season on these responses highlight the importance of further study of soil and near surface processes on controlling geochemical responses in the epikarst keywords epikarst groundwater dynamics karst springs hysteresis 1 introduction critical zone studies have been the focus of many research endeavors in recent years focusing on the dynamic surface and near surface of the earth from the tops of the trees to active moving groundwater white et al 2015 the behavior of this part of earth s surface and near surface is critical to our understanding of how anthropogenic activities impact the environment richter and mobley 2009 in carbonate terrain epikarst is an integral part of the critical zone williams 1983 2004 2008 and research on it has been ongoing since the 1970 s often highlighting its role in the overall behavior of karst groundwater systems kiraly et al 1995 bakalowicz 2004 the epikarst plays a crucial role in the geochemical evolution of groundwater pronk et al 2008 speleogenesis klimchouk 1995 2000 2004 subsurface ecosystem dynamics pipan and culver 2013 fluxes of sediment and nutrients through the system and maintenance of low flow conditions in the vadose zone of karst aquifers williams 2008 although considered to be part of the unsaturated zone the epikarst provides significant water storage perrin et al 2003 jacob et al 2009 the lack of evaporative signal in drip water isotopes in caves indicates that water leaves the root zone quickly polk et al 2013 schwartz et al 2013 and can be stored for months hu et al 2015 the amount of storage in these systems is likely driven by the overall thickness of the epikarst zhang et al 2013 however how these systems respond to precipitation is likely driven by some combination of rainfall intensity liu et al 2007 and antecedent conditions schwartz et al 2013 in addition seasonal variability in soil and vegetation dynamics may play a significant role in how water moves through and is stored in the epikarst yang et al 2012 researchers studying solute and particulate movement through the epikarst have not found a consistent relationship between water response to storms and other monitored parameters research suggests that particulates arrive at monitoring points ahead of solutes pronk et al 2008 however solutes do not show a consistent pattern in how they move through the system total organic carbon toc fecal coliform and agricultural contaminants all have differing responses relative to each other pronk et al 2008 found that both fecal coliform and toc were delayed relative to discharge peaks with fecal coliform preceding toc lerch et al 2018 found that atrazine lagged two months from surface application to arrival at an epikarst monitoring site with only a small amount of the contaminant being mobilized in that period indicating that additional processes may control its mobility other research has suggested that the response of solutes as with discharge may be driven by rainfall intensity liu et al 2007 and seasonality yang et al 2012 understanding these controls is critical in describing how water solutes and particulates move through the subsurface with projections of climate change indicating significant changes to precipitation patterns understanding the relationships between precipitation water solute and particulate transfer through the unsaturated zone is critical in protecting groundwater resources although the epikarst is known to play a significant role in critical zone processes conceptual models still fall short in conceptualizing the relationship between fluxes through the epikarst at scale larger than a single site liu et al 2007 pronk et al 2008 polk et al 2013 schwartz et al 2013 hu et al 2015 as climate change drives more intense extreme weather patterns understanding this relationship is critical to predicting how karst systems as a whole will respond to changing precipitation regimes we used the storm response behaviors of two epikarst systems to determine how storm intensity frequency and season drive fluxes through the epikarst critical zone 2 methodology 2 1 study sites to assess the storm responses of perennial epikarst systems we focused on two sites that have continuous flow from subsurface storage areas 30 m thick one is a small cave spring and the other is an in cave waterfall fig 1 both sites are located in flat lying mississippian limestones in central kentucky the high density of sinkholes in the area are indicative of a well developed and soil mantled epikarst system as the dominant source of water storage for the spring this has resulted in a well developed epikarst and four primary storage areas in the subsurface soil epikarst bedrock and conduits fig 2 winters december march are cold with lows reaching below freezing summers june september are warm with high temperatures regularly exceeding 30c there is a slight seasonality to precipitation with september and october slightly drier 8 10 cm standard deviation 4 46 cm than the rest of the year 10 84 cm per month standard deviation 4 98 cm based on records from 1895 to 2016 kentucky climate center data 2020 most vegetation in the region is deciduous which results in a large difference in plant water use between leaf on april october and leaf off november march seasons since irrigation is not typically used in this region we assumed that there is a greater impact on recharge to the epikarst due to seasonality of transpiration as opposed to seasonality of precipitation 2 1 1 homeplace farm homeplace on green river is a working farm that is owned and operated as a 501 c 3 nonprofit organization near campbellsville kentucky the majority of the land is agricultural with limited forested land along the incised drainages leading to the green river to the south karst development on the farm occurs in the reef member of the fort payne formation the reef member is a thin limestone unit that is intermittent throughout the region and is underlain by shales krause and meyer 2004 as a result there are numerous sinkholes in the study site as well as numerous springs emerging at the contact between the limestone and shale unit this has resulted in a relatively thin area of karstification with the springs emerging 20 m in elevation below the top of the sinkholes taylor and tobin 2020 dye tracing in the area following the procedures of currens 2013 delineated the groundwater basin for cave spring the largest spring in the area taylor and tobin 2020 dye tracing efforts also highlighted that all of the spring flow is generated by recharge through aquifers however no shallow aquifer is documented in the region 2 1 2 crumps cave crumps cave is a preserve owned and managed by western kentucky university located 1 km northwest of the town of smiths grove in northern warren county kentucky at an elevation of 194 m the cave is formed within the upper part of the st louis limestone previous studies have established a connection between drainage infiltrating from an adjacent row crop field and the in cave waterfall study site waterfall 1 wf1 extensive dye tracing has established flowtimes of minutes to hours from the surface to wf1 and indicates an estimated recharge area of 100 m2 which varies based on antecedent moisture conditions and storm magnitude miller 2011 lerch et al 2018 the waterfall is 25 m below the surface and emerges from the ceiling of crumps cave where water drains from the bottom of the epikarst water also moves 200 m laterally flowing westward along the dip of the bedrock between the surface and ceiling of crumps cave transport times from the surface are dependent upon soil pathways and thickness approximately 3 m varying within the epikarst and complex flowpaths governing the hydraulic regime based on head pressure dynamics under seasonal and storm conditions bandy et al 2017 lerch et al 2018 jackson and polk 2019 land cover in the vicinity of the cave is predominantly pasture and cropland usda nass 2011 additional site details are provided in miller 2011 and the supplemental materials in lerch et al 2018 2 2 field data collection 2 2 1 karst hydrogeologic inventory prior to this study karst at crumps cave has been documented through a series of previous studies groves et al 2005 miller 2011 vanderhoff 2011 polk et al 2013 lerch et al 2018 however research on the karst at homeplace at green river has been limited a thorough karst hydrogeologic inventory of the site and provided a basic overview of the hydrogeology of the system taylor and tobin 2020 2 2 2 instrumentation both sites were instrumented to measure precipitation discharge and water quality at homeplace precipitation was monitored using a tipping bucket rain gage located in the agricultural area of the farm a data logger was maintained at the cave spring to continuously measure temperature turbidity specific conductance oxidation reduction potential nitrate concentration and total suspended solids these data were coupled with one of three discharge measurements using an h flume compound weir or a stage discharge rating curve because successive floods destroyed the previous gaging instrumentation taylor and tobin 2020 all instruments were calibrated on a biweekly schedule for the duration of the study within the groundwater basin of cave spring a tipping bucket rain gage was installed for the duration of the project collecting data at a 10 min resolution at the crumps cave research site a weather station was installed to continuously measure meteorological conditions within the drainage area of the cave at 10 min resolution groves et al 2013 inside the cave at waterfall 1 wf1 a custom designed weir described in groves et al 2013 was used to monitor discharge flow from wf1 is directed into a reservoir beneath the structure supporting the weir within the reservoir two multiparameter water quality sondes continuously measured geochemistry parameters at 10 min resolution the parameters measured were ph specific conductance temperature and turbidity the method of using two sondes was employed as a redundancy data downloading and sonde calibrations were completed weekly and all data corrections were applied to the annual dataset 2 3 data analysis previous work has shown that storm discharge responses lag behind precipitation events depending on antecedent conditions and storm intensity schwartz et al 2013 in order to look at dominant components of the hydrologic system during flood pulses we assumed this lag exists and tested to determine what patterns control other responses in the system relative to the hydrograph response including temperature ph specific conductance and turbidity storm events during the study period february 2018 january 2019 were separated into leaf on may october and leaf off november april periods and then the hysteresis of each parameter was plotted following the methods of toran and reisch 2013 these plots were then categorized based on the classification of evans and davies 1998 based on the direction and pattern of responses non looping patterns were identified as linear simple loops were classified based on direction of loop clockwise vs counterclockwise and more complex loops were classified as a figure eight or complex these responses were then classified based on the seasonality of plant water use leaf on vs leaf off in addition to hysteresis plotting the cross correlation between all analytes and discharge was calculated the resulting peak lag time and correlation coefficient at the time of peak lag were used as response variables in separate linear regression models with metrics of precipitation antecedent conditions season hysteretic response and site used as predictors table 1 site was included in models as both an additive and interactive variable to account for potential impacts that site would have on both the slope and intercept of these relationships the lag time of the cross correlation represents how long it took each analyte to respond the fit of the correlation represents how similar the analyte response was to the discharge response the predictors for precipitation storm event total and intensity and antecedent conditions seven and 30 day precipitation totals were quantitative values all other predictors were treated as categorical data the value of the cross correlation fit was squared to address a large number of values with strong negative and strong positive correlation values and the cross correlation lag was square rooted to address skewness in the data for each response variable multiple linear regression models were run and akaike information criterion aic was conducted to determine the best fit model burnham and anderson 2002 3 results 3 1 storm response patterns during the winter fig 3 discharge and turbidity have similar responses an initial increase followed by a long recession temperature and specific conductance have the opposite response a steep decrease during the storm pulse followed by a gradual return to pre storm conditions a similar but more complex pattern occurs for ph as for temperature and specific conductance initial drop and gradual return to pre storm conditions however the gradual rise is punctuated by occasional drops in ph summer storm responses are typically more complex and responsive to smaller events than those of winter storms fig 4 although the general pattern is the same for all parameters the patterns typically exhibit more variability in how the system returns to baseflow conditions after a storm event 3 2 hysteresis responses hysteresis response differed between season and analyte and no analyte responded identically to every storm event leaf off responses tended to be simpler fig 5 whereas leaf on responses had a tendency to be more complex fig 6 with a wider variety of response times for each analyte whereas leaf off responses were more consistent for each analyte table 2 all analytes assessed in table 2 had a minimum of two different types of responses and a maximum of five different 3 3 regression modeling of 25 regression models of cross correlation lag time aic results showed one likely model within two aic units the model included event intensity analytes site and an interaction between site and analyte as predictor variables table 3 the model was significant p 0 001 with an r2 value of 0 492 this model shows that each site and analyte have different response lag times to storm events these variables show that crumps cave has a shorter lag time than homeplace of the analytes ph has the fastest response followed by specific conductance turbidity and then temperature the analytes also vary in the relationship between response time based on site all analytes have a steeper slope at homeplace as indicated by the analyte site variable in table 3 in addition at both sites lag time is also driven by storm intensity more intense storms have a quicker response the fit of the cross correlation at the peak lag time shows one likely model 2 aic unit difference table 4 the best fit model includes analyte season and total event precipitation this model was significant p 0 001 with an r2 value of 0 22 the fit of the analyte response to storm events varied by analyte fit of the cross correlation decreased during leaf on seasons each analyte showed different fits with specific conductance showing the strongest fit between discharge and analyte response and temperature showing the weakest fit total event precipitation showed that with increasing event totals there was a decrease in fit of the analyte relative to the discharge curve the inclusion of site in the lag time model but not the correlation fit model suggests that the timing of the response varied between sites but not in the way the system responds 4 discussion many studies discuss the epikarst being a transition zone that plays a role in both storage and recharge klimchouk 2000 aquilina et al 2006 the evolution of allogenic water and dissolution processes being formative to the karst landscape williams 2008 gabrovšek et al 2018 while our data shows that the geochemical behavior of flow through the system varies substantially table 2 figs 5 and 6 it also suggests that these functions are relatively consistent between sites and are governed by a set of feedback processes likely associated with the activated hydrologic pathways hysteresis models suggest that we are primarily dealing with two flow paths in the system which can be interpreted as slower flow path ways through the epikarst and faster flow path ways through conduits davies and beven 2015 differences in hysteretic response is likely driven by a combination of antecedent conditions storm amount and storm intensity when epikarst storage has been flushed prior to the observed storm event then a change in the hysteresis response is expected toran and reisch 2013 additionally the total storm amount and intensity will drive the relative responses of the epikarst and the conduit flow tritz et al 2011 zhang et al 2020 the interaction of these factors is the likely cause of the numerous small hysteretic loops seen in the storm responses at both sites figs 5 and 6 our regression models support this and show that storm intensity and site likely representing dominant flow lengths are critical variables in understanding how quickly a site will respond to a storm event conversely how physiochemical variables respond is more closely tied to the total quantity of precipitation and plant water use based on the leaf on vs leaf off response however how the system responds is independent of site this suggests that while activation of epikarst pathways is linked to storm characteristics season how the system response is similar across sites while the timing is variable it is clear that when responses occur they alter the hydrologic and geochemical nature of the system for a period these processes can be complex and spatially heterogeneous seasonality of responses highlights the impacts of climate and near surface critical zone processes evapotranspiration carbon cycling etc on the response of the epikarst system 4 1 conceptual model the regression models of cross correlation data suggest there is consistency in how each analyte responds during a storm pulse across sites but the timing of that response varies by site and season this variability in lag is likely tied to the difference in scale of the basins feeding each site although the homeplace site responses are larger in scale their response times have more lag than the crumps cave responses this can likely be explained by the travel time through the system with a larger basin more time is needed for the geochemical responses to propagate through the system though responses are fairly rapid at both sites although this difference is real the actual fit of the geochemical response relative to the hydrograph response is consistent between sites figs 3 and 4 these sites differ slightly in geology and discharge magnitude but the response of the epikarst system to storm events is similar at both sites the measured parameters individually respond differently but consistently to storms depending on season and storm size and intensity this indicates that not only is each variable influenced by different processes within the subsurface but that there are common governing processes within the epikarst as a system these responses allowed us to develop a conceptual model fig 7 for how these myriad factors interplay precipitation amount and intensity simplified into major and minor storms is the initial driver of the outflow response once precipitation is on the ground the storm event signal is then driven by infiltration and flowpath interactions the activation of these flowpaths vary seasonally likely a result of changes in evapotranspiration rates associated with plant water use these patterns result in feedback loops that ultimately control the physiochemical responses of the epikarst fig 7 4 1 1 storm event influences rainfall magnitude and intensity are the ultimate drivers of whether or not fast flow or slow flow pathways dominate the storm response signal in the resulting water geochemistry the intensity and magnitude of a recharge event and resultant hydraulic head created within the system will dictate the signal of the water draining from the epikarst system this signal will in turn be driven by mixing between fast and slow flow pathways baker et al 2020 during larger and more intense events the fast flow paths may activate more quickly whereas recharging low flow paths that become saturated during an event may cause a delay in low flow signals fig 7 our results indicate that more intense faster flow events create a larger response that also reduces the lag time based on the intensity of the event the response and recovery pattern seen in the hydrographs for both study sites indicate that during multiple events fig 4 the system attempts to recover to baseflow and the speed of this is likely dictated by the antecedent moisture conditions preceding each event 4 1 2 epikarst flowpaths multiple flowpaths within the epikarst govern the rate amount and connectivity between the surface and the ultimate drains that contribute to the groundwater flow regime the heterogeneity of the epikarst its connection to the broader regional aquifer and the complexity of modeling recharge dynamics have been studied in detail labat et al 2000 aquilina et al 2006 williams 2008 yet few studies isolate and examine the interrelationship between these factors on the hydrologic and geochemical behavior of this part of the system within the context of season storm and surface influences our results suggest that the epikarst is a nested scaled down version of the regional karst aquifer with similar processes governing the system response regression models of the response of each parameter to storm events show that intensity and season a proxy for near surface processes are important factors in explaining the response of each parameter similar to what other research has shown ollivier et al 2020 the pathway through which water moves through the soil column determines how that water contributes to vadose recharge into primary matrix and secondary fracture permeability zones which have slow and fast flow responses respectively these zones reach maximum flow and storage capabilities based on storm intensity and duration and seasonality although our results do not show antecedent conditions as a primary predictor of response other research e g schwartz et al 2013 has clearly shown antecedent conditions to also be a critical factor in governing epikarst system response because variability in antecedent conditions during our study period was minimal our data may have been insufficient to identify these conditions as a controlling factor 4 1 3 seasonal influences our conceptual model which is layered in its presentation of the epikarst flow system considers seasonality a dominating driver of how the system responds based on the influence of evapotranspiration temperature and antecedent moisture conditions storage homogenizes well during the leaf off season which coincides with the start of the drier season slower flow conditions allow matrix drainage to dominate the epikarst system ollivier et al 2020 baker et al 2020 at the start of the leaf on season storage amounts are higher than at the beginning of the leaf off season this results in a reduced threshold to activate fast flow pathways and the epikarst drainage becomes more heterogeneous however as the season proceeds evapotranspiration can modify pressure differentials in the subsurface altering the response of the epikarst system to storm events the feedback between evapotranspiration and water storage can even have a measurable effect during fall and winter months despite primarily leaf off conditions intensity continues to be a primary driver during all seasons because even during baseflow conditions following a prolonged drought such as in late summer 2018 storms of a certain intensity can overcome the evapotranspiration threshold and exceed the storage flow rate to activate secondary pathways and result in a direct increase in discharge and geochemical change to the epikarst groundwater system 4 1 4 physiochemical responses physiochemical responses are more complex and often influenced by conditions beyond recharge for example ph has a highly complex response and previous work has suggested the added influence of evapotranspiration and surface temperature which can play a role in the amount of co2 produced within the system can be a driver in how this analyte responds jackson and polk 2019 their findings suggest these soil and surface processes drive the annual variability in co2 the signal of this in the epikarst waters is then superimposed by storm event responses to cause short term changes this complexity provides a potential explanation for lagged responses in our model turbidity in contrast to ph has a much more consistent response increasing with increasing storm intensity likely from fast flow paths being activated however during smaller events in which water enters storage turbidity responses may lag storm recharge or have almost no response within the system this further supports the concept of differing flow pathways being a driver of lag times and hydrogeochemical responses within the epikarst specific conductance tends to respond quickly along with temperature during intense events regardless of season albeit with a more attenuated magnitude during smaller events or drier periods although variable responses of physio chemical parameters has often been documented li et al 2008 jackson and polk 2019 this study demonstrated a common response in these parameters in the epikarst system between sites furthering the concept that it is the zone governing many of these processes due to the complex interactions within the critical surface soil rock zone regardless of site variability our data indicate that the primary drivers of physiochemical responses are seasonality and storm events even though each analyte responds differently our results indicate that the soil rock interface processes tend to lead the response of the vadose drains within the epikarst thus indicating that the lag in geochemical parameters in part can be attributed to whether slow or fast flow pathways dominate the event and the amount of homogenization occurring which may influence the piston effect to lead the storm response this agrees with other studies attempting to model the geochemical pathways of epikarstic and epiphreatic flow aquilina et al 2006 gabrovšek et al 2018 while also demonstrating these pathways result in similar responses between sites an important aspect of the conceptual model regarding lead and lag times is that often the geochemical parameters do not return to their original baseflow value as the falling limb continues to recede figs 3 4 7 the system tends not to recover as smoothly or quickly to its previous steady state instead becoming more chaotic and responsive based on additional influencing factors such as future storms particularly during leaf on conditions more simply stated certain parameters in the system such as temperature ph and discharge do not return to their original baseflow values and therefore predispose the system to have a lead on responding to the next event during leaf on conditions this is clearly visible in the storm response figs 3 6 as such the epikarst should be viewed as a staged response system that shifts in equilibrium over time and conditions to accommodate the storage discharge potential dictated by the current level of saturation which can change rapidly on the order of days to weeks due to the efficiency of the well developed pathways and reservoirs in the system that both store and transmit recharge under varying hydrologic conditions fig 7 4 2 feedback systems the epikarst conceptual model presented here fig 7 accounts for a complex system of lead and lag responses affecting both hydrologic and geochemical responses we suggest that the epikarst serves as a nested aquifer system that acts in many ways like a broader regional aquifer albeit at a smaller scale klimchouk 2000 ollivier et al 2020 responses are both direct and indirect and must be examined at a broader temporal scale to account for the nature of the lead lag response of the system both seasonally and during individual storm events under baseflow conditions the system achieves a steady state condition that creates a potential for lags in certain parameters e g discharge response temperature ph caused by precipitation entering storage unless a certain storm event threshold is exceeded to cause direct flow through the epikarst in fractures to immediate drains into the broader aquifer system leads occur during conditions of higher saturation when the system is primed to have more rapid response in discharge conductivity pulses of storage water leading the storm event and turbidity more turbulent flow the important aspect of the conceptual model presented here fig 7 is the integration of the cross correlation parameters that identify the epikarst response across these conditions when the system is in flux which is typically during seasonal change or variability in the intensity or magnitude of storm events when affected by high evapotranspiration et effective recharge may be attenuated by et even during winter if storm events are low in intensity and duration and storage is available in the system when thresholds of intensity duration and storage are not reached by a given storm event little to no discharge response occurs in the epikarst drains during precipitation events because of the water entering storage or undergoing et processes in the soil interface zone the rapid and immediate effects of surface factors such as temperature and soil thickness are consistent across sites and apparent in our results as indicated in other recent studies examining the hydrogeochemical response over varying seasons lerch et al 2018 jackson and polk 2019 the responses seen in the monitored parameters must be considered within the three dimensional nature of the epikarst system and account for how varying pathways are activated both during baseflow and saturated conditions for example as storage reservoirs fill during a storm event and begin to spill over into faster drainage pathways their contribution will have a different geochemical signature of storage recharge water aquilina et al 2006 because of mixing this mixing of water causes changes in the epikarstic flow during storm events and careful scrutiny of the hydrograph is required in order to determine the pulses of storage versus storm water and their respective geochemical signature these pulses can even occur multiple times during an event based on fluctuating intensity storage water will typically have a higher ph and specific conductance because of longer residence time whereas storm pulses tend to drive the values lower for both as meteoric water saturated with co2 enters the system and fast flows through diffuse pathways storage pulses lead the rainfall and lags are created during baseflow conditions in which slowly leaking matrix flow feeds epikarst drains and maintains a relatively steady geochemical signature until a storm event arrives even so smaller storm events under dry conditions may cause no change in the system s discharge or geochemical parameters thus the epikarst serves as a system of storage areas and drains similar to documented patterns of karst aquifer development at a larger scale palmer 2007 5 conclusion collectively the results presented here suggest the epikarst is governed by a complex system of annual seasonal and storm event responses that lead and lag depending on the parameter being examined and thus should be studied both temporally and spatially while keeping in mind the concurrent processes affecting the hydrogeochemical responses additional factors that include soil thickness insoluble layers and secondary calcite precipitation may also influence the hysteretic relationships within the epikarst on a local scale the epikarst aquifer system is governed by a series of feedback systems supported by the data presented herein which suggest that a multi state model for epikarst flow dynamics is most appropriate when trying to predict responsiveness during any given condition the epikarst system is more complex and convoluted than typical conduit flow systems at depth because of the influence of these myriad factors which indicate that recharge discharge dynamics are influenced by both hydrogeologic and surface factors combined with the ability for these fast and slow flow components of the system to act as both storage locations and conduits for flow depending on storage conditions storm intensity and season the epikarst can present as a highly complex black box system that makes quantifying its critical zone processes challenging but conceptually it is an issue of scale and data resolution in being able to model its broader processes as demonstrated herein and generalizing them in a way that accurately represents the input output processes fig 6 collectively these dynamics of the system are important to account for when examining various processes related to carbon flux contaminant storage and transport paleoclimate reconstructions and flooding although there is complexity it is likely consistently complex between sites our results suggest that the time it takes the signal to reach our monitoring points differs between study sites however the pattern of how the system responds is similar this difference in timing of the response is likely a result of the scale of these basins each measured analyte has a different response to a storm event but as suggested by liu et al 2007 and yang et al 2012 these responses are driven by seasonality and rainfall intensity these similarities between systems may allow for a deeper understanding of biogeochemical cycling and contaminant transport through the critical zone pronk et al 2008 lerch et al 2018 our results suggest that the shallow subsurface soil and vegetation may play an important role in controlling fluxes through the karst system as research continues on epikarst applying these methods to other sites in different climates and lithologies is needed to determine if the findings are more broadly applicable additionally understanding the role of soils will be critical in developing more broadly applicable conceptual models of subsurface processes in karst understanding the role these parts of the unsaturated zone play in modifying flux signals will improve our understanding of the impact of critical zone processes on the saturated zone of karst

4747,precipitation extremes are recognized as one of the main factors that influence annual runoff and sediment yield in specific watersheds however it is not clear whether precipitation extremes account accurately for the variability in runoff and sediment yield for different karst watersheds especially in climate sensitive areas such as the karst critical zone of southwest china the objective of this study was to quantify the relative importance of the 11 precipitation extremes variables that explain the total variance in annual runoff and sediment yield with a boosted regression tree brt model for 40 typical karst watersheds in southwest china results indicated that the most important precipitation extremes for annual runoff and sediment yield were heavy precipitation amount consecutive dry days heavy precipitation days consecutive wet days and rainstorm amount the brt model accounted for 76 of the variation in runoff which demonstrated that precipitation extremes were crucial factors for generating runoff although precipitation extremes had significant effects on sediment yield the brt model only explained 32 of the variability in sediment yield hydrogeological conditions and dam construction in these karst watersheds may be responsible for the difference in total variance explained by the brt model between annual runoff and sediment yield because of the inherent nonlinearity present in many hydrological systems the brt model provided a robust capability to generate data driven objective insight into complex relationships we recommend this model for the application of non stationary and nonlinear hydrological processes keywords soil erosion climate non linear relationship boosted regression tree model karst critical zone ecohydrology 1 introduction karst landforms with an area of 22 million km2 occupy approximately 12 of the earth s continental surface and supply almost 25 of freshwater resources in the world ford and williams 2007 gutiérrez et al 2014 hartmann et al 2014 goldscheider et al 2020 as one of the largest contiguous karst regions in the world southwest china is featured by special geology rugged geomorphology heterogeneous landscapes rich biodiversity complex hydrogeology and fragile ecosystems jiang et al 2014 martin et al 2018 tong et al 2020 many of these karst regions have experienced an overwhelming rate of karst rocky desertification which generally causes surface water scarcity yan and cai 2015 wang et al 2019a this surface water shortage in these karst mountainous territories is becoming a serious threat to effective ecological restoration sustainable development of resources and the health of the environment qin et al 2015 jiang et al 2020 furthermore the karst region of southwest china is also experiencing severe soil erosion zeng et al 2018 li et al 2020a in this karst region the warm and moist climate generally enhanced weathering and pedogenesis peng and wang 2012 wang et al 2019a however most of the carbonate rocks are soluble and cannot produce much soil goldscheider et al 2010 wang et al 2004 li et al 2019 actually the insoluble pure carbonate rock components only accounted for 4 of the total area on average and therefore the soil formation rate was very low feng et al 2016 with similar climates the soil formation rate in non karst regions can be 100 times greater than that of karst regions jiang et al 2014 previous studies have shown that it would take 250 000 850 000 years to produce a 100 cm thickness of soil by dissolving a 25 m thickness of carbonate rocks jiang et al 2014 wang et al 2019a the soil layer in karst regions would be extremely difficult to recover once it is lost a better understanding of the temporal and spatial variation in runoff and sediment yield is thus of paramount importance to cope with current and future water scarcity and to control soil erosion in the karst critical zone effectively in recent decades climate extremes occurred frequently in southwest china and massive droughts and floods caused enormous societal economic and ecological losses qiu 2010 li et al 2012 recent studies also showed that climate extremes such as droughts or floods were projected to become more frequent more severe and more widespread throughout southwest china liu et al 2015 generally precipitation extremes are assumed to be very important factors that influence both hydrological and erosion processes for example dai et al 2008a found that extreme drought exerted substantial influence on runoff and contributed 45 of the runoff loss in 2006 of the yangtze river some studies also showed that the floods driven by precipitation extremes usually comprised a high proportion of runoff for a specific watershed walther et al 2002 pecl et al 2017 for sediment yield a few precipitation extreme events can produce a large amount of sediment which probably accounted for the vast majority of annual soil loss poesen and hooke 1997 estrany et al 2010 warrick et al 2004 revealed that 50 of the annual sediment load was transported by the largest 1 5 days of flooding gonzalez hidalgo et al 2010 also indicated that the 3 largest and 10 largest erosive events contributed on average 38 and 61 of the total sediment load respectively therefore it is essential to evaluate the effect of precipitation extremes on runoff and sediment yield in karst regions of southwest china because this fragile ecosystem experiences more frequent precipitation extremes the variables for precipitation extremes were generally multicollinear which probably yielded potentially misleading results li et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 furthermore the relationships between some of these variables and runoff or sediment yield were highly nonlinear li et al 2020b the hydrological variables and sediment yield were generally non stationary because they had means variances and covariances that varied over time she et al 2015 chang et al 2019 vu and mishra 2019 in reality the changes in runoff and sediment concentration or yield in alluvial rivers would probably be highly nonlinear in nature kuai and tsai 2012 kumar et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 to solve this problem the recently developed method of boosted regression trees brt not only handles highly correlated noise corrupted data sets but they also fit complex nonlinear relationships with threshold patterns elith et al 2008 bhatt et al 2013 wang et al 2019b in the model the boosting algorithm works by fitting individual regression trees in a forward and thus the final brt is a combination of many trees generally hundreds or thousands by shrinking the contribution of each tree and averaging across the final selected set boosting produces a final model that is more robust than a single regression tree model and enables nonlinear functions to be modelled therefore brt automatically captures nonlinearities and handles interactions among predictor variables recently nolan et al 2018 also indicated that the brt model can be used to identify the degree and direction of influence of the predictor variables and it can successfully provide additional insight by revealing nonlinear and non monotonic responses in addition to improving the accuracy of the predictability the brt method can also provide insight into mechanisms e g hydrological process brts have been applied successfully in many fields such as lemology remote sensing meteorology soil science and ecology elith et al 2008 pouteau et al 2011 bhatt et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 zabret et al 2018 wang et al 2019b yet the brt model has not been applied extensively in the hydrological sciences in the karst region of southwest china furthermore previous studies focused on the effects of precipitation extremes on runoff and sediment yield for a specific watershed dai et al 2008a estrany et al 2010 li et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 it is not clear whether precipitation extremes explain the variability in runoff and sediment yield for different watersheds with precision especially in climate sensitive areas such as a karst area of southwest china therefore this research provides an opportunity to test the applicability of an exploratory model i e brt for analyzing the effects of precipitation extremes on the annual runoff and sediment yield in a model environment that accounts for nonlinear and nonstationary phenomena the objectives of this study were to investigate the temporal and spatial variation in annual runoff and sediment yield to identify the dominant precipitation extremes that influenced runoff and sediment yield and to further test whether the precipitation extremes explained the variability in runoff and sediment yield for 40 selected karst watersheds of southwest china addressing these objectives can improve our understanding of how runoff and sediment yield respond to precipitation extremes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the typical karst region of the xijiang 21 36 27 00 n 102 16 113 23 e 3 5 105 km2 elevation 2 2866 m and wujiang watersheds 26 09 30 12 n 104 15 109 20 e 8 79 104 km2 elevation 113 2888 m in southwest china were selected as study areas fig 1 a the karst coverage for these watersheds was 43 5 and 77 2 respectively fig 1b the xijiang river is the largest tributary of the pearl river which is the second largest river in terms of mean annual runoff in china the xijiang river passes through four provinces that include yunnan guizhou guangxi and guangdong provinces and it eventually flows into the south sea this watershed is located in the subtropical to tropical monsoon climate zones with a mean annual temperature and precipitation that ranges from 14 to 22 c and from 1000 to 2200 mm respectively the distribution of precipitation during the year is uneven and 80 of it falls between april and october during 1955 2015 the mean annual runoff and sediment yield of the xijiang river were 651 mm and 184 t km 2 respectively the wujiang river is a southern tributary of the yangtze river with a total length of 1037 km it originates in the yunnan guizhou plateau and flows through yunnan guizhou chongqing and hubei provinces the wujiang watershed is featured by a subtropical monsoon humid climate with mean annual precipitation that ranges from 850 to 1600 mm the precipitation has a distinct spatial pattern and decreases from east to west and from south to north during 1955 2015 the mean annual runoff and sediment yield of the wujiang river were 552 mm and 273 t km 2 respectively in this study 40 sub watersheds were selected with 29 and 11 hydrologic observation stations located in xijiang and wujiang watersheds respectively fig 1c table 1 2 2 database daily meteorological data which included precipitation air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed and direction of 52 meteorological stations for the period 2009 2012 were downloaded from the china meteorological data network the datasets for daily runoff and sediment concentration were obtained from the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china the dem which had a resolution of 30 m 30 m was obtained from the geospatial data cloud based on the dem and the locations of the 40 hydrological observation stations the boundary of each sub watershed was mapped using arcgis software in recent years the chinese government initiated ecological engineering projects e g grain for green mountain closure to prevent soil erosion and to restore the degraded environment as a result soil erosion in karst regions of southwest china decreased and the monthly and annual sediment yield were relatively stable during 2009 2012 fig s1 and fig s2 therefore the time period between 2009 and 2012 was selected for this study runoff and sediment yield were only observed in 2009 for the liyutang hydrologic station thus the runoff and sediment yield data points both included 157 observations from 40 hydrologic stations during 2009 2012 2 3 potential climatic variables that influenced annual runoff and sediment yield using the daily meteorological data 11 precipitation extremes variables and 6 general climatic variables were defined and constructed as the potential factors that controlled annual runoff and sediment yield in previous studies these climatic variables were commonly used to investigate the spatial variability associated with climate change and hence may influence annual runoff and sediment yield significantly zhang et al 2012 sillmann et al 2013 li et al 2017 table 2 for example for precipitation extremes consecutive dry days cdd was used to indicate extreme dry events and longer cdd implied more severe meteorological drought the heavy precipitation amount r25 and annual maximum consecutive 5 day precipitation rx5 represented wet events where a high value of rx5 generally suggested that a flood had occurred for general climatic variables rainy days rds were defined as those days with precipitation 1 mm the threshold of 1 mm precipitation in the definition of rds was applied to avoid artificial trends because some observers failed to report small rainfall amounts potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated using the penman method penman 1948 which is one of the best formulas to capture climate change arcgis 10 3 software was used to interpolate all of the meteorological data by the cokriging interpolation algorithm and then the spatially averaged climatic variables were calculated for each sub watershed 2 4 boosted regression trees brt the boosted regression trees brt model was used to identify the precipitation extremes variables that were most relevant in explaining the variation in annual runoff and sediment yield brt is a statistical learning method that includes regression trees and boosting to fit many individual regression trees in a forward step wise manner before combining them into a final predictive model elith et al 2008 brt has the advantage of handling different types of explanatory variables and missing data without the need for data transformation and it effectively fits complex nonlinear relationships and automatically models interactions between variables bhatt et al 2013 rice et al 2015 the excellent performance of brt can overcome the problem of multicollinearity and prevent overfitting nolan et al 2018 wang et al 2019b all brt analyses were conducted in r software by using the gbm package ridgeway 2019 brt model performance was determined by the learning rate bag fraction tree complexity and cross validation elith et al 2008 the contribution of each tree to the growing model was controlled by the learning rate and the proportion of data used for model building at each step was determined by the bag fraction tree complexity indicated the number of nodes in a tree and regulated the level of interactions in a boosted regression tree model the cross validation method identified the optimal number of trees in the brt model elith et al 2008 by repeated trial and error the optimal brt model had a learning rate of 0 005 a bag fraction of 0 5 a tree complexity of 5 and a 10 fold cross validation technically the brt model is similar to the function x as an additive expansion of the base learner i e a small tree friedman 2002 1 f x f 0 x α 1 f 1 x α 2 f 2 x α m f m x where α m is the expansion coefficient and m is the number of iterations using the training data an individual base learner generally cannot create a satisfactory prediction but it can boost the performance of the prediction results using a series of regression trees with the lowest residuals by using an iterative algorithm a new regression tree h x r lm l l can divide the x space into l disjoint regions r lm l l and predict a constant value at each iteration m de ath 2007 yan et al 2019 2 h x r lm l l l 1 l y lm x r lm 3 y im ψ y i f x i f x i f x f m 1 x where y lm is the mean of pseudo residuals in each region r lm at the mth iteration y im subsequently the approximation f m 1 x is updated for each of the corresponding regions 2002 xenochristou et al 2020 4 f m x f m 1 x v γ lm x r lm 5 γ lm arg r min x i r lm ψ y i f m 1 x i γ where v 0 1 is the shrinkage parameter that dominates the procedure of the learning rate generally the small values of v 0 1 led to a much better generalization error friedman 2002 the partial dependence and relative importance of each predictor variable can also be derived from the brt model elith et al 2008 nolan et al 2014 the partial dependence of each predictor was calculated by partial dependence functions which implied how the predicted response variable was influenced by each predictor variable after accounting for the average effects of the remaining predictors in the model snelder et al 2009 zabret et al 2018 although the brt model had the capacity to constrain overfitting some overfitting may still have occurred in the partial dependence plots thus only the main trends in the dependence plots were discussed to avoid assessing these potential spurious results the relative importance of each predictor was applied in the gbm package and was based on the number of times that the predictor variable was selected for splitting and subsequent improvement of the model rice et al 2016 the relative importance evaluated the contribution of each predictor to the final model and was scaled such that the sum was 100 elith et al 2008 that is greater values corresponded to a stronger influence on annual runoff and sediment yield 2 4 1 model performance criteria the akaike s information criterion aic akaike 1969 root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r 2 were used to evaluate the performance of the brt model these statistical metrics can be calculated as 6 aic ln 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 2 h n 7 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 8 r 2 i 1 n pi p m oi o m 2 i 1 n pi p m 2 oi o m 2 where pi and oi are the predicted and observed annual runoff or sediment yield respectively h is the total number of variables in the regression model n refers to the number of annual runoff and sediment yield observations and pm and om are the mean of the predicted and observed annual runoff or sediment yield respectively the model that best explained the variability in annual runoff or sediment yield should provide the lowest aic and rmse values and r 2 should be as close to 1 as possible 3 results 3 1 temporal variation in runoff sediment yield and climatic variables from 2009 to 2012 the mean sediment yield of the 40 karst watersheds in 2011 44 t km 2 yr 1 was significantly lower than those of the other three years p 0 05 fig 2 there was also a significant difference in annual runoff between different years p 0 05 the mean runoff of the 40 karst watersheds in 2012 had a maximum value of 727 mm yr 1 and was 1 09 to 1 65 times greater than the other three years for climatic variables no significant differences were observed in consecutive wet days cwd max 1 day rx1 2 day rx2 4 day rx4 or 5 day rx5 precipitation amounts or annual temperature t between different years p 0 05 the consecutive dry days cdd in 2010 differed significantly from the other three years p 0 05 the temporal variation in heavy precipitation days rd25 was similar to the heavy precipitation amount r25 to rainstorm days rd50 and to rainstorm amount r50 fig 2 maximum pet was observed in 2011 but the minimum precipitation was also found in 2011 fig 2 interestingly significant differences in rainy days rds also occurred between any two different years p 0 05 3 2 spatial variation in runoff sediment yield and climatic variables precipitation runoff and sediment yield varied substantially between different karst watersheds precipitation ranged from 655 mm in the xiqiao watershed no 24 to 1621 mm in the guilin watershed no 22 fig 3 a annual runoff and sediment yield also ranged considerably from 146 mm yr 1 to 1444 mm yr 1 and from 2 t km 2 yr 1 to 246 t km 2 yr 1 respectively fig 3b c considering the spatial distribution in climatic variables cdd and pet were both low in the north and large in the west with minimum values 19 d and 809 mm observed in yujiang no 6 and liuchonghe no 5 watershed respectively and the maximum values 59 d and 119 mm respectively were both observed in zhanyi no 13 watershed fig 1c fig 4 on the contrary rds were low in the west and large in the north with the lowest 70 d and greatest values 119 d in xiqiao watershed no 24 and lipuhe watershed no 24 respectively fig 1c fig 4 for the other climatic variables there was a trend of increasing rds from east to west fig 4 3 3 brt model dominant precipitation extremes that influenced runoff and sediment yield no significant correlations were observed between sediment and cdd cwd pe t or tx although the other climatic variables had significant effects on sediment yield fig 5 annual runoff was significantly influenced by all the climatic variables except pe fig 5 moreover there were significant correlations among the climatic variables which indicated a high multicollinearity among these variables therefore the brt model was applied to eliminate the multicollinearity and thus to eliminate the misidentification of relevant predictors in a statistical model as well the relative importance of the extreme precipitation variables derived from the brt model indicated that annual runoff was most related to r25 15 3 although the rd25 was the most important predictor for annual sediment yield 18 7 the relative importance of r25 cdd rd25 cwd r50 and rx1 reached 72 and 68 for runoff and sediment yield respectively fig 6 the relative importance of each predictor to the performance of the brt model was scaled and therefore their sum was 100 which did not represent the r 2 value of the model in the range from 300 mm to 700 mm annual runoff increased with r25 when the r25 was 300 mm or 700 mm r25 had no effect on runoff fig 7 similarly rd25 cwd and r50 increased with increasing runoff conversely annual runoff decreased with cdd from 20 d to 40 d and then it was relatively stable with cdd 40 d annual runoff only showed a slight decrease with increasing rx1 in the range of 70 mm to 90 mm fig 7 predictors related to rd25 exhibited a strong positive effect on the sediment yield fig 8 similarly runoff increased with rx1 and cwd and then plateaued with rx1 and cwd at 90 mm and at 8 d respectively fig 8 3 4 performance of the brt model in the brt model the aic rmse and r 2 for the prediction of runoff were 10 16 149 64 and 0 76 respectively which indicated that the precipitation extremes explained 76 of the total variance in annual runoff using the brt model generally the predicted annual runoff matched the observed values satisfactorily and the points were close to the 1 1 line however the annual runoff was underestimated when the observed runoff was 1000 mm fig 9 aic rmse and r 2 for the annual sediment yield were 9 14 90 17 and 0 32 respectively this implied that the precipitation extremes only explained 32 of the variability in sediment yield for different karst watersheds furthermore the scatter points were quite far from the 1 1 line when sediment yield was 100 t km 2 yr 1 the 11 precipitation extremes variables and the six general climatic variables combined were also used as input factors in the brt model to test whether this enhanced the predictability compared with only using 11 precipitation extremes adding the general climatic variables to the brt model did not improve the explained variance substantially and the r 2 were 0 78 and 0 39 for annual runoff and sediment yield respectively table 3 fig s3 4 discussion southwest china is experiencing more frequent precipitation extremes which greatly influence runoff and sediment yield li et al 2012 liu et al 2014 thus we used the brt model to test whether the precipitation extremes explained the variation in annual runoff and sediment yield accurately the model results verified that the brt model was an effective method to identify the relative importance of a set of different explanatory variables and how they affected annual runoff and sediment yield specifically the brt model showed good explanatory power and the precipitation extremes explained 76 of the variability in runoff the complex hydrogeological karst system incorporates soil pockets rock matrix fractures fissures and a network of conduits and caves that are embedded in karst aquifers estrada medina et al 2013 jukić and denić jukić 2015 furthermore karst drainages have both surface and subsurface dual flow systems which were very well connected through conduits and caves wilcox et al 2008 jiang et al 2014 the epikarst which is located in the uppermost zone of carbonate rocks is the foundation for the vadose critical zone of epigenic karst and determines various flow regimes in a karst system fu et al 2015 the epikarst is distributed widely in karst regions and possesses many fractures and fissures which have a large storage capacity for water wilcox et al 2007 jiang et al 2014 in many regions of southwest china the depth of the epikarst is as high as 10 m wang et al 2019a as a result most of the water from normal rainfall events is stored in the epikarst systems as the main source of water for vegetation or is evaporated but the fractures and fissures can be completely saturated with rainwater under extreme rainfall events that subsequently induce large runoffs li et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 r25 rd25 r50 and rx1 were generally represented as the indicators of the variation in extreme heavy precipitation and therefore had a positive influence on runoff fig 5 fig 7 in karst regions of southwest china peng and wang 2012 indicated that large runoff occurred mainly during heavy storms when precipitation was 40 mm and the maximum 30 min rainfall intensity was 30 mm h 1 because cwd was usually applied to represent extreme wet events the greater the cwd the lower was the availability of water from fractures and fissures for plant growth or evaporation hence cwd was positively correlated with runoff and there was a negative relationship between cdd and runoff fu et al 2015 also showed that the high epikarst vertical drainage capacity and irregular epikarst surface joined to produce a high threshold rainfall depth for subsurface flow of 67 mm and 263 mm for wet and dry initial conditions respectively although the precipitation extremes had a significant influence on sediment yield fig 5 fig 8 they only accounted for 32 of the variability in sediment yield for different karst watersheds fig 9 for different karst watersheds the sediment yield was also influenced by special geology heterogeneous geomorphology soil properties and dam operation jiang et al 2014 zeng et al 2018 for example the peak cluster depression which is a closed and flat depression surrounded by a series of hills is ubiquitous in southwest china feng et al 2016 the water leakage structures such as sinkholes facilitate the eroded sediment transport to the groundwater systems li et al 2019 however the eroded sediment from the hillslopes generally blocked the outlet of sinkholes which usually led to flooding and waterlogging in karst depressions wang et al 2019a historical records showed that the depth of the flooded water can reach as high as 18 m in karst depressions jiang et al 2014 as a consequence most of the eroded sediment was deposited in the depression instead of being transporting to the surface water or groundwater that is the runoff eventually flowed into other catchments but many of the eroded sediments were deposited in the watershed and were not transported into other watersheds actually the high degree of hydrological connectivity in karst watersheds enlarged the effect of climate on runoff heckmann et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 furthermore during the 1950 s to 2011 our previous studies found that no significant trend was observed in annual runoff although the sediment yield showed a significant decreasing trend for the karst watersheds in southwest china li et al 2016 for a specific karst watershed temporal variation in annual runoff was mainly influenced by precipitation but sediment yield was impacted predominantly by human activity e g especially dam construction li et al 2016 on an annual scale dam construction generally did not influence runoff greatly because the water drained to reservoirs in stages dai et al 2008b different from runoff eroded sediments can be deposited easily especially after dam construction and reservoir operation wu et al 2012 at present because of the numerous dams that have been constructed in karst regions of southwest china significant differences were detected in sediment yield between pre dam and post dam periods but no significant differences were observed in runoff wu et al 2012 li et al 2016 therefore the brt model did not explain the variability in sediment yield as much as it explained runoff it is important to note that adding the general climatic variables in the brt model did not enhance the predictability of the model further fig 9 fig s3 precipitation extremes are generally excellent indicators of runoff because they are more informative about the special hydrological processes compared with general climatic variables in karst regions consequently precipitation extremes can serve as accurate diagnostic indicators for hydrological changes in the karst critical zone of southwest china however runoff was underestimated when it was 1000 mm fig 9 interestingly these underestimated values were all observed in the watersheds e g no 22 guilin no 23 taiping no 31 guijiang downstream of the xijiang river table 1 fig 1 which implied that the incoming discharge from upstream may have caused this bias in our prediction munia et al 2016 and veldkamp et al 2017 both indicated that upstream water use in transboundary river basins exerted a substantial influence on downstream water availability and a better understanding of the importance of upstream downstream interactions within river basins was very helpful for addressing water allocation problems moreover floodplain storage or other high water effects may be partly responsible for the underestimated runoff because of changes in channel morphology or sensor errors a high water discharge generally produced high errors due to the inherent complexity and nonlinearity present in many hydrological systems traditional statistical methods such as linear regression may not capture the complex relationships between the precipitation extremes and runoff or sediment yield bhatt et al 2013 rice et al 2015 the brt model can automatically handle interaction effects between the predictors and fit the complex nonlinear relationships and therefore has strong power for modelling non linear behaviour of hydrological processes snelder et al 2009 rice et al 2016 zabret et al 2018 elith et al 2008 also showed that the prediction accuracy of the complex brt model was superior to most traditional modelling methods therefore the brt model is recommended as an effective technique for modelling non linear behaviour of hydrological processes 5 conclusions in the current study we used the brt model to determine the relative contributions of 11 precipitation extremes variables for annual runoff and the dynamics of sediment yield r25 was recognized as the most influential variable that influenced runoff followed by cdd rd25 cwd and r50 similarly rd25 was the first dominant factor for sediment yield followed by r25 rx1 and cwd the brt model explained 76 of the variation in runoff but it could only accounted for 32 of the variability in sediment yield compared with only using 11 precipitation extremes variables inserting an extra six general climatic variables in the brt model did not greatly enhance the accuracy of the predictability for both runoff or sediment yield this indicated that precipitation extremes may have sufficient information on the influence of general climatic variables on annual runoff or sediment yield this study illustrated the strength of the brt model to handle the non linear behaviour of hydrological processes and this methodology has the potential to serve as a robust framework for nonlinear systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

4747,precipitation extremes are recognized as one of the main factors that influence annual runoff and sediment yield in specific watersheds however it is not clear whether precipitation extremes account accurately for the variability in runoff and sediment yield for different karst watersheds especially in climate sensitive areas such as the karst critical zone of southwest china the objective of this study was to quantify the relative importance of the 11 precipitation extremes variables that explain the total variance in annual runoff and sediment yield with a boosted regression tree brt model for 40 typical karst watersheds in southwest china results indicated that the most important precipitation extremes for annual runoff and sediment yield were heavy precipitation amount consecutive dry days heavy precipitation days consecutive wet days and rainstorm amount the brt model accounted for 76 of the variation in runoff which demonstrated that precipitation extremes were crucial factors for generating runoff although precipitation extremes had significant effects on sediment yield the brt model only explained 32 of the variability in sediment yield hydrogeological conditions and dam construction in these karst watersheds may be responsible for the difference in total variance explained by the brt model between annual runoff and sediment yield because of the inherent nonlinearity present in many hydrological systems the brt model provided a robust capability to generate data driven objective insight into complex relationships we recommend this model for

introduction karst landforms with an area of 22 million km2 occupy approximately 12 of the earth s continental surface and supply almost 25 of freshwater resources in the world ford and williams 2007 gutiérrez et al 2014 hartmann et al 2014 goldscheider et al 2020 as one of the largest contiguous karst regions in the world southwest china is featured by special geology rugged geomorphology heterogeneous landscapes rich biodiversity complex hydrogeology and fragile ecosystems jiang et al 2014 martin et al 2018 tong et al 2020 many of these karst regions have experienced an overwhelming rate of karst rocky desertification which generally causes surface water scarcity yan and cai 2015 wang et al 2019a this surface water shortage in these karst mountainous territories is becoming a serious threat to effective ecological restoration sustainable development of resources and the health of the environment qin et al 2015 jiang et al 2020 furthermore the karst region of southwest china is also experiencing severe soil erosion zeng et al 2018 li et al 2020a in this karst region the warm and moist climate generally enhanced weathering and pedogenesis peng and wang 2012 wang et al 2019a however most of the carbonate rocks are soluble and cannot produce much soil goldscheider et al 2010 wang et al 2004 li et al 2019 actually the insoluble pure carbonate rock components only accounted for 4 of the total area on average and therefore the soil formation rate was very low feng et al 2016 with similar climates the soil formation rate in non karst regions can be 100 times greater than that of karst regions jiang et al 2014 previous studies have shown that it would take 250 000 850 000 years to produce a 100 cm thickness of soil by dissolving a 25 m thickness of carbonate rocks jiang et al 2014 wang et al 2019a the soil layer in karst regions would be extremely difficult to recover once it is lost a better understanding of the temporal and spatial variation in runoff and sediment yield is thus of paramount importance to cope with current and future water scarcity and to control soil erosion in the karst critical zone effectively in recent decades climate extremes occurred frequently in southwest china and massive droughts and floods caused enormous societal economic and ecological losses qiu 2010 li et al 2012 recent studies also showed that climate extremes such as droughts or floods were projected to become more frequent more severe and more widespread throughout southwest china liu et al 2015 generally precipitation extremes are assumed to be very important factors that influence both hydrological and erosion processes for example dai et al 2008a found that extreme drought exerted substantial influence on runoff and contributed 45 of the runoff loss in 2006 of the yangtze river some studies also showed that the floods driven by precipitation extremes usually comprised a high proportion of runoff for a specific watershed walther et al 2002 pecl et al 2017 for sediment yield a few precipitation extreme events can produce a large amount of sediment which probably accounted for the vast majority of annual soil loss poesen and hooke 1997 estrany et al 2010 warrick et al 2004 revealed that 50 of the annual sediment load was transported by the largest 1 5 days of flooding gonzalez hidalgo et al 2010 also indicated that the 3 largest and 10 largest erosive events contributed on average 38 and 61 of the total sediment load respectively therefore it is essential to evaluate the effect of precipitation extremes on runoff and sediment yield in karst regions of southwest china because this fragile ecosystem experiences more frequent precipitation extremes the variables for precipitation extremes were generally multicollinear which probably yielded potentially misleading results li et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 furthermore the relationships between some of these variables and runoff or sediment yield were highly nonlinear li et al 2020b the hydrological variables and sediment yield were generally non stationary because they had means variances and covariances that varied over time she et al 2015 chang et al 2019 vu and mishra 2019 in reality the changes in runoff and sediment concentration or yield in alluvial rivers would probably be highly nonlinear in nature kuai and tsai 2012 kumar et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 to solve this problem the recently developed method of boosted regression trees brt not only handles highly correlated noise corrupted data sets but they also fit complex nonlinear relationships with threshold patterns elith et al 2008 bhatt et al 2013 wang et al 2019b in the model the boosting algorithm works by fitting individual regression trees in a forward and thus the final brt is a combination of many trees generally hundreds or thousands by shrinking the contribution of each tree and averaging across the final selected set boosting produces a final model that is more robust than a single regression tree model and enables nonlinear functions to be modelled therefore brt automatically captures nonlinearities and handles interactions among predictor variables recently nolan et al 2018 also indicated that the brt model can be used to identify the degree and direction of influence of the predictor variables and it can successfully provide additional insight by revealing nonlinear and non monotonic responses in addition to improving the accuracy of the predictability the brt method can also provide insight into mechanisms e g hydrological process brts have been applied successfully in many fields such as lemology remote sensing meteorology soil science and ecology elith et al 2008 pouteau et al 2011 bhatt et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 zabret et al 2018 wang et al 2019b yet the brt model has not been applied extensively in the hydrological sciences in the karst region of southwest china furthermore previous studies focused on the effects of precipitation extremes on runoff and sediment yield for a specific watershed dai et al 2008a estrany et al 2010 li et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 it is not clear whether precipitation extremes explain the variability in runoff and sediment yield for different watersheds with precision especially in climate sensitive areas such as a karst area of southwest china therefore this research provides an opportunity to test the applicability of an exploratory model i e brt for analyzing the effects of precipitation extremes on the annual runoff and sediment yield in a model environment that accounts for nonlinear and nonstationary phenomena the objectives of this study were to investigate the temporal and spatial variation in annual runoff and sediment yield to identify the dominant precipitation extremes that influenced runoff and sediment yield and to further test whether the precipitation extremes explained the variability in runoff and sediment yield for 40 selected karst watersheds of southwest china addressing these objectives can improve our understanding of how runoff and sediment yield respond to precipitation extremes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the typical karst region of the xijiang 21 36 27 00 n 102 16 113 23 e 3 5 105 km2 elevation 2 2866 m and wujiang watersheds 26 09 30 12 n 104 15 109 20 e 8 79 104 km2 elevation 113 2888 m in southwest china were selected as study areas fig 1 a the karst coverage for these watersheds was 43 5 and 77 2 respectively fig 1b the xijiang river is the largest tributary of the pearl river which is the second largest river in terms of mean annual runoff in china the xijiang river passes through four provinces that include yunnan guizhou guangxi and guangdong provinces and it eventually flows into the south sea this watershed is located in the subtropical to tropical monsoon climate zones with a mean annual temperature and precipitation that ranges from 14 to 22 c and from 1000 to 2200 mm respectively the distribution of precipitation during the year is uneven and 80 of it falls between april and october during 1955 2015 the mean annual runoff and sediment yield of the xijiang river were 651 mm and 184 t km 2 respectively the wujiang river is a southern tributary of the yangtze river with a total length of 1037 km it originates in the yunnan guizhou plateau and flows through yunnan guizhou chongqing and hubei provinces the wujiang watershed is featured by a subtropical monsoon humid climate with mean annual precipitation that ranges from 850 to 1600 mm the precipitation has a distinct spatial pattern and decreases from east to west and from south to north during 1955 2015 the mean annual runoff and sediment yield of the wujiang river were 552 mm and 273 t km 2 respectively in this study 40 sub watersheds were selected with 29 and 11 hydrologic observation stations located in xijiang and wujiang watersheds respectively fig 1c table 1 2 2 database daily meteorological data which included precipitation air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed and direction of 52 meteorological stations for the period 2009 2012 were downloaded from the china meteorological data network the datasets for daily runoff and sediment concentration were obtained from the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china the dem which had a resolution of 30 m 30 m was obtained from the geospatial data cloud based on the dem and the locations of the 40 hydrological observation stations the boundary of each sub watershed was mapped using arcgis software in recent years the chinese government initiated ecological engineering projects e g grain for green mountain closure to prevent soil erosion and to restore the degraded environment as a result soil erosion in karst regions of southwest china decreased and the monthly and annual sediment yield were relatively stable during 2009 2012 fig s1 and fig s2 therefore the time period between 2009 and 2012 was selected for this study runoff and sediment yield were only observed in 2009 for the liyutang hydrologic station thus the runoff and sediment yield data points both included 157 observations from 40 hydrologic stations during 2009 2012 2 3 potential climatic variables that influenced annual runoff and sediment yield using the daily meteorological data 11 precipitation extremes variables and 6 general climatic variables were defined and constructed as the potential factors that controlled annual runoff and sediment yield in previous studies these climatic variables were commonly used to investigate the spatial variability associated with climate change and hence may influence annual runoff and sediment yield significantly zhang et al 2012 sillmann et al 2013 li et al 2017 table 2 for example for precipitation extremes consecutive dry days cdd was used to indicate extreme dry events and longer cdd implied more severe meteorological drought the heavy precipitation amount r25 and annual maximum consecutive 5 day precipitation rx5 represented wet events where a high value of rx5 generally suggested that a flood had occurred for general climatic variables rainy days rds were defined as those days with precipitation 1 mm the threshold of 1 mm precipitation in the definition of rds was applied to avoid artificial trends because some observers failed to report small rainfall amounts potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated using the penman method penman 1948 which is one of the best formulas to capture climate change arcgis 10 3 software was used to interpolate all of the meteorological data by the cokriging interpolation algorithm and then the spatially averaged climatic variables were calculated for each sub watershed 2 4 boosted regression trees brt the boosted regression trees brt model was used to identify the precipitation extremes variables that were most relevant in explaining the variation in annual runoff and sediment yield brt is a statistical learning method that includes regression trees and boosting to fit many individual regression trees in a forward step wise manner before combining them into a final predictive model elith et al 2008 brt has the advantage of handling different types of explanatory variables and missing data without the need for data transformation and it effectively fits complex nonlinear relationships and automatically models interactions between variables bhatt et al 2013 rice et al 2015 the excellent performance of brt can overcome the problem of multicollinearity and prevent overfitting nolan et al 2018 wang et al 2019b all brt analyses were conducted in r software by using the gbm package ridgeway 2019 brt model performance was determined by the learning rate bag fraction tree complexity and cross validation elith et al 2008 the contribution of each tree to the growing model was controlled by the learning rate and the proportion of data used for model building at each step was determined by the bag fraction tree complexity indicated the number of nodes in a tree and regulated the level of interactions in a boosted regression tree model the cross validation method identified the optimal number of trees in the brt model elith et al 2008 by repeated trial and error the optimal brt model had a learning rate of 0 005 a bag fraction of 0 5 a tree complexity of 5 and a 10 fold cross validation technically the brt model is similar to the function x as an additive expansion of the base learner i e a small tree friedman 2002 1 f x f 0 x α 1 f 1 x α 2 f 2 x α m f m x where α m is the expansion coefficient and m is the number of iterations using the training data an individual base learner generally cannot create a satisfactory prediction but it can boost the performance of the prediction results using a series of regression trees with the lowest residuals by using an iterative algorithm a new regression tree h x r lm l l can divide the x space into l disjoint regions r lm l l and predict a constant value at each iteration m de ath 2007 yan et al 2019 2 h x r lm l l l 1 l y lm x r lm 3 y im ψ y i f x i f x i f x f m 1 x where y lm is the mean of pseudo residuals in each region r lm at the mth iteration y im subsequently the approximation f m 1 x is updated for each of the corresponding regions 2002 xenochristou et al 2020 4 f m x f m 1 x v γ lm x r lm 5 γ lm arg r min x i r lm ψ y i f m 1 x i γ where v 0 1 is the shrinkage parameter that dominates the procedure of the learning rate generally the small values of v 0 1 led to a much better generalization error friedman 2002 the partial dependence and relative importance of each predictor variable can also be derived from the brt model elith et al 2008 nolan et al 2014 the partial dependence of each predictor was calculated by partial dependence functions which implied how the predicted response variable was influenced by each predictor variable after accounting for the average effects of the remaining predictors in the model snelder et al 2009 zabret et al 2018 although the brt model had the capacity to constrain overfitting some overfitting may still have occurred in the partial dependence plots thus only the main trends in the dependence plots were discussed to avoid assessing these potential spurious results the relative importance of each predictor was applied in the gbm package and was based on the number of times that the predictor variable was selected for splitting and subsequent improvement of the model rice et al 2016 the relative importance evaluated the contribution of each predictor to the final model and was scaled such that the sum was 100 elith et al 2008 that is greater values corresponded to a stronger influence on annual runoff and sediment yield 2 4 1 model performance criteria the akaike s information criterion aic akaike 1969 root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r 2 were used to evaluate the performance of the brt model these statistical metrics can be calculated as 6 aic ln 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 2 h n 7 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 8 r 2 i 1 n pi p m oi o m 2 i 1 n pi p m 2 oi o m 2 where pi and oi are the predicted and observed annual runoff or sediment yield respectively h is the total number of variables in the regression model n refers to the number of annual runoff and sediment yield observations and pm and om are the mean of the predicted and observed annual runoff or sediment yield respectively the model that best explained the variability in annual runoff or sediment yield should provide the lowest aic and rmse values and r 2 should be as close to 1 as possible 3 results 3 1 temporal variation in runoff sediment yield and climatic variables from 2009 to 2012 the mean sediment yield of the 40 karst watersheds in 2011 44 t km 2 yr 1 was significantly lower than those of the other three years p 0 05 fig 2 there was also a significant difference in annual runoff between different years p 0 05 the mean runoff of the 40 karst watersheds in 2012 had a maximum value of 727 mm yr 1 and was 1 09 to 1 65 times greater than the other three years for climatic variables no significant differences were observed in consecutive wet days cwd max 1 day rx1 2 day rx2 4 day rx4 or 5 day rx5 precipitation amounts or annual temperature t between different years p 0 05 the consecutive dry days cdd in 2010 differed significantly from the other three years p 0 05 the temporal variation in heavy precipitation days rd25 was similar to the heavy precipitation amount r25 to rainstorm days rd50 and to rainstorm amount r50 fig 2 maximum pet was observed in 2011 but the minimum precipitation was also found in 2011 fig 2 interestingly significant differences in rainy days rds also occurred between any two different years p 0 05 3 2 spatial variation in runoff sediment yield and climatic variables precipitation runoff and sediment yield varied substantially between different karst watersheds precipitation ranged from 655 mm in the xiqiao watershed no 24 to 1621 mm in the guilin watershed no 22 fig 3 a annual runoff and sediment yield also ranged considerably from 146 mm yr 1 to 1444 mm yr 1 and from 2 t km 2 yr 1 to 246 t km 2 yr 1 respectively fig 3b c considering the spatial distribution in climatic variables cdd and pet were both low in the north and large in the west with minimum values 19 d and 809 mm observed in yujiang no 6 and liuchonghe no 5 watershed respectively and the maximum values 59 d and 119 mm respectively were both observed in zhanyi no 13 watershed fig 1c fig 4 on the contrary rds were low in the west and large in the north with the lowest 70 d and greatest values 119 d in xiqiao watershed no 24 and lipuhe watershed no 24 respectively fig 1c fig 4 for the other climatic variables there was a trend of increasing rds from east to west fig 4 3 3 brt model dominant precipitation extremes that influenced runoff and sediment yield no significant correlations were observed between sediment and cdd cwd pe t or tx although the other climatic variables had significant effects on sediment yield fig 5 annual runoff was significantly influenced by all the climatic variables except pe fig 5 moreover there were significant correlations among the climatic variables which indicated a high multicollinearity among these variables therefore the brt model was applied to eliminate the multicollinearity and thus to eliminate the misidentification of relevant predictors in a statistical model as well the relative importance of the extreme precipitation variables derived from the brt model indicated that annual runoff was most related to r25 15 3 although the rd25 was the most important predictor for annual sediment yield 18 7 the relative importance of r25 cdd rd25 cwd r50 and rx1 reached 72 and 68 for runoff and sediment yield respectively fig 6 the relative importance of each predictor to the performance of the brt model was scaled and therefore their sum was 100 which did not represent the r 2 value of the model in the range from 300 mm to 700 mm annual runoff increased with r25 when the r25 was 300 mm or 700 mm r25 had no effect on runoff fig 7 similarly rd25 cwd and r50 increased with increasing runoff conversely annual runoff decreased with cdd from 20 d to 40 d and then it was relatively stable with cdd 40 d annual runoff only showed a slight decrease with increasing rx1 in the range of 70 mm to 90 mm fig 7 predictors related to rd25 exhibited a strong positive effect on the sediment yield fig 8 similarly runoff increased with rx1 and cwd and then plateaued with rx1 and cwd at 90 mm and at 8 d respectively fig 8 3 4 performance of the brt model in the brt model the aic rmse and r 2 for the prediction of runoff were 10 16 149 64 and 0 76 respectively which indicated that the precipitation extremes explained 76 of the total variance in annual runoff using the brt model generally the predicted annual runoff matched the observed values satisfactorily and the points were close to the 1 1 line however the annual runoff was underestimated when the observed runoff was 1000 mm fig 9 aic rmse and r 2 for the annual sediment yield were 9 14 90 17 and 0 32 respectively this implied that the precipitation extremes only explained 32 of the variability in sediment yield for different karst watersheds furthermore the scatter points were quite far from the 1 1 line when sediment yield was 100 t km 2 yr 1 the 11 precipitation extremes variables and the six general climatic variables combined were also used as input factors in the brt model to test whether this enhanced the predictability compared with only using 11 precipitation extremes adding the general climatic variables to the brt model did not improve the explained variance substantially and the r 2 were 0 78 and 0 39 for annual runoff and sediment yield respectively table 3 fig s3 4 discussion southwest china is experiencing more frequent precipitation extremes which greatly influence runoff and sediment yield li et al 2012 liu et al 2014 thus we used the brt model to test whether the precipitation extremes explained the variation in annual runoff and sediment yield accurately the model results verified that the brt model was an effective method to identify the relative importance of a set of different explanatory variables and how they affected annual runoff and sediment yield specifically the brt model showed good explanatory power and the precipitation extremes explained 76 of the variability in runoff the complex hydrogeological karst system incorporates soil pockets rock matrix fractures fissures and a network of conduits and caves that are embedded in karst aquifers estrada medina et al 2013 jukić and denić jukić 2015 furthermore karst drainages have both surface and subsurface dual flow systems which were very well connected through conduits and caves wilcox et al 2008 jiang et al 2014 the epikarst which is located in the uppermost zone of carbonate rocks is the foundation for the vadose critical zone of epigenic karst and determines various flow regimes in a karst system fu et al 2015 the epikarst is distributed widely in karst regions and possesses many fractures and fissures which have a large storage capacity for water wilcox et al 2007 jiang et al 2014 in many regions of southwest china the depth of the epikarst is as high as 10 m wang et al 2019a as a result most of the water from normal rainfall events is stored in the epikarst systems as the main source of water for vegetation or is evaporated but the fractures and fissures can be completely saturated with rainwater under extreme rainfall events that subsequently induce large runoffs li et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 r25 rd25 r50 and rx1 were generally represented as the indicators of the variation in extreme heavy precipitation and therefore had a positive influence on runoff fig 5 fig 7 in karst regions of southwest china peng and wang 2012 indicated that large runoff occurred mainly during heavy storms when precipitation was 40 mm and the maximum 30 min rainfall intensity was 30 mm h 1 because cwd was usually applied to represent extreme wet events the greater the cwd the lower was the availability of water from fractures and fissures for plant growth or evaporation hence cwd was positively correlated with runoff and there was a negative relationship between cdd and runoff fu et al 2015 also showed that the high epikarst vertical drainage capacity and irregular epikarst surface joined to produce a high threshold rainfall depth for subsurface flow of 67 mm and 263 mm for wet and dry initial conditions respectively although the precipitation extremes had a significant influence on sediment yield fig 5 fig 8 they only accounted for 32 of the variability in sediment yield for different karst watersheds fig 9 for different karst watersheds the sediment yield was also influenced by special geology heterogeneous geomorphology soil properties and dam operation jiang et al 2014 zeng et al 2018 for example the peak cluster depression which is a closed and flat depression surrounded by a series of hills is ubiquitous in southwest china feng et al 2016 the water leakage structures such as sinkholes facilitate the eroded sediment transport to the groundwater systems li et al 2019 however the eroded sediment from the hillslopes generally blocked the outlet of sinkholes which usually led to flooding and waterlogging in karst depressions wang et al 2019a historical records showed that the depth of the flooded water can reach as high as 18 m in karst depressions jiang et al 2014 as a consequence most of the eroded sediment was deposited in the depression instead of being transporting to the surface water or groundwater that is the runoff eventually flowed into other catchments but many of the eroded sediments were deposited in the watershed and were not transported into other watersheds actually the high degree of hydrological connectivity in karst watersheds enlarged the effect of climate on runoff heckmann et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 furthermore during the 1950 s to 2011 our previous studies found that no significant trend was observed in annual runoff although the sediment yield showed a significant decreasing trend for the karst watersheds in southwest china li et al 2016 for a specific karst watershed temporal variation in annual runoff was mainly influenced by precipitation but sediment yield was impacted predominantly by human activity e g especially dam construction li et al 2016 on an annual scale dam construction generally did not influence runoff greatly because the water drained to reservoirs in stages dai et al 2008b different from runoff eroded sediments can be deposited easily especially after dam construction and reservoir operation wu et al 2012 at present because of the numerous dams that have been constructed in karst regions of southwest china significant differences were detected in sediment yield between pre dam and post dam periods but no significant differences were observed in runoff wu et al 2012 li et al 2016 therefore the brt model did not explain the variability in sediment yield as much as it explained runoff it is important to note that adding the general climatic variables in the brt model did not enhance the predictability of the model further fig 9 fig s3 precipitation extremes are generally excellent indicators of runoff because they are more informative about the special hydrological processes compared with general climatic variables in karst regions consequently precipitation extremes can serve as accurate diagnostic indicators for hydrological changes in the karst critical zone of southwest china however runoff was underestimated when it was 1000 mm fig 9 interestingly these underestimated values were all observed in the watersheds e g no 22 guilin no 23 taiping no 31 guijiang downstream of the xijiang river table 1 fig 1 which implied that the incoming discharge from upstream may have caused this bias in our prediction munia et al 2016 and veldkamp et al 2017 both indicated that upstream water use in transboundary river basins exerted a substantial influence on downstream water availability and a better understanding of the importance of upstream downstream interactions within river basins was very helpful for addressing water allocation problems moreover floodplain storage or other high water effects may be partly responsible for the underestimated runoff because of changes in channel morphology or sensor errors a high water discharge generally produced high errors due to the inherent complexity and nonlinearity present in many hydrological systems traditional statistical methods such as linear regression may not capture the complex relationships between the precipitation extremes and runoff or sediment yield bhatt et al 2013 rice et al 2015 the brt model can automatically handle interaction effects between the predictors and fit the complex nonlinear relationships and therefore has strong power for modelling non linear behaviour of hydrological processes snelder et al 2009 rice et al 2016 zabret et al 2018 elith et al 2008 also showed that the prediction accuracy of the complex brt model was superior to most traditional modelling methods therefore the brt model is recommended as an effective technique for modelling non linear behaviour of hydrological processes 5 conclusions in the current study we used the brt model to determine the relative contributions of 11 precipitation extremes variables for annual runoff and the dynamics of sediment yield r25 was recognized as the most influential variable that influenced runoff followed by cdd rd25 cwd and r50 similarly rd25 was the first dominant factor for sediment yield followed by r25 rx1 and cwd the brt model explained 76 of the variation in runoff but it could only accounted for 32 of the variability in sediment yield compared with only using 11 precipitation extremes variables inserting an extra six general climatic variables in the brt model did not greatly enhance the accuracy of the predictability for both runoff or sediment yield this indicated that precipitation extremes may have sufficient information on the influence of general climatic variables on annual runoff or sediment yield this study illustrated the strength of the brt model to handle the non linear behaviour of hydrological processes and this methodology has the potential to serve as a robust framework for nonlinear systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

4748,although numerous studies on nitrate transport and transformation in karst catchments have been reported many challenges in understanding nitrate fluxes remain due to the unique architecture of karst critical zones and complex hydrological processes water age is an important descriptor of hydrological function providing insight to into flow paths and water sources at the catchment scale this offers a potential opportunity to better understand the spatio temporal variations in nitrate dynamics in karst catchments we linked the nitrate dynamics of underground conduit flow to water age extracted from a robust tracer aided model for a karst catchment in southwestern china the results show that nitrate dynamics in underground conduit flow are controlled by the coupling of nitrate supply and of flow paths in the karst catchment high contributions of drainage from small fractures water leads to low nitrate concentrations in underground conduit flow during the dry season this reveals that the small fractures may be another important hot spot for denitrification leading to nitrate removal in the karst critical zone the switching between transport limited and supply limited conditions cause the marked variations in nitrate concentration of underground conduit flow during wet season although rapid infiltration via large fractures and sinkholes have strong dilution effects on nitrate in underground conduit flow at beginning of rainfall more nitrate was transported out of the catchment with drainage during rainfall events due to the mobilization of soil nitrate by rainfall meanwhile the capacity to transport nitrate out of catchment can be potentially activated when the old water is displaced by rainfall under high wetness condition keywords karst catchment nitrate dynamics water age underground conduit 1 introduction the karst critical zone comprises complex porous media encompassing soil small fractures large fractures and conduits ford and williams 2007 which cause a diverse range of hydrological processes at the catchment scale hartmann et al 2014 the sharp responses of stream and underground conduit flows to rainfall are notable due to the very high permeability of karst aquifers and well developed subsurface fracture conduit networks white 2002 in particular the unique landform structure of sinkholes provides direct flow paths linking the surface epikarst to underground drainage networks after heavy rain which strengthens hydrological connectivity between surface and subsurface systems tihansky 1999 increased fertilization using n for agriculture creates a high n pollution risk in karst maringanti et al 2009 yang et al 2020 high nitrate concentrations in streamflow have been observed in many agricultural catchments with intense fertilization kellman and hillaire marcel 2003 barnes and raymond 2009 heaton et al 2012 overapplication of fertilizer as well as wrong timing of application potentially lead to major nitrate leaching losses and unsustainable land and water management practices di and cameron 2002 understanding the resulting spatio temporal dynamics of nitrate in aquifer and stream flow is critical to water resources and agriculture management in karst areas the transport and transformation of nitrate in karst areas is more complex than that in non karst environments because of the marked spatial heterogeneity of the hydrodynamic behaviour hartmann et al 2014 along with water flows in the karst critical zone nitrate transport is strongly controlled by hydrological connectivity between different landform units e g hillslopes and depressions as well as different porous media e g small fractures and conduits zhang et al 2020a nitrate is easily leached into aquifers due to the thin soils and quick infiltration rate in karst yue et al 2015 in addition to soil the epikarst is a substantial nitrate reservoir where the transport and biogeochemical transformations of nitrate e g denitrification cannot be ignored husic et al 2019 an important research gap on nitrate in karst regions is that different nitrate transport pathways affect nitrate behaviour in stream or underground conduit flows although some researchers have reported findings on this results can be contradictory for example husic et al 2019 indicated that the slow to moderate flow pathways in epikarst contribute most nitrate to streamflow nearly 90 of the downstream nitrate flux while wang et al 2020 found that very large amounts of nitrate enter drainage systems through fast flow paths after heavy rains characterisation of the relationship between nitrate concentration and discharge c q is a popular method for assessing nitrate dynamics at the catchment scale basu et al 2010 duncan et al 2017 zhi et al 2019 the c q response pattern is usually categorized into three types dilution enrichment and constant which imply different hydrological flow paths and biogeochemical reactions musolff et al 2017 in particular the c q relationship for a rainfall event usually exhibits looped trajectories due to hysteretic behaviour of the solute concentration relative to discharge williams 1989 analysis of the c q hysteresis behaviour has been widely adopted to examine solute transport in catchments bieroza and heathwaite 2015 bowes et al 2015 lloyd et al 2016 perks et al 2015 it can provide insights into the spatio temporal dynamics of solute concentrations and their linkage to watershed structure storage variations and hydrologic connectivity under different hydroclimatic conditions perks et al 2015 as descriptors of hydrological function the age of water in various fluxes can reveal how catchment storage mediates flow path activation and mixing processes kirchner et al 2000 botter 2012 mcdonnell and beven 2014 soulsby et al 2015 sprenger et al 2019 therefore linking solute dynamics to water ages can potentially provide new insights into the coupling of hydrological and transport processes at the catchment scale benettin et al 2015 2020 tunaley et al 2016 metrics of water age are traditionally referred to as specific times such as the mean travel time defining as the average time interval between the entrance and the exit of a water particle in a catchment or the mean residence time of water in a particular store and the alternative age metrics of young water fraction defining the fraction of water with transit times between zero and a specific age threshold typically 2 3 months water aged have been widely estimated using conservative tracers e g stable isotopes hrachowitz et al 2009 birkel and soulsby 2015 kirchner 2016a 2016b time invariant approaches e g lumped convolution approaches were often adopted in the early estimations of travel time distributions ttd and mean travel times mtt as well examination of the influences of climate and landscape properties heidbüchel et al 2013 however these simplified approaches have limited application in complex dynamic flow systems exhibiting non steady state response to hydroclimatic variability botter 2012 many time variant approaches have been proposed for the characterization of age distributions of catchment water storage and fluxes for example water age dynamics can be inferred by simulating transport processes at the catchment scale through storage selection sas functions that collapse complex transport processes into a unified framework of age related storage rinaldo et al 2015 recent advances in tracer aided hydrological modelling have also provided more constrained water age estimates by tracking water and tracer fluxes e g mcmillan et al 2012 soulsby et al 2015 piovano et al 2019 moreover tracer aided models allow the estimation of probability density functions pdfs of travel residence times describing the fate of rainfall water particles traveling through catchments remondi et al 2018 despite many existing studies on nitrate dynamics and their controlling influences in karst areas liu et al 2006 schilling and helmers 2008 husic et al 2019 great challenges in improving understanding of nitrate transport and transformation in this unique hydrogeological system remain to help address the general research gaps in nitrate processes in karst catchments our overall objective is to use water ages as a tool to better understand the influence of flow path dynamics on nitrate behaviour in underground conduits and the associated controlling effects of hydroclimatic and nitrate supply conditions more specifically in this study we address three questions for karst catchment 1 what are the relationships between nitrate concentration loading and water age in underground conduit flow under different hydroclimatic conditions 2 how does the intra rainfall event hysteresis between nitrate concentration and water age of underground conduit flow vary under different hydroclimatic conditions 3 how do water sources and flow paths affect nitrate and water age dynamics in underground conduit flow 2 site and methodology 2 1 study catchment the chenqi catchment with surface area of 1 25 km2 is a typical cockpit karst landscape located at the puding karst ecohydrological observation station in guizhou province southwest china fig 1 this catchment is surrounded by conical hills separated by star shaped valleys zhang et al 2011 chen et al 2018 the elevation ranges from 1 340 to 1 500 m above sea level fig 1a this region is subject to a subtropical wet monsoon climate and has a mean annual temperature of 20 1 c with the highest temperatures typically occurring in july and the lowest ones in january the mean annual precipitation is 1 140 mm according to long term measured data in the catchment the wet season lasts from may to september and the dry season from october through to april of the following year the catchment contains two main landscape units depressions with low elevations 1340 m and hillslopes with a high elevation ranging from 1 340 1 500 m the spatial extents of the depressions and hillslopes derived from a 1 10 000 digital topography map are 0 37 and 0 88 km2 respectively the catchment is drained by a single underground conduit fig 1a geological units in the catchment include dolostone thick and thin limestones marl and quaternary soil the thickness of the limestone formations is approximately 150 200 m above the impervious marl formation the low permeability causes precipitation to recharge perched groundwater on the marl which then moves laterally to be discharged in the lower areas hence the marl formation is a key control on the distribution of hillside springs in this region on the hillslopes the quaternary soils covering carbonate rocks are very thin with an average thickness of 30 cm while the average thickness of the soil layer in the depression is greater than 2 m limestone fragments occur in the soil layer and the rock outcrop area accounts for 10 30 of the total area the vegetation characteristics include deciduous broad leaved forests shrubs and grass at the top and middle of the hillslopes and crops at the lower end of the hillslopes and in the depression which has a thick soil layer fig 1b a rice rape crop rotation is the main land use in the depression and a corn rape crop rotation occurs at the foot of the hillslopes fertilization is common in agricultural regions in southwest china leading extensive potentially long term contamination of the karst system fenton et al 2017 in this catchment organic fertilizers e g cattle and pig manure and chemical fertilizers e g urea and diammonium phosphate are mainly applied for rice and rape crops in the depression fig 1 the light fertilization for rape occurs in october november and the heavy fertilization for rice is in may early june yue et al 2019 at chenqi there are two flow observation points the underground conduit spring at catchment outlet and a hillslope spring located at the foot of the eastern steep hillslope fig 1a the discharge at the two springs is measured at time intervals of 15 min using v notch weirs instrumented with hobo u20 water level loggers onset corporation usa four automatic weather stations are located on the upper hillslopes precipitation air temperature wind parameters radiation air humidity and air pressure are all recorded at time intervals of 5 min the no3 n concentration at the catchment outlet is monitored using a non optical nise sensor at time intervals of 15 min the sensor is powered by 24 v dc batteries supplemented by solar panels the sensor has been calibrated using the laboratory measured concentrations of grab samples manually collected over the duration of the observation period and the uncertainty of estimated field no3 n is between 0 04 and 0 64 mg l yue et al 2019 all the observations were performed from 1 november 2016 to 30 october 2017 2 2 simulated age and travel time distribution of underground conduit flow a tracer aided hydrological model for karst catchments has been developed and applied to chenqi by zhang et al 2019 this model disaggregates the cockpit karst catchment into the two dominant landscape units of the hillslopes and depressions for depressions a two reservoir model linking slow and fast reservoirs is applied to simulate the water and tracer transport conceptualising the typical dual flow system of the karst critical zone hartmann et al 2014 the slow flow reservoir represents the low permeability media e g primary porosity in the matrix blocks and small fractures in the aquifer the fast flow reservoir mainly represents the large fractures and conduits with a high permeability the outlet of the fast flow reservoir is the catchment outlet to reduce the model parameterization one reservoir with an additional passive store only for the tracer mixing simulation is employed to estimate the water and tracer dynamics in the hillslope unit this method can not only realize the partial mixing of tracers at the catchment scale but can also reduce the model parameterization tetzlaff et al 2014 model calibration and verification have been performed using high temporal resolution measured data hourly of flow and stable isotopes at outlet hillslope spring and groundwater wells in the study catchment full detail in zhang et al 2019 the results revealed that the model can capture the flow and tracer dynamics within each landscape unit quite well and has a strong capacity to track the hourly water and isotope fluxes through each landscape unit this allows the associated storage and hydrological connectivity dynamics to be characterised as well as the time variant age of underground conduit flow zhang et al 2019 the series of flow age over the study period derived from this tracer aided model were used to explore nitrate export from the catchment by linking it to observed nitrate dynamics furthermore once calibrated the tracer aided model can be run multiple times in parallel to separately track the fate of each hourly rainfall input during event the water over each rainfall hour is uniquely labelled with a specific tracer concentration then by estimating the variation in tracer mass over time at the catchment outlet the fate of the rainwater during each rainfall hour reaching the outlet as discharge can be tracked forward hence the travel time distributions ttd of rain entering catchment at each rainfall hour can be estimated remondi et al 2018 then the discharge over time at outlet generated by a specific rainfall can be calculated by multiplying the corresponding water amount of rainfall minus evaporation and its ttd using this approach a total of 892 rainfall hours during the study period were tracked and the results were used to explore the dynamics of nitrate export at catchment outlet driven by rainfall the amount of no3 n export depends on the no3 n concentration and discharge at underground conduit outlet for each time step the no3 n export driven by a specific rainfall is calculated by the no3 n concentration of underground conduit flow multiplied by the discharge generated from the corresponding rainfall i e the amount of rainfall minus evaporation multiplied by ttd of outflow this means that based on the observed concentrations the estimation of no3 n export over time driven by each rainfall event only takes into account the discharge generated by it without considering the biogeochemical reactions please refer to zhang et al 2019 and zhang et al 2020b for full details on how the flow age was calculated and how rainwater was tracked in the model 2 3 hysteresis analysis as a fingerprint of water flow water age is usually treated as a specific tracer concentration botter et al 2011 remondi et al 2018 similar to the relationship between concentration and discharge c q the relationship between water age and discharge a q is a potential descriptor providing information about flow paths and mixing processes in this study the hysteretic behaviour of nitrate and water age were estimated with the method of the loop cyclic of c q and a q respectively which reveal the lags in response between discharge and solute concentration and water age the hysteresis index by lloyd et al 2016 is adopted to characterize the size and shape of the hysteresis loop first raw discharge and concentration data for individual rainfall events are normalized by 1 q i q i q min q max q min 2 c i c i c min c max c min where qi and ci are the discharge and concentration respectively at time step i qmin and cmin are the minimum discharge and concentration respectively qmax and cmax are the maximum discharge and concentration respectively based on the normalized data the hysteresis index at a specific percentile of the normalized discharge for the corresponding rainfall event is calculated as 3 hi q j c r l q j c f l q j where hi q j is the hysteresis index at percentile j of the normalized discharge and c r l q j and c f l q j are the normalized concentrations at percentile j of the normalized discharge on the rising and falling limbs respectively if there is no measured concentration value at the equivalent discharge point on the rising or falling limb linear interpolation is used to generate a value on the corresponding limb c r l q j or c f l q j respectively then the final hi for the rainfall event is the mean of all hysteresis indexes at a specific percentile of the normalized discharge in this study the hysteresis index at every 10 of the discharge was calculated lloyd et al 2016 the water age is treated as a proxy for a specific tracer concentration and the hysteresis index of the water age for each rainfall event was calculated with eq 1 to 3 the value of the hysteresis index varies between 1 and 1 negative and positive values indicate anti clockwise and clockwise loops respectively the absolute value of the hysteresis index indicates the size of the hysteresis loop representing the degree of lag between the responses of the discharge and concentration or water age 3 results 3 1 temporal dynamics of no3 n concentration loading and age of underground conduit flow fig 2 shows the time series of the precipitation discharge no3 n concentration loading and flow age during the study period encompassing one full dry season november 2016 to april 2017 and one full wet reason may to october 2017 the total precipitation was 1 017 mm with a maximum hourly rainfall of 45 6 mm the mean discharge no3 n concentration and no3 n loading were 5 10 3 m3 s 3 72 mg l and 0 067 kg h respectively notable variations in underground conduit flow between the dry and wet seasons were evident from the flow duration curves from hourly observations the highly developed drainage systems in karstic hydrogeology causes a sharp rise and decline of the hydrograph during the wet season for example the discharge can vary by three orders of magnitude within a short time fig 2b the variability of no3 n concentration was much lower than that of the flow over the study period although there were several peaks both in the dry and wet seasons fig 2c in general no3 n concentrations were in a low level with the mean value of 3 4 mg l during dry season and that were in a relatively high level with the mean value of 4 mg l during wet season it was notable that immediately after fertilization october november and may june the increases of no3 n concentrations of underground conduit flow were marked when there was rainfall fig 2c and then the no3 n concentrations declined gradually with time the variability of the no3 n loading was as expected similar to that of flow exhibiting a marked seasonality fig 2d in particular nitrate export in underground conduit drainage was directly related to heavy rainfall conditions showing sharp increases after heavy storms affected by mixing of pre event and event water younger water the age of underground conduit flow derived from the tracer aided model revealed a clear seasonality with a mean value of 531 and 271 days the dry and wet season respectively fig 2e notably the flow age exhibited dramatic changes after heavy rainfall decreasing from 500 days to 1 day especially during the transition period between the dry and wet seasons fig 2e summary statistics of the precipitation discharge no3 n concentration loading and flow age during the study period are shown in table 1 3 2 relationships between nitrate concentration loading and discharge age of underground conduit fig 3 shows the relationships between the measured discharge no3 n concentrations and loadings during the study period the c q pattern is classified using a simple power law c aqb with exponent b indicating the c q archetype which reflects the integration of hydrological processes and biogeochemical reactions at the catchment scale godsey et al 2009 musolff et al 2015 exponent b is 0 03 in the fitting of the hourly no3 n concentration and discharge in underground conduit at the catchment outlet this reveals a generally constant pattern absolute b 0 1 thompson et al 2011 indicating relatively small variations in no3 n concentrations compared to discharge however there are many banded or noisy variations in no3 n concentration with the discharge associated with specific rainfall events fig 3 which suggests that different c q patterns may appear under different hydroclimatic situations contrasting antecedent and fertilization conditions in contrast the hourly no3 n loading in underground conduit flow increases almost linearly with the discharge the wide ranges of flow age at catchment outlet could provide further insight into the temporal dynamics of flow paths and mixing processes affecting the spatial temporal variations in nitrate fate at the catchment scale the changes in no3 n concentration and loading with the flow age derived from the tracer aided model are shown in fig 4 the results showed that the correlation between hourly no3 n concentrations and flow age in the underground conduit was not significant this is consistent with the findings that nitrate concentration dynamic in conduit flow in karst catchment are affected by multiple factors such as n sources rainfall amount and intensity flow paths biogeochemical interactions and mixing processes yue et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a 2020b husic et al 2019 in contrast there was a significant negative correlation between the monthly no3 n concentration and flow age during dry season r2 0 8 with the significance level of 0 05 that was probably due to the more limited variation in hydrological conditions causing biogeochemical reactions e g denitrification to be the main controlling factor for no3 n concentrations in underground conduit flow due to the changeable hydrometeorological conditions and biogeochemical processes there was a weak positive correlation between the monthly no3 n concentration and flow age during wet season r2 0 11 significance level 0 05 the monthly no3 n loadings showed a dominant decrease with increasing of flow age during both dry and wet seasons and the negative correlation was more pronounced for the dry season r2 0 81 than that for the wet season r2 0 24 while the mean no3 n loadings during the wet season 0 12 kg h were much higher than that during the dry season 0 01 kg h obviously the high no3 n loadings corresponded to some specific flow age ranges during both dry and wet seasons for example during the dry season highest no3 n loadings mainly occurred when the flow ages varied between 250 and 450 days during the wet season the high no3 n loadings corresponded to flow ages 200 days e g the maximum no3 n loading was 2 5 kg h when the water age was 61 days fig 4a in general the no3 n loadings changed sharply from 0 1 to 2 6 kg h when the flow age ranges were between 30 to 150 days during the wet season 3 3 nitrate concentration and flow age hysteresis behaviours in rainfall events to examine the hysteresis of nitrate concentration and flow age with respect to discharge and its control of flow paths and mixing a total of 15 rainfall events during the study period were selected for analysis with 3 events in dry season and 12 events in wet season table 2 a rainfall event here is defined as a rain period in which there is no continuous 24 h spell without rainfall of these 15 selected rainfall events the maximum rain amount was 86 8 mm and the minimum rain amount was 7 7 mm the mean discharges were 0 005 and 0 037 m3 s for the 3 rainfall events in dry season events and the 12 rainfall events in wet season events respectively the mean age of the underground conduit flow in the dry season rainfall events 416 days was approximately 3 4 times that in the wet season events 121 days while the difference of no3 n concentration between dry and wet season rainfall events was relatively small with mean values of 3 5 and 3 9 mg l respectively the correlations between hourly discharge and no3 n concentration flow age in underground conduit for the 15 chosen rainfall events were estimated in this study fig s1 in appendix although some of them were not significant due to multiple confounding influences it could provide potential indications for flow paths and mixing processes the results showed that the flow age and discharge a q were negatively correlated for all 15 rainfall events table 2 which indicated that the rain water caused the decline of modelled age of underground conduit flow in contrast the relationships between no3 n concentration and discharge c q were more complex a negative correlation between no3 n concentration and discharge occurs in 9 of the 12 rainfall events in wet season while the other 3 wet season rainfall events as well as the 3 rainfall events during dry season exhibited a positive correlation table 2 it is worth noting that the 6 rainfall events with positive correlation between no3 n concentration and discharge occurred immediately after or close to fertilization may june and october november and the other rainfall events with negative correlation were in mid and later wet season this reveals that n supply conditions have a significant influence on nitrate dynamics of underground conduit flow in rainfall event fig 5 shows the inter relationships of discharge no3 n concentration and flow age for two representative rainfall events in the dry and wet seasons respectively those for the remaining selected rainfall events are in fig s2 in the appendix the results showed that the a q relationship for each of all the 15 selected rainfall events exhibited an anti clockwise loop pattern implying that the mean flow age on the rising limb of the hydrograph was lower than that on the falling limb which revealed that the response of flow age to rainfall was quicker than that for discharge the absolute values of a q hysteresis index of rainfall events in dry season mean 0 64 for events 1 2 and 3 were significantly higher than that in the wet season mean 0 24 for events 4 to15 which indicated that in general the time lag between age and discharge was smaller for the wet season than for the dry season for example the mean time lag between the lowest age and discharge peak was 10 h for rainfall events in the dry season and that was 4 h for rainfall events in wet seasons for no3 n concentrations the three rainfall events in dry season exhibited anti clockwise hysteresis with negative hysteresis index values indicating that the mean no3 n concentration of underground conduit flow was lower on rising limb of hydrograph than that on falling limb which revealed that the no3 n concentration peak occurred later than discharge peak in these three rainfall events the no3 n concentrations of underground channel flow eventually exceeded the corresponding initial level this could be due to the mobilization of external nitrate in soil e g fertilizer by rainfall this is consistent with the positive correlation between no3 n concentrations and discharge govern by rainfall in table 2 eight of the 12 rainfall events in wet season exhibited a figure of eight or complex loop pattern which indicates the complexity of no3 n concentration dynamics and its hysteresis behaviour in the wet season although not all rainfall events showed simple unidirectional loops the method of hysteresis index in this study effectively normalises the hydrograph and examines the relative behaviour of the rising and falling limb thereby identifying the proportion of the rainfall event occurring in a clockwise or anti clockwise phase lloyd et al 2016 therefore the hysteresis indexes for all rainfall events were calculated for assessment of their inter relationships between no3 n concentration and discharge table 2 the results showed that 7 of the 12 rainfall events in wet season had positive hysteresis index indicating higher mean no3 n concentration on the rising limb of hydrograph than that on the falling limbs which reveals abundant nitrate supply during the rising limb period in contrast the negative hysteresis index values for the other 5 rainfall events in wet season suggest the limited supply of nitrate to underground conduit at the beginning of rainfall event it is worth noting that there was a notable decline of no3 n concentration at the start of each rainfall event in both dry and wet seasons fig 5 and s2 which implied that a part of rain water with low no3 n concentration entered the underground conduit quickly just after rainfall started this decline in no3 n concentration was almost synchronous with age decline of underground conduit flow in dry season which implies that the event water with low age draining through preferential flow paths leads to the attenuation of nitrate in underground conduit flow however the time lags between the lowest flow age and peak no3 n concentrations of conduit flows were significantly longer for rainfall events in wet season than that in dry season for example the mean time lag between lowest flow age and peak no3 n concentration was close to 0 for the three dry season rainfall events but increased to 5 h for the 12 rainfall events in wet season this is most likely caused by the greater transport capacity for mobilizing nitrate by heavy rainfall in the wet season which delays the decline in no3 n concentration of underground conduit flow this is consistent with the findings in other studies that more nitrate is produced as soils become wetter and successive rainfall events can facilitate greater nitrate leaching as catchments become more hydrologically connected rusjan et al 2008 hansen and singh 2018 3 4 no3 n export with catchment drainage driven by specific rainfall events to assess how no3 n export in underground conduit flow was driven by specific rainfall events three events event 2 7 and 12 out of the 15 events listed in table 2 with similar rainfall amounts 26 mm were selected for the analysis the three events on t1 28 november 2016 dry season t2 26 june 2017 and 2 august 2017 wet season the no3 n export with the underground conduit flow driven by each rainfall event was estimated using the flux tracking method described in the methodology section the intensity and duration of rainfall for the three selected events were notably different e g there were 35 40 and 5 rain hours in the three events with similar rainfall amounts the maximum hourly rainfall intensity for each event was 3 9 2 8 and 20 4 mm respectively fig 6 f as expected the amount of no3 n export driven by the rainfall events in dry season was notably lower than in the wet season fig 6c d and e for event 2 in the dry season approximately 9 25 kg no3 n was exported with the underground conduit flow over the period from the entry time of rainwater to the end of the study period a total of 336 days in contrast the same no3 n export amount driven by the 7th and 12th events in the wet season only required 4 and 2 days respectively the highest no3 n export rate for event 2 in dry season was 0 57 kg d occurring 223 days after the rainfall fig 6c which implies that most of the entering rainwater was stored in the critical zone during dry periods and released during wet periods resulting in relatively high no3 n transport under high wetness condition the maximum no3 n export rates of events 7 and 12 were 5 9 and 9 1 kg d respectively fig 6d and e which both occurred at the beginning of the rainfall events the 4th and second days respectively after the initial rainfall it seems that the higher no3 n export rate of event 12 is due to the high rainfall intensity from the results although the rainfall occurring in dry season is unable to connect to drainage networks and transport large amounts of nitrate out of catchment in a short time the nitrate export in wet season driven by the old water from previous rainfall should not be ignored 4 discussion the dynamics of solute concentrations and loading and their relationships to water age in streamflow are mainly controlled by both supply and transport conditions which have been widely reported for non karst catchments reddy et al 2011 tunaley et al 2016 van metre et al 2016 compared to most non karst catchments the variations in flow paths and mixing processes under different hydrometeorological and critical zone structure conditions in a karst landscapes are more dramatic hartmann et al 2014 especially partial mixing usually occurs in the karst critical zone with notable shifts between fast flow e g the flow within macropores and slow flow e g matrix flow van schaik et al 2008 legout et al 2009 this implies that during the same rainfall event poorly mixed water in proximal zones to drainage networs and the well mixed water in more distal areas impose both dilution and enrichment effects on underground conduit flow respectively this inference is consistent with the findings that connectivity between the solute source and stream causes the variations in solute concentration and c q pattern of the streamflow herndon et al 2015 schwab et al 2017 from these inferences and the results of this study a conceptual model of flow and n transport in the karst catchment can be developed fig 7 due to intense fertilization on farm land surface soil in the depression is the largest nitrogen reservoir in the catchment hence the nitrate supply of underground conduit flow is mainly controlled by the infiltrated flow in that can mobilize n from the surface soil layer and transport it during the dry season the high contribution of water from small fractures in the slow flow reservoir results in high ages of underground conduit flow fig 7a since the small fracture water has less contact with the surface soil it transports less nitrate to underground conduit even if there is some infiltrated water from deeper soil layers draining to fractures or conduits this will bring in less nitrate due to denitrification it can be inferred that small fractures provide an anaerobic environment due to their tiny spaces under soil and rock cover which enhances the denitrification leading higher nitrate removal tesoriero and puckett 2011 heffernan et al 2012 kolbe et al 2016 benettin et al 2020 although the small fractures have not received much attention they may be another important underground hot spot for denitrification leading to nitrate removal in karst catchments therefore underground conduit flow usually exhibits a gradual decline or relatively constant pattern in nitrate concentration during dry season especially during no rain period fig 2 this is also consistent with the negative correlation between no3 n concentration and flow age during dry season fig 4 when rainfall occurs in the dry season part of the rainfall rapidly infiltrates through large fractures at beginning of the event leading a decline in the age of the underground conduit flow fig 7b due to the high percolation rate this quick infiltrated water has less contact time with surface soil meaning little leaching of nitrate and poor mixing with pre event soil water which also leads a drop in no3 n concentrations of conduit flow hence although large fractures account for a small proportion in karst aquifer approximately 8 by zhang et al 2013 they can impose dominant effects on water and solute transport processes in karst critical zone consequently the well mixed water with more leached nitrate enters underground conduit resulting in a significant increase in no3 n concentration of conduit flow fig 7b generally the low ages of the underground conduit flow during wet season depends on the high contributions of event water from rapid flow through large fractures or sinkholes fig 7c however the no3 n concentrations of underground conduit flow vary greatly in different stages of the wet season due to the influence of nitrate supply conditions the heavy fertilization that occurs at beginning of wet season may june leads abundant storage of nitrate in soil layer during this period with the increase of hydrological connectivity between surface and underground conduits greater infiltration of soil water with high no3 n concentration cause a relatively high level of no3 n concentrations in underground conduit flow especially during the period immediately after fertilization as no3 n transport and removal e g denitrification and plant uptake progresses the no3 n storage in the soil layer gradually decreases in addition the increase of rainfall enhances solute dilution during the middle and later wet season e g july and august which leads a relatively low level in no3 n concentrations of underground conduit flow from these variations it can be inferred that the main controlling condition changes from transport limited at the beginning of wet season to supply limited at the middle and latter of wet season the pattern of decline then increase in nitrate concentration of underground conduit flow for rainfall event in the wet season is similar to that in dry season fig 7d and the high contribution of hillslope flow enhances the dilution of the underground conduit flow under high wetness condition unlike in the dry season the no3 n concentrations of underground conduit flow usually return to the pre event levels after the rainfall event due to the supply limited condition wider implication from this study is the controlling influence of the soil rock interface on nitrate transport in karst catchment the time lags of no3 n concentration peak to discharge peak for some rainfall events are only several hours fig s2 even in the dry season from previous studies in this catchment the soil thickness is 2 m and the hydrological conductivity of the soil is about 10 5 m s for the lower cultivated areas zhang et al 2011 according to this from first approximations it will take more than 56 h for rain water and no3 n to enter into underground conduit through soil matrix hence there may be preferential paths connecting the soil to the underground conduit for water and no3 n infiltration wang et al 2020 reported that high proportion of nitrate loss from peak clusters and lowland farmland during heavy rainfall events based on nitrate isotopes which supports this explanation in the south western karst area of china soil layer in depression for agriculture is usually interspersed with rocks therefore the soil rock interface may provide the fast pathways for high nitrate fluxes especially in the wet season after fertilization 5 conclusion in this study water age was linked to nitrate dynamics in underground conduit flow from a 1 25 km2 karst catchment in southwestern china a tracer aided model for the catchment developed by zhang et al 2019 and calibrated on flows and stable isotopes was adopted to determine the age of underground conduit flow high frequency measurements allowed us to examine the inter relationships between nitrate and discharge dynamics and their connections with the flow age the variations in flow age and nitrate concentration loading are mainly controlled by flow pathways and mixing processes in karst catchment high contribution of small fracture water leads a low nitrate concentration and a negative correlation between nitrate concentrations and flow age in underground conduit flow during dry season which implies that the small fractures may be another important hot spot for denitrification causing nitrate removal in the karst critical zone the changes between transport limited and supply limited conditions cause the marked variations in nitrate concentration of underground conduit flow the notable dilution effects of event water via fast flow path cause a sharp drop in age and nitrate concentration of the underground conduit flow at the beginning of rainfall while the mobilization of nitrate in surface soil layers leads the increase of nitrate concentration at the middle and latter of rainfall the ability to transport nitrate out of the catchment can be potentially enhanced when old water is displaced and mobilized under high wetness conditions this study reports advances in integrating of tracer aided model and higher frequency observation of nitrate in linking nitrate dynamics to water age which provides crucial insight into nitrate transport and mixing in complex karst environments this highlights the karstic landform and critical zone features controlling on variations in nitrate transport in karst catchments which will improve our ability to evaluate the effects of climate change and agricultural management on nitrate pollution help underpin decision support tools however the controls on nitrate dynamics and associated water age in the different landscape units in karst catchments requires further research which will necessitates longer and more detailed spatio temporal observation data e g nitrate concentration in the hillslopes wells and fractures in the epikarst credit authorship contribution

4748,although numerous studies on nitrate transport and transformation in karst catchments have been reported many challenges in understanding nitrate fluxes remain due to the unique architecture of karst critical zones and complex hydrological processes water age is an important descriptor of hydrological function providing insight to into flow paths and water sources at the catchment scale this offers a potential opportunity to better understand the spatio temporal variations in nitrate dynamics in karst catchments we linked the nitrate dynamics of underground conduit flow to water age extracted from a robust tracer aided model for a karst catchment in southwestern china the results show that nitrate dynamics in underground conduit flow are controlled by the coupling of nitrate supply and of flow paths in the karst catchment high contributions of drainage from small fractures water leads to low nitrate concentrations in underground conduit flow during the dry season this reveals that the small fractures may be another important hot spot for denitrification leading to nitrate removal in the karst critical zone the switching between transport limited and supply limited conditions cause the marked variations in nitrate concentration of underground conduit flow during wet season although rapid infiltration via large fractures and sinkholes have strong dilution effects on nitrate in underground conduit flow at beginning of rainfall more nitrate was transported out of the catchment with drainage during rainfall events due to the mobilization of soil nitrate by rainfall meanwhile the capacity to transport nitrate out of catchment can be potentially activated when the old water is displaced by rainfall under high wetness condition keywords karst catchment nitrate dynamics water age underground conduit 1 introduction the karst critical zone comprises complex porous media encompassing soil small fractures large fractures and conduits ford and williams 2007 which cause a diverse range of hydrological processes at the catchment scale hartmann et al 2014 the sharp responses of stream and underground conduit flows to rainfall are notable due to the very high permeability of karst aquifers and well developed subsurface fracture conduit networks white 2002 in particular the unique landform structure of sinkholes provides direct flow paths linking the surface epikarst to underground drainage networks after heavy rain which strengthens hydrological connectivity between surface and subsurface systems tihansky 1999 increased fertilization using n for agriculture creates a high n pollution risk in karst maringanti et al 2009 yang et al 2020 high nitrate concentrations in streamflow have been observed in many agricultural catchments with intense fertilization kellman and hillaire marcel 2003 barnes and raymond 2009 heaton et al 2012 overapplication of fertilizer as well as wrong timing of application potentially lead to major nitrate leaching losses and unsustainable land and water management practices di and cameron 2002 understanding the resulting spatio temporal dynamics of nitrate in aquifer and stream flow is critical to water resources and agriculture management in karst areas the transport and transformation of nitrate in karst areas is more complex than that in non karst environments because of the marked spatial heterogeneity of the hydrodynamic behaviour hartmann et al 2014 along with water flows in the karst critical zone nitrate transport is strongly controlled by hydrological connectivity between different landform units e g hillslopes and depressions as well as different porous media e g small fractures and conduits zhang et al 2020a nitrate is easily leached into aquifers due to the thin soils and quick infiltration rate in karst yue et al 2015 in addition to soil the epikarst is a substantial nitrate reservoir where the transport and biogeochemical transformations of nitrate e g denitrification cannot be ignored husic et al 2019 an important research gap on nitrate in karst regions is that different nitrate transport pathways affect nitrate behaviour in stream or underground conduit flows although some researchers have reported findings on this results can be contradictory for example husic et al 2019 indicated that the slow to moderate flow pathways in epikarst contribute most nitrate to streamflow nearly 90 of the downstream nitrate flux while wang et al 2020 found that very large amounts of nitrate enter drainage systems through fast flow paths after heavy rains characterisation of the relationship between nitrate concentration and discharge c q is a popular method for assessing nitrate dynamics at the catchment scale basu et al 2010 duncan et al 2017 zhi et al 2019 the c q response pattern is usually categorized into three types dilution enrichment and constant which imply different hydrological flow paths and biogeochemical reactions musolff et al 2017 in particular the c q relationship for a rainfall event usually exhibits looped trajectories due to hysteretic behaviour of the solute concentration relative to discharge williams 1989 analysis of the c q hysteresis behaviour has been widely adopted to examine solute transport in catchments bieroza and heathwaite 2015 bowes et al 2015 lloyd et al 2016 perks et al 2015 it can provide insights into the spatio temporal dynamics of solute concentrations and their linkage to watershed structure storage variations and hydrologic connectivity under different hydroclimatic conditions perks et al 2015 as descriptors of hydrological function the age of water in various fluxes can reveal how catchment storage mediates flow path activation and mixing processes kirchner et al 2000 botter 2012 mcdonnell and beven 2014 soulsby et al 2015 sprenger et al 2019 therefore linking solute dynamics to water ages can potentially provide new insights into the coupling of hydrological and transport processes at the catchment scale benettin et al 2015 2020 tunaley et al 2016 metrics of water age are traditionally referred to as specific times such as the mean travel time defining as the average time interval between the entrance and the exit of a water particle in a catchment or the mean residence time of water in a particular store and the alternative age metrics of young water fraction defining the fraction of water with transit times between zero and a specific age threshold typically 2 3 months water aged have been widely estimated using conservative tracers e g stable isotopes hrachowitz et al 2009 birkel and soulsby 2015 kirchner 2016a 2016b time invariant approaches e g lumped convolution approaches were often adopted in the early estimations of travel time distributions ttd and mean travel times mtt as well examination of the influences of climate and landscape properties heidbüchel et al 2013 however these simplified approaches have limited application in complex dynamic flow systems exhibiting non steady state response to hydroclimatic variability botter 2012 many time variant approaches have been proposed for the characterization of age distributions of catchment water storage and fluxes for example water age dynamics can be inferred by simulating transport processes at the catchment scale through storage selection sas functions that collapse complex transport processes into a unified framework of age related storage rinaldo et al 2015 recent advances in tracer aided hydrological modelling have also provided more constrained water age estimates by tracking water and tracer fluxes e g mcmillan et al 2012 soulsby et al 2015 piovano et al 2019 moreover tracer aided models allow the estimation of probability density functions pdfs of travel residence times describing the fate of rainfall water particles traveling through catchments remondi et al 2018 despite many existing studies on nitrate dynamics and their controlling influences in karst areas liu et al 2006 schilling and helmers 2008 husic et al 2019 great challenges in improving understanding of nitrate transport and transformation in this unique hydrogeological system remain to help address the general research gaps in nitrate processes in karst catchments our overall objective is to use water ages as a tool to better understand the influence of flow path dynamics on nitrate behaviour in underground conduits and the associated controlling effects of hydroclimatic and nitrate supply conditions more specifically in this study we address three questions for karst catchment 1 what are the relationships between nitrate concentration loading and water age in underground conduit flow under different hydroclimatic conditions 2 how does the intra rainfall event hysteresis between nitrate concentration and water age of underground conduit flow vary under different hydroclimatic conditions 3 how do water sources and flow paths affect nitrate and water age dynamics in underground conduit flow 2 site and methodology 2 1 study catchment the chenqi catchment with surface area of 1 25 km2 is a typical cockpit karst landscape located at the puding karst ecohydrological observation station in guizhou province southwest china fig 1 this catchment is surrounded by conical hills separated by star shaped valleys zhang et al 2011 chen et al 2018 the elevation ranges from 1 340 to 1 500 m above sea level fig 1a this region is subject to a subtropical wet monsoon climate and has a mean annual temperature of 20 1 c with the highest temperatures typically occurring in july and the lowest ones in january the mean annual precipitation is 1 140 mm according to long term measured data in the catchment the wet season lasts from may to september and the dry season from october through to april of the following year the catchment contains two main landscape units depressions with low elevations 1340 m and hillslopes with a high elevation ranging from 1 340 1 500 m the spatial extents of the depressions and hillslopes derived from a 1 10 000 digital topography map are 0 37 and 0 88 km2 respectively the catchment is drained by a single underground conduit fig 1a geological units in the catchment include dolostone thick and thin limestones marl and quaternary soil the thickness of the limestone formations is approximately 150 200 m above the impervious marl formation the low permeability causes precipitation to recharge perched groundwater on the marl which then moves laterally to be discharged in the lower areas hence the marl formation is a key control on the distribution of hillside springs in this region on the hillslopes the quaternary soils covering carbonate rocks are very thin with an average thickness of 30 cm while the average thickness of the soil layer in the depression is greater than 2 m limestone fragments occur in the soil layer and the rock outcrop area accounts for 10 30 of the total area the vegetation characteristics include deciduous broad leaved forests shrubs and grass at the top and middle of the hillslopes and crops at the lower end of the hillslopes and in the depression which has a thick soil layer fig 1b a rice rape crop rotation is the main land use in the depression and a corn rape crop rotation occurs at the foot of the hillslopes fertilization is common in agricultural regions in southwest china leading extensive potentially long term contamination of the karst system fenton et al 2017 in this catchment organic fertilizers e g cattle and pig manure and chemical fertilizers e g urea and diammonium phosphate are mainly applied for rice and rape crops in the depression fig 1 the light fertilization for rape occurs in october november and the heavy fertilization for rice is in may early june yue et al 2019 at chenqi there are two flow observation points the underground conduit spring at catchment outlet and a hillslope spring located at the foot of the eastern steep hillslope fig 1a the discharge at the two springs is measured at time intervals of 15 min using v notch weirs instrumented with hobo u20 water level loggers onset corporation usa four automatic weather stations are located on the upper hillslopes precipitation air temperature wind parameters radiation air humidity and air pressure are all recorded at time intervals of 5 min the no3 n concentration at the catchment outlet is monitored using a non optical nise sensor at time intervals of 15 min the sensor is powered by 24 v dc batteries supplemented by solar panels the sensor has been calibrated using the laboratory measured concentrations of grab samples manually collected over the duration of the observation period and the uncertainty of estimated field no3 n is between 0 04 and 0 64 mg l yue et al 2019 all the observations were performed from 1 november 2016 to 30 october 2017 2 2 simulated age and travel time distribution of underground conduit flow a tracer aided hydrological model for karst catchments has been developed and applied to chenqi by zhang et al 2019 this model disaggregates the cockpit karst catchment into the two dominant landscape units of the hillslopes and depressions for depressions a two reservoir model linking slow and fast reservoirs is applied to simulate the water and tracer transport conceptualising the typical dual flow system of the karst critical zone hartmann et al 2014 the slow flow reservoir represents the low permeability media e g primary porosity in the matrix blocks and small fractures in the aquifer the fast flow reservoir mainly represents the large fractures and conduits with a high permeability the outlet of the fast flow reservoir is the catchment outlet to reduce the model parameterization one reservoir with an additional passive store only for the tracer mixing simulation is employed to estimate the water and tracer dynamics in the hillslope unit this method can not only realize the partial mixing of tracers at the catchment scale but can also reduce the model parameterization tetzlaff et al 2014 model calibration and verification have been performed using high temporal resolution measured data hourly of flow and stable isotopes at outlet hillslope spring and groundwater wells in the study catchment full detail in zhang et al 2019 the results revealed that the model can capture the flow and tracer dynamics within each landscape unit quite well and has a strong capacity to track the hourly water and isotope fluxes through each landscape unit this allows the associated storage and hydrological connectivity dynamics to be characterised as well as the time variant age of underground conduit flow zhang et al 2019 the series of flow age over the study period derived from this tracer aided model were used to explore nitrate export from the catchment by linking it to observed nitrate dynamics furthermore once calibrated the tracer aided model can be run multiple times in parallel to separately track the fate of each hourly rainfall input during event the water over each rainfall hour is uniquely labelled with a specific tracer concentration then by estimating the variation in tracer mass over time at the catchment outlet the fate of the rainwater during each rainfall hour reaching the outlet as discharge can be tracked forward hence the travel time distributions ttd of rain entering catchment at each rainfall hour can be estimated remondi et al 2018 then the discharge over time at outlet generated by a specific rainfall can be calculated by multiplying the corresponding water amount of rainfall minus evaporation and its ttd using this approach a total of 892 rainfall hours during the study period were tracked and the results were used to explore the dynamics of nitrate export at catchment outlet driven by rainfall the amount of no3 n export depends on the no3 n concentration and discharge at underground conduit outlet for each time step the no3 n export driven by a specific rainfall is calculated by the no3 n concentration of underground conduit flow multiplied by the discharge generated from the corresponding rainfall i e the amount of rainfall minus evaporation multiplied by ttd of outflow this means that based on the observed concentrations the estimation of no3 n export over time driven by each rainfall event only takes into account the discharge generated by it without considering the biogeochemical reactions please refer to zhang et al 2019 and zhang et al 2020b for full details on how the flow age was calculated and how rainwater was tracked in the model 2 3 hysteresis analysis as a fingerprint of water flow water age is usually treated as a specific tracer concentration botter et al 2011 remondi et al 2018 similar to the relationship between concentration and discharge c q the relationship between water age and discharge a q is a potential descriptor providing information about flow paths and mixing processes in this study the hysteretic behaviour of nitrate and water age were estimated with the method of the loop cyclic of c q and a q respectively which reveal the lags in response between discharge and solute concentration and water age the hysteresis index by lloyd et al 2016 is adopted to characterize the size and shape of the hysteresis loop first raw discharge and concentration data for individual rainfall events are normalized by 1 q i q i q min q max q min 2 c i c i c min c max c min where qi and ci are the discharge and concentration respectively at time step i qmin and cmin are the minimum discharge and concentration respectively qmax and cmax are the maximum discharge and concentration respectively based on the normalized data the hysteresis index at a specific percentile of the normalized discharge for the corresponding rainfall event is calculated as 3 hi q j c r l q j c f l q j where hi q j is the hysteresis index at percentile j of the normalized discharge and c r l q j and c f l q j are the normalized concentrations at percentile j of the normalized discharge on the rising and falling limbs respectively if there is no measured concentration value at the equivalent discharge point on the rising or falling limb linear interpolation is used to generate a value on the corresponding limb c r l q j or c f l q j respectively then the final hi for the rainfall event is the mean of all hysteresis indexes at a specific percentile of the normalized discharge in this study the hysteresis index at every 10 of the discharge was calculated lloyd et al 2016 the water age is treated as a proxy for a specific tracer concentration and the hysteresis index of the water age for each rainfall event was calculated with eq 1 to 3 the value of the hysteresis index varies between 1 and 1 negative and positive values indicate anti clockwise and clockwise loops respectively the absolute value of the hysteresis index indicates the size of the hysteresis loop representing the degree of lag between the responses of the discharge and concentration or water age 3 results 3 1 temporal dynamics of no3 n concentration loading and age of underground conduit flow fig 2 shows the time series of the precipitation discharge no3 n concentration loading and flow age during the study period encompassing one full dry season november 2016 to april 2017 and one full wet reason may to october 2017 the total precipitation was 1 017 mm with a maximum hourly rainfall of 45 6 mm the mean discharge no3 n concentration and no3 n loading were 5 10 3 m3 s 3 72 mg l and 0 067 kg h respectively notable variations in underground conduit flow between the dry and wet seasons were evident from the flow duration curves from hourly observations the highly developed drainage systems in karstic hydrogeology causes a sharp rise and decline of the hydrograph during the wet season for example the discharge can vary by three orders of magnitude within a short time fig 2b the variability of no3 n concentration was much lower than that of the flow over the study period although there were several peaks both in the dry and wet seasons fig 2c in general no3 n concentrations were in a low level with the mean value of 3 4 mg l during dry season and that were in a relatively high level with the mean value of 4 mg l during wet season it was notable that immediately after fertilization october november and may june the increases of no3 n concentrations of underground conduit flow were marked when there was rainfall fig 2c and then the no3 n concentrations declined gradually with time the variability of the no3 n loading was as expected similar to that of flow exhibiting a marked seasonality fig 2d in particular nitrate export in underground conduit drainage was directly related to heavy rainfall conditions showing sharp increases after heavy storms affected by mixing of pre event and event water younger water the age of underground conduit flow derived from the tracer aided model revealed a clear seasonality with a mean value of 531 and 271 days the dry and wet season respectively fig 2e notably the flow age exhibited dramatic changes after heavy rainfall decreasing from 500 days to 1 day especially during the transition period between the dry and wet seasons fig 2e summary statistics of the precipitation discharge no3 n concentration loading and flow age during the study period are shown in table 1 3 2 relationships between nitrate concentration loading and discharge age of underground conduit fig 3 shows the relationships between the measured discharge no3 n concentrations and loadings during the study period the c q pattern is classified using a simple power law c aqb with exponent b indicating the c q archetype which reflects the integration of hydrological processes and biogeochemical reactions at the catchment scale godsey et al 2009 musolff et al 2015 exponent b is 0 03 in the fitting of the hourly no3 n concentration and discharge in underground conduit at the catchment outlet this reveals a generally constant pattern absolute b 0 1 thompson et al 2011 indicating relatively small variations in no3 n concentrations compared to discharge however there are many banded or noisy variations in no3 n concentration with the discharge associated with specific rainfall events fig 3 which suggests that different c q patterns may appear under different hydroclimatic situations contrasting antecedent and fertilization conditions in contrast the hourly no3 n loading in underground conduit flow increases almost linearly with the discharge the wide ranges of flow age at catchment outlet could provide further insight into the temporal dynamics of flow paths and mixing processes affecting the spatial temporal variations in nitrate fate at the catchment scale the changes in no3 n concentration and loading with the flow age derived from the tracer aided model are shown in fig 4 the results showed that the correlation between hourly no3 n concentrations and flow age in the underground conduit was not significant this is consistent with the findings that nitrate concentration dynamic in conduit flow in karst catchment are affected by multiple factors such as n sources rainfall amount and intensity flow paths biogeochemical interactions and mixing processes yue et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a 2020b husic et al 2019 in contrast there was a significant negative correlation between the monthly no3 n concentration and flow age during dry season r2 0 8 with the significance level of 0 05 that was probably due to the more limited variation in hydrological conditions causing biogeochemical reactions e g denitrification to be the main controlling factor for no3 n concentrations in underground conduit flow due to the changeable hydrometeorological conditions and biogeochemical processes there was a weak positive correlation between the monthly no3 n concentration and flow age during wet season r2 0 11 significance level 0 05 the monthly no3 n loadings showed a dominant decrease with increasing of flow age during both dry and wet seasons and the negative correlation was more pronounced for the dry season r2 0 81 than that for the wet season r2 0 24 while the mean no3 n loadings during the wet season 0 12 kg h were much higher than that during the dry season 0 01 kg h obviously the high no3 n loadings corresponded to some specific flow age ranges during both dry and wet seasons for example during the dry season highest no3 n loadings mainly occurred when the flow ages varied between 250 and 450 days during the wet season the high no3 n loadings corresponded to flow ages 200 days e g the maximum no3 n loading was 2 5 kg h when the water age was 61 days fig 4a in general the no3 n loadings changed sharply from 0 1 to 2 6 kg h when the flow age ranges were between 30 to 150 days during the wet season 3 3 nitrate concentration and flow age hysteresis behaviours in rainfall events to examine the hysteresis of nitrate concentration and flow age with respect to discharge and its control of flow paths and mixing a total of 15 rainfall events during the study period were selected for analysis with 3 events in dry season and 12 events in wet season table 2 a rainfall event here is defined as a rain period in which there is no continuous 24 h spell without rainfall of these 15 selected rainfall events the maximum rain amount was 86 8 mm and the minimum rain amount was 7 7 mm the mean discharges were 0 005 and 0 037 m3 s for the 3 rainfall events in dry season events and the 12 rainfall events in wet season events respectively the mean age of the underground conduit flow in the dry season rainfall events 416 days was approximately 3 4 times that in the wet season events 121 days while the difference of no3 n concentration between dry and wet season rainfall events was relatively small with mean values of 3 5 and 3 9 mg l respectively the correlations between hourly discharge and no3 n concentration flow age in underground conduit for the 15 chosen rainfall events were estimated in this study fig s1 in appendix although some of them were not significant due to multiple confounding influences it could provide potential indications for flow paths and mixing processes the results showed that the flow age and discharge a q were negatively correlated for all 15 rainfall events table 2 which indicated that the rain water caused the decline of modelled age of underground conduit flow in contrast the relationships between no3 n concentration and discharge c q were more complex a negative correlation between no3 n concentration and discharge occurs in 9 of the 12 rainfall events in wet season while the other 3 wet season rainfall events as well as the 3 rainfall events during dry season exhibited a positive correlation table 2 it is worth noting that the 6 rainfall events with positive correlation between no3 n concentration and discharge occurred immediately after or close to fertilization may june and october november and the other rainfall events with negative correlation were in mid and later wet season this reveals that n supply conditions have a significant influence on nitrate dynamics of underground conduit flow in rainfall event fig 5 shows the inter relationships of discharge no3 n concentration and flow age for two representative rainfall events in the dry and wet seasons respectively those for the remaining selected rainfall events are in fig s2 in the appendix the results showed that the a q relationship for each of all the 15 selected rainfall events exhibited an anti clockwise loop pattern implying that the mean flow age on the rising limb of the hydrograph was lower than that on the falling limb which revealed that the response of flow age to rainfall was quicker than that for discharge the absolute values of a q hysteresis index of rainfall events in dry season mean 0 64 for events 1 2 and 3 were significantly higher than that in the wet season mean 0 24 for events 4 to15 which indicated that in general the time lag between age and discharge was smaller for the wet season than for the dry season for example the mean time lag between the lowest age and discharge peak was 10 h for rainfall events in the dry season and that was 4 h for rainfall events in wet seasons for no3 n concentrations the three rainfall events in dry season exhibited anti clockwise hysteresis with negative hysteresis index values indicating that the mean no3 n concentration of underground conduit flow was lower on rising limb of hydrograph than that on falling limb which revealed that the no3 n concentration peak occurred later than discharge peak in these three rainfall events the no3 n concentrations of underground channel flow eventually exceeded the corresponding initial level this could be due to the mobilization of external nitrate in soil e g fertilizer by rainfall this is consistent with the positive correlation between no3 n concentrations and discharge govern by rainfall in table 2 eight of the 12 rainfall events in wet season exhibited a figure of eight or complex loop pattern which indicates the complexity of no3 n concentration dynamics and its hysteresis behaviour in the wet season although not all rainfall events showed simple unidirectional loops the method of hysteresis index in this study effectively normalises the hydrograph and examines the relative behaviour of the rising and falling limb thereby identifying the proportion of the rainfall event occurring in a clockwise or anti clockwise phase lloyd et al 2016 therefore the hysteresis indexes for all rainfall events were calculated for assessment of their inter relationships between no3 n concentration and discharge table 2 the results showed that 7 of the 12 rainfall events in wet season had positive hysteresis index indicating higher mean no3 n concentration on the rising limb of hydrograph than that on the falling limbs which reveals abundant nitrate supply during the rising limb period in contrast the negative hysteresis index values for the other 5 rainfall events in wet season suggest the limited supply of nitrate to underground conduit at the beginning of rainfall event it is worth noting that there was a notable decline of no3 n concentration at the start of each rainfall event in both dry and wet seasons fig 5 and s2 which implied that a part of rain water with low no3 n concentration entered the underground conduit quickly just after rainfall started this decline in no3 n concentration was almost synchronous with age decline of underground conduit flow in dry season which implies that the event water with low age draining through preferential flow paths leads to the attenuation of nitrate in underground conduit flow however the time lags between the lowest flow age and peak no3 n concentrations of conduit flows were significantly longer for rainfall events in wet season than that in dry season for example the mean time lag between lowest flow age and peak no3 n concentration was close to 0 for the three dry season rainfall events but increased to 5 h for the 12 rainfall events in wet season this is most likely caused by the greater transport capacity for mobilizing nitrate by heavy rainfall in the wet season which delays the decline in no3 n concentration of underground conduit flow this is consistent with the findings in other studies that more nitrate is produced as soils become wetter and successive rainfall events can facilitate greater nitrate leaching as catchments become more hydrologically connected rusjan et al 2008 hansen and singh 2018 3 4 no3 n export with catchment drainage driven by specific rainfall events to assess how no3 n export in underground conduit flow was driven by specific rainfall events three events event 2 7 and 12 out of the 15 events listed in table 2 with similar rainfall amounts 26 mm were selected for the analysis the three events on t1 28 november 2016 dry season t2 26 june 2017 and 2 august 2017 wet season the no3 n export with the underground conduit flow driven by each rainfall event was estimated using the flux tracking method described in the methodology section the intensity and duration of rainfall for the three selected events were notably different e g there were 35 40 and 5 rain hours in the three events with similar rainfall amounts the maximum hourly rainfall intensity for each event was 3 9 2 8 and 20 4 mm respectively fig 6 f as expected the amount of no3 n export driven by the rainfall events in dry season was notably lower than in the wet season fig 6c d and e for event 2 in the dry season approximately 9 25 kg no3 n was exported with the underground conduit flow over the period from the entry time of rainwater to the end of the study period a total of 336 days in contrast the same no3 n export amount driven by the 7th and 12th events in the wet season only required 4 and 2 days respectively the highest no3 n export rate for event 2 in dry season was 0 57 kg d occurring 223 days after the rainfall fig 6c which implies that most of the entering rainwater was stored in the critical zone during dry periods and released during wet periods resulting in relatively high no3 n transport under high wetness condition the maximum no3 n export rates of events 7 and 12 were 5 9 and 9 1 kg d respectively fig 6d and e which both occurred at the beginning of the rainfall events the 4th and second days respectively after the initial rainfall it seems that the higher no3 n export rate of event 12 is due to the high rainfall intensity from the results although the rainfall occurring in dry season is unable to connect to drainage networks and transport large amounts of nitrate out of catchment in a short time the nitrate export in wet season driven by the old water from previous rainfall should not be ignored 4 discussion the dynamics of solute concentrations and loading and their relationships to water age in streamflow are mainly controlled by both supply and transport conditions which have been widely reported for non karst catchments reddy et al 2011 tunaley et al 2016 van metre et al 2016 compared to most non karst catchments the variations in flow paths and mixing processes under different hydrometeorological and critical zone structure conditions in a karst landscapes are more dramatic hartmann et al 2014 especially partial mixing usually occurs in the karst critical zone with notable shifts between fast flow e g the flow within macropores and slow flow e g matrix flow van schaik et al 2008 legout et al 2009 this implies that during the same rainfall event poorly mixed water in proximal zones to drainage networs and the well mixed water in more distal areas impose both dilution and enrichment effects on underground conduit flow respectively this inference is consistent with the findings that connectivity between the solute source and stream causes the variations in solute concentration and c q pattern of the streamflow herndon et al 2015 schwab et al 2017 from these inferences and the results of this study a conceptual model of flow and n transport in the karst catchment can be developed fig 7 due to intense fertilization on farm land surface soil in the depression is the largest nitrogen reservoir in the catchment hence the nitrate supply of underground conduit flow is mainly controlled by the infiltrated flow in that can mobilize n from the surface soil layer and transport it during the dry season the high contribution of water from small fractures in the slow flow reservoir results in high ages of underground conduit flow fig 7a since the small fracture water has less contact with the surface soil it transports less nitrate to underground conduit even if there is some infiltrated water from deeper soil layers draining to fractures or conduits this will bring in less nitrate due to denitrification it can be inferred that small fractures provide an anaerobic environment due to their tiny spaces under soil and rock cover which enhances the denitrification leading higher nitrate removal tesoriero and puckett 2011 heffernan et al 2012 kolbe et al 2016 benettin et al 2020 although the small fractures have not received much attention they may be another important underground hot spot for denitrification leading to nitrate removal in karst catchments therefore underground conduit flow usually exhibits a gradual decline or relatively constant pattern in nitrate concentration during dry season especially during no rain period fig 2 this is also consistent with the negative correlation between no3 n concentration and flow age during dry season fig 4 when rainfall occurs in the dry season part of the rainfall rapidly infiltrates through large fractures at beginning of the event leading a decline in the age of the underground conduit flow fig 7b due to the high percolation rate this quick infiltrated water has less contact time with surface soil meaning little leaching of nitrate and poor mixing with pre event soil water which also leads a drop in no3 n concentrations of conduit flow hence although large fractures account for a small proportion in karst aquifer approximately 8 by zhang et al 2013 they can impose dominant effects on water and solute transport processes in karst critical zone consequently the well mixed water with more leached nitrate enters underground conduit resulting in a significant increase in no3 n concentration of conduit flow fig 7b generally the low ages of the underground conduit flow during wet season depends on the high contributions of event water from rapid flow through large fractures or sinkholes fig 7c however the no3 n concentrations of underground conduit flow vary greatly in different stages of the wet season due to the influence of nitrate supply conditions the heavy fertilization that occurs at beginning of wet season may june leads abundant storage of nitrate in soil layer during this period with the increase of hydrological connectivity between surface and underground conduits greater infiltration of soil water with high no3 n concentration cause a relatively high level of no3 n concentrations in underground conduit flow especially during the period immediately after fertilization as no3 n transport and removal e g denitrification and plant uptake progresses the no3 n storage in the soil layer gradually decreases in addition the increase of rainfall enhances solute dilution during the middle and later wet season e g july and august which leads a relatively low level in no3 n concentrations of underground conduit flow from these variations it can be inferred that the main controlling condition changes from transport limited at the beginning of wet season to supply limited at the middle and latter of wet season the pattern of decline then increase in nitrate concentration of underground conduit flow for rainfall event in the wet season is similar to that in dry season fig 7d and the high contribution of hillslope flow enhances the dilution of the underground conduit flow under high wetness condition unlike in the dry season the no3 n concentrations of underground conduit flow usually return to the pre event levels after the rainfall event due to the supply limited condition wider implication from this study is the controlling influence of the soil rock interface on nitrate transport in karst catchment the time lags of no3 n concentration peak to discharge peak for some rainfall events are only several hours fig s2 even in the dry season from previous studies in this catchment the soil thickness is 2 m and the hydrological conductivity of the soil is about 10 5 m s for the lower cultivated areas zhang et al 2011 according to this from first approximations it will take more than 56 h for rain water and no3 n to enter into underground conduit through soil matrix hence there may be preferential paths connecting the soil to the underground conduit for water and no3 n infiltration wang et al 2020 reported that high proportion of nitrate loss from peak clusters and lowland farmland during heavy rainfall events based on nitrate isotopes which supports this explanation in the south western karst area of china soil layer in depression for agriculture is usually interspersed with rocks therefore the soil rock interface may provide the fast pathways for high nitrate fluxes especially in the wet season after fertilization 5 conclusion in this study water age was linked to nitrate dynamics in underground conduit flow from a 1 25 km2 karst catchment in southwestern china a tracer aided model for the catchment developed by zhang et al 2019 and calibrated on flows and stable isotopes was adopted to determine the age of underground conduit flow high frequency measurements allowed us to examine the inter relationships between nitrate and discharge dynamics and their connections with the flow age the variations in flow age and nitrate concentration loading are mainly controlled by flow pathways and mixing processes in karst catchment high contribution of small fracture water leads a low nitrate concentration and a negative correlation between nitrate concentrations and flow age in underground conduit flow during dry season which implies that the small fractures may be another important hot spot for denitrification causing nitrate removal in the karst critical zone the changes between transport limited and supply limited conditions cause the marked variations in nitrate concentration of underground conduit flow the notable dilution effects of event water via fast flow path cause a sharp drop in age and nitrate concentration of the underground conduit flow at the beginning of rainfall while the mobilization of nitrate in surface soil layers leads the increase of nitrate concentration at the middle and latter of rainfall the ability to transport nitrate out of the catchment can be potentially enhanced when old water is displaced and mobilized under high wetness conditions this study reports advances in integrating of tracer aided model and higher frequency observation of nitrate in linking nitrate dynamics to water age which provides crucial insight into nitrate transport and mixing in complex karst environments this highlights the karstic landform and critical zone features controlling on variations in nitrate transport in karst catchments which will improve our ability to evaluate the effects of climate change and agricultural management on nitrate pollution help underpin decision support tools however the controls on nitrate dynamics and associated water age in the different landscape units in karst catchments requires further research which will necessitates longer and more detailed spatio temporal observation data e g nitrate concentration in the hillslopes wells and fractures in the epikarst credit authorship contribution

4749,warming temperatures earlier snowmelt and the elongation of dry seasons are contributing to the propensity for more frequent and severe wildfires in semiarid mountainous watersheds which act as source watersheds for communities especially in the southwestern united states research on how vegetation and water sources will respond following wildfires in these watersheds is critical for water resource land and forest managers little research has been completed on the effect of groundwater discharged from springs on revegetation of burned forests we test whether springs as perennial sources of water in semiarid watersheds have the potential to protect roots and seeds from being damaged and facilitate the regrowth of native vegetation in areas affected by wildfires thereby creating zones of fire refugia and mitigating the propensity for floods erosion and incursion of invasive species the effect of springs on revegetation is studied in the asaayi creek watershed located in the chuska mountains nm az and in the royal gorge park located near cañon city co in the asaayi creek watershed remote sensing imagery and ground surveys show that springs facilitated revegetation following a june 2014 wildfire post fire time lapse photography reveal more abundant vegetation around springs and more diverse vegetation in areas where there are multiple springs significantly higher enhanced vegetative index evi values are observed around perennial springs in the asaayi creek watershed and also around intermittent springs in the royal gorge area one year after wildfires occurred in each study area however the revegetation around the perennial springs in the asaayi creek watershed is widespread compared to royal gorge there are multiple perennial springs that are clustered close together in asaayi creek watershed and only three intermittent flowing springs are located in the royal gorge burn area springs in the asaayi creek watershed provide a critical source of water that directly impacts soil moisture near the springs and in turn protects roots and buds allowing native vegetation to regenerate keywords mountain watersheds groundwater springs wildfire impacts fire refugia 1 introduction the climate of the southwest is expected to become hotter and drier cayan et al 2010 and the frequency and intensities of wildfires is expected to increase due to these changing climatic conditions pierce et al 2004 in arizona and new mexico an increasing number of large high severity wildfires has been observed within the last 35 years singleton et al 2019 semiarid snow dominated mountainous ssm watersheds are particularly vulnerable to wildfire activity in the southwest united states because snowpack is decreasing mote et al 2005 spring snowmelt is occurring earlier in the year lengthening the dry season and causing vegetation to become more moisture stressed westerling et al 2006 in turn creating more fuel for wildfires increased tree mortality due to increases in drought severity allen et al 2010 and from beetle kill adams et al 2017 mitton and ferrenberg 2012 may also increase the fuel for wildfires although this concept is still unresolved meigs et al 2016 additionally historical reconstruction of fires in the pinaleno mountains of southern arizona show that high fuel continuity and fuel loading due to fire suppression in combination with climatic changes were all factors that led to large high severity fires becoming a predominant fire type o connor et al 2014 this demonstrates additional factors that lead to increasing large high severity fires in ssm watersheds north of the pinaleno mountains the vulnerability of ssm watersheds to wildfires calls for focus on new ideas on mitigating wildfire impacts recently more research has been focused on fire refugia areas of a landscape that are not burned or are nominally affected by fire because of their various ecological functions such as providing habitat and promoting population reestablishment meddens et al 2018 specifically fire refugia have been found to play an important role in ponderosa pine and dry mixed conifer forest regeneration coop et al 2019 topography and fire weather have been used to predict the occurrence of fire refugia krawchuk et al 2016 some of these factors such as catchment slope and aspect overlap with hydrologic factors that are used to predict soil moisture because some springs can provide consistent moisture springs have been analyzed for potential as climate change refugia cartwright and johnson 2018 however there are few studies that examine the intersection of springs and wildfires and particularly springs as fire refugia a springs assessment project by the sky island alliance found some evidence that springs acted as fire refugia through lower burn severity observed around springs and that the primary impacts of fire on springs in the sky island region of southern arizona and california were disturbance of spring ecosystem habitats and erosion of spring channels misztal et al 2016 wildfires may also impact spring discharge due to reduced recharge of the springshed due to soil hydrophobicity neary et al 2003 changes in vegetation following wildfires can also lead to increased evapotranspiration silberstein et al 2013 and also reduced recharge to springs however increased spring flow or groundwater recharge due to a reduction in evapotranspiration following wildfires may also occur neary et al 2003 while the impacts of wildfires on springs have been studied just as reviewed there are few if any studies of the effects of springs on the revegetation of landscapes following wildfires springs often support dense riparian vegetation especially in semiarid regions stevens and meretsky 2008 comprised of trees shrubs and flowers this suggests that perennial flow from springs may likewise support post fire revegetation post fire restoration and mitigation efforts can be costly and new strategies to minimize damage and costs must be explored because little research has been conducted on the intersection of springs and wildfires forest and watershed managers do not yet consider the presence of springs in restoration and mitigation strategies the presence of springs in many ssm watersheds is integral because springs play a role in sustaining streamflow yet little is known about the role of springs in vegetative response to wildfires in mountainous watersheds springs are also important for maintaining alpine freshwater ecosystems brown et al 2007 and for being hotspots for biological diversity van der kamp 1995 stevens and meretsky 2008 both perennial and ephemeral springs support ponderosa pine tree growth and can reduce the sensitivity of these trees to drought fuchs et al 2019 a major hindrance to the revegetation of burn areas is lack of soil moisture many fires occur during dry seasons westerling et al 2006 and the lack of soil moisture which also contributes to the spark and migration of fires baker 2009 diminishes protection of roots and seeds and impedes regrowth of native vegetation following a fire springs enhance soil moisture around their discharge or emergence points and provide refuge from soil moisture depletion during dry seasons ephemeral springs will provide water for only part s of the year such as during snowmelt runoff or during the monsoon season perennial springs provide water year round springs can also be accompanied by shallow groundwater not reaching the surface that provides additional soil moisture chen and hu 2004 in principle soil moisture from springs has the potential to provide a moisture and temperature buffer for soil and litter layers where buds and seed banks are stored and to act as a source of water for quick germination of stored seeds buds and regrowth of vegetation around springs following wildfires ssm watersheds are especially important for the southwest because they regionally receive the highest amount of precipitation prism climate group 2015 store water as snowpack serreze et al 1999 feed larger river systems stewart et al 2004 and recharge surrounding aquifers earman et al 2006 tolley et al 2015 wilson and guan 2004 winograd et al 1998 impacts of wildfires on ssm watersheds include loss of homes and structures monetary expenses e g firefighting economic impacts restoration etc loss of vegetation and habitat soil hydrophobicity flooding erosion sediment transport landslides and debris flows and rapid intrusion by invasive vegetative species neary et al 2008 zouhar et al 2008 brunson and tanaka 2011 although fires are a natural component in many healthy forests of the arid southwest u s the consequences of increasing high severity wildfire activity due to climate change and past land management are problematic for ecosystems and society schoennagel et al 2017 the severity of a fire and vegetation sprouting characteristics are the main factors that determine how revegetation occurs following a wildfire miller 2000 higher intensity and severity fires can burn deeper into the litter and soil layers damaging stored seeds and buds baker 2009 lentile et al 2007 buds stored in deeper layers such as those on rhizomes and roots are least affected by fires and can resprout baker 2009 areas with very high severity fires that damage the deep stored buds and seeds rely on seeds sourced from other areas such as those that are wind blown for revegetation miller 2000 plants that rely solely on seeds to resprout such as conifers face major challenges following high severity wildfires because the only sources of seeds mature unburned trees may be located far from the burned area rother and veblen 2016 haffey et al 2018 revegetation of ssm watersheds by forbs and grasses is needed to stabilize the surface and prevent erosion robichaud et al 2010 while revegetation by trees and shrubs are needed for wildlife habitat baker 2009 high severity burn areas may require reseeding treatment to help reduce erosion and the spread of invasive species but effectiveness of reseeding treatment in combating these impacts has been variable pyke et al 2013 however some post fire treatments also increase the risk of introducing and promoting growth of non native vegetation such as cheatgrass and bull thistle zouhar et al 2008 kruse et al 2004 non native grasses such as cheatgrass used in post fire seeding treatments may be effective in erosion control but pose a risk of outcompeting native grasses and vegetation beyers 2004 natural modes of post fire revegetation are thus important especially for high severity burns in reducing negative impacts of large wildfires in this study we aim to quantify the role of springs in promoting post fire revegetation the primary research question for this study is how does the presence of mountain springs mitigate the impacts of wildfires subsidiary questions are do springs provide a buffer for initial impacts of fire on vegetation and do springs promote recovery of vegetation we hypothesize that depending on their magnitude and intermittency springs can provide a perennial source of water that impacts soil moisture and mitigates the impacts of wildfires and promotes revegetation this research uses an ecohydrologic approach to answer these questions by monitoring the vegetation around springs and non spring control areas and by characterizing the hydrology of springs in burned areas from recent wildfires in new mexico and colorado study areas in colorado and new mexico represent three different environments with different water fluxes 1 isolated ephemeral springs 2 isolated perennial spring and 3 multiple perennial springs findings for these three water flux based environments can be applied to other ssm watersheds with similar types of water fluxes from springs 2 study areas the primary study area is the asaayi creek watershed a 45 km2 watershed located in nm near the az border the watershed drains the chuska mountains within the boundaries of the navajo nation fig 1 a the chuska mountains developed on the eastern flank of the defiance plateau are composed of sedimentary rock namely the cenozoic chuska sandstone that overlies the mesozoic chinle formation and is capped by tertiary volcanic deposits the asaayi creek watershed lies at the southern end of the chuska mountains ranging in elevation from 2286 m 7500 ft at asaayi lake to 2743 m 9000 ft at the top of the chuska mountains asaayi creek is a perennial stream with several tributaries that generally flows from the northeast to southwest fig 1c the chuska mountains topography is flat topped relief at the highest elevations of the asaayi creek watershed at the top of the chuska mountains is low as the contributing area of the watershed increases the relief steepens and the stream cuts into a canyon named bowl canyon some terrace like topographic features are present in hillslopes of the watershed including areas where springs emerge asaayi creek eventually flows into asaayi lake a reservoir formed by a flood control dam vegetation is primarily pinon juniper and ponderosa pine in the highlands and sage and other shrubs grasses in the lowlands wright et al 1973 within the past 200 years the fire regime had been influenced by human activity particularly with a decline in natural fire activity associated with the rise of pastoralism guiterman et al 2019 savage and swetnam 1990 whitehair et al 2018 the human caused asaayi spelled assayii in the inciweb incident information system lake fire ignited on june 13 2014 and eventually burned 30 km2 of the 45 km2 asaayi creek watershed fig 1a the fire burned a total of 60 km2 in the chuska mountains and lasted until early july the study springs in the asaayi creek watershed are located in moderate to high burn severity areas fig 1c where a majority of overstory trees did not survive the second study area is located in the royal gorge bridge and park near cañon city colorado fig 1a and 1b royal gorge is an approximately 380 m deep canyon carved by the arkansas river through fractured volcanic and metamorphic rock elevation in royal gorge bridge and park ranges between 1615 m 5300 ft including the elevation of the arkansas river at the bottom of the gorge and 2195 m 7200 ft at the plateau vegetation varies between plain grasses and shrubs to pinon juniper in june 2013 the royal gorge fire burned 13 km2 including several park structures fig 1b restoration efforts for the royal gorge fire began in february 2014 with reseeding of a mixture of grasses in parts of the burned area goldberg 2017 although the burn severity in royal gorge is largely classified as low to moderate burn severity a majority of overstory trees did not survive the fire the asaayi lake fire and royal gorge fire both occurred during particularly dry years monthly precipitation data fig 2 from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism shows that prior to the fire precipitation was below the 1981 2010 climate normal for december 2013 to june 2014 in the asaayi creek watershed precipitation in july 2014 was above the climate normal and contributed to intense flooding and erosion in asaayi creek precipitation in the asaayi creek watershed was slightly below or above monthly climate normals for december 2014 april 2015 and well above the climate normals for may july of 2015 which aided in postfire vegetation recovery prism data for royal gorge shows that prior to the fire precipitation was below the monthly climate normals for february june of 2013 from january may of 2014 and july 2014 precipitation in royal gorge was slightly below or above the monthly climate normals 3 methods 3 1 field methods flow from the asaayi springs was gauged using either a 3 inch parshall flume or by volumetric discharge flow measurements were taken monthly between may and october in 2014 and 2015 except for june and july 2014 due the ongoing asaayi lake fire and in may september and october of 2016 in june 2016 springs in royal gorge were located on the ground however no flow measurements were taken from royal gorge springs because the flow while still observable by eye was too low ground truthing of vegetation and soil moisture around springs in the asaayi creek watershed were done using trail cameras a vegetation survey and a soil moisture survey these methods were focused on two study areas in the asaayi creek watershed 1 an area with multiple springs fig 3 b where 5 springs are located within 150 m of one another and 2 a single spring fig 3b about 200 m north of the multiple springs area where no other springs are located within 100 m in the asaayi burn area six day 6 plotwatcher pro hd trail cameras were set up in 2015 to take photos and time lapse videos 720p 1280 720 resolution between may 27 and october 15 of the following calendar year at 30 min intervals during the day three cameras were mounted directly facing spring channels each of the cameras facing the springs were paired with control cameras that were 10 30 m offset from the spring facing cameras and did not face springs the control cameras faced the same hillslopes as their associated spring facing cameras springcam1 springcam2 controlcam1 and controlcam2 were all placed in the multiple springs area springcam3 was facing the single spring and controlcam3 was also placed in the single spring area in september 2016 samples of vegetation around the multiple springs of the asaayi burn area were collected and placed in a plant press for identification plants were identified using heil et al 2013b and with the help of arnold clifford a botanist with expertise on vegetation grown in the chuska mountains on october 2016 soil moisture was measured around the springs in the asaayi burn area seventeen measurements were taken using the wet based gravimetric soil moisture method lekshmi et al 2014 measurements were taken within the top 5 cm of the surface along two transects one transect crossed the spring in the single spring area and included 7 measurements the second transect crossed two springs in the multiple springs area and included 10 measurements 3 2 remote sensing enhanced vegetative index evi landsat products from the usgs high level science data center were downloaded based on pre and post fire landsat 8 imagery for the asaayi lake fire and the royal gorge fire imagery from june 2014 to october 2016 was downloaded and projected into the utm zone 12 n coordinate system for the asaayi burn area imagery from june 2013 to october 2014 was downloaded and projected in utm zone 13 n for the royal gorge burn area evi spectral indices are scaled by the usgs by a factor of 0 0001 and the data range between 10 000 and 10 000 where more positive values indicate healthier vegetation and negative values indicate lack of vegetation u s geological survey 2016 the enhanced vegetation index evi spectral index u s geological survey 2016 was used to analyze pre and post fire revegetation in the study areas evi values were extracted around springs and compared to burned and unburned areas of each study area the algorithm for landsat 8 evi is band 4 includes red wavelengths band 6 includes short wave infrared wavelengths and band 2 includes blue wavelengths barsi et al 2014 evi was analyzed and compared between springs and non springs control areas using ibm spss the mann whitney u statistical test dinneen and blakesley 1973 was performed to test the null hypothesis that the distribution of evi is the same between extracted evi values around springs and evi values around the burned non spring areas of the watersheds for the asaayi creek burn area tests were performed using evi values from june 23 2014 postfire june 26 2015 and august 29 2015 for the royal gorge burn area tests were performed for july 8 2013 and july 27 2014 4 results 4 1 hydrology springs in the asaayi watershed are perennial hillslope and contact springs springer and stevens 2008 that emerge from the chuska sandstone the study springs are located on a west northwest facing hillslope and are within 30 m of elevation of one another discharge from the springs ranged from 0 5 to 1 5 l s between may and october of 2015 because volumetric discharge and parshall flume measurements were used to measure discharge it was difficult to capture temporal variation of flow from the springs three springs were found in the royal gorge burn area but each spring had low diffuse flow that was too difficult to accurately measure 4 2 soil moisture seventeen soil moisture measurements were taken in cross sections over three springs in the asaayi creek watershed the soil moisture samples measurements were collected during the dry base flow season for the chuska mountains in october 2016 to reduce the possibility that recent recharge and or precipitation has affected the soil moisture one cross section measured soil moisture at a single spring located over 200 m away from the other study springs in this cross section water content ranged from 60 by weight on the banks of the spring channel to 5 at 20 m away from the spring channel a second cross section that crossed two spring channels showed water content over 60 on the banks of the stream channels in between the two spring channels water content did not decrease below 10 but it did decrease below 5 towards the ends of the cross section i e moving away from the spring channels 4 3 vegetation survey seventeen different plants were collected around the asaayi springs and identified by genus four grasses 11 forbs herbs 1 tree and moss were identified table 1 the plants were collected in and around the spring channels and in between springs where multiple springs were close together because of the seasonal timing of the vegetation survey and accessibility issues these plants are only a sample of the range of vegetation growing around the springs in the burn area of the asaayi creek watershed 4 4 remote sensing evi was compared for springs and non springs in burned areas of the asaayi creek watershed between 2014 and 2015 fig 3 shows the locations of the springs and the portion of the burned asaayi creek watershed where evi values were extracted the seven study springs in the asaayi creek watershed flow westward into tributaries of asaayi creek evi values were extracted from ellipses oriented to each spring not shown because the ellipses are too small to be distinguishable on one map the major axes had a length of 90 m and the minor axes had a length of 60 m the major axes was oriented east west to capture vegetation growth due to shallow subsurface flow upslope of the spring and downstream of the spring five of the ellipses contained 6 pixels and 1 ellipse contained 5 pixels where each pixel had a 30 m 30 m resolution the non spring area included all the pixels within the burn perimeter shown in fig 3 excluding the pixels containing the ellipses the number of pixels sample size for the burned non spring areas n 24 366 is much larger than the number of pixels for the spring areas n 35 the differences in evi values between the ellipses around the springs and in non spring burned parts of the watershed were tested using the mann whitney u test the null hypothesis that the distribution of evi is the same across the spring and non spring areas was rejected distributions of post fire evi values between the spring and non spring burned areas are not normal nor similar thus mean ranks are reported the mann whitney u test assigns ranks to individual evi values from individual pixels for both the spring and non spring areas from lowest to highest so the lowest evi value is assigned a rank of 1 and the highest evi value is assigned the rank of the total number of values the ranks assigned to the individual evi are then grouped into the spring or non spring distribution the mean ranks for each distribution are averaged and reported as mean ranks fig 4 low mean ranks indicate relatively low evi values and high mean ranks indicate relatively high evi values for the distributions thus significant differences using two sided asymptotic significance levels in evi are shown as significant differences of mean ranks between the distributions immediately after the asaayi lake fire in june 2014 evi values in the spring area mean rank 9262 were significantly lower than the non spring burned area of the watershed mean rank 12 205 u 529 270 p 0 014 in june 2015 evi values for the spring area mean rank 17 919 were significantly higher than the evi values from the non spring burn areas mean rank 12 192 u 226 248 p 0 001 at the peak of the 2015 growing season in august evi values for the spring area mean rank 17 398 remained significantly higher than the evi values in the non spring burn areas mean rank 12 193 u 244 507 p 0 001 in royal gorge post fire evi values were also compared between spring and non spring burn areas between july 2013 and 2014 evi values were extracted from ellipses around the springs in royal gorge with the major axis oriented in the direction of downstream flow from two of the springs fig 5 the most southwestern spring was stagnant and located in a more channelized area so the ellipse was centered around the spring with the major axis oriented with the channel because patches of unburned areas in royal gorge are observed within the burn perimeter evi values were extracted from low moderate burn severity areas designated by monitoring trends in burn severity mtbs an intergovernmental agency that produces burn severity maps see fig 1c the non normal distributions in evi values between the spring n 630 and non spring n 10 288 areas were not similar with one another following the fire in 2013 evi values from the non spring area mean rank 5499 were significantly higher than evi values from the spring area mean rank 4817 u 3645377 p 0 001 see fig 4 in 2014 evi values from the spring area mean rank 6903 were still significantly higher than the non spring area mean rank 5699 u 2715327 p 0 001 4 5 trail cameras vegetation responses between may and december 2015 varied by abundance and by type based on qualitative observations between spring and control trail cameras in the asaayi creek burned area in terms of abundance and diversity more vegetation was observed in photographs from spring cameras fig 6 a b as compared to photos from the control cameras fig 6c d in late may 2015 grasses and forbs were observed near and on the banks of spring channels as the growing season progressed vegetation spread throughout the field of view of the spring cameras vegetation growth peaked in late august and began to change color through december see supplementary material in terms of vegetation type aspen brackenfern thistles moss grasses and forbs were observed in the spring trail cameras supplementary material in comparison aspen and brackenfern were the dominant vegetation with the control trail cameras some thistles grasses and forbs were also observed in photos from the control cameras but in much less abundance compared to the spring facing cameras supplementary material variation of vegetation responses between the single spring and multiple spring study areas were also observed through the trail cameras see supplementary material springcam1 springcam2 and springcam3 are all trail cameras that were facing springs and controlcam1 controlcam2 and controlcam3 are control cameras located in the burn area not facing any springs springcam1 springcam2 controlcam1 and controlcam2 are located in the multiple springs area that feed into a tributary to asaayi creek photos from springcam1 and springcam2 fig 4 show more grasses and shrubs present near the spring channels in late may 2015 by august 2015 vegetation within the field of view of these cameras are dominated by grasses forbs and moss in controlcam1 and controlcam2 aspen dominates along with some thistles and brackenfern springcam3 and controlcam3 are located in the single spring area photos from springcam3 show some grasses by the spring channel and several brackenferns located around the field of view in may 2015 approximately 11 months after the fire as the growing season progresses more grasses and shrubs grow by the spring channel whereas the surrounding area was mostly covered with brackenfern by late august in controlcam3 only brackenfern is seen growing 5 discussion groundwater from springs contribute to post fire vegetation recovery by providing refuge from soil moisture depletion perennial springs in the asaayi creek watershed emerge at a contact between hydrostratigraphic units within the chuska sandstone explaining the proximity of multiple springs with one another perennial flow from these springs contributes water throughout the year to spring ecosystems and to streamflow for asaayi creek perennial flow also provides a constant source of water affecting soil moisture around the springs post fire revegetation was visually observed while in the field and by trail cameras upslope of the emergence points of some of the springs which is indicative of groundwater interactions near the spring emergence in comparison springs are rare in the metamorphic and volcanic rock of the high elevation sites in royal gorge thus shallow groundwater like that seen in the asaayi creek watershed may not be present the royal gorge springs are ephemeral and do not emerge within close proximity to one another the three royal gorge springs sampled in may 2016 also do not have strong evaporative stable isotope signatures not shown as seen in other spring and well samples in this area reported by clarey 1996 supporting the inference that these springs are discharging relatively recent recharge instead geologic factors at the two study areas influence the differences in hydrology location of emergences and proximity of springs with implications for the spatial pattern of soil moisture around springs although the asaayi creek watershed lies at a higher elevation than royal gorge precipitation is comparable between the two study areas fig 2 in the asaayi creek watershed different soil moisture and vegetation patterns are observed between an area where there is a single spring and an area where there are multiple springs in the area with multiple springs the soil moisture is high near the spring and remains relatively high even between the springs the broader surface area of soil moisture allows more abundant and diverse vegetation to become established to be protected and to grow following the fire in the area with a single spring soil moisture is only increased near the spring emergence point and channel the revegetation of grasses and forbs around the spring channel was rapid in the year following the 2014 fire but not as widespread or diverse as seen in the area around the multiple springs brackenfern and aspen are known to quickly colonize disturbed areas because they are able to resprout quickly from rhizomes in brackenfern and from quickly growing shoots in an aspen clone and grow faster than slower growing vegetation such as conifers as they quickly resprout they are also able to outcompete other vegetation for available resources earp 2011 shinneman et al 2015 more brackenfern were observed growing around the isolated single spring as compared to the local area between the multiple springs we infer that the larger area of increased soil moisture provided by the multiple springs provides more resources and allows more diverse vegetation to grow also annual grasses and forbs herbs were observed growing around springs suggesting that these species had resprouted from seeds stored in seed banks that were protected in the litter or soil layers the source of the seeds remains uncertain one explanation is that forbs herbs grasses and shrubs that grew near springs pre fire had established seed banks and buds in the soil following the wildfire the native plants regenerated from the seed banks and stored buds allow for native plants to grow and not to be outcompeted by brackenfern or thistles especially in the multiple springs area in the asaayi creek watershed in other burn areas like royal gorge annual plants regrow through seeding treatment resprouting from seed banks activated by the fire miller 2000 or must wait multiple years for seeds to be naturally transported back into the burn area in both asaayi creek and royal gorge we see significantly higher evi around springs compared to the rest of the burned areas the royal gorge burn area was treated in the winter spring immediately following the 2013 wildfire no seeding treatment occurred in the asaayi creek watershed within a year of the asaayi lake fire however there is a greater increase in evi around the spring area in the asaayi creek watershed in the year after the 2014 fire compared to royal gorge precipitation was higher in both asaayi creek watershed and royal gorge in the year following the wildfire for each watershed see fig 2 precipitation in june and july of 2014 at royal gorge was below the climate normal precipitation in asaayi creek watershed in may and june of 2015 was above the climate normal suggesting that the larger increase in evi observed around springs in the asaayi creek watershed compared to evi in royal gorge is also due to higher precipitation in 2015 although higher precipitation in asaayi creek in the year following the asaayi lake fire supported vegetation recovery findings in this study still support our hypothesis that the difference of revegetation between the study areas can be attributed to the differences of the hydrology of the springs of the study sites the springs in asaayi creek watershed are perennial and clustered close together compared to the ephemeral springs in the royal gorge burn area that range from 750 m to greater than 2 km apart additionally the increase in evi associated with springs in the asaayi creek watershed is observed over a larger area whereas the increase in evi associated with springs in royal gorge is localized and confined to pixels representing localized spring channels a survey of vegetation around springs in the royal gorge was not conducted as part of this study significant increases of evi are seen around springs in both treated and untreated burned areas of royal gorge this suggests that seed banks and storage of buds from resprouting plants are established around ephemeral springs in royal gorge in addition to the grasses and forbs herbs moss was observed growing around the springs in the asaayi creek watershed in the first year following the 2014 fire this is important because plants such as mosses can help stabilize the landscape and reduce erosion grover et al 2017 reestablish decomposition and initiate soil development as the landscape is stabilized further regrowth of stored seeds and buds can occur thus revegetation around springs helps to reestablish native vegetation for the rest of the burned watershed similar to how unburned areas aid in revegetation of burned areas baker 2009 although no conifer seedlings were observed at the time of the vegetation survey in the asaayi watershed there is potential for springs to act as refugia for conifer seed banks during wildfires there is also potential for springs to be refugia for native vegetation in times of drought or aridification there is need to further explore this potential 6 conclusions in this research we ask whether the presence of springs mitigates the impacts of wildfires in ssm watersheds in particular 1 do springs provide a buffer to impacts of wildfires yes springs provide soil moisture that protects stored buds on roots and seed banks springs also provide water for vegetation to quickly regrow following wildfires which stabilizes the land surface and prevents invasive species from dominating the vegetation 2 do springs promote revegetation following wildfires yes diverse vegetation is established around springs as observed qualitatively through trail cameras some of this vegetation identified in the field through a vegetation survey has buds stored either through their roots rhizome systems or in seed banks around the springs springs provide water for this vegetation to quickly resprout following wildfires springs that feed into streams may also transport buds downstream throughout other parts of the watershed dwire and kauffman 2003 hyslop and trowsdale 2012 in both asaayi creek watershed and royal gorge there was a high mortality of overstory trees primarily ponderosa pine but springs were able to save soil from erosion and create zones of fire refugia this was particularly important in the asaayi creek watershed where the hillslopes on which the springs are present are steep in this research we see a novel link between springs and revegetation following forest fires this research shows that springs may be just as important ecologically as streams to the recovery of wildfire springs in the asaayi creek watershed helped to mitigate immediate post fire impacts such as erosion and invasion of non native weedy species although springs flow ephemerally in royal gorge higher evi values are observed downstream of the springs indicating intermittent springs may still provide enough water and soil moisture to protect stored seeds buds and provide an immediate source of water for regrowth in addition reseeding efforts focused around springs may increase the survivability of new vegetation and expedite the revegetation process springs in the asaayi creek watershed and royal gorge demonstrate that fire refugia zones are created by springs which suggests that springs can potentially be highly influential to post fire recovery in other parts of watersheds where springs are not present additionally this research indicates how the presence of springs should be considered in post fire restoration strategies it demonstrates how springs especially those that flow perennially and in close vicinity of one another promote quick revegetation of native grasses and herbs and prevented additional erosion and intrusion of invasive plants watershed and forest managers should consider monitoring and rehabilitation strategies for springs such as those offered by the springs stewardship institute of the museum of northern arizona to protect springs which serve as valuable hydrologic ecologic and cultural assets in areas where funding for restoration is low such as the navajo nation the presence of perennial springs should help to mitigate potential negative post wildfire effects more research is needed on the role and recovery of springs and their environments following wildfires while studies of the effects of fire on springs have been published in the past this study is one of the first efforts to examine the effects of springs on vegetation recovery future studies on the effects of springs on the recovery of watersheds following wildfires should include a more thorough examination of how quick vegetation recovery around springs impedes erosion and subsequently might prevent further water quality degradation longer term studies should also examine how springs may influence regeneration of overstory trees future studies should also examine the role of springs as refugia to other perturbations such as drought and climate change further investigations on the role of springs as fire refugia could emphasize the importance of the protection and rehabilitation of springs and lead to the implementation of new fire restoration and climate adaptation strategies credit authorship contribution statement l m tsinnajinnie conceptualization methodology investigation

4749,warming temperatures earlier snowmelt and the elongation of dry seasons are contributing to the propensity for more frequent and severe wildfires in semiarid mountainous watersheds which act as source watersheds for communities especially in the southwestern united states research on how vegetation and water sources will respond following wildfires in these watersheds is critical for water resource land and forest managers little research has been completed on the effect of groundwater discharged from springs on revegetation of burned forests we test whether springs as perennial sources of water in semiarid watersheds have the potential to protect roots and seeds from being damaged and facilitate the regrowth of native vegetation in areas affected by wildfires thereby creating zones of fire refugia and mitigating the propensity for floods erosion and incursion of invasive species the effect of springs on revegetation is studied in the asaayi creek watershed located in the chuska mountains nm az and in the royal gorge park located near cañon city co in the asaayi creek watershed remote sensing imagery and ground surveys show that springs facilitated revegetation following a june 2014 wildfire post fire time lapse photography reveal more abundant vegetation around springs and more diverse vegetation in areas where there are multiple springs significantly higher enhanced vegetative index evi values are observed around perennial springs in the asaayi creek watershed and also around intermittent springs in the royal gorge area one year after wildfires occurred in each study area however the revegetation around the perennial springs in the asaayi creek watershed is widespread compared to royal gorge there are multiple perennial springs that are clustered close together in asaayi creek watershed and only three intermittent flowing springs are located in the royal gorge burn area springs in the asaayi creek watershed provide a critical source of water that directly impacts soil moisture near the springs and in turn protects roots and buds allowing native vegetation to regenerate keywords mountain watersheds groundwater springs wildfire impacts fire refugia 1 introduction the climate of the southwest is expected to become hotter and drier cayan et al 2010 and the frequency and intensities of wildfires is expected to increase due to these changing climatic conditions pierce et al 2004 in arizona and new mexico an increasing number of large high severity wildfires has been observed within the last 35 years singleton et al 2019 semiarid snow dominated mountainous ssm watersheds are particularly vulnerable to wildfire activity in the southwest united states because snowpack is decreasing mote et al 2005 spring snowmelt is occurring earlier in the year lengthening the dry season and causing vegetation to become more moisture stressed westerling et al 2006 in turn creating more fuel for wildfires increased tree mortality due to increases in drought severity allen et al 2010 and from beetle kill adams et al 2017 mitton and ferrenberg 2012 may also increase the fuel for wildfires although this concept is still unresolved meigs et al 2016 additionally historical reconstruction of fires in the pinaleno mountains of southern arizona show that high fuel continuity and fuel loading due to fire suppression in combination with climatic changes were all factors that led to large high severity fires becoming a predominant fire type o connor et al 2014 this demonstrates additional factors that lead to increasing large high severity fires in ssm watersheds north of the pinaleno mountains the vulnerability of ssm watersheds to wildfires calls for focus on new ideas on mitigating wildfire impacts recently more research has been focused on fire refugia areas of a landscape that are not burned or are nominally affected by fire because of their various ecological functions such as providing habitat and promoting population reestablishment meddens et al 2018 specifically fire refugia have been found to play an important role in ponderosa pine and dry mixed conifer forest regeneration coop et al 2019 topography and fire weather have been used to predict the occurrence of fire refugia krawchuk et al 2016 some of these factors such as catchment slope and aspect overlap with hydrologic factors that are used to predict soil moisture because some springs can provide consistent moisture springs have been analyzed for potential as climate change refugia cartwright and johnson 2018 however there are few studies that examine the intersection of springs and wildfires and particularly springs as fire refugia a springs assessment project by the sky island alliance found some evidence that springs acted as fire refugia through lower burn severity observed around springs and that the primary impacts of fire on springs in the sky island region of southern arizona and california were disturbance of spring ecosystem habitats and erosion of spring channels misztal et al 2016 wildfires may also impact spring discharge due to reduced recharge of the springshed due to soil hydrophobicity neary et al 2003 changes in vegetation following wildfires can also lead to increased evapotranspiration silberstein et al 2013 and also reduced recharge to springs however increased spring flow or groundwater recharge due to a reduction in evapotranspiration following wildfires may also occur neary et al 2003 while the impacts of wildfires on springs have been studied just as reviewed there are few if any studies of the effects of springs on the revegetation of landscapes following wildfires springs often support dense riparian vegetation especially in semiarid regions stevens and meretsky 2008 comprised of trees shrubs and flowers this suggests that perennial flow from springs may likewise support post fire revegetation post fire restoration and mitigation efforts can be costly and new strategies to minimize damage and costs must be explored because little research has been conducted on the intersection of springs and wildfires forest and watershed managers do not yet consider the presence of springs in restoration and mitigation strategies the presence of springs in many ssm watersheds is integral because springs play a role in sustaining streamflow yet little is known about the role of springs in vegetative response to wildfires in mountainous watersheds springs are also important for maintaining alpine freshwater ecosystems brown et al 2007 and for being hotspots for biological diversity van der kamp 1995 stevens and meretsky 2008 both perennial and ephemeral springs support ponderosa pine tree growth and can reduce the sensitivity of these trees to drought fuchs et al 2019 a major hindrance to the revegetation of burn areas is lack of soil moisture many fires occur during dry seasons westerling et al 2006 and the lack of soil moisture which also contributes to the spark and migration of fires baker 2009 diminishes protection of roots and seeds and impedes regrowth of native vegetation following a fire springs enhance soil moisture around their discharge or emergence points and provide refuge from soil moisture depletion during dry seasons ephemeral springs will provide water for only part s of the year such as during snowmelt runoff or during the monsoon season perennial springs provide water year round springs can also be accompanied by shallow groundwater not reaching the surface that provides additional soil moisture chen and hu 2004 in principle soil moisture from springs has the potential to provide a moisture and temperature buffer for soil and litter layers where buds and seed banks are stored and to act as a source of water for quick germination of stored seeds buds and regrowth of vegetation around springs following wildfires ssm watersheds are especially important for the southwest because they regionally receive the highest amount of precipitation prism climate group 2015 store water as snowpack serreze et al 1999 feed larger river systems stewart et al 2004 and recharge surrounding aquifers earman et al 2006 tolley et al 2015 wilson and guan 2004 winograd et al 1998 impacts of wildfires on ssm watersheds include loss of homes and structures monetary expenses e g firefighting economic impacts restoration etc loss of vegetation and habitat soil hydrophobicity flooding erosion sediment transport landslides and debris flows and rapid intrusion by invasive vegetative species neary et al 2008 zouhar et al 2008 brunson and tanaka 2011 although fires are a natural component in many healthy forests of the arid southwest u s the consequences of increasing high severity wildfire activity due to climate change and past land management are problematic for ecosystems and society schoennagel et al 2017 the severity of a fire and vegetation sprouting characteristics are the main factors that determine how revegetation occurs following a wildfire miller 2000 higher intensity and severity fires can burn deeper into the litter and soil layers damaging stored seeds and buds baker 2009 lentile et al 2007 buds stored in deeper layers such as those on rhizomes and roots are least affected by fires and can resprout baker 2009 areas with very high severity fires that damage the deep stored buds and seeds rely on seeds sourced from other areas such as those that are wind blown for revegetation miller 2000 plants that rely solely on seeds to resprout such as conifers face major challenges following high severity wildfires because the only sources of seeds mature unburned trees may be located far from the burned area rother and veblen 2016 haffey et al 2018 revegetation of ssm watersheds by forbs and grasses is needed to stabilize the surface and prevent erosion robichaud et al 2010 while revegetation by trees and shrubs are needed for wildlife habitat baker 2009 high severity burn areas may require reseeding treatment to help reduce erosion and the spread of invasive species but effectiveness of reseeding treatment in combating these impacts has been variable pyke et al 2013 however some post fire treatments also increase the risk of introducing and promoting growth of non native vegetation such as cheatgrass and bull thistle zouhar et al 2008 kruse et al 2004 non native grasses such as cheatgrass used in post fire seeding treatments may be effective in erosion control but pose a risk of outcompeting native grasses and vegetation beyers 2004 natural modes of post fire revegetation are thus important especially for high severity burns in reducing negative impacts of large wildfires in this study we aim to quantify the role of springs in promoting post fire revegetation the primary research question for this study is how does the presence of mountain springs mitigate the impacts of wildfires subsidiary questions are do springs provide a buffer for initial impacts of fire on vegetation and do springs promote recovery of vegetation we hypothesize that depending on their magnitude and intermittency springs can provide a perennial source of water that impacts soil moisture and mitigates the impacts of wildfires and promotes revegetation this research uses an ecohydrologic approach to answer these questions by monitoring the vegetation around springs and non spring control areas and by characterizing the hydrology of springs in burned areas from recent wildfires in new mexico and colorado study areas in colorado and new mexico represent three different environments with different water fluxes 1 isolated ephemeral springs 2 isolated perennial spring and 3 multiple perennial springs findings for these three water flux based environments can be applied to other ssm watersheds with similar types of water fluxes from springs 2 study areas the primary study area is the asaayi creek watershed a 45 km2 watershed located in nm near the az border the watershed drains the chuska mountains within the boundaries of the navajo nation fig 1 a the chuska mountains developed on the eastern flank of the defiance plateau are composed of sedimentary rock namely the cenozoic chuska sandstone that overlies the mesozoic chinle formation and is capped by tertiary volcanic deposits the asaayi creek watershed lies at the southern end of the chuska mountains ranging in elevation from 2286 m 7500 ft at asaayi lake to 2743 m 9000 ft at the top of the chuska mountains asaayi creek is a perennial stream with several tributaries that generally flows from the northeast to southwest fig 1c the chuska mountains topography is flat topped relief at the highest elevations of the asaayi creek watershed at the top of the chuska mountains is low as the contributing area of the watershed increases the relief steepens and the stream cuts into a canyon named bowl canyon some terrace like topographic features are present in hillslopes of the watershed including areas where springs emerge asaayi creek eventually flows into asaayi lake a reservoir formed by a flood control dam vegetation is primarily pinon juniper and ponderosa pine in the highlands and sage and other shrubs grasses in the lowlands wright et al 1973 within the past 200 years the fire regime had been influenced by human activity particularly with a decline in natural fire activity associated with the rise of pastoralism guiterman et al 2019 savage and swetnam 1990 whitehair et al 2018 the human caused asaayi spelled assayii in the inciweb incident information system lake fire ignited on june 13 2014 and eventually burned 30 km2 of the 45 km2 asaayi creek watershed fig 1a the fire burned a total of 60 km2 in the chuska mountains and lasted until early july the study springs in the asaayi creek watershed are located in moderate to high burn severity areas fig 1c where a majority of overstory trees did not survive the second study area is located in the royal gorge bridge and park near cañon city colorado fig 1a and 1b royal gorge is an approximately 380 m deep canyon carved by the arkansas river through fractured volcanic and metamorphic rock elevation in royal gorge bridge and park ranges between 1615 m 5300 ft including the elevation of the arkansas river at the bottom of the gorge and 2195 m 7200 ft at the plateau vegetation varies between plain grasses and shrubs to pinon juniper in june 2013 the royal gorge fire burned 13 km2 including several park structures fig 1b restoration efforts for the royal gorge fire began in february 2014 with reseeding of a mixture of grasses in parts of the burned area goldberg 2017 although the burn severity in royal gorge is largely classified as low to moderate burn severity a majority of overstory trees did not survive the fire the asaayi lake fire and royal gorge fire both occurred during particularly dry years monthly precipitation data fig 2 from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism shows that prior to the fire precipitation was below the 1981 2010 climate normal for december 2013 to june 2014 in the asaayi creek watershed precipitation in july 2014 was above the climate normal and contributed to intense flooding and erosion in asaayi creek precipitation in the asaayi creek watershed was slightly below or above monthly climate normals for december 2014 april 2015 and well above the climate normals for may july of 2015 which aided in postfire vegetation recovery prism data for royal gorge shows that prior to the fire precipitation was below the monthly climate normals for february june of 2013 from january may of 2014 and july 2014 precipitation in royal gorge was slightly below or above the monthly climate normals 3 methods 3 1 field methods flow from the asaayi springs was gauged using either a 3 inch parshall flume or by volumetric discharge flow measurements were taken monthly between may and october in 2014 and 2015 except for june and july 2014 due the ongoing asaayi lake fire and in may september and october of 2016 in june 2016 springs in royal gorge were located on the ground however no flow measurements were taken from royal gorge springs because the flow while still observable by eye was too low ground truthing of vegetation and soil moisture around springs in the asaayi creek watershed were done using trail cameras a vegetation survey and a soil moisture survey these methods were focused on two study areas in the asaayi creek watershed 1 an area with multiple springs fig 3 b where 5 springs are located within 150 m of one another and 2 a single spring fig 3b about 200 m north of the multiple springs area where no other springs are located within 100 m in the asaayi burn area six day 6 plotwatcher pro hd trail cameras were set up in 2015 to take photos and time lapse videos 720p 1280 720 resolution between may 27 and october 15 of the following calendar year at 30 min intervals during the day three cameras were mounted directly facing spring channels each of the cameras facing the springs were paired with control cameras that were 10 30 m offset from the spring facing cameras and did not face springs the control cameras faced the same hillslopes as their associated spring facing cameras springcam1 springcam2 controlcam1 and controlcam2 were all placed in the multiple springs area springcam3 was facing the single spring and controlcam3 was also placed in the single spring area in september 2016 samples of vegetation around the multiple springs of the asaayi burn area were collected and placed in a plant press for identification plants were identified using heil et al 2013b and with the help of arnold clifford a botanist with expertise on vegetation grown in the chuska mountains on october 2016 soil moisture was measured around the springs in the asaayi burn area seventeen measurements were taken using the wet based gravimetric soil moisture method lekshmi et al 2014 measurements were taken within the top 5 cm of the surface along two transects one transect crossed the spring in the single spring area and included 7 measurements the second transect crossed two springs in the multiple springs area and included 10 measurements 3 2 remote sensing enhanced vegetative index evi landsat products from the usgs high level science data center were downloaded based on pre and post fire landsat 8 imagery for the asaayi lake fire and the royal gorge fire imagery from june 2014 to october 2016 was downloaded and projected into the utm zone 12 n coordinate system for the asaayi burn area imagery from june 2013 to october 2014 was downloaded and projected in utm zone 13 n for the royal gorge burn area evi spectral indices are scaled by the usgs by a factor of 0 0001 and the data range between 10 000 and 10 000 where more positive values indicate healthier vegetation and negative values indicate lack of vegetation u s geological survey 2016 the enhanced vegetation index evi spectral index u s geological survey 2016 was used to analyze pre and post fire revegetation in the study areas evi values were extracted around springs and compared to burned and unburned areas of each study area the algorithm for landsat 8 evi is band 4 includes red wavelengths band 6 includes short wave infrared wavelengths and band 2 includes blue wavelengths barsi et al 2014 evi was analyzed and compared between springs and non springs control areas using ibm spss the mann whitney u statistical test dinneen and blakesley 1973 was performed to test the null hypothesis that the distribution of evi is the same between extracted evi values around springs and evi values around the burned non spring areas of the watersheds for the asaayi creek burn area tests were performed using evi values from june 23 2014 postfire june 26 2015 and august 29 2015 for the royal gorge burn area tests were performed for july 8 2013 and july 27 2014 4 results 4 1 hydrology springs in the asaayi watershed are perennial hillslope and contact springs springer and stevens 2008 that emerge from the chuska sandstone the study springs are located on a west northwest facing hillslope and are within 30 m of elevation of one another discharge from the springs ranged from 0 5 to 1 5 l s between may and october of 2015 because volumetric discharge and parshall flume measurements were used to measure discharge it was difficult to capture temporal variation of flow from the springs three springs were found in the royal gorge burn area but each spring had low diffuse flow that was too difficult to accurately measure 4 2 soil moisture seventeen soil moisture measurements were taken in cross sections over three springs in the asaayi creek watershed the soil moisture samples measurements were collected during the dry base flow season for the chuska mountains in october 2016 to reduce the possibility that recent recharge and or precipitation has affected the soil moisture one cross section measured soil moisture at a single spring located over 200 m away from the other study springs in this cross section water content ranged from 60 by weight on the banks of the spring channel to 5 at 20 m away from the spring channel a second cross section that crossed two spring channels showed water content over 60 on the banks of the stream channels in between the two spring channels water content did not decrease below 10 but it did decrease below 5 towards the ends of the cross section i e moving away from the spring channels 4 3 vegetation survey seventeen different plants were collected around the asaayi springs and identified by genus four grasses 11 forbs herbs 1 tree and moss were identified table 1 the plants were collected in and around the spring channels and in between springs where multiple springs were close together because of the seasonal timing of the vegetation survey and accessibility issues these plants are only a sample of the range of vegetation growing around the springs in the burn area of the asaayi creek watershed 4 4 remote sensing evi was compared for springs and non springs in burned areas of the asaayi creek watershed between 2014 and 2015 fig 3 shows the locations of the springs and the portion of the burned asaayi creek watershed where evi values were extracted the seven study springs in the asaayi creek watershed flow westward into tributaries of asaayi creek evi values were extracted from ellipses oriented to each spring not shown because the ellipses are too small to be distinguishable on one map the major axes had a length of 90 m and the minor axes had a length of 60 m the major axes was oriented east west to capture vegetation growth due to shallow subsurface flow upslope of the spring and downstream of the spring five of the ellipses contained 6 pixels and 1 ellipse contained 5 pixels where each pixel had a 30 m 30 m resolution the non spring area included all the pixels within the burn perimeter shown in fig 3 excluding the pixels containing the ellipses the number of pixels sample size for the burned non spring areas n 24 366 is much larger than the number of pixels for the spring areas n 35 the differences in evi values between the ellipses around the springs and in non spring burned parts of the watershed were tested using the mann whitney u test the null hypothesis that the distribution of evi is the same across the spring and non spring areas was rejected distributions of post fire evi values between the spring and non spring burned areas are not normal nor similar thus mean ranks are reported the mann whitney u test assigns ranks to individual evi values from individual pixels for both the spring and non spring areas from lowest to highest so the lowest evi value is assigned a rank of 1 and the highest evi value is assigned the rank of the total number of values the ranks assigned to the individual evi are then grouped into the spring or non spring distribution the mean ranks for each distribution are averaged and reported as mean ranks fig 4 low mean ranks indicate relatively low evi values and high mean ranks indicate relatively high evi values for the distributions thus significant differences using two sided asymptotic significance levels in evi are shown as significant differences of mean ranks between the distributions immediately after the asaayi lake fire in june 2014 evi values in the spring area mean rank 9262 were significantly lower than the non spring burned area of the watershed mean rank 12 205 u 529 270 p 0 014 in june 2015 evi values for the spring area mean rank 17 919 were significantly higher than the evi values from the non spring burn areas mean rank 12 192 u 226 248 p 0 001 at the peak of the 2015 growing season in august evi values for the spring area mean rank 17 398 remained significantly higher than the evi values in the non spring burn areas mean rank 12 193 u 244 507 p 0 001 in royal gorge post fire evi values were also compared between spring and non spring burn areas between july 2013 and 2014 evi values were extracted from ellipses around the springs in royal gorge with the major axis oriented in the direction of downstream flow from two of the springs fig 5 the most southwestern spring was stagnant and located in a more channelized area so the ellipse was centered around the spring with the major axis oriented with the channel because patches of unburned areas in royal gorge are observed within the burn perimeter evi values were extracted from low moderate burn severity areas designated by monitoring trends in burn severity mtbs an intergovernmental agency that produces burn severity maps see fig 1c the non normal distributions in evi values between the spring n 630 and non spring n 10 288 areas were not similar with one another following the fire in 2013 evi values from the non spring area mean rank 5499 were significantly higher than evi values from the spring area mean rank 4817 u 3645377 p 0 001 see fig 4 in 2014 evi values from the spring area mean rank 6903 were still significantly higher than the non spring area mean rank 5699 u 2715327 p 0 001 4 5 trail cameras vegetation responses between may and december 2015 varied by abundance and by type based on qualitative observations between spring and control trail cameras in the asaayi creek burned area in terms of abundance and diversity more vegetation was observed in photographs from spring cameras fig 6 a b as compared to photos from the control cameras fig 6c d in late may 2015 grasses and forbs were observed near and on the banks of spring channels as the growing season progressed vegetation spread throughout the field of view of the spring cameras vegetation growth peaked in late august and began to change color through december see supplementary material in terms of vegetation type aspen brackenfern thistles moss grasses and forbs were observed in the spring trail cameras supplementary material in comparison aspen and brackenfern were the dominant vegetation with the control trail cameras some thistles grasses and forbs were also observed in photos from the control cameras but in much less abundance compared to the spring facing cameras supplementary material variation of vegetation responses between the single spring and multiple spring study areas were also observed through the trail cameras see supplementary material springcam1 springcam2 and springcam3 are all trail cameras that were facing springs and controlcam1 controlcam2 and controlcam3 are control cameras located in the burn area not facing any springs springcam1 springcam2 controlcam1 and controlcam2 are located in the multiple springs area that feed into a tributary to asaayi creek photos from springcam1 and springcam2 fig 4 show more grasses and shrubs present near the spring channels in late may 2015 by august 2015 vegetation within the field of view of these cameras are dominated by grasses forbs and moss in controlcam1 and controlcam2 aspen dominates along with some thistles and brackenfern springcam3 and controlcam3 are located in the single spring area photos from springcam3 show some grasses by the spring channel and several brackenferns located around the field of view in may 2015 approximately 11 months after the fire as the growing season progresses more grasses and shrubs grow by the spring channel whereas the surrounding area was mostly covered with brackenfern by late august in controlcam3 only brackenfern is seen growing 5 discussion groundwater from springs contribute to post fire vegetation recovery by providing refuge from soil moisture depletion perennial springs in the asaayi creek watershed emerge at a contact between hydrostratigraphic units within the chuska sandstone explaining the proximity of multiple springs with one another perennial flow from these springs contributes water throughout the year to spring ecosystems and to streamflow for asaayi creek perennial flow also provides a constant source of water affecting soil moisture around the springs post fire revegetation was visually observed while in the field and by trail cameras upslope of the emergence points of some of the springs which is indicative of groundwater interactions near the spring emergence in comparison springs are rare in the metamorphic and volcanic rock of the high elevation sites in royal gorge thus shallow groundwater like that seen in the asaayi creek watershed may not be present the royal gorge springs are ephemeral and do not emerge within close proximity to one another the three royal gorge springs sampled in may 2016 also do not have strong evaporative stable isotope signatures not shown as seen in other spring and well samples in this area reported by clarey 1996 supporting the inference that these springs are discharging relatively recent recharge instead geologic factors at the two study areas influence the differences in hydrology location of emergences and proximity of springs with implications for the spatial pattern of soil moisture around springs although the asaayi creek watershed lies at a higher elevation than royal gorge precipitation is comparable between the two study areas fig 2 in the asaayi creek watershed different soil moisture and vegetation patterns are observed between an area where there is a single spring and an area where there are multiple springs in the area with multiple springs the soil moisture is high near the spring and remains relatively high even between the springs the broader surface area of soil moisture allows more abundant and diverse vegetation to become established to be protected and to grow following the fire in the area with a single spring soil moisture is only increased near the spring emergence point and channel the revegetation of grasses and forbs around the spring channel was rapid in the year following the 2014 fire but not as widespread or diverse as seen in the area around the multiple springs brackenfern and aspen are known to quickly colonize disturbed areas because they are able to resprout quickly from rhizomes in brackenfern and from quickly growing shoots in an aspen clone and grow faster than slower growing vegetation such as conifers as they quickly resprout they are also able to outcompete other vegetation for available resources earp 2011 shinneman et al 2015 more brackenfern were observed growing around the isolated single spring as compared to the local area between the multiple springs we infer that the larger area of increased soil moisture provided by the multiple springs provides more resources and allows more diverse vegetation to grow also annual grasses and forbs herbs were observed growing around springs suggesting that these species had resprouted from seeds stored in seed banks that were protected in the litter or soil layers the source of the seeds remains uncertain one explanation is that forbs herbs grasses and shrubs that grew near springs pre fire had established seed banks and buds in the soil following the wildfire the native plants regenerated from the seed banks and stored buds allow for native plants to grow and not to be outcompeted by brackenfern or thistles especially in the multiple springs area in the asaayi creek watershed in other burn areas like royal gorge annual plants regrow through seeding treatment resprouting from seed banks activated by the fire miller 2000 or must wait multiple years for seeds to be naturally transported back into the burn area in both asaayi creek and royal gorge we see significantly higher evi around springs compared to the rest of the burned areas the royal gorge burn area was treated in the winter spring immediately following the 2013 wildfire no seeding treatment occurred in the asaayi creek watershed within a year of the asaayi lake fire however there is a greater increase in evi around the spring area in the asaayi creek watershed in the year after the 2014 fire compared to royal gorge precipitation was higher in both asaayi creek watershed and royal gorge in the year following the wildfire for each watershed see fig 2 precipitation in june and july of 2014 at royal gorge was below the climate normal precipitation in asaayi creek watershed in may and june of 2015 was above the climate normal suggesting that the larger increase in evi observed around springs in the asaayi creek watershed compared to evi in royal gorge is also due to higher precipitation in 2015 although higher precipitation in asaayi creek in the year following the asaayi lake fire supported vegetation recovery findings in this study still support our hypothesis that the difference of revegetation between the study areas can be attributed to the differences of the hydrology of the springs of the study sites the springs in asaayi creek watershed are perennial and clustered close together compared to the ephemeral springs in the royal gorge burn area that range from 750 m to greater than 2 km apart additionally the increase in evi associated with springs in the asaayi creek watershed is observed over a larger area whereas the increase in evi associated with springs in royal gorge is localized and confined to pixels representing localized spring channels a survey of vegetation around springs in the royal gorge was not conducted as part of this study significant increases of evi are seen around springs in both treated and untreated burned areas of royal gorge this suggests that seed banks and storage of buds from resprouting plants are established around ephemeral springs in royal gorge in addition to the grasses and forbs herbs moss was observed growing around the springs in the asaayi creek watershed in the first year following the 2014 fire this is important because plants such as mosses can help stabilize the landscape and reduce erosion grover et al 2017 reestablish decomposition and initiate soil development as the landscape is stabilized further regrowth of stored seeds and buds can occur thus revegetation around springs helps to reestablish native vegetation for the rest of the burned watershed similar to how unburned areas aid in revegetation of burned areas baker 2009 although no conifer seedlings were observed at the time of the vegetation survey in the asaayi watershed there is potential for springs to act as refugia for conifer seed banks during wildfires there is also potential for springs to be refugia for native vegetation in times of drought or aridification there is need to further explore this potential 6 conclusions in this research we ask whether the presence of springs mitigates the impacts of wildfires in ssm watersheds in particular 1 do springs provide a buffer to impacts of wildfires yes springs provide soil moisture that protects stored buds on roots and seed banks springs also provide water for vegetation to quickly regrow following wildfires which stabilizes the land surface and prevents invasive species from dominating the vegetation 2 do springs promote revegetation following wildfires yes diverse vegetation is established around springs as observed qualitatively through trail cameras some of this vegetation identified in the field through a vegetation survey has buds stored either through their roots rhizome systems or in seed banks around the springs springs provide water for this vegetation to quickly resprout following wildfires springs that feed into streams may also transport buds downstream throughout other parts of the watershed dwire and kauffman 2003 hyslop and trowsdale 2012 in both asaayi creek watershed and royal gorge there was a high mortality of overstory trees primarily ponderosa pine but springs were able to save soil from erosion and create zones of fire refugia this was particularly important in the asaayi creek watershed where the hillslopes on which the springs are present are steep in this research we see a novel link between springs and revegetation following forest fires this research shows that springs may be just as important ecologically as streams to the recovery of wildfire springs in the asaayi creek watershed helped to mitigate immediate post fire impacts such as erosion and invasion of non native weedy species although springs flow ephemerally in royal gorge higher evi values are observed downstream of the springs indicating intermittent springs may still provide enough water and soil moisture to protect stored seeds buds and provide an immediate source of water for regrowth in addition reseeding efforts focused around springs may increase the survivability of new vegetation and expedite the revegetation process springs in the asaayi creek watershed and royal gorge demonstrate that fire refugia zones are created by springs which suggests that springs can potentially be highly influential to post fire recovery in other parts of watersheds where springs are not present additionally this research indicates how the presence of springs should be considered in post fire restoration strategies it demonstrates how springs especially those that flow perennially and in close vicinity of one another promote quick revegetation of native grasses and herbs and prevented additional erosion and intrusion of invasive plants watershed and forest managers should consider monitoring and rehabilitation strategies for springs such as those offered by the springs stewardship institute of the museum of northern arizona to protect springs which serve as valuable hydrologic ecologic and cultural assets in areas where funding for restoration is low such as the navajo nation the presence of perennial springs should help to mitigate potential negative post wildfire effects more research is needed on the role and recovery of springs and their environments following wildfires while studies of the effects of fire on springs have been published in the past this study is one of the first efforts to examine the effects of springs on vegetation recovery future studies on the effects of springs on the recovery of watersheds following wildfires should include a more thorough examination of how quick vegetation recovery around springs impedes erosion and subsequently might prevent further water quality degradation longer term studies should also examine how springs may influence regeneration of overstory trees future studies should also examine the role of springs as refugia to other perturbations such as drought and climate change further investigations on the role of springs as fire refugia could emphasize the importance of the protection and rehabilitation of springs and lead to the implementation of new fire restoration and climate adaptation strategies credit authorship contribution statement l m tsinnajinnie conceptualization methodology investigation
