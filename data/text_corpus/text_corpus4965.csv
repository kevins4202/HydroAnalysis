correlation between sinusoidal harmonic model and average napp from remote sensing the correlation between model and data is significative p 0 05 with an adjusted r2 0 95 regarding variability on southern summer where january is the month more variable variation coefficient 24 followed by february variation coefficient 18 march and december variation coefficient 16 both on the other hand the less variable month are october variation coefficient 6 september and november variation coefficient 8 both even if correlation between sinusoidal model and napp data is strong monthly variability must be incorporated on the analysis the annual variability will be discussed on next section of this paper for march 2000 to october 2019 napp series considering the adjustment of sinusoidal model eq 1 by a climate coefficient that stress the mean harmonic monthly value 3 results 3 1 analysing the annual variability of napp for basaltic region to modelling the environmental effect on average napp productivity considering the environment in a wide sense including any factor that changes monthly mean grass growth we introduce a climate coefficient parameter climacoeff this parameter corresponds to the relation of napp for a given month divided by the average of napp for this month on data series that parameter was previously used for calibrating the megane and ppgl model dieguez 2012 dieguez and fort 2017 fort et al 2017 but in this opportunity is implemented to calculate napp in the previously mentioned models a logistic grass growth was considered and climacoeff affects the carrying capacity k value in the present work the climacoeff will affect directly the napp being a multiplicative stress factor of average grass growth the climacoeff allows then to generate a relative value of napp for each month allowing to compare the deflection of grass growth between different months of the year the climacoeff can reach values less than 1 in particular situations like hydric stress on the other hand coefclima values 1 represents favourable conditions to enhance grass growth table 1 shows the actual monthly climacoeff for annualized time series fig 3 presents que coefclima results in a frequency of occurrence of events lower or higher than the average values less or greater than 1 as observed in fig 3 the normal distribution of climacoeff has a significative normal distribution p 0 01 by the kolmogorov smirnov test 2008 with a skewness value of 0 074 maximal climacoeff 1 37 and a kurtosis value of 0 528 results suggest a leptokurtic behaviour concentrating values of climacoeff between 0 9 and 1 2 this range includes 72 of data the standard deviation for whole data series is 0 136 with an average of 1 by definition considering this analysis of data normality it can be considered to include an environment stress factor on running simulations to generate scenarios that embodies climate variability on grass growth next section of this paper analyses the inclusion of environmental factors on harmonic sinusoidal model formerly presented eq 1 3 2 modelling the annual dynamics of grasslands productivity including variability time series with actual napp with monthly variation by remote sensing is used to obtain climacoeff this variability can be captured considering its normal distribution as previously discussed fig 4 presents time series in chronologically sequence of actual climacoeff actual napp and the harmonic sinusoidal model corrected by the climacoeff as shown in fig 4 fitting between corrected sinusoidal model results an actual napp is significative p 0 001 with an r2 value of 0 99 the relative root mean square error rrmse jamieson et al 1991 and qi et al 2017 value is 9 considering 12 78 kg dm ha d as yearly average indicating an excellent agreement between model and data continuing with a goodness of fit analysis between modelled and actual napp the sinusoidal model presents systematically an overestimation maximum value 12 on august 8 01 vs 9 94 kg dm ha d month average on time series for actual napp data and corrected sinusoidal model on the other hand the model presents an underestimation on march and april having average monthly values of 15 29 vs 13 02 kg dm ha d march y 11 15 vs 9 47 kg dm ha d april for actual napp vs corrected sinusoidal model for the rest of months the range of underestimation and overestimation is between 7 june and 10 september the closest values of actual vs sinusoidal modelled napp ratio is 1 for february 16 46 vs 16 54 for actual napp data and corrected sinusoidal model 3 3 using sinusoidal model as predictive tool a main question about modelling is using it to generate future scenarios allowing to discuss possible system evolutions wedderburn et al 2013 in order to use the sinusoidal model to predict system behaviour an internal correlation analysis of time series data was performed the climacoeff parameter was used to explore correlations between consecutive months the table 2 presents regression and correlations between consecutive month for climacoeff for napp 2000 2019 time series as shown in table 2 there are positive significative correlations between consecutive month for whole year except for janury december pair it is important to note that january month has the biggest napp amplitude of the year this fact represents in practice a difficult to predict the behaviour of forage productivity in that month to test the impact of inclusion of correlation between pairs consecutive month to build a predictive model a set of simulations n 1000 was performed in each simulation run the napp sinusoidal model without correlation parameters table 2 between consecutive month wout c was compared the sinusoidal model with correlation whit c both models include a monthly random generated climacoeff with normal distribution and sd for each month obtained form 2000 2019 time series fig 1 for january december correlations not significant correlation the correlation parameters were kept on simulation runs to maintain the same criteria and to avoid slant results the rrmse jamieson et al 1991 qi et al 2017 an r2 were used to assess the goodness of fit between modelled and monitored data table 3 presents rrmse and r2 results average maximum and minimum result of 1000 runs for wout c and with c sinusoidal models with napp data results presented on table 3 indicates that inclusion of correlation between consecutive month improves fitness of model and napp sensed data for whole time series the average goodness of fit but enough to going from a poor to fair fitness according with qi et al 2017 model with c present a smaller range of rrmse than model wout c for all scenarios considering de maximum and minimum obtained values correlation of model with c and napp data is higher presenting also a closer range in r2 results fig 5 presents the napp remote sensing time series data and models without or with correlation between months wout c and with c respectively for the better fit run of with c model between simulations and actual data in general terms both sinusoidal models wout c and with c has a significative correlation with napp remote sensing data in the best fitting simulation run fig 5 the r2 was 0 86 p 0 05 and rrmse was 20 for with c model when the wout c model presented a r2 0 72 p 0 05 and a rrsmse value of 22 when considering the average monthly data see fig 1 the results using with c sinusoidal model improves the correlation r2 0 971 p 0 05 and a rrmse of 6 9 when the sinusoidal wout c model presents a r2 0 953 with an rrmse value of 9 0 considering the inclusion of correlations between consecutive month as a way to improve fitness of model and aiming to use it as a predictive tool the sinusoidal model including variability of napp can be reformulated as presented on eq 2 2 nap p m nap p max nap p min 2 cos 2 pi m 12 nap p max nap p min 2 a clim acoef f m 1 b where nappmax and nappmin represents the maximal and minimal napp of the monthly average of data series m is the ordinal number of the month a is the slope and b is the intercept of correlations between m and m 1 months table 2 3 4 exploring the safe stocking rate concept next sections of this paper present an exploratory work formalizing the calculus of ssr from napp sinusoidal model formerly described in a first part the robustness of ssr calculus is tested on environmental variability scenarios last but not least a comparation between management models using different levels of fixed stocking rate on whole year vs adjusted stocking rate using ssr criteria is held to discuss adaptive management response of the native grassland based livestock farming systems 3 4 1 calculus of ssr from napp the ssr concept is now days discussed in extension activities as a way to improve the efficiency of livestock farming on native grasslands under the adaptive management paradigm birgé et al 2016 the ssr is the stocking rate in gross units gu by hectare gu ha that represents the half of intake of grass napp a gu gross unit is defined as the requirements of a breeding cow of 380 kg of liveweight assuming 2 of dm daily intake of it livewight cacho 1993 it represents 7 6 kg dm gu d fig 6 shows the monthly variation of ssr calculated from napp using the harmonic sinusoidal model and a normal distribution of climacoeff mean 1 and sd obtained napp time series data considering ssr definition then the formalization of it calculus is presentdd on eq 3 3 ss r t nap p max nap p min 4 cos 2 pi t 365 nap p max nap p min 4 gul i where nappmax y nappmin represents the maximal and minimal napp of the monthly average of data series t is the time expressed as julian day gul is the gross unit liveweight 380 kg animal martinez and pereira 2011 i is the daily dm intake refered to a gu liveweight 2 por default cacho 1993 it is worthy to note that ssr monthly expressed can be an ambiguous concept because the calculation does not consider cumulative grass differed from one month to the next nevertheless the supposition of take half leave half briske et al 2011 seems to be a primary approximation in fact there is national empirical information that supports that regular harvesting efficiency of natural pasture by animals on extensive grassland systems is near 50 saldanha 2005 martinez and pereira 2011 using the annual average value of napp calculated from harmonic sinusoidal model the annual ssr value is 0 85 gu ha corresponding to an annual intake of 2358 kg dm ha this result is comparable with native grassland national empirical experience berretta et al 2000 martinez and pereira 2011 in an annual scale we can assume that in a system managed with stocking rate adjustment to ssr value the difference between intake and offered is cumulated on whole year forage assessment with that perspective a behaviour test was performed in an annual scale to asses robustness of using a monthly average predefined value of srr fig 6 in an environmental variability scenario simulations runs n 1000 where carried out to generate annual napp cumulated value with the sinusoidal model and it ssr eq 3 considering environmental variability for each simulation run a climacoeff was random generated mean 1 and sd obtained napp time series data table 4 present the result of simulation for napp calculated ssr and it percentual difference with the static annual average value of ssr 0 85 gu ha results suggest that in annual scale herd management using ssr criteria using a settled value can dump the environmental variability assuming a normal distribution of climacoeff where de excess of forage is transferred to following months in the yearly cycle the model can overestimate in order of 15 or underestimate in order of 13 the average value in a whole year table 4 the average value and range obtained can be considered the rmse of fixed vs variable environment ssr for simulations run was 1 0 with maximum and minimum values of 2 3 and 0 3 respectively these results support the buffering effect of whole year assessment on variable conditions even using a monthly static ssr 3 4 2 comparing management using ssr criteria and annual fixed stocking rate considering that primary productivity represents the major input of matter and energy into agroecosystems in agreement with sala and austin 2000 the anpp can be conceived as an integrative variable of whole ecosystem functioning because of its relationships with animal biomass secondary productivity and nutrient cycling furthermore primary production of grasslands determines forage availability and constrains animal carrying capacity it is worthy to mention that farm practices like supplemented feed weaning management pasture fertilization can affect directly with system stocking rate by changing nutrient inputs and flows the ssr concept implies an adaptive management of grazing system to grass productivity particularly on variable environmental scenarios it is interesting to compare then a fixed stocking rate management with an adapted stocking rate using ssr concept with forage annual dynamics to compare an adaptive system using ssr and a fixed sr fsr simulations considers a daily intake of 7 6 kg dm animal d corresponding to an average stocking rate 0 85 gu ha 322 kg liveweight ha on whole year simulations note that average stocking rate scenario corresponds to mean ssr calculated from annual mean of napp data 12 87 kg dm ha d to compare management strategies scenarios where built generating 1000 annual simulations with a normal distribution of climacoeff mean 1 and sd obtained napp time series data comparing a ssr management and fsr of 0 85 gu ha results of annual cumulated forage average sd maximum and minimum of 1000 iterations and average number of months with negative forage assessment difference between needs and offered simulations are presented on table 5 results contrasting both management strategies are presented in table 5 results suggest that ssr can increase 27 forage cumulation than fsr system also ssr management has a less variability compared with static sr simulations vc 5 vs 16 for sfr and fsr respectively likewise ssr system do not present any month with negative forage balance when fsr management has as mean of simulations 3 months with lack of pasture for livestock with a range from 1 to 7 month with grass deficit that lack of grass is placed in winter may june july quarter the adaptive management using ssr allows to generate a pasture surplus making more resilient system to climate variability and helps to avoid winter grass deficiency that normally forces to mobilize cattle energy reserves that can compromises the productive and reproductive herd performance in agreement with derner and augustine 2016 setting stocking rates based on expected forage supply during drought episodes may increase resilience of the rangeland plant soil community and will reduce the chance of having economic loses at farm level furthermore same authors stated that it exists some successful experiences of proactive strategies employed by ranchers using adaptive management against drought impact including grassbanking conservative overall ranch stocking rate and using seasonal climate predictions to adjust stocking rate even if actual stocking rate at farm level depends on several factors like farm size soil type pasture and land use combined with strategies of herd management stocking rate is a main system key to adjust nutrient assessment an optimal stocking rate value is needed to determine maximal response of animals liveweight variation as function of grass allowance considering the carrying capacity of rangeland ungar 2019 a local reference is 0 8 gu ha year equivalent to 300 kg liveweight ha martinez and pereira 2011 nevertheless neither climate variability nor seasonal variability are included in that benchmarking value deeper intra annual analysis is required to understand monthly dynamics of napp and its effects on stocking rate considering climate variability on a forage deficiency period caused by drought lowering stocking is a strategy to buffer the lower pasture productivity bartaburu et al 2009 however the threshold of an adequate stocking rate still being an unknown model results suggest that an adaptive management throw reduction of the stocking rate in with ssr criteria fig 6 eq 3 can be a strategy to improve system resilience 4 conclusion the present work proposes a simple model of napp based on harmonic oscillation function of julian day of the year the input parameters in our model are the maximum and minimum napp data obtained by remote sensing in this case but can be obtained by other classical ways likewise grass cutting monitoring these two inputs determine the amplitude of the periodic oscillations of the base model it is considered that the disturbance of the sinusoidal model is caused by the environment associated to climate events e g drought depleting grass growth the environmental climate effect is also studied and modelled resulting in a normal distribution of a relative variation coefficient climacoeff once the variability is characterized it can be included into the model to generate random scenarios that possibility allows to explore pasture response to climate stress and let to study prospective scenarios in that sense we observe positive correlations between consecutive months on climacoeff except for january december pair january napp is difficult to forecast but nevertheless it can be modelled with a biggest sd of values even if climacoeff corrected sinusoidal model fits napp remote sensing data series 2000 2019 more information can improve correlations between consecutive months and enhance predictive power of it also accumulation of information can improve statistics analysis of napp behaviour of grasslands the napp modelling allows to explore an optimal grassland management like the ssr concept that involves an adaptive management of livestock farming system this work presents a ssr calculus also function of napp that can helps to dialogue and reflect about sr management at farm level simulations strongly suggest that an adaptive sr can improve yearly grass cumulation and can make more resilient systems to climate variability cumulated forage can be considered as a food saving grassbanks for animals and a buffer to droughts episodes that affects farms and country economy in a larger scale model results are discussed stakeholders in extension activity of the instituto plan agropecuario modelling as a knowledge platform allows to share knowledge about grasslands dynamics with farmers and field technicians to explore grazing alternatives on climate variability scenarios focused on strategies to avoid negative effects of drought episodes credit authorship contribution statement

underestimation on march and april having average monthly values of 15 29 vs 13 02 kg dm ha d march y 11 15 vs 9 47 kg dm ha d april for actual napp vs corrected sinusoidal model for the rest of months the range of underestimation and overestimation is between 7 june and 10 september the closest values of actual vs sinusoidal modelled napp ratio is 1 for february 16 46 vs 16 54 for actual napp data and corrected sinusoidal model 3 3 using sinusoidal model as predictive tool a main question about modelling is using it to generate future scenarios allowing to discuss possible system evolutions wedderburn et al 2013 in order to use the sinusoidal model to predict system behaviour an internal correlation analysis of time series data was performed the climacoeff parameter was used to explore correlations between consecutive months the table 2 presents regression and correlations between consecutive month for climacoeff for napp 2000 2019 time series as shown in table 2 there are positive significative correlations between consecutive month for whole year except for janury december pair it is important to note that january month has the biggest napp amplitude of the year this fact represents in practice a difficult to predict the behaviour of forage productivity in that month to test the impact of inclusion of correlation between pairs consecutive month to build a predictive model a set of simulations n 1000 was performed in each simulation run the napp sinusoidal model without correlation parameters table 2 between consecutive month wout c was compared the sinusoidal model with correlation whit c both models include a monthly random generated climacoeff with normal distribution and sd for each month obtained form 2000 2019 time series fig 1 for january december correlations not significant correlation the correlation parameters were kept on simulation runs to maintain the same criteria and to avoid slant results the rrmse jamieson et al 1991 qi et al 2017 an r2 were used to assess the goodness of fit between modelled and monitored data table 3 presents rrmse and r2 results average maximum and minimum result of 1000 runs for wout c and with c sinusoidal models with napp data results presented on table 3 indicates that inclusion of correlation between consecutive month improves fitness of model and napp sensed data for whole time series the average goodness of fit but enough to going from a poor to fair fitness according with qi et al 2017 model with c present a smaller range of rrmse than model wout c for all scenarios considering de maximum and minimum obtained values correlation of model with c and napp data is higher presenting also a closer range in r2 results fig 5 presents the napp remote sensing time series data and models without or with correlation between months wout c and with c respectively for the better fit run of with c model between simulations and actual data in general terms both sinusoidal models wout c and with c has a significative correlation with napp remote sensing data in the best fitting simulation run fig 5 the r2 was 0 86 p 0 05 and rrmse was 20 for with c model when the wout c model presented a r2 0 72 p 0 05 and a rrsmse value of 22 when considering the average monthly data see fig 1 the results using with c sinusoidal model improves the correlation r2 0 971 p 0 05 and a rrmse of 6 9 when the sinusoidal wout c model presents a r2 0 953 with an rrmse value of 9 0 considering the inclusion of correlations between consecutive month as a way to improve fitness of model and aiming to use it as a predictive tool the sinusoidal model including variability of napp can be reformulated as presented on eq 2 2 nap p m nap p max nap p min 2 cos 2 pi m 12 nap p max nap p min 2 a clim acoef f m 1 b where nappmax and nappmin represents the maximal and minimal napp of the monthly average of data series m is the ordinal number of the month a is the slope and b is the intercept of correlations between m and m 1 months table 2 3 4 exploring the safe stocking rate concept next sections of this paper present an exploratory work formalizing the calculus of ssr from napp sinusoidal model formerly described in a first part the robustness of ssr calculus is tested on environmental variability scenarios last but not least a comparation between management models using different levels of fixed stocking rate on whole year vs adjusted stocking rate using ssr criteria is held to discuss adaptive management response of the native grassland based livestock farming systems 3 4 1 calculus of ssr from napp the ssr concept is now days discussed in extension activities as a way to improve the efficiency of livestock farming on native grasslands under the adaptive management paradigm birgé et al 2016 the ssr is the stocking rate in gross units gu by hectare gu ha that represents the half of intake of grass napp a gu gross unit is defined as the requirements of a breeding cow of 380 kg of liveweight assuming 2 of dm daily intake of it livewight cacho 1993 it represents 7 6 kg dm gu d fig 6 shows the monthly variation of ssr calculated from napp using the harmonic sinusoidal model and a normal distribution of climacoeff mean 1 and sd obtained napp time series data considering ssr definition then the formalization of it calculus is presentdd on eq 3 3 ss r t nap p max nap p min 4 cos 2 pi t 365 nap p max nap p min 4 gul i where nappmax y nappmin represents the maximal and minimal napp of the monthly average of data series t is the time expressed as julian day gul is the gross unit liveweight 380 kg animal martinez and pereira 2011 i is the daily dm intake refered to a gu liveweight 2 por default cacho 1993 it is worthy to note that ssr monthly expressed can be an ambiguous concept because the calculation does not consider cumulative grass differed from one month to the next nevertheless the supposition of take half leave half briske et al 2011 seems to be a primary approximation in fact there is national empirical information that supports that regular harvesting efficiency of natural pasture by animals on extensive grassland systems is near 50 saldanha 2005 martinez and pereira 2011 using the annual average value of napp calculated from harmonic sinusoidal model the annual ssr value is 0 85 gu ha corresponding to an annual intake of 2358 kg dm ha this result is comparable with native grassland national empirical experience berretta et al 2000 martinez and pereira 2011 in an annual scale we can assume that in a system managed with stocking rate adjustment to ssr value the difference between intake and offered is cumulated on whole year forage assessment with that perspective a behaviour test was performed in an annual scale to asses robustness of using a monthly average predefined value of srr fig 6 in an environmental variability scenario simulations runs n 1000 where carried out to generate annual napp cumulated value with the sinusoidal model and it ssr eq 3 considering environmental variability for each simulation run a climacoeff was random generated mean 1 and sd obtained napp time series data table 4 present the result of simulation for napp calculated ssr and it percentual difference with the static annual average value of ssr 0 85 gu ha results suggest that in annual scale herd management using ssr criteria using a settled value can dump the environmental variability assuming a normal distribution of climacoeff where de excess of forage is transferred to following months in the yearly cycle the model can overestimate in order of 15 or underestimate in order of 13 the average value in a whole year table 4 the average value and range obtained can be considered the rmse of fixed vs variable environment ssr for simulations run was 1 0 with maximum and minimum values of 2 3 and 0 3 respectively these results support the buffering effect of whole year assessment on variable conditions even using a monthly static ssr 3 4 2 comparing management using ssr criteria and annual fixed stocking rate considering that primary productivity represents the major input of matter and energy into agroecosystems in agreement with sala and austin 2000 the anpp can be conceived as an integrative variable of whole ecosystem functioning because of its relationships with animal biomass secondary productivity and nutrient cycling furthermore primary production of grasslands determines forage availability and constrains animal carrying capacity it is worthy to mention that farm practices like supplemented feed weaning management pasture fertilization can affect directly with system stocking rate by changing nutrient inputs and flows the ssr concept implies an adaptive management of grazing system to grass productivity particularly on variable environmental scenarios it is interesting to compare then a fixed stocking rate management with an adapted stocking rate using ssr concept with forage annual dynamics to compare an adaptive system using ssr and a fixed sr fsr simulations considers a daily intake of 7 6 kg dm animal d corresponding to an average stocking rate 0 85 gu ha 322 kg liveweight ha on whole year simulations note that average stocking rate scenario corresponds to mean ssr calculated from annual mean of napp data 12 87 kg dm ha d to compare management strategies scenarios where built generating 1000 annual simulations with a normal distribution of climacoeff mean 1 and sd obtained napp time series data comparing a ssr management and fsr of 0 85 gu ha results of annual cumulated forage average sd maximum and minimum of 1000 iterations and average number of months with negative forage assessment difference between needs and offered simulations are presented on table 5 results contrasting both management strategies are presented in table 5 results suggest that ssr can increase 27 forage cumulation than fsr system also ssr management has a less variability compared with static sr simulations vc 5 vs 16 for sfr and fsr respectively likewise ssr system do not present any month with negative forage balance when fsr management has as mean of simulations 3 months with lack of pasture for livestock with a range from 1 to 7 month with grass deficit that lack of grass is placed in winter may june july quarter the adaptive management using ssr allows to generate a pasture surplus making more resilient system to climate variability and helps to avoid winter grass deficiency that normally forces to mobilize cattle energy reserves that can compromises the productive and reproductive herd performance in agreement with derner and augustine 2016 setting stocking rates based on expected forage supply during drought episodes may increase resilience of the rangeland plant soil community and will reduce the chance of having economic loses at farm level furthermore same authors stated that it exists some successful experiences of proactive strategies employed by ranchers using adaptive management against drought impact including grassbanking conservative overall ranch stocking rate and using seasonal climate predictions to adjust stocking rate even if actual stocking rate at farm level depends on several factors like farm size soil type pasture and land use combined with strategies of herd management stocking rate is a main system key to adjust nutrient assessment an optimal stocking rate value is needed to determine maximal response of animals liveweight variation as function of grass allowance considering the carrying capacity of rangeland ungar 2019 a local reference is 0 8 gu ha year equivalent to 300 kg liveweight ha martinez and pereira 2011 nevertheless neither climate variability nor seasonal variability are included in that benchmarking value deeper intra annual analysis is required to understand monthly dynamics of napp and its effects on stocking rate considering climate variability on a forage deficiency period caused by drought lowering stocking is a strategy to buffer the lower pasture productivity bartaburu et al 2009 however the threshold of an adequate stocking rate still being an unknown model results suggest that an adaptive management throw reduction of the stocking rate in with ssr criteria fig 6 eq 3 can be a strategy to improve system resilience 4 conclusion the present work proposes a simple model of napp based on harmonic oscillation function of julian day of the year the input parameters in our model are the maximum and minimum napp data obtained by remote sensing in this case but can be obtained by other classical ways likewise grass cutting monitoring these two inputs determine the amplitude of the periodic oscillations of the base model it is considered that the disturbance of the sinusoidal model is caused by the environment associated to climate events e g drought depleting grass growth the environmental climate effect is also studied and modelled resulting in a normal distribution of a relative variation coefficient climacoeff once the variability is characterized it can be included into the model to generate random scenarios that possibility allows to explore pasture response to climate stress and let to study prospective scenarios in that sense we observe positive correlations between consecutive months on climacoeff except for january december pair january napp is difficult to forecast but nevertheless it can be modelled with a biggest sd of values even if climacoeff corrected sinusoidal model fits napp remote sensing data series 2000 2019 more information can improve correlations between consecutive months and enhance predictive power of it also accumulation of information can improve statistics analysis of napp behaviour of grasslands the napp modelling allows to explore an optimal grassland management like the ssr concept that involves an adaptive management of livestock farming system this work presents a ssr calculus also function of napp that can helps to dialogue and reflect about sr management at farm level simulations strongly suggest that an adaptive sr can improve yearly grass cumulation and can make more resilient systems to climate variability cumulated forage can be considered as a food saving grassbanks for animals and a buffer to droughts episodes that affects farms and country economy in a larger scale model results are discussed stakeholders in extension activity of the instituto plan agropecuario modelling as a knowledge platform allows to share knowledge about grasslands dynamics with farmers and field technicians to explore grazing alternatives on climate variability scenarios focused on strategies to avoid negative effects of drought episodes credit authorship contribution statement

24826,the expansion of the aquaculture industry in the last several decades has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts of the industry bivalve culture particularly mussel farming relies on naturally occurring plankton and numerous studies have demonstrated top down control on phytoplankton increased nutrients through excretion of metabolic wastes and remineralization of faeces and pseudofaeces and bottom up effects on predators and scavengers through mussel fall off however results are inconsistent between studies and hydrodynamic conditions and nutrient availability are thought to play an important role in the magnitude and the direction of the ecological effects of mussel culture on the surrounding ecosystem we used qualitative network models qnms to outline a general model that integrates these environmental conditions and 1 evaluated the ability of different model configurations to reproduce known responses to perturbations 2 analyzed the behaviour of key components to contrasting hydrodynamic and nutrient condition scenarios and 3 identified the most influential features of the derived scenarios the model that included uncertain linkages to characterize unknown relationships performed best based on predetermined validation criteria the addition of semi quantitative information on the relative strength of certain linkages improved accuracy and sign determinacy of outcomes the presence of suspended mussel culture negatively affected primary producers zooplankton and deposit feeders and had a positive effect on predators and scavengers especially in low energy environments hydrodynamic conditions were shown to have a major impact on the response of the community to mussel culture while nutrient availability had a very minor impact keywords qnms qualitative model food web trophic network mussel aquaculture shellfish aquaculture 1 introduction the world s growing demand for seafood has accelerated the development of the aquaculture industry which reached a total production of 80 million tonnes in 2016 including 16 1 million tonnes of bivalves fao 2018 in canada mussels are the most valuable bivalve aquaculture species and their production has almost doubled since the end of the 1990s dfo 2018 the rapid expansion of the sector has raised concerns about the ecological impacts of mussel farming as demonstrated by a quick search in isi web of science showing a greater than five fold increase in the annual number of scientific publications on the topic since 2000 i e from 65 in 2000 to 333 articles in 2018 unlike much of finfish culture which usually requires the addition of food to the ecosystem mussels consume naturally occurring phytoplankton and do not rely on external inputs of nutrients to the system however the addition of 1 a dense population of suspended filter feeders and 2 the associated physical structure to what are commonly otherwise soft sediment bottom areas has various direct and indirect effects on the local ecosystem mckindsey et al 2011 the grazing pressure of the high biomass in mussel culture may exert a top down control on their food source dame and prins 1997 filgueira and grant 2009 grant et al 2005 prins et al 1995 phytoplankton depletion can negatively affect mussel production and potentially natural populations of primary consumers grant et al 2005 while many studies have focused on the optimization of mussel densities to yield maximum production given a system s characteristics and resources filgueira and grant 2009 fréchette 2010 grant et al 2007 limited information is available on the consequences of mussel culture on zooplankton communities and other filter feeders lam hoai and rougier 2001 suggested that competition for food and predation by farmed shellfish could explain a biomass depletion of zooplankton near shellfish farms in the thau lagoon france but these assumptions remain to be confirmed phytoplankton filtration by cultured mussels may also increase water transparency lindahl et al 2005 schröder et al 2014 which may in turn promote microphytobenthic production newell et al 2002 microphytobenthos play an important role in shallow ecosystems by limiting nutrient fluxes from the sediment to the water column and providing a major food source and habitat to herbivores and predators macintyre et al 1996 miller et al 1996 mussels may also have a bottom up control on primary production through metabolic waste excretion and biodeposition of faeces and pseudofaeces cranford et al 2007 grant et al 1995 jansen 2012 prins et al 1998 direct excretion of dissolved metabolites may contribute significantly to the pool of nutrients released from a mussel farm holmer et al 2015 prins and smaal 1994 and enhance primary production ren et al 2010 benthic organic enrichment from biodeposition of particulate matter beneath mussel lines has been shown to stimulate mineralization rates and nutrient releases in the water column hargrave et

lead to hypoxic or anoxic conditions in bottom waters and sulphide accumulation callier et al 2007 christensen et al 2003 cranford et al 2009 holmer et al 2015 richard et al 2006 while organically enriched environments may be beneficial to deposit feeders only a few species can tolerate hypoxic and sulphidic conditions callier et al 2007 diaz and rosenberg 1995 filter feeders are also thought to be sensitive to oxygen concentrations josefson and rosenberg 1988 stenton dozey et al 2001 stenton dozey et al 1999 fall off of mussels and associated organisms colonizing suspended culture ascidians bryozoans hydrozoans macroalgae etc is another bottom up process linked to mussel farming fréchette 2012 grant et al 1995 leonard 2004 mallet and carver 1991 matisson and lindén 1983 the addition of food to the bottom has been shown to attract benthic predators and scavengers such as starfish crabs gastropods and fish drouin et al 2015 d amours et al 2008 inglis and gust 2003 kaspar et al 1985 romero et al 1982 wilding and nickell 2013 an increased abundance of lobsters was also reported under mussel culture sites but a manipulative study showed that the presence of anchor blocks partly explained this observation drouin et al 2015 the introduction of physical farm structure to the bottom as well as to the water column in addition to the bivalves themselves as previously mentioned may also create favourable habitats for hard substrate species cultured mussels and the associated fauna may in turn attract pelagic predators such as fish and other large organisms callier et al 2018 and references therein the magnitude and direction of the ecological effects of shellfish aquaculture on ecosystems vary among studies ranging from undetectable or low e g crawford et al 2003 danovaro et al 2004 grant et al 1995 to significant e g callier et al 2008 drouin et al 2015 d amours et al 2008 giles et al 2006 kaspar et al 1985 and is greatly influenced by site bathymetry and hydrodynamic conditions chamberlain et al 2001 hartstein and stevens 2005 rudorff et al 2012 shallow areas characterized by weak currents have a low potential for dispersion and longer water residence times and are thus more subject to biodeposit accumulation and phytoplankton depletion than are deeper and high energy environments cranford et al 2008 hartstein and stevens 2005 in addition the availability of nutrients in the system may also influence the effects of mussel farming for example the contribution of mussel culture to nutrient pools in the water column through direct excretion may be of greater importance for primary production in oligotrophic than in eutrophic systems jansen et al 2012 similarly the influence of grazing pressure by farmed organisms in oligotrophic systems where phytoplankton biomass is typically low may have a greater effect than in eutrophic systems aure et al 2007 models are often used to assess the dynamics of aquaculture environment interactions e g filgueira et al 2015 mckindsey 2013 however while much work has been done toward examining particular aspects of bivalve culture such as dynamic energy budget deb models to evaluate mussel growth under various environmental conditions e g dabrowski et al 2013 filgueira et al 2018 maar et al 2015 and dispersion models to assess benthic loading mckindsey et al 2009 weise et al 2009 little is known about community wide responses to mussel culture under different hydrodynamic and nutrient availability conditions these causes and responses are diffuse and because the systems are open it is difficult to ascribe an observed response to a particular cause driven by the mussel culture operations quantitative trophic modelling approaches have been used to integrate direct and indirect effects of bivalve aquaculture on the surrounding ecosystem components byron et al 2011 kluger et al 2016 outeiro et al 2018 however these models do not easily allow the inclusion of variables that are not biomass pools and their site specific parameterization and data set requirements prevent their use at a broader scale and in data limited areas harvey et al 2016 reum et al 2015a qualitative network models qnms are an interesting alternative or complementary approach to quantitative methods in cases of data poor systems requiring only a qualitative understanding of the interactions between ecosystem components and allowing the explicit exploration of structural and parametric uncertainty melbourne thomas et al 2012 harvey et al 2016 sobocinski et al 2017 developed by levins 1974 and puccia and levins 1985 qnms have recently been used to explore various levels of biological organization this includes cellular level effects for osmotic stress in cancerous cells shorthouse et al 2018 to individuals and tumour development in people franke et al 2008 to population level effects and the decline of pacific salmon survival sobocinski et al 2017 to individual species or species group effects on the ecosystem goedegebuure et al 2017 to communities and the redistribution of reef species in eastern tasmania marzloff et al 2016 and to ecosystem level effects and causative drivers of changes in the black sea ecosystem bodini et al 2018 qnms also provide a tool for a more integrated perspective of the system enabling analysis of food web dynamics while incorporating potential effects of diverse processes such as external forcings harvey et al 2016 sobocinski et al 2017 which is potentially more useful in systems with a diverse set of drivers and responses for which quantitative data are rare in addition qnms may also be used to evaluate sobocinski et al 2017 marzloff et al 2016 different management strategies on the ecological and social attributes of systems as has been shown for salmon harvey et al 2016 for a variety of fisheries species zador et al 2017 to undertake integrated ecosystem assessments depiper et al 2017 and to guide the development of zoning site selection and area management plans for aquaculture corner and aguilar manjarrez 2017 with respect to aquaculture enms have been used to evaluate community wide responses to various bivalve cultivation effort scenarios reum et al 2015a and impact of ocean acidification on a shellfish producing estuary on the usa west coast reum et al 2015b building on this we use qnms to explore responses of eastern canada coastal ecosystems to the addition of suspended mussel culture under contrasting hydrodynamic and nutrient availability scenarios more specifically we developed a qnm and compared the ability of alternative versions to reproduce known responses to perturbations analyzed the behaviour of key components of the system and identified which aspect of the scenarios had the most influence on outcomes i e the response of benthic species we also present a new method to include weighting of forcings variables to provide further information in the approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and conceptual model the conceptual ecosystem model was constructed based on knowledge gathered from the literature on the influence of mussel aquaculture on the ecosystem with a focus on studies conducted in eastern canada in 2017 mussel production in canada approached 25 000 tonnes of which 82 came from the 4 500 ha of mussel leases on prince edward island dfo 2018 mussel culture activities in eastern canada have also developed in newfoundland and labrador nova scotia and québec farmed mussel species include mytilus edulis and to a lesser extent m trossulus in eastern canada mussel aquaculture is mainly practiced using suspended culture on off bottom longline systems in shallow bays and inlets that are generally characterized by soft substrate clynick et al 2008 mussels are grown on lines or in mesh socks 2 or 3 m in length and suspended approximately 30 to 50 cm apart from 100 to 200 m long backlines mussel density is usually maintained at 1 10 to 2 06 kg m2 comeau et al 2008 the backlines anchored at both ends and floated by buoys are typically spaced by 10 to 20 m wide corridors drapeau et al 2006 drouin et al 2015 guyondet et al 2016 a series of ropes legs attached to the backlines at regular intervals and fixed by block anchors on the seafloor are used to control the position of the backline in the water column by adjusting their number and length mckindsey et al 2011 the conceptual ecosystem model was created using the directed graphing software dia v 0 97 2 this took the form of a signed digraph in which nodes variables are connected by edges linkages characterizing the sign of direct effects positive negative or neutral of the components on one another puccia and levins 1985 and is readily interpretable in subsequent analyses we sought to build a holistic model of a coastal ecosystem incorporating key ecological groups and interactions to assess the behaviour of its components in response to the presence or absence of mussel culture fig 1 the nodes currents and depth and their associated linkages were included to allow simulation of low and high energy environments while the node nutrients allowed simulations of nutrient rich eutrophic and nutrient poor oligotrophic conditions functionally similar species were grouped in a single variable to simplify the model reduce prediction uncertainty and generalize its application to other geographic areas the node mussels et al comprises suspended mussel culture and associated fouling communities such as ascidians bryozoans hydrozoans and macroalgae which were combined given their coexistence and dependence of the latter on the former fish and birds were excluded from the model which focused mainly on vagile benthic macroinvertebrates further because the main objective of the study was to explore the impact of mussel aquaculture on the ecosystem we wanted to control the variable mussels et al to obtain contrasted results and thus did not consider variables that could affect this node the relationships between the variables were defined as positive negative or null based on the existing literature dashed linkages indicate weak or uncertain linkages all linkages pointing to benthic filter feeders were weak except for the linkage from mussels et al since their high abundance on the bottom of mussel culture sites depends mostly on fall off from suspended lines descriptions of the interactions included in the model are provided in supplementary data table s1 because the objective was to explore the impact of mussel culture on the dynamics of the ecosystem the node mussels et al varied only when we directly applied a sustained press perturbation negative self effects were added to all variables to account for self regulation and the potential effect of other variables that were not represented in the model dambacher et al 1999 puccia and levins 1985 2 2 qualitative network models qnms the approach used to analyze the behaviour of the model was first developed by levins 1974 and puccia and levins 1985 to analyze the contribution of feedbacks in network models the first step consists of converting signed digraphs obtained from conceptual models into their mathematically equivalent community interaction matrix wherein the rate of change of a variable of the system can be described as a continuous function of one or more variables levins 1974 puccia and levins 1985 the dynamics of n interacting variables is represented as a system of differential equations of the form d x i d t f x 1 x 2 x n c 1 c 2 c m where the rate of change in variable xi is a function of one or more variables in the system and their rate parameters ci the community matrix a is composed of interaction coefficients aij describing the effect of a small change in the level of variable j on the level of variable i and defined by the partial derivative aij fi xj evaluated at the equilibrium puccia and levins 1985 the negative inverse of the community matrix a 1 can be used to estimate the direction of changes in system equilibrium i e responses of the variables resulting from a press perturbation of one or more rate parameters c puccia and levins 1985 while quantitative specification of a is often difficult to achieve in ecology and quantitative predictions based on the inverse community matrix can be overly sensitive to small changes in interaction values aij dambacher et al 2002 the qualitative specification of a only requires the signs of the non zero aij terms i e 1 1 allowing the inclusion of variables that are difficult to measure or quantify or about which little information is available levins 1974 puccia and levins 1985 qualitative predictions of press perturbation impacts can be obtained from the calculation of system feedbacks if all feedback loops have the same sign the predicted response is unambiguous however if multiple feedback loops of opposite sign contribute to the response which is generally the case in complex ecosystem models the qualitative prediction may have high sign indeterminacy dambacher et al 2003 to address this situation raymond et al 2011 followed by melbourne thomas et al 2012 developed a probabilistic simulation based approach to predict the direction of change in the level of each variable to a press perturbation and an estimation of the level of sign determinacy the first step consists in generating a predefined number of matrices by assigning a random value to each non zero interaction coefficients aij of the community matrix from a uniform distribution values from 1 to 1 in the presence of uncertain linkages which represent unknown or weak interactions between variables their inclusion in each community matrix is determined by sampling from a binomial distribution each generated matrix is tested against stability criteria melbourne thomas et al 2012 and unstable matrices are discarded additional validation criteria can be applied to constrain the matrices to only those correctly predicting the responses of one or more variables to a previously observed perturbation scenario melbourne thomas et al 2012 raymond et al 2011 for each retained matrix the negative inverse matrix is calculated these steps are repeated until the predefined number of matrices is reached the sign of the response of each variable to a press perturbation is then summarized for the retained matrices and a distribution of outcomes is produced sign determinacy is calculated as the proportion of positive negative and neutral responses of the variables divided by the number of stable and if applicable validated matrices the qpress package http rforge net qpress provides many tools to explore qnms in r r core team 2018 starting from the conversion of conceptual digraphs into community matrices to evaluating the impact of press perturbations through simulations melbourne thomas et al 2012 here a similar approach was used to interpret the conceptual model and perform analyses with custom modifications and extensions of the qpress codes including the ability to add validation criteria based on semi quantitative information about the relative strength of linkages for example if evidence indicates that a14 is stronger than a23 then randomly generated matrices that do not reproduce this behaviour are discarded this addition helps to further constrain the resulting community matrices by including more information on the system even if the data only partially cover the components thereby reducing uncertainty and improving sign determinacy and robustness of the subsequent analyses 2 3 model simulations and analyses responses of the community to the presence of suspended mussel culture was assessed under four scenarios of environmental conditions defined by nutrient availability nutrient rich or nutrient poor area and hydrodynamic conditions low energy or high energy environment table 1 a positive perturbation was applied to the node mussels et al to simulate the presence of mussel culture the inclusion of contrasting trophic states in the scenarios which was achieved either by negatively or positively pressing the node nutrients broadens the application of the model to different geographic areas e g oligotrophic lagoons in îles de la madeleine québec canada trottet et al 2007 andeutrophic bays in prince edward island canada cranford et al 2009 and assesses the effects of nutrient enrichment enhanced by human population growth bricker et al 2008 on the components of the model similarly the inclusion of contrasting hydrodynamic conditions simulated either by negatively or positively pressing the nodes currents and depth for low energy or high energy environments respectively simulates the hydrodynamic regimes and bathymetry that could mitigate the accumulation of biodeposit on the seafloor hartstein and stevens 2005 and for the expansion of aquaculture to offshore environments jansen et al 2016 troell et al 2009 the outcomes of these scenarios were compared for three model configurations an uncertain model in which all linkages were set as uncertain a certain model in which all linkages were set as certain and a hybrid model in which only known weaker or unknown linkages based on documented effects of a high biomass of suspended mussels on the environment and on the main predators diet were marked as uncertain figure 1 in addition we analyzed the behaviour of these three model configurations under four levels of simulation constraints starting with a no constraint b two a priori validation criteria corresponding to known responses of particular variables to the addition of suspended mussel culture namely 1 an increase in benthic filter feeders due to mussel fall off fréchette 2012 leonard 2004 and 2 an increase in benthic organic enrichment in low energy conditions due to biodeposition grant et al 1995 prins et al 1998 c semi quantitative information on the relative strength of certain linkages table 2 and d a combination of b and c the models were further validated with two a posteriori validation criteria based on field observations of increased densities of crabs and starfish within mussel farms compared with control sites drouin et al 2015 d amours et al 2008 inglis and gust 2003 romero et al 1982 the effect of the number of simulation matrices 1 000 5 000 and 10 000 on the outcomes was also tested to evaluate consistency in the results following the approach of sobocinski et al 2017 we considered the effect of a perturbation to be clearly positive or negative when the percentage of the positive or negative outcomes among simulation matrices or sign consistency was 80 the effect was considered weak when sign consistency was 60 80 and ambiguous when sign consistency was 60 sign consistency is therefore a measure of the certainty in relationships among nodes to compare outcomes among scenarios we calculated pearson correlations of the results of all variables in each scenario in the presence of suspended mussel culture using the hmisc package version 4 2 0 harrell jr 2019 in r the results were visualized using correlation plots next we used the vegan package version 2 5 4 oksanen et al 2015 to explore the relative influence of each aspect of the scenarios i e presence or absence of suspended mussel culture hydrodynamic conditions and nutrient availability on variable responses we first performed a non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis based on distance matrices calculated from the bray curtis index to visualize the spread and position of the outcomes of all scenarios on an ordination plot we compared the results from a permutational analysis of variance permanova and an analysis of similarities anosim to test the significance of scenario differences in community wide responses and to confirm the results observed in the nmds plot finally we determined which scenarios differed from each other significantly by performing pairwise comparisons using permanova with corrections for multiple testing 3 results 3 1 model evaluation the final qnm had 20 nodes and 101 linkages of which 16 were considered uncertain in the hybrid model we started the analysis by generating 1 000 simulation matrices for each model configuration and explored the application of the four levels of simulation constraints on the outcomes of the scenarios table 1 while obtaining simulation matrices without any constraint besides the stability criteria and with two a priori validation criteria required on average three and nine times the number of simulations desired respectively the application of the 31 semi quantitative pieces of information on the relative strength of linkages required 3 74 107 and 5 65 107 simulations to obtain 1 000 valid simulation matrices for the certain and uncertain models respectively when both a priori validation criteria and semi quantitative information were applied this number jumped to 1 32 108 and 2 04 108 for the certain and uncertain models respectively to generate 1 000 valid simulation matrices for the hybrid model the application of semi quantitative information required approximately 4 5 106 simulations and the combination with a priori validation criteria required approximately 8 106 simulations inspection of the weights defining all community matrices for each model configuration and each level of simulation constraints revealed no anomalies results not shown for the certain model configuration none of the levels of simulation constraints applied led to the expected behaviour of an increase in crabs and starfish in the presence of suspended mussel culture as stated by our two a posteriori validation criteria figure s1a while most responses were weak sign consistency from 60 80 or ambiguous sign consistency 60 these two predators instead showed a trend towards the opposite behaviour in the case of the uncertain model most outcomes were neutral when no validation criterion was applied except for the pressed nodes and the variable dispersion which was directly related to pressed nodes figures 1 and s1b sequential application of the other levels of simulation constraints resulted in a directional response for most variables while the response of starfish followed the expected behaviour defined by our a posteriori validation criteria when both a priori criteria and information on the relative strength of linkages were applied figure s1b column d the response of crabs was not consistent among scenarios and tended to decrease in high energy nutrient poor conditions overall the responses of dispersion oxygen zooplankton light deposit feeders and herbivorous gastropods were consistent among model configurations especially for the outcomes obtained from the third and fourth levels of simulation constraints i e with semi quantitative information on the relative strength of certain linkages and with both semi quantitative information and two a priori validation criteria while the response of starfish and crabs was ambiguous in high energy scenarios the outcomes obtained from the hybrid model best matched our two a posteriori validation criteria when simulation constraints were applied especially when using both a priori validation criteria and semi quantitative information about the relative strength of some linkages figure s1c since the hybrid model was the best configuration based on our two a posteriori validation criteria and given the great amount of time required to obtain simulations for the certain and uncertain model configurations with semi quantitative information criteria ca 100 hours for 1 000 valid simulation matrices on an intel xeon cpu e5 2650 v4 at 2 20ghz the effect of the number of simulations was only assessed for the hybrid model since the outcomes from using 1 000 5 000 and 10 000 simulation matrices showed little differences except for phytoplankton whose sign determinacy increased with 5 000 and 10 000 simulations figure s2 we used 1 000 simulation matrices for subsequent analyses to reduce computation time 3 2 outcomes with suspended mussel culture we report outcomes generated from the hybrid model for the four scenarios from 1 000 simulation matrices validated a priori using the fourth level of validation constraints as well as a posteriori with two additional validation criteria the response of the four pressed nodes corresponded to the press perturbation applied on them but in the case of currents and nutrients whose responses also depended on one or many other nodes the outcomes were not always as clear as for depth and mussels et al which were not sensitive to the variation of any other nodes figure 2 results for depth and mussels et al are not shown for simplicity positive outcomes were observed in all scenarios for biodeposits benthic filter feeders starfish crabs and lobsters the positive response of biodeposits starfish crabs and lobsters had higher sign consistency in low energy environments the responses of starfish and crabs were ambiguous in high energy environments predatory gastropods increased in nutrient rich environments but their responses were ambiguous in nutrient poor environments currents oxygen bioturbation phytoplankton zooplankton light microphytobenthos and deposit feeders responded negatively to all scenarios but in the case of oxygen the outcomes were ambiguous in high energy environments dispersion increased in high energy environments and conversely decreased in low energy environments herbivorous gastropods showed the opposite behaviour with a negative response in high energy environments and a positive response in low energy environments the simulated effect of suspended mussel culture on remineralization was ambiguous in all scenarios community wide responses to the four scenarios showed high correlations for outcomes from similar hydrodynamic conditions figure 3 r 0 8 p 0 001 for high energy environments and r 0 7 p 0 001 for low energy environments no significant trend was detected between scenarios with the same nutrient availability for subsequent analyses to further evaluate the influence of each aspect of the scenarios on variable responses including the effect of suspended mussel culture we used the data obtained by positively and negatively pressing the node mussels et al for both hydrodynamic and nutrient conditions nmds analysis showed separation between scenarios of contrasting hydrodynamic conditions as well as between scenarios simulating the presence or absence of suspended mussel culture but the ellipses representing the 95 confidence interval around the centroid overlapped for scenarios simulating the same nutrient availability figure 4 the anosim r 0 525 p 0 001 and permanova r2 0 506 p 0 001 analyses confirmed the differences among groups pairwise comparisons revealed that all outcomes differed significantly between scenarios p 0 028 but that the percentage of variation explained by the scenarios varied the presence or absence of suspended mussel culture explained ca 39 of the variation between scenarios with the same hydrodynamic and nutrient conditions hydrodynamic conditions explained ca 25 of the variation between scenarios with the same nutrient conditions and nutrient conditions explained ca 1 of the variation between scenarios with the same hydrodynamic conditions 4 discussion the world wide rapid expansion of bivalve aquaculture requires better understanding of its impacts on ecosystems however comprehensive studies are often limited by the difficulty of acquiring data due to fieldwork logistics and budgetary limitations qnms constitute a promising approach to assess the behaviour of complex models under different perturbation scenarios requiring only a qualitative understanding of the components and their interactions the initial step enables collaboration of diverse experts and stakeholders to create conceptual models visually and intuitively illustrating their understanding of a system while reaching a common perspective may at times represent a challenge when involving multiple parties with different backgrounds salliou et al 2017 the approach easily allows the analysis of different model versions and the integration of uncertain relationship between components furthermore the flexibility of qnms which only require knowledge of the direction of relationships make the inclusion of various types of variables ecological social economic etc possible even for components that are difficult to quantify such as the sense of place variable included in harvey et al 2016 to account for human well being in the assessment of different management strategies on salmon populations under poor environmental conditions their flexible configuration and parameterization broaden their application to different regions which is often challenging for quantitative site specific parametrized models reum et al 2015a one drawback of this method is the high sign indeterminacy of the predictions generated by complex models that include multiple feedbacks with opposing directions dambacher et al 2003 sign determinacy could be improved using quantitative data on the strength of the relationships between system components reum et al 2015a although qnms are often used to assess data limited systems here we chose a trade off between strictly qualitative and quantitative model parameterization adding when available information on the relative strength of interactions between variables we showed that this addition increases sign determinacy especially when combined to a priori validation criteria while the outcomes of the certain model configuration did not follow the two a posteriori validation criteria the outcomes of the uncertain model configuration showed encouraging results however the responses of many variables even under the highest level of simulation constraints remained unclear the addition of semi quantitative information on the relative strength of more linkages could improve these results but the computing time would increase significantly the concept of a hybrid model combining certain linkages with well established relationships and uncertain linkages with weak or unknown relationships considerably reduces the computing time relative to model configurations built exclusively with either certain or uncertain linkages comparing outcomes of the model configurations also highlighted the importance of using a posteriori validation criteria from which we selected the model version that best reflected the results obtained from the literature thus increasing our confidence in prediction accuracy this study explored impacts of suspended mussel culture on coastal ecosystems while considering hydrodynamic and nutrient conditions of the area which have previously been identified as key factors influencing the magnitude of the response of system components chamberlain et al 2001 hartstein and stevens 2005 jansen 2012 rudorff et al 2012 consideration of these factors broadens application of the results to various geographic areas and is also relevant in the context of offshore aquaculture development to overcome nearshore spatial conflicts gentry et al 2017 jansen et al 2016 based on our final model configuration results from pairwise permanova analyses suggested that hydrodynamic conditions have more impact than nutrient availability on the influence of mussel culture on the ecosystem this was also illustrated by contrasting response direction between hydrodynamic conditions for certain variables or higher response sign determinacy in low energy environments for others and is consistent with previous studies comparing sites with contrasting hydrodynamic regimes hartstein and stevens 2005 rudorff et al 2012 analysis of our model suggests that the presence of mussel culture has a negative impact on phytoplankton regardless of hydrodynamic and nutrient conditions the stress that mussel culture exerts on phytoplankton is well documented in eutrophic areas dame and prins 1997 grant et al 2005 maar et al 2008 petersen et al 2008 but an increase in phytoplankton due to the contribution of mussel culture to the nutrient pool through metabolic waste and biodeposit remineralization has been hypothesized in oligotrophic regions jansen et al 2011 our results imply that the expected stimulation of primary production caused by the presence of mussel culture is insufficient to compensate for grazing pressure highlighting the relevance of carrying capacity studies before establishing of new mussel leases similarly zooplankton responded negatively to all four scenarios of mussel culture which can be explained by both the reduction in their source of food phytoplankton and direct consumption of zooplankton by the cultured mussels this result is consistent with the few studies reporting the effect of mussel grazing on zooplankton communities maar et al 2007 maar et al 2008 while the effect of grazing was thought to promote microphytobenthic production newell et al 2002 our model suggested a decrease in microphytobenthos most probably caused by the feeding pressure of benthic filter feeders as well as light reduction in high energy environments simulating deeper hence darker sites this negative response was not compensated by the increased nutrient pool in nutrient rich areas studies on the effect of mussel culture on microphytobenthos are scarce and more data are needed to validate the results obtained from our model directly linked to microphytobenthos which are a source of food miller et al 1996 deposit feeders responded negatively to all scenarios of mussel culture predation pressure from crabs and starfish could also partially explain this result although the strength of these linkages was considered weak another explanation is the ambiguous response of biodeposits in high energy environments mitigated by dispersion and the decrease in oxygen in low flow environments most likely explained by low dispersion and the ambiguous response of remineralization and bioturbation studies of infaunal communities under suspended mussel farms showed similar results in response to organic enrichment callier et al 2009 grant et al 1995 matisson and lindén 1983 but little effect was observed where biodeposit accumulation was low danovaro et al 2004 the addition of information on the relative strength of more linkages involving deposit feeders may help capture the behaviour of this variable the response of herbivorous gastropods was negative in high energy environments and positive in low energy environments even though the abundance of most of their predators increased this observation is contrary to results obtained from scallop bottom culture modelling in sechura bay peru kluger et al 2016 the positive response of herbivorous gastropods in low energy environments probably reflects the outcomes obtained for biodeposits the presence of suspended mussel culture had a positive effect on most macroinvertebrate predators crabs lobsters and starfish especially in low energy environments i e in shallow areas where currents are weak the abundance of epifauna associated with suspended culture colonizing shells and aquaculture gear as well as mussel fall off underneath farms provide food and are thought to explain the high densities of scavengers and carnivorous species drouin et al 2015 d amours et al 2008 inglis and gust 2003 kaspar et al 1985 romero et al 1982 wilding and nickell 2013 however for lobsters drouin et al 2015 demonstrated that the provision of shelter by anchor blocks may have a greater influence than does mussel fall off on their abundance the response of crabs and starfish was unclear in high energy environments i e in deeper areas where currents are stronger which is most likely due to the negative response of deposit feeders and herbivorous gastropods both present in their diet an observational study at an offshore longline mussel farm in îles de la madeleine showed that scavenging and predatory species were much more abundant inside of a farm than outside of it with the abundance of most scavengers being particularly high directly below lines where mussels fall mckindsey unpublished results likewise based on previous studies in various rias in spain crab populations are expected to increase in the presence of mussel culture even in areas more exposed to oceanic currents romero et al 1982 tenore et al 1985 similarly the wide vertical distribution of starfish such as asterias spp which were found at depths of more than 300 m franz et al 1981 and the report of their high incidence on mussel farm sites drouin et al 2015 inglis and gust 2003 suggest that starfish populations are also likely to increase in high energy environments predatory gastropods also responded positively to the presence of mussel culture in scenarios simulating nutrient rich areas but their response was unclear in nutrient poor areas their presence was described in mussel farms located in sheltered shallow bays in nova scotia and prince edward island d amours et al 2008 grant et al 1995 and on the west coast of south africa stenton dozey et al 1999 but to date there is no report of their presence in mussel culture sites located in nutrient poor regions in our model predatory gastropods were influenced by many variables which can lead to low sign determinacy dambacher et al 2003 more information about the relative strength of linkages related to variables with ambiguous results might help elucidate the direction of their response 5 conclusion qnms provide an affordable rapid and effective tool to assess outcomes of perturbations or restoration efforts on ecosystems and thus represent a promising research and integrative management approach the development of one or several versions of a conceptual model allows the integration of multiple sources of information and the collaboration of diverse parties which may facilitate reaching a consensual understanding of the system further the use of qualitative descriptors of the relationships included in a model allows the consideration of variables that are difficult to quantify such as human well being our study demonstrated the great value of qnms particularly in a data poor system to evaluate different scenarios of ecosystem components while the complexity of relationships among variables made some responses ambiguous the addition of information on the relative strength of key linkages may improve sign determinacy further our model was designed to represent a general coastal ecosystem refinement of the variables and the inclusion of more environmental parameters would probably lead to different outcomes since mussel culture is more frequent in relatively enclosed areas gentry et al 2017 data on macroinvertebrate communities under offshore mussel culture is scarce and thus our results for high energy environment were difficult to corroborate however our model provides predictions that could orient future investigations credit authorship contribution statement nathalie l forget conceptualization methodology software validation

24826,the expansion of the aquaculture industry in the last several decades has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts of the industry bivalve culture particularly mussel farming relies on naturally occurring plankton and numerous studies have demonstrated top down control on phytoplankton increased nutrients through excretion of metabolic wastes and remineralization of faeces and pseudofaeces and bottom up effects on predators and scavengers through mussel fall off however results are inconsistent between studies and hydrodynamic conditions and nutrient availability are thought to play an important role in the magnitude and the direction of the ecological effects of mussel culture on the surrounding ecosystem we used qualitative network models qnms to outline a general model that integrates these environmental conditions and 1 evaluated the ability of different model configurations to reproduce known responses to perturbations 2 analyzed the behaviour of key components to contrasting hydrodynamic and nutrient condition scenarios and 3 identified the most influential features of the derived scenarios the model that included uncertain linkages to characterize unknown relationships performed best based on predetermined validation criteria the addition of semi quantitative information on the relative strength of certain linkages improved accuracy and sign determinacy of outcomes the presence of suspended mussel culture negatively affected primary producers zooplankton and deposit feeders and had a positive effect on predators and scavengers especially in low energy environments hydrodynamic conditions were shown to have a major impact on the response of the community to mussel culture while nutrient availability had a very minor impact keywords qnms qualitative model food web trophic network mussel aquaculture shellfish aquaculture 1 introduction the world s growing demand for seafood has accelerated the development of the aquaculture industry which reached a total production of 80 million tonnes in 2016 including 16 1 million tonnes of bivalves fao 2018 in canada mussels are the most valuable bivalve aquaculture species and their production has almost doubled since the end of the 1990s dfo 2018 the rapid expansion of the sector has raised concerns about the ecological impacts of mussel farming as demonstrated by a quick search in isi web of science showing a greater than five fold increase in the annual number of scientific publications on the topic since 2000 i e from 65 in 2000 to 333 articles in 2018 unlike much of finfish culture which usually requires the addition of food to the ecosystem mussels consume naturally occurring phytoplankton and do not rely on external inputs of nutrients to the system however the addition of 1 a dense population of suspended filter feeders and 2 the associated physical structure to what are commonly otherwise soft sediment bottom areas has various direct and indirect effects on the local ecosystem mckindsey et al 2011 the grazing pressure of the high biomass in mussel culture may exert a top down control on their food source dame and prins 1997 filgueira and grant 2009 grant et al 2005 prins et al 1995 phytoplankton depletion can negatively affect mussel production and potentially natural populations of primary consumers grant et al 2005 while many studies have focused on the optimization of mussel densities to yield maximum production given a system s characteristics and resources filgueira and grant 2009 fréchette 2010 grant et al 2007 limited information is available on the consequences of mussel culture on zooplankton communities and other filter feeders lam hoai and rougier 2001 suggested that competition for food and predation by farmed shellfish could explain a biomass depletion of zooplankton near shellfish farms in the thau lagoon france but these assumptions remain to be confirmed phytoplankton filtration by cultured mussels may also increase water transparency lindahl et al 2005 schröder et al 2014 which may in turn promote microphytobenthic production newell et al 2002 microphytobenthos play an important role in shallow ecosystems by limiting nutrient fluxes from the sediment to the water column and providing a major food source and habitat to herbivores and predators macintyre et al 1996 miller et al 1996 mussels may also have a bottom up control on primary production through metabolic waste excretion and biodeposition of faeces and pseudofaeces cranford et al 2007 grant et al 1995 jansen 2012 prins et al 1998 direct excretion of dissolved metabolites may contribute significantly to the pool of nutrients released from a mussel farm holmer et al 2015 prins and smaal 1994 and enhance primary production ren et al 2010 benthic organic enrichment from biodeposition of particulate matter beneath mussel lines has been shown to stimulate mineralization rates and nutrient releases in the water column hargrave et al 2008 kaspar et al 1985 prins and smaal 1994 richard et al 2007 potentially increasing phytoplankton production prins et al 1995 oxygen consumption by microbial degradation of organic matter may lead to hypoxic or anoxic conditions in bottom waters and sulphide accumulation callier et al 2007 christensen et al 2003 cranford et al 2009 holmer et al 2015 richard et al 2006 while organically enriched environments may be beneficial to deposit feeders only a few species can tolerate hypoxic and sulphidic conditions callier et al 2007 diaz and rosenberg 1995 filter feeders are also thought to be sensitive to oxygen concentrations josefson and rosenberg 1988 stenton dozey et al 2001 stenton dozey et al 1999 fall off of mussels and associated organisms colonizing suspended culture ascidians bryozoans hydrozoans macroalgae etc is another bottom up process linked to mussel farming fréchette 2012 grant et al 1995 leonard 2004 mallet and carver 1991 matisson and lindén 1983 the addition of food to the bottom has been shown to attract benthic predators and scavengers such as starfish crabs gastropods and fish drouin et al 2015 d amours et al 2008 inglis and gust 2003 kaspar et al 1985 romero et al 1982 wilding and nickell 2013 an increased abundance of lobsters was also reported under mussel culture sites but a manipulative study showed that the presence of anchor blocks partly explained this observation drouin et al 2015 the introduction of physical farm structure to the bottom as well as to the water column in addition to the bivalves themselves as previously mentioned may also create favourable habitats for hard substrate species cultured mussels and the associated fauna may in turn attract pelagic predators such as fish and other large organisms callier et al 2018 and references therein the magnitude and direction of the ecological effects of shellfish aquaculture on ecosystems vary among studies ranging from undetectable or low e g crawford et al 2003 danovaro et al 2004 grant et al 1995 to significant e g callier et al 2008 drouin et al 2015 d amours et al 2008 giles et al 2006 kaspar et al 1985 and is greatly influenced by site bathymetry and hydrodynamic conditions chamberlain et al 2001 hartstein and stevens 2005 rudorff et al 2012 shallow areas characterized by weak currents have a low potential for dispersion and longer water residence times and are thus more subject to biodeposit accumulation and phytoplankton depletion than are deeper and high energy environments cranford et al 2008 hartstein and stevens 2005 in addition the availability of nutrients in the system may also influence the effects of mussel farming for example the contribution of mussel culture to nutrient pools in the water column through direct excretion may be of greater importance for primary production in oligotrophic than in eutrophic systems jansen et al 2012 similarly the influence of grazing pressure by farmed organisms in oligotrophic systems where phytoplankton biomass is typically low may have a greater effect than in eutrophic systems aure et al 2007 models are often used to assess the dynamics of aquaculture environment interactions e g filgueira et al 2015 mckindsey 2013 however while much work has been done toward examining particular aspects of bivalve culture such as dynamic energy budget deb models to evaluate mussel growth under various environmental conditions e g dabrowski et al 2013 filgueira et al 2018 maar et al 2015 and dispersion models to assess benthic loading mckindsey et al 2009 weise et al 2009 little is known about community wide responses to mussel culture under different hydrodynamic and nutrient availability conditions these causes and responses are diffuse and because the systems are open it is difficult to ascribe an observed response to a particular cause driven by the mussel culture operations quantitative trophic modelling approaches have been used to integrate direct and indirect effects of bivalve aquaculture on the surrounding ecosystem components byron et al 2011 kluger et al 2016 outeiro et al 2018 however these models do not easily allow the inclusion of variables that are not biomass pools and their site specific parameterization and data set requirements prevent their use at a broader scale and in data limited areas harvey et al 2016 reum et al 2015a qualitative network models qnms are an interesting alternative or complementary approach to quantitative methods in cases of data poor systems requiring only a qualitative understanding of the interactions between ecosystem components and allowing the explicit exploration of structural and parametric uncertainty melbourne thomas et al 2012 harvey et al 2016 sobocinski et al 2017 developed by levins 1974 and puccia and levins 1985 qnms have recently been used to explore various levels of biological organization this includes cellular level effects for osmotic stress in cancerous cells shorthouse et al 2018 to individuals and tumour development in people franke et al 2008 to population level effects and the decline of pacific salmon survival sobocinski et al 2017 to individual species or species group effects on the ecosystem goedegebuure et al 2017 to communities and the redistribution of reef species in eastern tasmania marzloff et al 2016 and to ecosystem level effects and causative drivers of changes in the black sea ecosystem bodini et al 2018 qnms also provide a tool for a more integrated perspective of the system enabling analysis of food web dynamics while incorporating potential effects of diverse processes such as external forcings harvey et al 2016 sobocinski et al 2017 which is potentially more useful in systems with a diverse set of drivers and responses for which quantitative data are rare in addition qnms may also be used to evaluate sobocinski et al 2017 marzloff et al 2016 different management strategies on the ecological and social attributes of systems as has been shown for salmon harvey et al 2016 for a variety of fisheries species zador et al 2017 to undertake integrated ecosystem assessments depiper et al 2017 and to guide the development of zoning site selection and area management plans for aquaculture corner and aguilar manjarrez 2017 with respect to aquaculture enms have been used to evaluate community wide responses to various bivalve cultivation effort scenarios reum et al 2015a and impact of ocean acidification on a shellfish producing estuary on the usa west coast reum et al 2015b building on this we use qnms to explore responses of eastern canada coastal ecosystems to the addition of suspended mussel culture under contrasting hydrodynamic and nutrient availability scenarios more specifically we developed a qnm and compared the ability of alternative versions to reproduce known responses to perturbations analyzed the behaviour of key components of the system and identified which aspect of the scenarios had the most influence on outcomes i e the response of benthic species we also present a new method to include weighting of forcings variables to provide further information in the approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and conceptual model the conceptual ecosystem model was constructed based on knowledge gathered from the literature on the influence of mussel aquaculture on the ecosystem with a focus on studies conducted in eastern canada in 2017 mussel production in canada approached 25 000 tonnes of which 82 came from the 4 500 ha of mussel leases on prince edward island dfo 2018 mussel culture activities in eastern canada have also developed in newfoundland and labrador nova scotia and québec farmed mussel species include mytilus edulis and to a lesser extent m trossulus in eastern canada mussel aquaculture is mainly practiced using suspended culture on off bottom longline systems in shallow bays and inlets that are generally characterized by soft substrate clynick et al 2008 mussels are grown on lines or in mesh socks 2 or 3 m in length and suspended approximately 30 to 50 cm apart from 100 to 200 m long backlines mussel density is usually maintained at 1 10 to 2 06 kg m2 comeau et al 2008 the backlines anchored at both ends and floated by buoys are typically spaced by 10 to 20 m wide corridors drapeau et al 2006 drouin et al 2015 guyondet et al 2016 a series of ropes legs attached to the backlines at regular intervals and fixed by block anchors on the seafloor are used to control the position of the backline in the water column by adjusting their number and length mckindsey et al 2011 the conceptual ecosystem model was created using the directed graphing software dia v 0 97 2 this took the form of a signed digraph in which nodes variables are connected by edges linkages characterizing the sign of direct effects positive negative or neutral of the components on one another puccia and levins 1985 and is readily interpretable in subsequent analyses we sought to build a holistic model of a coastal ecosystem incorporating key ecological groups and interactions to assess the behaviour of its components in response to the presence or absence of mussel culture fig 1 the nodes currents and depth and their associated linkages were included to allow simulation of low and high energy environments while the node nutrients allowed simulations of nutrient rich eutrophic and nutrient poor oligotrophic conditions functionally similar species were grouped in a single variable to simplify the model reduce prediction uncertainty and generalize its application to other geographic areas the node mussels et al comprises suspended mussel culture and associated fouling communities such as ascidians bryozoans hydrozoans and macroalgae which were combined given their coexistence and dependence of the latter on the former fish and birds were excluded from the model which focused mainly on vagile benthic macroinvertebrates further because the main objective of the study was to explore the impact of mussel aquaculture on the ecosystem we wanted to control the variable mussels et al to obtain contrasted results and thus did not consider variables that could affect this node the relationships between the variables were defined as positive negative or null based on the existing literature dashed linkages indicate weak or uncertain linkages all linkages pointing to benthic filter feeders were weak except for the linkage from mussels et al since their high abundance on the bottom of mussel culture sites depends mostly on fall off from suspended lines descriptions of the interactions included in the model are provided in supplementary data table s1 because the objective was to explore the impact of mussel culture on the dynamics of the ecosystem the node mussels et al varied only when we directly applied a sustained press perturbation negative self effects were added to all variables to account for self regulation and the potential effect of other variables that were not represented in the model dambacher et al 1999 puccia and levins 1985 2 2 qualitative network models qnms the approach used to analyze the behaviour of the model was first developed by levins 1974 and puccia and levins 1985 to analyze the contribution of feedbacks in network models the first step consists of converting signed digraphs obtained from conceptual models into their mathematically equivalent community interaction matrix wherein the rate of change of a variable of the system can be described as a continuous function of one or more variables levins 1974 puccia and levins 1985 the dynamics of n interacting variables is represented as a system of differential equations of the form d x i d t f x 1 x 2 x n c 1 c 2 c m where the rate of change in variable xi is a function of one or more variables in the system and their rate parameters ci the community matrix a is composed of interaction coefficients aij describing the effect of a small change in the level of variable j on the level of variable i and defined by the partial derivative aij fi xj evaluated at the equilibrium puccia and levins 1985 the negative inverse of the community matrix a 1 can be used to estimate the direction of changes in system equilibrium i e responses of the variables resulting from a press perturbation of one or more rate parameters c puccia and levins 1985 while quantitative specification of a is often difficult to achieve in ecology and quantitative predictions based on the inverse community matrix can be overly sensitive to small changes in interaction values aij dambacher et al 2002 the qualitative specification of a only requires the signs of the non zero aij terms i e 1 1 allowing the inclusion of variables that are difficult to measure or quantify or about which little information is available levins 1974 puccia and levins 1985 qualitative predictions of press perturbation impacts can be obtained from the calculation of system feedbacks if all feedback loops have the same sign the predicted response is unambiguous however if multiple feedback loops of opposite sign contribute to the response which is generally the case in complex ecosystem models the qualitative prediction may have high sign indeterminacy dambacher et al 2003 to address this situation raymond et al 2011 followed by melbourne thomas et al 2012 developed a probabilistic simulation based approach to predict the direction of change in the level of each variable to a press perturbation and an estimation of the level of sign determinacy the first step consists in generating a predefined number of matrices by assigning a random value to each non zero interaction coefficients aij of the community matrix from a uniform distribution values from 1 to 1 in the presence of uncertain linkages which represent unknown or weak interactions between variables their inclusion in each community matrix is determined by sampling from a binomial distribution each generated matrix is tested against stability criteria melbourne thomas et al 2012 and unstable matrices are discarded additional validation criteria can be applied to constrain the matrices to only those correctly predicting the responses of one or more variables to a previously observed perturbation scenario melbourne thomas et al 2012 raymond et al 2011 for each retained matrix the negative inverse matrix is calculated these steps are repeated until the predefined number of matrices is reached the sign of the response of each variable to a press perturbation is then summarized for the retained matrices and a distribution of outcomes is produced sign determinacy is calculated as the proportion of positive negative and neutral responses of the variables divided by the number of stable and if applicable validated matrices the qpress package http rforge net qpress provides many tools to explore qnms in r r core team 2018 starting from the conversion of conceptual digraphs into community matrices to evaluating the impact of press perturbations through simulations melbourne thomas et al 2012 here a similar approach was used to interpret the conceptual model and perform analyses with custom modifications and extensions of the qpress codes including the ability to add validation criteria based on semi quantitative information about the relative strength of linkages for example if evidence indicates that a14 is stronger than a23 then randomly generated matrices that do not reproduce this behaviour are discarded this addition helps to further constrain the resulting community matrices by including more information on the system even if the data only partially cover the components thereby reducing uncertainty and improving sign determinacy and robustness of the subsequent analyses 2 3 model simulations and analyses responses of the community to the presence of suspended mussel culture was assessed under four scenarios of environmental conditions defined by nutrient availability nutrient rich or nutrient poor area and hydrodynamic conditions low energy or high energy environment table 1 a positive perturbation was applied to the node mussels et al to simulate the presence of mussel culture the inclusion of contrasting trophic states in the scenarios which was achieved either by negatively or positively pressing the node nutrients broadens the application of the model to different geographic areas e g oligotrophic lagoons in îles de la madeleine québec canada trottet et al 2007 andeutrophic bays in prince edward island canada cranford et al 2009 and assesses the effects of nutrient enrichment enhanced by human population growth bricker et al 2008 on the components of the model similarly the inclusion of contrasting hydrodynamic conditions simulated either by negatively or positively pressing the nodes currents and depth for low energy or high energy environments respectively simulates the hydrodynamic regimes and bathymetry that could mitigate the accumulation of biodeposit on the seafloor hartstein and stevens 2005 and for the expansion of aquaculture to offshore environments jansen et al 2016 troell et al 2009 the outcomes of these scenarios were compared for three model configurations an uncertain model in which all linkages were set as uncertain a certain model in which all linkages were set as certain and a hybrid model in which only known weaker or unknown linkages based on documented effects of a high biomass of suspended mussels on the environment and on the main predators diet were marked as uncertain figure 1 in addition we analyzed the behaviour of these three model configurations under four levels of simulation constraints starting with a no constraint b two a priori validation criteria corresponding to known responses of particular variables to the addition of suspended mussel culture namely 1 an increase in benthic filter feeders due to mussel fall off fréchette 2012 leonard 2004 and 2 an increase in benthic organic enrichment in low energy conditions due to biodeposition grant et al 1995 prins et al 1998 c semi quantitative information on the relative strength of certain linkages table 2 and d a combination of b and c the models were further validated with two a posteriori validation criteria based on field observations of increased densities of crabs and starfish within mussel farms compared with control sites drouin et al 2015 d amours et al 2008 inglis and gust 2003 romero et al 1982 the effect of the number of simulation matrices 1 000 5 000 and 10 000 on the outcomes was also tested to evaluate consistency in the results following the approach of sobocinski et al 2017 we considered the effect of a perturbation to be clearly positive or negative when the percentage of the positive or negative outcomes among simulation matrices or sign consistency was 80 the effect was considered weak when sign consistency was 60 80 and ambiguous when sign consistency was 60 sign consistency is therefore a measure of the certainty in relationships among nodes to compare outcomes among scenarios we calculated pearson correlations of the results of all variables in each scenario in the presence of suspended mussel culture using the hmisc package version 4 2 0 harrell jr 2019 in r the results were visualized using correlation plots next we used the vegan package version 2 5 4 oksanen et al 2015 to explore the relative influence of each aspect of the scenarios i e presence or absence of suspended mussel culture hydrodynamic conditions and nutrient availability on variable responses we first performed a non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis based on distance matrices calculated from the bray curtis index to visualize the spread and position of the outcomes of all scenarios on an ordination plot we compared the results from a permutational analysis of variance permanova and an analysis of similarities anosim to test the significance of scenario differences in community wide responses and to confirm the results observed in the nmds plot finally we determined which scenarios differed from each other significantly by performing pairwise comparisons using permanova with corrections for multiple testing 3 results 3 1 model evaluation the final qnm had 20 nodes and 101 linkages of which 16 were considered uncertain in the hybrid model we started the analysis by generating 1 000 simulation matrices for each model configuration and explored the application of the four levels of simulation constraints on the outcomes of the scenarios table 1 while obtaining simulation matrices without any constraint besides the stability criteria and with two a priori validation criteria required on average three and nine times the number of simulations desired respectively the application of the 31 semi quantitative pieces of information on the relative strength of linkages required 3 74 107 and 5 65 107 simulations to obtain 1 000 valid simulation matrices for the certain and uncertain models respectively when both a priori validation criteria and semi quantitative information were applied this number jumped to 1 32 108 and 2 04 108 for the certain and uncertain models respectively to generate 1 000 valid simulation matrices for the hybrid model the application of semi quantitative information required approximately 4 5 106 simulations and the combination with a priori validation criteria required approximately 8 106 simulations inspection of the weights defining all community matrices for each model configuration and each level of simulation constraints revealed no anomalies results not shown for the certain model configuration none of the levels of simulation constraints applied led to the expected behaviour of an increase in crabs and starfish in the presence of suspended mussel culture as stated by our two a posteriori validation criteria figure s1a while most responses were weak sign consistency from 60 80 or ambiguous sign consistency 60 these two predators instead showed a trend towards the opposite behaviour in the case of the uncertain model most outcomes were neutral when no validation criterion was applied except for the pressed nodes and the variable dispersion which was directly related to pressed nodes figures 1 and s1b sequential application of the other levels of simulation constraints resulted in a directional response for most variables while the response of starfish followed the expected behaviour defined by our a posteriori validation criteria when both a priori criteria and information on the relative strength of linkages were applied figure s1b column d the response of crabs was not consistent among scenarios and tended to decrease in high energy nutrient poor conditions overall the responses of dispersion oxygen zooplankton light deposit feeders and herbivorous gastropods were consistent among model configurations especially for the outcomes obtained from the third and fourth levels of simulation constraints i e with semi quantitative information on the relative strength of certain linkages and with both semi quantitative information and two a priori validation criteria while the response of starfish and crabs was ambiguous in high energy scenarios the outcomes obtained from the hybrid model best matched our two a posteriori validation criteria when simulation constraints were applied especially when using both a priori validation criteria and semi quantitative information about the relative strength of some linkages figure s1c since the hybrid model was the best configuration based on our two a posteriori validation criteria and given the great amount of time required to obtain simulations for the certain and uncertain model configurations with semi quantitative information criteria ca 100 hours for 1 000 valid simulation matrices on an intel xeon cpu e5 2650 v4 at 2 20ghz the effect of the number of simulations was only assessed for the hybrid model since the outcomes from using 1 000 5 000 and 10 000 simulation matrices showed little differences except for phytoplankton whose sign determinacy increased with 5 000 and 10 000 simulations figure s2 we used 1 000 simulation matrices for subsequent analyses to reduce computation time 3 2 outcomes with suspended mussel culture we report outcomes generated from the hybrid model for the four scenarios from 1 000 simulation matrices validated a priori using the fourth level of validation constraints as well as a posteriori with two additional validation criteria the response of the four pressed nodes corresponded to the press perturbation applied on them but in the case of currents and nutrients whose responses also depended on one or many other nodes the outcomes were not always as clear as for depth and mussels et al which were not sensitive to the variation of any other nodes figure 2 results for depth and mussels et al are not shown for simplicity positive outcomes were observed in all scenarios for biodeposits benthic filter feeders starfish crabs and lobsters the positive response of biodeposits starfish crabs and lobsters had higher sign consistency in low energy environments the responses of starfish and crabs were ambiguous in high energy environments predatory gastropods increased in nutrient rich environments but their responses were ambiguous in nutrient poor environments currents oxygen bioturbation phytoplankton zooplankton light microphytobenthos and deposit feeders responded negatively to all scenarios but in the case of oxygen the outcomes were ambiguous in high energy environments dispersion increased in high energy environments and conversely decreased in low energy environments herbivorous gastropods showed the opposite behaviour with a negative response in high energy environments and a positive response in low energy environments the simulated effect of suspended mussel culture on remineralization was ambiguous in all scenarios community wide responses to the four scenarios showed high correlations for outcomes from similar hydrodynamic conditions figure 3 r 0 8 p 0 001 for high energy environments and r 0 7 p 0 001 for low energy environments no significant trend was detected between scenarios with the same nutrient availability for subsequent analyses to further evaluate the influence of each aspect of the scenarios on variable responses including the effect of suspended mussel culture we used the data obtained by positively and negatively pressing the node mussels et al for both hydrodynamic and nutrient conditions nmds analysis showed separation between scenarios of contrasting hydrodynamic conditions as well as between scenarios simulating the presence or absence of suspended mussel culture but the ellipses representing the 95 confidence interval around the centroid overlapped for scenarios simulating the same nutrient availability figure 4 the anosim r 0 525 p 0 001 and permanova r2 0 506 p 0 001 analyses confirmed the differences among groups pairwise comparisons revealed that all outcomes differed significantly between scenarios p 0 028 but that the percentage of variation explained by the scenarios varied the presence or absence of suspended mussel culture explained ca 39 of the variation between scenarios with the same hydrodynamic and nutrient conditions hydrodynamic conditions explained ca 25 of the variation between scenarios with the same nutrient conditions and nutrient conditions explained ca 1 of the variation between scenarios with the same hydrodynamic conditions 4 discussion the world wide rapid expansion of bivalve aquaculture requires better understanding of its impacts on ecosystems however comprehensive studies are often limited by the difficulty of acquiring data due to fieldwork logistics and budgetary limitations qnms constitute a promising approach to assess the behaviour of complex models under different perturbation scenarios requiring only a qualitative understanding of the components and their interactions the initial step enables collaboration of diverse experts and stakeholders to create conceptual models visually and intuitively illustrating their understanding of a system while reaching a common perspective may at times represent a challenge when involving multiple parties with different backgrounds salliou et al 2017 the approach easily allows the analysis of different model versions and the integration of uncertain relationship between components furthermore the flexibility of qnms which only require knowledge of the direction of relationships make the inclusion of various types of variables ecological social economic etc possible even for components that are difficult to quantify such as the sense of place variable included in harvey et al 2016 to account for human well being in the assessment of different management strategies on salmon populations under poor environmental conditions their flexible configuration and parameterization broaden their application to different regions which is often challenging for quantitative site specific parametrized models reum et al 2015a one drawback of this method is the high sign indeterminacy of the predictions generated by complex models that include multiple feedbacks with opposing directions dambacher et al 2003 sign determinacy could be improved using quantitative data on the strength of the relationships between system components reum et al 2015a although qnms are often used to assess data limited systems here we chose a trade off between strictly qualitative and quantitative model parameterization adding when available information on the relative strength of interactions between variables we showed that this addition increases sign determinacy especially when combined to a priori validation criteria while the outcomes of the certain model configuration did not follow the two a posteriori validation criteria the outcomes of the uncertain model configuration showed encouraging results however the responses of many variables even under the highest level of simulation constraints remained unclear the addition of semi quantitative information on the relative strength of more linkages could improve these results but the computing time would increase significantly the concept of a hybrid model combining certain linkages with well established relationships and uncertain linkages with weak or unknown relationships considerably reduces the computing time relative to model configurations built exclusively with either certain or uncertain linkages comparing outcomes of the model configurations also highlighted the importance of using a posteriori validation criteria from which we selected the model version that best reflected the results obtained from the literature thus increasing our confidence in prediction accuracy this study explored impacts of suspended mussel culture on coastal ecosystems while considering hydrodynamic and nutrient conditions of the area which have previously been identified as key factors influencing the magnitude of the response of system components chamberlain et al 2001 hartstein and stevens 2005 jansen 2012 rudorff et al 2012 consideration of these factors broadens application of the results to various geographic areas and is also relevant in the context of offshore aquaculture development to overcome nearshore spatial conflicts gentry et al 2017 jansen et al 2016 based on our final model configuration results from pairwise permanova analyses suggested that hydrodynamic conditions have more impact than nutrient availability on the influence of mussel culture on the ecosystem this was also illustrated by contrasting response direction between hydrodynamic conditions for certain variables or higher response sign determinacy in low energy environments for others and is consistent with previous studies comparing sites with contrasting hydrodynamic regimes hartstein and stevens 2005 rudorff et al 2012 analysis of our model suggests that the presence of mussel culture has a negative impact on phytoplankton regardless of hydrodynamic and nutrient conditions the stress that mussel culture exerts on phytoplankton is well documented in eutrophic areas dame and prins 1997 grant et al 2005 maar et al 2008 petersen et al 2008 but an increase in phytoplankton due to the contribution of mussel culture to the nutrient pool through metabolic waste and biodeposit remineralization has been hypothesized in oligotrophic regions jansen et al 2011 our results imply that the expected stimulation of primary production caused by the presence of mussel culture is insufficient to compensate for grazing pressure highlighting the relevance of carrying capacity studies before establishing of new mussel leases similarly zooplankton responded negatively to all four scenarios of mussel culture which can be explained by both the reduction in their source of food phytoplankton and direct consumption of zooplankton by the cultured mussels this result is consistent with the few studies reporting the effect of mussel grazing on zooplankton communities maar et al 2007 maar et al 2008 while the effect of grazing was thought to promote microphytobenthic production newell et al 2002 our model suggested a decrease in microphytobenthos most probably caused by the feeding pressure of benthic filter feeders as well as light reduction in high energy environments simulating deeper hence darker sites this negative response was not compensated by the increased nutrient pool in nutrient rich areas studies on the effect of mussel culture on microphytobenthos are scarce and more data are needed to validate the results obtained from our model directly linked to microphytobenthos which are a source of food miller et al 1996 deposit feeders responded negatively to all scenarios of mussel culture predation pressure from crabs and starfish could also partially explain this result although the strength of these linkages was considered weak another explanation is the ambiguous response of biodeposits in high energy environments mitigated by dispersion and the decrease in oxygen in low flow environments most likely explained by low dispersion and the ambiguous response of remineralization and bioturbation studies of infaunal communities under suspended mussel farms showed similar results in response to organic enrichment callier et al 2009 grant et al 1995 matisson and lindén 1983 but little effect was observed where biodeposit accumulation was low danovaro et al 2004 the addition of information on the relative strength of more linkages involving deposit feeders may help capture the behaviour of this variable the response of herbivorous gastropods was negative in high energy environments and positive in low energy environments even though the abundance of most of their predators increased this observation is contrary to results obtained from scallop bottom culture modelling in sechura bay peru kluger et al 2016 the positive response of herbivorous gastropods in low energy environments probably reflects the outcomes obtained for biodeposits the presence of suspended mussel culture had a positive effect on most macroinvertebrate predators crabs lobsters and starfish especially in low energy environments i e in shallow areas where currents are weak the abundance of epifauna associated with suspended culture colonizing shells and aquaculture gear as well as mussel fall off underneath farms provide food and are thought to explain the high densities of scavengers and carnivorous species drouin et al 2015 d amours et al 2008 inglis and gust 2003 kaspar et al 1985 romero et al 1982 wilding and nickell 2013 however for lobsters drouin et al 2015 demonstrated that the provision of shelter by anchor blocks may have a greater influence than does mussel fall off on their abundance the response of crabs and starfish was unclear in high energy environments i e in deeper areas where currents are stronger which is most likely due to the negative response of deposit feeders and herbivorous gastropods both present in their diet an observational study at an offshore longline mussel farm in îles de la madeleine showed that scavenging and predatory species were much more abundant inside of a farm than outside of it with the abundance of most scavengers being particularly high directly below lines where mussels fall mckindsey unpublished results likewise based on previous studies in various rias in spain crab populations are expected to increase in the presence of mussel culture even in areas more exposed to oceanic currents romero et al 1982 tenore et al 1985 similarly the wide vertical distribution of starfish such as asterias spp which were found at depths of more than 300 m franz et al 1981 and the report of their high incidence on mussel farm sites drouin et al 2015 inglis and gust 2003 suggest that starfish populations are also likely to increase in high energy environments predatory gastropods also responded positively to the presence of mussel culture in scenarios simulating nutrient rich areas but their response was unclear in nutrient poor areas their presence was described in mussel farms located in sheltered shallow bays in nova scotia and prince edward island d amours et al 2008 grant et al 1995 and on the west coast of south africa stenton dozey et al 1999 but to date there is no report of their presence in mussel culture sites located in nutrient poor regions in our model predatory gastropods were influenced by many variables which can lead to low sign determinacy dambacher et al 2003 more information about the relative strength of linkages related to variables with ambiguous results might help elucidate the direction of their response 5 conclusion qnms provide an affordable rapid and effective tool to assess outcomes of perturbations or restoration efforts on ecosystems and thus represent a promising research and integrative management approach the development of one or several versions of a conceptual model allows the integration of multiple sources of information and the collaboration of diverse parties which may facilitate reaching a consensual understanding of the system further the use of qualitative descriptors of the relationships included in a model allows the consideration of variables that are difficult to quantify such as human well being our study demonstrated the great value of qnms particularly in a data poor system to evaluate different scenarios of ecosystem components while the complexity of relationships among variables made some responses ambiguous the addition of information on the relative strength of key linkages may improve sign determinacy further our model was designed to represent a general coastal ecosystem refinement of the variables and the inclusion of more environmental parameters would probably lead to different outcomes since mussel culture is more frequent in relatively enclosed areas gentry et al 2017 data on macroinvertebrate communities under offshore mussel culture is scarce and thus our results for high energy environment were difficult to corroborate however our model provides predictions that could orient future investigations credit authorship contribution statement nathalie l forget conceptualization methodology software validation

24827,a numerical coupling of a dynamic biogeochemical model b witch and a model of forest balance water biljou was used to simulate the concentration of major species within soil profiles from two contrasted ecosystems beech and spruce stands located in the vosges mountains and their evolution during decades this coupled modelling allows an important vertical discretization of water and cation cycle and a direct comparison with the hydrological and geochemical data available over twenty five years and on a seasonal basis the processes controlling the past evolution of soil solution chemistry have been identified and tested the biogeochemical cycles of cations estimated on the two sites shows that the biological fluxes control up to 70 for ca and mg and up to 95 k of the chemical composition of the soil solutions the ca and mg concentrations decrease over the last decades which can be explained by the evolution of atmospheric inputs and by the behavior of the exchange complex this paper highlights the weak contribution of mineral dissolution and the key role of biological recycling and cation exchange processes in the soil solution signatures the future sustainability of

water cycle was greatly simplified the aim of this study is to use a numerical coupling of a dynamic biogeochemical model b witch and a water balance model dedicated to forest ecosystems biljou in

description 2 1 1 1 climate and hyrdology the strengbach basin is a small watershed of 0 8 km2 surface area located in the vosges mountains france and subjected to oceanic mountainous climate fig 1 since 1986 climatic hydrological and geochemical parameters have been recorded the mean annual air temperature and precipitation over 1986 2015 period are 6 c and 1380 mm respectively pierret et al 2019 the catchment is characterized by elevation ranging from 883 m to 1146 m with a mean slope of 15 the mean annual water export is 806 mm with variations ranged from 525 to 1148 mm yr from 1986 to 2015 pierret et al 2018 the outlet discharges varied between 1 to 400 ls 1 with highest runoff occurring in cold period especially during snow melt events whereas the lowest flows are in summer season

part of catchment is characterized by hydrothermal alteration more important than the northern part el gh mari 1995 fichter et al 1998 the altered granite displays a depletion of biotite albite and muscovite and larger quantities of quartz illite and hematite caused by hydrothermal weathering process a small band of gneiss in contact with the granite appears at the northern top of the watershed the thickness of saprolite is spatially very heterogeneous and can reach 10 m depth el gh mari 1995 the soils are generally 1 m thick and varied from brown acidic to ochreous podzolic series the brown soils are mainly located on the high altitude part of the northern slope and are characterized by higher clay content higher cec and lower ph and organic matter than the ochreous podzolic soils

the northern slope and belongs to the alocrisol type brown acidic soil while the soil profile sampled at the beech plot hp site elevation 1000 m is located on the southern slope and belongs to the ochreous podzol type ochreous brown podzolic soil the main characteristics of the soil horizons are listed in the table 1 2 2 modeling description in this section the model cascade between lpj and witch models is described followed by a brief description of the witch and lpj models including the model inputs and outputs used in this study fig 2 2 2 1 the b witch model the b witch model is a coupling between a numerical code describing the chemical weathering of the continental surfaces witch and a global dynamic vegetation model lpj this model cascade has been described in previous studies roelandt et al 2010 beaulieu et al 2010 2012 and applied at different spatial scale from soil profile beaulieu et al 2010 to catchment scale beaulieu et al 2011 2012 and under different climatic conditions from artic climate beaulieu et al 2012 to tropical climate roelandt et al 2010 the principle of b witch model is the use of lpj model to calculate the cation fluxes exchange between the vegetation and the soil profile and the co2 pressure in the soil derived from the heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration these fluxes are then transferred to a process based model where the dissolution precipitation processes of minerals are estimated in the weathering profile the soil profile is divided into fifteen layers thickness 10cm each the uptake and release of cations by leaving and dead biomass in the soil layers are estimated from the vegetation productivity and element carbon ratios drever 1997 ca2 c 0 005 mg2 c 0 00125 so4 2 c 0 00125 k c 0 0025 p c 0 00125 al c 0

description the lund potsdam jena model lpj is a global dynamic biospheric model able to estimate the carbon and water fluxes exchanged between land and atmosphere through a mechanistic representation of vegetal cover dynamics this model takes into account vegetation structure dynamic competition between the plant functional types and the soil biogeochemistry the lpj model is derived from the biome family of models haxeltine and prentice 1996 kaplan 2001 sitch et al 2003 in which bioclimatic limits have been introduced the model includes ten plant functional types eight forests and two herbaceous environments with physiological and morphological parameters and bioclimatic limits these characteristics determine the presence absence and the fractional coverage of each plant functional type the lpj model is divided into two soil layers a superficial layer up to 0 5 m and a deep layer from 0 5 to 1 5 m the lpj model is able to reproduce the water and carbon exchanges with the atmosphere on the seasonal time scale on different environments lucht et al 2002 sitch et al 2003 gerten et al 2004 and the vegetation distribution on the strengbach catchment beaulieu et al 2016 the

the chemical composition of the water in each soil layer as a function of time on a seasonal time step the chemical budget of the soil solution is calculated at each time step 3 d z θ c i d t f i n f

witch model allows to estimate the evolution of the concentration of each cation in the solution of each soil layer fig 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 observed trends over the 1992 2011 period throughfall and soil solutions at hp and vp sites 3 1 1 throughfalls the long term trends in the chemical compositions and fluxes of the atmospheric input under vp and hp throughfalls stand have been studied and discussed recently pierret et al 2019 and we resume here the general outlines significant decreases in the concentrations and fluxes of several ions were observed h and so4 2 cl and ca2 in open field precipitation and throughfalls the regular and strong decrease in protons and sulfate followed the decreases in anthropogenic so2 and nox emissions since the 1980s the annual calcium fluxes were also reduced by 40 and 70 from approximately 15 to 9 and 6 to 2 kg ha 1 under vp and hp respectively as a consequence of the reductions in anthropogenic industrial dust the canopy cover had significant and various impacts on the water and elemental fluxes atmospheric deposition and biological interactions via leaching or uptake processes on leaf surfaces may be influenced by the type of tree the geometry of the canopy lai age density etc as well as the leaf persistence during the whole year as a result the concentrations and fluxes of elements coming mainly or partly from atmospheric dry deposits na cl no3 ca2 mg2 so4 2 and nh4 were notably higher under vp than under hp the ph in throughfalls under vp is significantly lower than under hp pierret et al 2019 3 1 2 soil solution despite the fact that the soil solutions were monitored discontinuously significant long term trend can be identified over the 1992 2012 period and especially through the continuous record since 2004 as presented in prunier et al 2015 and ackerer et al 2018 these different long term trends are described in more detail below 3 1 2 1 cations for na no significant trend has been determined in the soil solution at the hp stand nor at 5 cm depth at the vp site table 5 this is in accordance with the results obtained for the throughfalls where no significant trend was found pierret et al 2019 moreover the na concentration is stable at 60 cm depth at the vp site since 2000s for k ca and mg significant decreases were observed over time in the soil solutions at each depth of the two plots table 5 these elements may have several origins atmospheric deposits canopy exchange biological recycling soil cationic exchange and mineral dissolution and may be impacted by biological uptake and secondary mineral precipitation goddéris et al 2006 pierret et al 2018 chabaux et al 2019 for ca the decrease in soil solution may be partly related to the decrease of ca atmospheric inputs reported by pierret et al 2019 at both sites over the same period however it does not apply for k at both sites and mg at vp sites since the concentrations and fluxes of these elements in atmospheric deposition increased or remained stable during this period moreover the decline of ca and k concentrations in the soil solutions was more pronounced in the deepest layers than in the topsoil at the vp site and to a lesser extent at the hp site suggesting that another process occurs we may hypothesis i a progressive emptying of the cationic exchange capacity over the 1991 2012 period and or ii the decrease of global dissolution processes in the deepest soil layers related to the decrease of proton concentrations see equation table 3 however this second hypothesis is not consistent with the stable of na concentrations observed in the soil solutions the cationic exchanges in soils are controlled by complex equilibrium reactions and competition between cations the numerical simulations performed with the b witch model helped in understanding the temporal changes observed in the soil solution at both sites see next section 3 1 2 2 silicia silica is a neutral molecule h4sio4 not involved in these types of cationic reactions and is not supplied by atmospheric deposits with insignificant si concentrations in rain or throughfalls however significant and important decrease of si concentrations have been monitored at both depths at vp as well as at hp at 10 cm depth table 5 this temporal evolution may be explained by some chemical reaction implying secondary minerals as clays or a modification over time of the biological cycle recycling vs uptake prunier et al 2015 schmitt et al 2017 chabaux et al 2019 once again the numerical simulations presented hereafter helped in understanding the behavior of si in these two soil profiles 3 2 simulated evolution of cation concentrations by b witch model on the vp and hp sites the reference simulations are performed on vp and hp sites and the mean annual results are compared to the measured chemical composition of soil solutions at 10 and 60 cm depth for vp site and at 5 and 70 cm depth for hp site over 1987 2011 period the model seems able to reproduce the ph except for vp over the last years and the trends and concentration levels for na ca2 mg2 and h4sio4 over the study period at both sites figs 3 and 4 except for aqueous silica underestimated at 10 cm depth on the hp site fig 4 the simulated mean annual ph is close to the measured value 3 7 vs 4 2 at 5 cm and 4 6 vs 4 9 at 60 cm on the vp site and 3 9 vs 4 2 at 10 cm and 5 0 vs 4 9 at 70 cm on the hp site however the slight increase of the measured ph is not well reproduced by the model on the vp site over the ten last years the measured decrease of mg2 concentration is reproduced by the model that simulates a decrease of 0 7 μmol l yr at 5 and 60 cm depths under vp fig 3 and a decrease of 0 3 μmol l yr at 10 and 70 cm depths under hp fig 4 however the simulated mg decrease is underestimated by a factor of about 2 at the hp plot the model also reproduced the decrease of ca2 concentration in the soil solution but the magnitude was lower than for the measurements especially in the deepest layers a 3 5 fold simulated decrease vs a 6 7 fold measured decrease on the vp site and a 1 6 fold simulated decrease vs a 4 4 fold measured decrease on the hp site the decrease in mg2 and ca2 concentrations under vp seems to be related to leaching from the exchange complex with a simulated decrease of soil ca and mg content on the cec in the soil layers for ca2 this decrease may also be related to the decrease of ca2 concentration in throughfall from 50 to 30 μmol l and previously discussed however the simulated leaching from the exchange complex is not significant enough to reproduce the decrease of ca2 and mg2 in the soil solutions under hp the decrease in mg2 and ca2 concentrations is only related to the decrease of ca2 and mg2 concentration in the throughfall over the last two decades because the behavior of exchange complex surface is stable the simulated na concentrations remain stable over time and are close to the measured concentrations in the soil solutions at the both sites the simulated evolutions of k concentrations are characterized by different trends between the two sites a decrease at the hp plot fig 4 and an increase followed by a decrease at the vp plot fig 3 the model simulates an increase of the number of occupied sites by potassium on exchange complex and then a decrease at the vp site while it simulates a continuous increase over the studied period at the hp site moreover the k concentration in throughfall increases from 26 μmol l to 146 μmol l over 1987 2003 period then decreases down to 24 μmol l on the vp site while it increases by about 100 over 1992 2011 period at the hp site related to an increased amount of biomass pierret et al 2019 the simulated decrease of k concentrations at the hp site may be related to the evolution observed in the throughfall and to the behavior of exchange complex and the simulated increase then decrease at the vp site may be only related to evolution observed in the throughfall despite these results the b witch model does not reproduce the decline of potassium concentration measured in the hp site and overestimates the k concentration by a factor of 4 at 5cm depth and by a factor of 7 at 60 cm depth at the end of simulation at the vp site discussed in the section 3 4 the simulated so4 2 concentration decreases from 80 to 20 μmol l under vp and from 40 to 20 μmol l under hp in accordance with the decrease reported by measurements from 58 to 9 μmol l at 5 cm depth on the vp site and from 31 to 13 μmol l on the hp site however the stable so4 2 concentration measured at 60 cm depth under vp is not reproduced by the model this discrepancy could be explained by sulfate desorption not taken into account in the model occurring at the bottom of the soil profile and acting as a source of sulfate van der heijden et al 2011 thereby stabilizing the so4 2 concentration at 60 cm depth since the early 2000s the simulated and measured h4sio4 concentration are at steady state in the soil surface layers of two sites with a simulated mean annual concentration of 44 μmol l vs 60 μmol measured at 5 cm depth and 36 μmol l vs 92 μmol l measured at 10 cm depth on the vp and hp sites respectively figs 3 and 4 the underestimation of the h4sio4 concentration in the topsoil could thus be explain by the contribution of a biological source not taken into account in the model indeed several studies highlight an important contribution of phytoliths dissolution to silicon export flux up to 85 in deciduous forest ecosystem bartoli 1983 meunier et al 2003 gerard et al 2008 otherwise the b witch model predicts a slightly decrease of h4sio4 concentration at 60 cm under vp in accordance with the evolution measured thanks to the lysimetric plates however the simulated concentration is overestimated by a factor of 1 7 at 60 cm depth this overestimation could be related to the si uptake by plants in the root zone not simulated in the b witch model or an overestimation of the chemical weathering the h4sio4 concentrations are mainly controlled by chemical weathering processes in the soil profile the simulated weathering profile shows that all secondary and primary phases dissolve down to 60 cm depth except illite that precipitates in the deepest soil layer figs 5 and 6 the silicon budget is largely controlled by the interaction between secondary minerals and soil solutions and by the soil acidity indeed the dissolution rates of secondary phases are one order of magnitude higher than that of primary minerals and are higher in the surface soil layers than in the deep layers the montmorillonite and illite dissolution contributes from 75 to 89 at the vp site and from 73 to 91 at the hp site to total chemical weathering flux moreover the soil acidity being lower at the hp plot the chemical weathering at the hp site is globally lower than in the soil profile under vp as reported by previous studies lelong et al 1990 fichter et al 1998 3 3 importance of biological cycling in the biogeochemical cycle of major cations at the two sites the biogeochemical cycles of cations ca mg na k are estimated at the soil profile scale at the hp and vp sites figs 7 and 8 the simulated chemical weathering fluxes of major cations ca mg k and na range between 0 7 and 1 4 kg ha yr and are quite similar to those estimated by fichter et al 1998 the weathering of granitic rock is characterized by low mineral dissolution precipitation rates which provides annually few available cations to the studied soils with a weak contribution of weathering to the global biogeochemical cycle of major cations our results show that biological processes widely influence the biogeochemical cycle of ca k na and to the lesser extent of mg at the two sites the simulated root uptake fluxes are very close to the input fluxes to the soil that are influenced by the vegetation fluxes released by litter decomposition plus throughfall flux minus rain flux for all cations the simulated calcium uptake fluxes represent on average 26 kg ca ha yr on the vp site and 13 5 kg ca ha yr on the hp site these fluxes being two to eight times more important than for other cations from 1 8 to 12 8 kg ha yr unsurprisingly the potassium throughfall represents the major element input to the topsoil at the two sites 22 4 kg k ha yr at the vp site and 31 6 kg ha yr at the hp site at the hp site the ca na and mg throughfall fluxes 4 8 6 8 and 1 5 kg ha yr respectively are from two to three times less important than on the vp site 11 5 9 7 and 2 5 kg ha yr respectively throughfall fluxes are of the same magnitude than that estimated fluxes on vp and hp stand by hojjati et al 2009 and salehi et al 2016 the throughfall input the biological uptake and the liter decomposition are higher under the spruce than under beech plot related to the faster growth of spruce and the persistent foliage of spruce 3 4 discrepancies between simulated and measured output fluxes the simulated leaching fluxes varied between 17 8 kg ha yr k at vp site and 2 7 kg ha yr mg at hp site and are characterized by large inter annual variations over 2001 2011 period these important fluctuations are mainly controlled by the large variability of chemical composition of throughfall the simulated leaching flux of ca and mg are close to the measured flux over the 1992 2011 period when taking into account the standard deviations lpj model fix the root distribution along profile without modification over time which seems a reasonable assumption in our study the k simulated leaching fluxes are in agreement with that observed over 1992 1998 period but they are widely overestimated by a factor of 5 over the 2001 2011 period at the vp site and by a factor of 6 over the 2003 2011 period at the hp site the cations can be readily leached from canopy and transferred to the soil by throughfall especially potassium white et al 2005b adriaenssens et al 2012 as discussed previously the important simulated output fluxes of k could be explained by the high fluxes from throughfall an underestimation of the simulated k uptake fluxes is unlikely because of the decline in vegetation observed at the strengbach catchment since several years schmitt et al 2017 pierret et al 2018 numerous studies have shown the impact of acid rain on soil cations availability and on vegetation growth probst et al 1990 likens et al 1998 and it seems more likely that a change of the exchange complex behavior occurs over the last decades the evolutions of ca and mg output fluxes are better reproduced by b witch model the important decrease of measured k output flux could thus be explained by k leaching from the exchange complex over time and this process is not correctly simulated by the b witch model we decided then to perform sensitivity tests focusing on the selectivity coefficient associated to the cation adsorption reactions in order understand the potential effect on soil solution and cation leaching 3 5 the effect of exchange complex reactivity on cation leaching there are two thermodynamically different ways to formulate the cation exchange reactions the vanselow convention and the gapon convention sposito 1977 in the b witch model the gapon convention is used to represent the cation exchanges on exchange complex surface as in the safe model warfinge and sverdrup 1993 the values of selectivity coefficients associated to the reactions of cations adsorption h ca2 mg2 k al3 depend on the studied site ranging over several orders of magnitude these values being in addition often adjusted to calibrate the models robins et al 1980 warfinge and sverdrup 1984 ludwig et al 1999 cosby et al 2001 zetterberg et al 2014 3 5 1 kexch sensitivity test the observed decrease of k concentration into the soil profile at the vp site not reproduced by b witch model has led to a first sensitivity test ktest scenario where the values of k selectivity coefficient were changed from 10 3 to 10 2 7 the same value as for ca selectivity coefficient over the 1987 2010 period table 6 the increase of the k selectivity coefficient may lead an increase of number of occupied by k on the surface of the exchange complex and a decrease of k concentration in the soil solution under this scenario we show a decrease of k concentrations in the soil solution at 60 cm depth from 19 to 12 μmol l and to a lesser extent à 5cm depth this decrease is controlled by an increase of the k concentrations on the surface of exchange complex same trend as for the reference simulation fig 9 the decrease of k concentration is related to the slight increase of h concentration in the soil solution however the modeled k concentrations in the soil solution and the leaching of k from the exchange complex are underestimated and the observed trend was not correctly reproduced in our simulations the evolution of k concentration in the soil solution is mainly controlled by the evolution of k concentration in throughfall and a change in k selectivity coefficient does not improve the simulations the concentrations of the other major cations have not significantly changed under the ktest scenario 3 5 2 mg caexch sensitivity test the ca and mg measured concentrations in the soil solution decrease over time and to a lesser extent in the simulations due to the leaching of cations from the surface of the exchange complex a sensitivity test mg catest scenario was performed with lower ca and mg selectivity coefficients 10 4 at 60 cm depth than for the reference simulation with k selectivity coefficient value of 10 2 7 the aim was to evaluate the effect of the selectivity coefficients on cation leaching under this scenario we show an important increase of mean annual concentrations of ca and mg in the soil solution by a factor of 4 for mg2 and of 9 for ca2 related to the increase of h ions at the surface of the exchange complex over the simulation period fig 9 the ph of the soil solution increases from 4 6 to 5 2 at 60 cm depth and the ca2 and mg2 concentrations significantly decrease by 8 μmol l yr and 3 μmol l yr respectively over the last ten years of the simulation period these decreases are more important than for the reference simulation 0 5μmolca l yr and 0 8 μmolmg l yr and than for measurements 2 4 μmolca l yr and 0 2 μmolmg l yr under this scenario an important cation leaching occurs from the exchange complex since the number of occupied sites by ca and mg decrease from 9 to 0 4 for ca and from 6 to 0 8 for mg 3 5 2 1 conclusions and perspectives in this contribution we use a cascade model between a model of forest balance water biljou and a biogeochemical model b witch to simulate the evolution of the concentrations of major elements under two contrasted stands over the last twenty five years beech and spruce plots located in the vosges mountains france this model cascade allows us taking into account the major interaction between the biological hydrological and geochemical processes into the critical zone in spite of the spatial heterogeneity of some parameters used in the models as soil characteristics or mineralogy and the large fluctuations of input data our simulations allow to highlight the parameters and processes controlling the evolution of soil chemical composition under two different tree covers the salient results are 1 the cascade model is able to reproduce the behavior of most major species and of ph under beech and spruce stands over the time except to k 2 the silicon budget is mainly controlled by the chemical weathering of secondary minerals from 75 to 89 under spruce stand and from 73 to 91 under beech stand to total chemical weathering flux 3 the calculated biogeochemical cycles of major elements show that the weathering fluxes of cations contribute marginally to the leaching fluxes 4 the tree species influence deeply the biogeochemical cycle by the throughfall inputs biological uptake and decomposition which are all higher on spruce than on beech plot 5 the ca and mg concentrations decrease over the last decades which can be explained by the evolution of cation concentration in the throughfall and by the behavior of the exchange complex indeed the nature of the exchangeable complex evolved over time with a decrease of some cations as ca mg at the surface replaced by protons and confirmed by simulation 6 the performed sensitivity tests highlight the key role of value of selectivity coefficients associated to the reactions of cation adsorption at the exchange complex surface on the chemical composition of the soil solution in parallel this study also raised some limitations to the modeling of the chemical composition of the surface water in the b witch model the uptake cation fluxes by the vegetation is depending on the root distribution between the soil layers the lpj model fixed the root distribution along the soil profile over time which controlled the intensity of chemical uptake for each soil layer however in the future we can expect a potential adaptation of vegetation to hydric stress or decrease of soil fertility by modifying the repartition of roots with depths for instance the relation between roots density and cation bioavailability in the different layers could not be taken into account this limitation could lead to an underestimation of cation uptake fluxes and could limit the modelling forest adaptation to the changes of chemical environment i e soil prolife over time furthermore the silica concentration is underestimated in the surface soil solutions mainly under beech stand highlighting the presence of a silica source not simulated the integration of biological recycling of silicon in the future will allow a better modeling of silica cycle the chemical evolution of the cation exchangeable pool with a temporal leaching of some nutrient as ca and mg involve a decrease of soil fertility highlighting the fragility of forest in such base poor environment this is particularly preoccupying in a context where climate change induces more intense and more frequent water stress seneviratne et al 2012 and where the weakened trees undergo destructive parasite attacks fei et al 2019 in addition the forest management by the choice of tree species can influence the intensity of fluxes and then the soil fertility evolution modelling can then be a useful tool to assess the sustainability of forests credit author statement e beaulieu methodology sofware

24827,a numerical coupling of a dynamic biogeochemical model b witch and a model of forest balance water biljou was used to simulate the concentration of major species within soil profiles from two contrasted ecosystems beech and spruce stands located in the vosges mountains and their evolution during decades this coupled modelling allows an important vertical discretization of water and cation cycle and a direct comparison with the hydrological and geochemical data available over twenty five years and on a seasonal basis the processes controlling the past evolution of soil solution chemistry have been identified and tested the biogeochemical cycles of cations estimated on the two sites shows that the biological fluxes control up to 70 for ca and mg and up to 95 k of the chemical composition of the soil solutions the ca and mg concentrations decrease over the last decades which can be explained by the evolution of atmospheric inputs and by the behavior of the exchange complex this paper highlights the weak contribution of mineral dissolution and the key role of biological recycling and cation exchange processes in the soil solution signatures the future sustainability of forest in mountainous environment on base poor bedrock depends strongly on the forest management and evolution of exchangeable pool nature keywords biogeochemistry modeling forest ecosystem soil solution chemical weathering 1 introduction atmospheric acid depositions have modified the biogeochemical cycles of several elements c n p h s al ca mg leading to the acidification of surface waters and soil degradation paces 1985 likens et al 1996 the understanding of the interactions between vegetal cover soil and water is fundamental to assess the consequences of anthropogenic forcing on conservation and management of natural resources it is widely acknowledged that the process of soil acidification might have caused forest decline in both europe and the eastern us by accelerating base cation leaching ulrich et al 1980 matzner and ulrich 1987 schultze 1989 johnson 1992a b indeed base cation leaching can lead to plant deficiencies through the decrease of nutrient cations availability schulze 1989 and the increase of labile al concentrations reuss and johnson 1986 ulrich et al 1980 moreover the role of acid deposition on the weathering processes has also been investigated at the watershed scale highlighting a decrease of the atmospheric soil co2 consumption by weathering when the sulfuric acid deposition is considered amiotte suchet et al 1995 probst et al 2000 vries et al 2003 lerman et al 2007 xu and liu 2010 liu et al 2016 bleam 2017 at the watershed scale the surface waters quality and the soil solution chemistry depend on many processes such as

change on chemical weathering through the vegetal cover response roelandt et al 2010 beaulieu et al 2011 2012 however this model has been used at the catchment scale with an annual time step and the water cycle was greatly simplified the aim of this study is to use a numerical coupling of a dynamic biogeochemical model b witch and a water balance model dedicated to forest ecosystems biljou in order to identify the processes controlling the evolution of the soil solution chemistry and the biogeochemical cycle of base cation over the last three decades on a small forested catchment vosges france the originality of our approach relates to the availability of hydrological and geochemical data over a twenty five years period the use of coupled modeling allowing an important vertical discretization of water and cation cycle a direct comparison between the simulation outputs and the measured data may thus be done on a seasonal basis 2 material and methods 2 1 study site 2 1 1 site

part of catchment is characterized by hydrothermal alteration more important than the northern part el gh mari 1995 fichter et al 1998 the altered granite displays a depletion of biotite albite and muscovite and larger quantities of quartz illite and hematite caused by hydrothermal weathering process a small band of gneiss in contact with the granite appears at the northern top of the watershed the thickness of saprolite is spatially very heterogeneous and can reach 10 m depth el gh mari 1995 the soils are generally 1 m thick and varied from brown acidic to ochreous podzolic series the brown soils are mainly located on the high altitude part of the northern slope and are characterized by higher clay content higher cec and lower ph and organic matter than the ochreous podzolic soils

vegetation the forest covers about 90 of the watershed area with 80 of spruces piceas abies l between 60 and 120years old and 20 of beeches fagus sylvatica l 150 years old with a stem density of about 550 and 430 tree ha 1 for the beech stand le goaster et al 1990 forest decline related to acid precipitation was observed in the strengbach catchment in the 1980s as observed in several areas in

particular the spruce stand underwent approximately 30 needle loss and needle yellowing due to ca and mg deficiencies following the peaks of acid deposition landmann and bonneau 1995 probst et al 1990 2 1 2 data collection we studied two experimental plots vp a 120 years old spruce stand and hp a 150 years old beech stand fig 1 both plots spruce site vp and beech site hp fig 1 were instrumented and monitored over a long time for throughfall soil solution litterfall and soils prunier et al 2015 gangloff et al 2016 schmitt et al 2017 pierret et al 2018 chabaux et al 2019 throughfall were collected using two throughfall collectors surface area 0 2 0 2 m each and soil solutions were collected at different depths at 5 10 30 and 60 cm for vp and at 10 and 70 cm for hp using zero tension plate lysimeter discontinuously since 1992 with three periods 1992 1995 1997 1998 and since 2004 prunier et al 2015 pierret et al 2018 2019 chabaux et al 2019 samples were collected every month and analyzed for major elements al ca mg k na cl fe so4 n03 h4sio4 two soil profiles representative from each plot were studied the soil profile sampled at the spruce plot vp site elevation 1050 m is located on the northern slope and belongs to the alocrisol type brown acidic soil while the soil profile sampled at the beech plot hp site elevation 1000 m is located on the southern slope and belongs to the ochreous podzol type ochreous brown podzolic soil the main characteristics of the soil horizons are listed in the table 1 2 2 modeling description in this section the model cascade between lpj and witch models is described followed by a brief description of the witch and lpj models including the model inputs and outputs used in this study fig 2 2 2 1 the b witch model the b witch model is a coupling between a numerical code describing the chemical weathering of the continental surfaces witch and a global dynamic vegetation model lpj this model cascade has been described in previous studies roelandt et al 2010 beaulieu et al 2010 2012 and applied at different spatial scale from soil profile beaulieu et al 2010 to catchment scale beaulieu et al 2011 2012 and under different climatic conditions from artic climate beaulieu et al 2012 to tropical climate roelandt et al 2010 the principle of b witch model is the use of lpj model to calculate the cation fluxes exchange between the vegetation and the soil profile and the co2 pressure in the soil derived from the heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration these fluxes are then transferred to a process based model where the dissolution precipitation processes of minerals are estimated in the weathering profile the soil profile is divided into fifteen layers thickness 10cm each the uptake and release of cations by leaving and dead biomass in the soil layers are estimated from the vegetation productivity and element carbon ratios drever 1997 ca2 c 0 005 mg2 c 0 00125 so4 2 c 0 00125 k c 0 0025 p c 0 00125 al c 0

depth whereas the deepest are at 60 and 70 cm depth for vp and hp stand respectively thus the output simulations of the b witch model are compared with these soil solution data 2 2 2 lpj model 2 2 2 1 description the lund potsdam jena model lpj is a global dynamic biospheric model able to estimate the carbon and water fluxes exchanged between land and atmosphere through a mechanistic representation of vegetal cover dynamics this model takes into account vegetation structure dynamic competition between the plant functional types and the soil biogeochemistry the lpj model is derived from the biome family of models haxeltine and prentice 1996 kaplan 2001 sitch et al 2003 in which bioclimatic limits have been introduced the model includes ten plant functional types eight forests and two herbaceous environments with physiological and morphological parameters and bioclimatic limits these characteristics determine the presence absence and the fractional coverage of each plant functional type the lpj model is divided into two soil layers a superficial layer up to 0 5 m and a deep layer from 0 5 to 1 5 m the lpj model is able to reproduce the water and carbon exchanges with the atmosphere on the seasonal time scale on different environments lucht et al 2002 sitch et al 2003 gerten et al 2004 and the vegetation distribution on the strengbach catchment beaulieu et al 2016 the lpj model is fully described in sitch et al 2003 2 2 2 2 model inputs and outputs the lpj model uses monthly mean climate data precipitation air temperature cloud cover amount of wet days co2 pressure measured at the strengbach catchment for the years 1986 2011 ohge database and additional data from cru ts 3 1 database over 1901 1985 period harris et al 2014 the monthly climate data from cru ts 3 1 database are corrected from calculated anomalies according to the same procedure of previous studies françois et al 1998 beaulieu et al 2016 the vegetation productivity calculated by the model allows estimating the uptake up and release lt of cations and the co2 pressure in each soil layer fig 2 the lpj model is run over 1901 2011 period and predicted a vegetal cover stabilized after 30 simulated

2010 beaulieu et al 2010 2012 or with dynamic code at the soil profile goddéris et al 2006 goddéris et al 2010 the witch model estimates the dissolution precipitation rate of the mineral phases and the chemical composition of the water in each soil layer as a function of time on a seasonal time step the chemical budget of the soil solution is calculated at each time step 3 d z θ c i d t f i n f

of species in the layer controlled by the drainage the volumetric water content and the vertical drainage are estimated by the biljou model at a daily time step granier et al 1999 these simulations were performed before geochemical runs the cation exchange flux fexchange between the soil solution and the cationic exchange capacity is calculated according to fick diffusion law sverdrup and warfinge 1995 and could be either positive or negative the fraction of sites on the exchange complex occupied by ca2 mg2 and k is calculated at each time step 4 d e b c d t k x b c s u r f b c s o l

detailed in the table 4 fichter et al 1998 the soil characteristics as textural fractions of the soils and soil density table 1 are also used for the calculation at the end of each simulation the witch model allows to estimate the evolution of the concentration of each cation in the solution of each soil layer fig 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 observed trends over the 1992 2011 period throughfall and soil solutions at hp and vp sites 3 1 1 throughfalls the long term trends in the chemical compositions and fluxes of the atmospheric input under vp and hp throughfalls stand have been studied and discussed recently pierret et al 2019 and we resume here the general outlines significant decreases in the concentrations and fluxes of several ions were observed h and so4 2 cl and ca2 in open field precipitation and throughfalls the regular and strong decrease in protons and sulfate followed the decreases in anthropogenic so2 and nox emissions since the 1980s the annual calcium fluxes were also reduced by 40 and 70 from approximately 15 to 9 and 6 to 2 kg ha 1 under vp and hp respectively as a consequence of the reductions in anthropogenic industrial dust the canopy cover had significant and various impacts on the water and elemental fluxes atmospheric deposition and biological interactions via leaching or uptake processes on leaf surfaces may be influenced by the type of tree the geometry of the canopy lai age density etc as well as the leaf persistence during the whole year as a result the concentrations and fluxes of elements coming mainly or partly from atmospheric dry deposits na cl no3 ca2 mg2 so4 2 and nh4 were notably higher under vp than under hp the ph in throughfalls under vp is significantly lower than under hp pierret et al 2019 3 1 2 soil solution despite the fact that the soil solutions were monitored discontinuously significant long term trend can be identified over the 1992 2012 period and especially through the continuous record since 2004 as presented in prunier et al 2015 and ackerer et al 2018 these different long term trends are described in more detail below 3 1 2 1 cations for na no significant trend has been determined in the soil solution at the hp stand nor at 5 cm depth at the vp site table 5 this is in accordance with the results obtained for the throughfalls where no significant trend was found pierret et al 2019 moreover the na concentration is stable at 60 cm depth at the vp site since 2000s for k ca and mg significant decreases were observed over time in the soil solutions at each depth of the two plots table 5 these elements may have several origins atmospheric deposits canopy exchange biological recycling soil cationic exchange and mineral dissolution and may be impacted by biological uptake and secondary mineral precipitation goddéris et al 2006 pierret et al 2018 chabaux et al 2019 for ca the decrease in soil solution may be partly related to the decrease of ca atmospheric inputs reported by pierret et al 2019 at both sites over the same period however it does not apply for k at both sites and mg at vp sites since the concentrations and fluxes of these elements in atmospheric deposition increased or remained stable during this period moreover the decline of ca and k concentrations in the soil solutions was more pronounced in the deepest layers than in the topsoil at the vp site and to a lesser extent at the hp site suggesting that another process occurs we may hypothesis i a progressive emptying of the cationic exchange capacity over the 1991 2012 period and or ii the decrease of global dissolution processes in the deepest soil layers related to the decrease of proton concentrations see equation table 3 however this second hypothesis is not consistent with the stable of na concentrations observed in the soil solutions the cationic exchanges in soils are controlled by complex equilibrium reactions and competition between cations the numerical simulations performed with the b witch model helped in understanding the temporal changes observed in the soil solution at both sites see next section 3 1 2 2 silicia silica is a neutral molecule h4sio4 not involved in these types of cationic reactions and is not supplied by atmospheric deposits with insignificant si concentrations in rain or throughfalls however significant and important decrease of si concentrations have been monitored at both depths at vp as well as at hp at 10 cm depth table 5 this temporal evolution may be explained by some chemical reaction implying secondary minerals as clays or a modification over time of the biological cycle recycling vs uptake prunier et al 2015 schmitt et al 2017 chabaux et al 2019 once again the numerical simulations presented hereafter helped in understanding the behavior of si in these two soil profiles 3 2 simulated evolution of cation concentrations by b witch model on the vp and hp sites the reference simulations are performed on vp and hp sites and the mean annual results are compared to the measured chemical composition of soil solutions at 10 and 60 cm depth for vp site and at 5 and 70 cm depth for hp site over 1987 2011 period the model seems able to reproduce the ph except for vp over the last years and the trends and concentration levels for na ca2 mg2 and h4sio4 over the study period at both sites figs 3 and 4 except for aqueous silica underestimated at 10 cm depth on the hp site fig 4 the simulated mean annual ph is close to the measured value 3 7 vs 4 2 at 5 cm and 4 6 vs 4 9 at 60 cm on the vp site and 3 9 vs 4 2 at 10 cm and 5 0 vs 4 9 at 70 cm on the hp site however the slight increase of the measured ph is not well reproduced by the model on the vp site over the ten last years the measured decrease of mg2 concentration is reproduced by the model that simulates a decrease of 0 7 μmol l yr at 5 and 60 cm depths under vp fig 3 and a decrease of 0 3 μmol l yr at 10 and 70 cm depths under hp fig 4 however the simulated mg decrease is underestimated by a factor of about 2 at the hp plot the model also reproduced the decrease of ca2 concentration in the soil solution but the magnitude was lower than for the measurements especially in the deepest layers a 3 5 fold simulated decrease vs a 6 7 fold measured decrease on the vp site and a 1 6 fold simulated decrease vs a 4 4 fold measured decrease on the hp site the decrease in mg2 and ca2 concentrations under vp seems to be related to leaching from the exchange complex with a simulated decrease of soil ca and mg content on the cec in the soil layers for ca2 this decrease may also be related to the decrease of ca2 concentration in throughfall from 50 to 30 μmol l and previously discussed however the simulated leaching from the exchange complex is not significant enough to reproduce the decrease of ca2 and mg2 in the soil solutions under hp the decrease in mg2 and ca2 concentrations is only related to the decrease of ca2 and mg2 concentration in the throughfall over the last two decades because the behavior of exchange complex surface is stable the simulated na concentrations remain stable over time and are close to the measured concentrations in the soil solutions at the both sites the simulated evolutions of k concentrations are characterized by different trends between the two sites a decrease at the hp plot fig 4 and an increase followed by a decrease at the vp plot fig 3 the model simulates an increase of the number of occupied sites by potassium on exchange complex and then a decrease at the vp site while it simulates a continuous increase over the studied period at the hp site moreover the k concentration in throughfall increases from 26 μmol l to 146 μmol l over 1987 2003 period then decreases down to 24 μmol l on the vp site while it increases by about 100 over 1992 2011 period at the hp site related to an increased amount of biomass pierret et al 2019 the simulated decrease of k concentrations at the hp site may be related to the evolution observed in the throughfall and to the behavior of exchange complex and the simulated increase then decrease at the vp site may be only related to evolution observed in the throughfall despite these results the b witch model does not reproduce the decline of potassium concentration measured in the hp site and overestimates the k concentration by a factor of 4 at 5cm depth and by a factor of 7 at 60 cm depth at the end of simulation at the vp site discussed in the section 3 4 the simulated so4 2 concentration decreases from 80 to 20 μmol l under vp and from 40 to 20 μmol l under hp in accordance with the decrease reported by measurements from 58 to 9 μmol l at 5 cm depth on the vp site and from 31 to 13 μmol l on the hp site however the stable so4 2 concentration measured at 60 cm depth under vp is not reproduced by the model this discrepancy could be explained by sulfate desorption not taken into account in the model occurring at the bottom of the soil profile and acting as a source of sulfate van der heijden et al 2011 thereby stabilizing the so4 2 concentration at 60 cm depth since the early 2000s the simulated and measured h4sio4 concentration are at steady state in the soil surface layers of two sites with a simulated mean annual concentration of 44 μmol l vs 60 μmol measured at 5 cm depth and 36 μmol l vs 92 μmol l measured at 10 cm depth on the vp and hp sites respectively figs 3 and 4 the underestimation of the h4sio4 concentration in the topsoil could thus be explain by the contribution of a biological source not taken into account in the model indeed several studies highlight an important contribution of phytoliths dissolution to silicon export flux up to 85 in deciduous forest ecosystem bartoli 1983 meunier et al 2003 gerard et al 2008 otherwise the b witch model predicts a slightly decrease of h4sio4 concentration at 60 cm under vp in accordance with the evolution measured thanks to the lysimetric plates however the simulated concentration is overestimated by a factor of 1 7 at 60 cm depth this overestimation could be related to the si uptake by plants in the root zone not simulated in the b witch model or an overestimation of the chemical weathering the h4sio4 concentrations are mainly controlled by chemical weathering processes in the soil profile the simulated weathering profile shows that all secondary and primary phases dissolve down to 60 cm depth except illite that precipitates in the deepest soil layer figs 5 and 6 the silicon budget is largely controlled by the interaction between secondary minerals and soil solutions and by the soil acidity indeed the dissolution rates of secondary phases are one order of magnitude higher than that of primary minerals and are higher in the surface soil layers than in the deep layers the montmorillonite and illite dissolution contributes from 75 to 89 at the vp site and from 73 to 91 at the hp site to total chemical weathering flux moreover the soil acidity being lower at the hp plot the chemical weathering at the hp site is globally lower than in the soil profile under vp as reported by previous studies lelong et al 1990 fichter et al 1998 3 3 importance of biological cycling in the biogeochemical cycle of major cations at the two sites the biogeochemical cycles of cations ca mg na k are estimated at the soil profile scale at the hp and vp sites figs 7 and 8 the simulated chemical weathering fluxes of major cations ca mg k and na range between 0 7 and 1 4 kg ha yr and are quite similar to those estimated by fichter et al 1998 the weathering of granitic rock is characterized by low mineral dissolution precipitation rates which provides annually few available cations to the studied soils with a weak contribution of weathering to the global biogeochemical cycle of major cations our results show that biological processes widely influence the biogeochemical cycle of ca k na and to the lesser extent of mg at the two sites the simulated root uptake fluxes are very close to the input fluxes to the soil that are influenced by the vegetation fluxes released by litter decomposition plus throughfall flux minus rain flux for all cations the simulated calcium uptake fluxes represent on average 26 kg ca ha yr on the vp site and 13 5 kg ca ha yr on the hp site these fluxes being two to eight times more important than for other cations from 1 8 to 12 8 kg ha yr unsurprisingly the potassium throughfall represents the major element input to the topsoil at the two sites 22 4 kg k ha yr at the vp site and 31 6 kg ha yr at the hp site at the hp site the ca na and mg throughfall fluxes 4 8 6 8 and 1 5 kg ha yr respectively are from two to three times less important than on the vp site 11 5 9 7 and 2 5 kg ha yr respectively throughfall fluxes are of the same magnitude than that estimated fluxes on vp and hp stand by hojjati et al 2009 and salehi et al 2016 the throughfall input the biological uptake and the liter decomposition are higher under the spruce than under beech plot related to the faster growth of spruce and the persistent foliage of spruce 3 4 discrepancies between simulated and measured output fluxes the simulated leaching fluxes varied between 17 8 kg ha yr k at vp site and 2 7 kg ha yr mg at hp site and are characterized by large inter annual variations over 2001 2011 period these important fluctuations are mainly controlled by the large variability of chemical composition of throughfall the simulated leaching flux of ca and mg are close to the measured flux over the 1992 2011 period when taking into account the standard deviations lpj model fix the root distribution along profile without modification over time which seems a reasonable assumption in our study the k simulated leaching fluxes are in agreement with that observed over 1992 1998 period but they are widely overestimated by a factor of 5 over the 2001 2011 period at the vp site and by a factor of 6 over the 2003 2011 period at the hp site the cations can be readily leached from canopy and transferred to the soil by throughfall especially potassium white et al 2005b adriaenssens et al 2012 as discussed previously the important simulated output fluxes of k could be explained by the high fluxes from throughfall an underestimation of the simulated k uptake fluxes is unlikely because of the decline in vegetation observed at the strengbach catchment since several years schmitt et al 2017 pierret et al 2018 numerous studies have shown the impact of acid rain on soil cations availability and on vegetation growth probst et al 1990 likens et al 1998 and it seems more likely that a change of the exchange complex behavior occurs over the last decades the evolutions of ca and mg output fluxes are better reproduced by b witch model the important decrease of measured k output flux could thus be explained by k leaching from the exchange complex over time and this process is not correctly simulated by the b witch model we decided then to perform sensitivity tests focusing on the selectivity coefficient associated to the cation adsorption reactions in order understand the potential effect on soil solution and cation leaching 3 5 the effect of exchange complex reactivity on cation leaching there are two thermodynamically different ways to formulate the cation exchange reactions the vanselow convention and the gapon convention sposito 1977 in the b witch model the gapon convention is used to represent the cation exchanges on exchange complex surface as in the safe model warfinge and sverdrup 1993 the values of selectivity coefficients associated to the reactions of cations adsorption h ca2 mg2 k al3 depend on the studied site ranging over several orders of magnitude these values being in addition often adjusted to calibrate the models robins et al 1980 warfinge and sverdrup 1984 ludwig et al 1999 cosby et al 2001 zetterberg et al 2014 3 5 1 kexch sensitivity test the observed decrease of k concentration into the soil profile at the vp site not reproduced by b witch model has led to a first sensitivity test ktest scenario where the values of k selectivity coefficient were changed from 10 3 to 10 2 7 the same value as for ca selectivity coefficient over the 1987 2010 period table 6 the increase of the k selectivity coefficient may lead an increase of number of occupied by k on the surface of the exchange complex and a decrease of k concentration in the soil solution under this scenario we show a decrease of k concentrations in the soil solution at 60 cm depth from 19 to 12 μmol l and to a lesser extent à 5cm depth this decrease is controlled by an increase of the k concentrations on the surface of exchange complex same trend as for the reference simulation fig 9 the decrease of k concentration is related to the slight increase of h concentration in the soil solution however the modeled k concentrations in the soil solution and the leaching of k from the exchange complex are underestimated and the observed trend was not correctly reproduced in our simulations the evolution of k concentration in the soil solution is mainly controlled by the evolution of k concentration in throughfall and a change in k selectivity coefficient does not improve the simulations the concentrations of the other major cations have not significantly changed under the ktest scenario 3 5 2 mg caexch sensitivity test the ca and mg measured concentrations in the soil solution decrease over time and to a lesser extent in the simulations due to the leaching of cations from the surface of the exchange complex a sensitivity test mg catest scenario was performed with lower ca and mg selectivity coefficients 10 4 at 60 cm depth than for the reference simulation with k selectivity coefficient value of 10 2 7 the aim was to evaluate the effect of the selectivity coefficients on cation leaching under this scenario we show an important increase of mean annual concentrations of ca and mg in the soil solution by a factor of 4 for mg2 and of 9 for ca2 related to the increase of h ions at the surface of the exchange complex over the simulation period fig 9 the ph of the soil solution increases from 4 6 to 5 2 at 60 cm depth and the ca2 and mg2 concentrations significantly decrease by 8 μmol l yr and 3 μmol l yr respectively over the last ten years of the simulation period these decreases are more important than for the reference simulation 0 5μmolca l yr and 0 8 μmolmg l yr and than for measurements 2 4 μmolca l yr and 0 2 μmolmg l yr under this scenario an important cation leaching occurs from the exchange complex since the number of occupied sites by ca and mg decrease from 9 to 0 4 for ca and from 6 to 0 8 for mg 3 5 2 1 conclusions and perspectives in this contribution we use a cascade model between a model of forest balance water biljou and a biogeochemical model b witch to simulate the evolution of the concentrations of major elements under two contrasted stands over the last twenty five years beech and spruce plots located in the vosges mountains france this model cascade allows us taking into account the major interaction between the biological hydrological and geochemical processes into the critical zone in spite of the spatial heterogeneity of some parameters used in the models as soil characteristics or mineralogy and the large fluctuations of input data our simulations allow to highlight the parameters and processes controlling the evolution of soil chemical composition under two different tree covers the salient results are 1 the cascade model is able to reproduce the behavior of most major species and of ph under beech and spruce stands over the time except to k 2 the silicon budget is mainly controlled by the chemical weathering of secondary minerals from 75 to 89 under spruce stand and from 73 to 91 under beech stand to total chemical weathering flux 3 the calculated biogeochemical cycles of major elements show that the weathering fluxes of cations contribute marginally to the leaching fluxes 4 the tree species influence deeply the biogeochemical cycle by the throughfall inputs biological uptake and decomposition which are all higher on spruce than on beech plot 5 the ca and mg concentrations decrease over the last decades which can be explained by the evolution of cation concentration in the throughfall and by the behavior of the exchange complex indeed the nature of the exchangeable complex evolved over time with a decrease of some cations as ca mg at the surface replaced by protons and confirmed by simulation 6 the performed sensitivity tests highlight the key role of value of selectivity coefficients associated to the reactions of cation adsorption at the exchange complex surface on the chemical composition of the soil solution in parallel this study also raised some limitations to the modeling of the chemical composition of the surface water in the b witch model the uptake cation fluxes by the vegetation is depending on the root distribution between the soil layers the lpj model fixed the root distribution along the soil profile over time which controlled the intensity of chemical uptake for each soil layer however in the future we can expect a potential adaptation of vegetation to hydric stress or decrease of soil fertility by modifying the repartition of roots with depths for instance the relation between roots density and cation bioavailability in the different layers could not be taken into account this limitation could lead to an underestimation of cation uptake fluxes and could limit the modelling forest adaptation to the changes of chemical environment i e soil prolife over time furthermore the silica concentration is underestimated in the surface soil solutions mainly under beech stand highlighting the presence of a silica source not simulated the integration of biological recycling of

24828,g e hutchinson raised the paradox of how a number of phytoplankton species competing for the same resources are able to coexist in a relatively isotropic environment as a key for solving the paradox we focused on the limiting similarity which prohibits the coexistence of similar species we expected that the limiting similarity will be mitigated by some factors which are not represented in traditional theoretical studies but can be represented if we use a three dimensional 3d model the use of a 3d model enables us to explore the limiting similarity without using the controversial assumption connecting niche overlap with the competitive exclusion in previous theoretical studies furthermore while constant or no dispersion is given in theoretical studies it is explicitly represented in a 3d model the coexistence of similar species in 3d environments was explored by dividing a target persistent species in a quasi equilibrium community into 80 subspecies which were slightly different from one another at the optimum temperature for population growth in the experiments we found cases in which several dozens of species having nearly overlapping niches coexist stably at a point for over 80 years the comparison of experiments with and without dispersion by oceanic currents revealed that dispersion negates the progress of competitive exclusion or significantly delays the exclusion the result that species having nearly overlapping niches are able to coexist also highlights the crucial role of the specific rate in determining the number of coexisting species if the number of coexisting species is not determined by the limiting similarity it will be determined by the frequency of speciation events as in the neutral theory keywords oceanic phytoplankton limiting similarity competitive exclusion dispersion ogcm oceanic general circulation model species coexistence introduction the paradox of the plankton was raised by hutchinson 1961 how is it possible for a number of species to coexist in a relatively isotropic or unstructured environment all competing for the same sorts of materials the observed huge bunch of phytoplankton species seems to conflict with the competitive exclusion principle which was demonstrated by chemostat experiments gause 1934 the competitive exclusion principle states that when two species compete for the same resource one species will always outcompete the other macarthur and levins 1967 analyzed the limit to the similarity among competing species for their stable coexistence the limiting similarity of macarthur and levins comes from the assumption that the competition coefficient is related to overlap in resource utilization curves whereas some subsequent theoretical studies considered the assumption controversial abrams 1983 leimar et al 2013 many studies have proposed coexistence mechanisms related to niche differentiation partitioning plural resources is proposed in the resource ratio hypothesis of tilman 1985 where the maximum number of coexisting species is determined by the number of nutrients if two species are competing for two limiting resources coexistence is possible under the conditions that a species is more restricted by one resource and the other species is more restricted by the other resource and that each species consumes more the restricted resource than the other resource in the case of oceanic phytoplankton coexistence due to resource partitioning occurs between nitrogen fixers and the other taxa in most of the subtropical region the growth of nitrogen fixers is more restricted by iron or phosphate concentration than the other taxa whereas the other taxa are restricted by nitrogen which is unnecessary for nitrogen fixers partitioning space and or time is also an effective coexistence mechanism which includes concepts of the storage effect chesson and warner 1981 chesson 1985 environmental gradients kohyama 1993 begon et al 2006 and spatiotemporal heterogeneity levin and paine 1974 paine and levin 1981 in these studies biological chemical and physical conditions differ in space and or time and species exhibit different responses to spatial or temporal variability conversely species differences are not necessary for coexistence in the neutral theory hubbell 2001 in which the species composition of a biological assemblage is regulated by the speciation rate durrett and levin 1996 and limitations on dispersion tilman 1994 hurtt and pacala 1995 ehrlén and eriksson 2000 contrary to niche theory which considers a biological assemblage to be deterministic the neutral theory considers a biological assembly as a continuously changing nonequilibrium assembly structured by stochastic processes many studies have tried to reconcile these two contrasting theories tilman 2004 gravel et al 2006 adler et al 2007 rosindell et al 2011 in the reconciliation a key is the dispersal limitation which prevents the most competitive species occupying its appropriate habitat sites hubbell 2001 argues that a complete continuum is possible in the quantitative degree to which niche assembly versus dispersal assembly controls the local community structure another coexistence mechanism is based on the preference of predators which is demonstrated by keystone predation paine 1966 and density dependent predation abrams and matsuda 1996 chesson and kuang 2008 showed the potential of predation to promote coexistence or to promote exclusion in the same way as resource competition in oceanic phytoplankton communities size selective grazing armstrong 2003 wirtz 2013 is a significant coexistence mechanism due to the wide range of size variation from picoplankton 0 2 2 μm to microplankton 20 200 μm sieburth et al 1978 recent studies using the darwin model follows et al 2007 dutkiewicz et al 2009 combined with a 3d oceanic general circulation model hereafter ogcm indicated that niche difference plays a central role in the coexistence of phytoplankton species in these and subsequent studies niche is represented as species specific growth rate response to an oceanic environmental condition such as temperature light intensity and nutrient concentration species having a relatively higher growth rate become more competitive and the competitive advantage of a species changes depending on the spatiotemporally variable environmental conditions an ogcm can simulate realistic temperature light and nutrient distributions and oceanic eddies so that it is a powerful tool to represent spatiotemporally variable environments in studies using ogcms it is not required to use the assumption connecting niche overlap and the competitive coefficient in macarthur and levins 1967 the use of ogcms enables us to explore the limiting similarity without using the controversial assumption of macarthur and levins 1967 however this exploration awaits challenge if phytoplankton species having nearly overlapping niches can coexist in a simulated oceanic environment this situation will play a central role in solving hutchinson s paradox the other important role of ogcm in exploring the limiting similarity is the explicit representation of oceanic currents and resultant phytoplankton dispersion using an ogcm frees us from the assumption of constant dispersion rates using the darwin model lévy et al 2014 found that phytoplankton dispersion by oceanic currents increases local species diversity however since a situation in which many similar species are packed is not considered in the experiments in previous ogcm studies we know little about the roles of dispersion on the limiting similarity the purpose of our study is the exploration of the limiting similarity in a spatiotemporally variable oceanic environment with a special concern on the roles of dispersion caused by oceanic currents in terrestrial plant communities pacala and tilman 1994 showed that a spatial model is a useful tool for exploring the limiting similarity compared to spatial models of terrestrial plant communities an oceanic 3d phytoplankton model is simple in significant processes concerning species competition when a site is released by the death of an individual of a terrestrial plant species complex processes operate until the site is occupied by another individual and thereby an implicit representation is necessary in an oceanic phytoplankton model this kind of implicit representation of species competition is unnecessary dispersion of kernels propagules or spores of terrestrial plants is a complex and species specific process for example it is related to seed size and dispersal agents ehrlén and eriksson 2000 in the ocean dispersion of phytoplankton is rarely species specific but it relies on oceanic currents 2 model and design of the experiments the physical and biological models used in this study are the same as those in masuda et al 2017 and therefore we outline them briefly here 2 1 physical model we used an ogcm meteorological research institute community ocean model mri com developed at the meteorological research institute of the japan meteorological agency tsujino et al 2010 nakano et al 2015 the model has a rectangular domain of 0ºe 30ºe and 25ºn 55ºn and its horizontal resolution is 0 1 0 1 to explicitly reproduce oceanic mesoscale eddies the model represents idealized subtropical and subpolar regions it has 40 vertical layers of which the upper 20 layers have the same thickness of 10 m if the sea surface height variation is zero the model was driven by a seasonal cycle of wind stress and the restoring temperature at the sea surface the time step is 15 minutes year 1 was defined as starting after the connection of the physical and biological models our idealized model has sufficient ability to represent the characteristic dynamic structures in the real ocean the simulated oceanic surface temperature fig 1 a clearly shows the meridional gradient and mesoscale variabilities on a scale of a few hundred kilometers the vertical temperature gradient and temperature variability fig 1b are appropriately expressed in the model the mesoscale temperature variabilities are created by mesoscale eddies fig 1c for basin scale circulation the subtropical gyre with clockwise circulation is formed in about the southern half of the model domain and in the remaining northern half the subpolar gyre is formed fig 1c the subtropical gyre has the strong western boundary current corresponding to kuroshio or gulf stream whose maximum velocity greater than 100 cm s 1 is well represented in the model the model reproduces oceanic mesoscale eddies that lead to temporal changes in current strength and direction fig 1d therefore phytoplankton can be transported in various directions 2 2 biological model the prognostic variables in our biological model are the concentration of a few hundred phytoplankton species concentration of one zooplankton species acting as a general predator dissolved organic nitrogen don particulate organic nitrogen pon nitrate and ammonia all of which compose a nitrogen cycle fig 2 the rate of change in the phytoplankton concentration pi for a virtual species i and the zooplankton concentration z is described by the following set of equations 1 p i t 1 γ f i t g i l h i n o 3 n h 4 p i r e k r t p i m p i p sum g e k g t 1 e λ p sum p sum z p i p sum advection diffusion 2 p sum i 1 n p i 3 z t β z g e k g t 1 e λ p sum p sum z m z e k m t z 2 advection diffusion where t l no3 and nh4 are temperature light intensity nitrate concentration and ammonia concentration respectively γ r kr m g kg λ p sum βz mz and km are constant parameters masuda et al 2017 and n represents the total number of phytoplankton species in the phytoplankton equation eq 1 the first to fourth terms on the right hand side represent photosynthesis minus extracellular excretion respiration mortality by the density effect and mortality by predation respectively phytoplankton species differ in the dependency of their rate of photosynthesis on temperature light intensity and nutrient concentration which are denoted by fi t gi l and hi no3 nh4 respectively note that mortality via the density effect is represented not by mpipi but by mpipsum if we divide one phytoplankton species into two artificial species each with half the concentration of the original species the representation using mpipsum does not change the total mortality one zooplankton species with no grazing preference does not contribute to the coexistence of phytoplankton species caused by grazing preference the grazing pressure is given by the ivlev formulation ivlev 1961 which is commonly assumed in oceanic phytoplankton models kishi et al 2007 intending to clarify the roles of dispersion on competition we did not treat mechanisms that obviously enable species coexistence at a local point without dispersion e g resource partitioning and size selective grazing note that these resource partitioning and size selective grazing are included in the darwin model follows et al 2007 dutkiewicz et al 2009 the rates of change in nitrate and ammonia are described by the following equations 4 n o 3 t i 1 n 1 γ f i t g i l h i n o 3 n h 4 p i r e k r t p i r new i v n i t 0 e k n i t t n h 4 advection diffusion 5 n h 4 t i 1 n 1 γ f i t g i l h i n o 3 n h 4 p i r e k r t p i 1 r new i v nit 0 e k nit t n h 4 excretion by zooplankton remineralization of don advection diffusion vnit 0 and knit are constant parameters and r new i takes a value from 0 to 1 depending on relative concentration of nitrate and ammonia on the right hand side in eqs 4 and 5 the first term represents the flow of inorganic nitrogen to phytoplankton and the second term represents nitrification respectively in eq 5 the detailed formulae of excretion by zooplankton and remineralization of don are described in masuda et al 2017 pon is sinking matter which is distributed in the vertical direction and decomposed into don competition among phytoplankton species occurs due to the following processes simulated plural phytoplankton species have different growth rates from one another which are shown in the first term on the right hand side in eq 1 the growth rate of each species changes depending on temperature light and nutrient condition and therefore competitive species with a relatively higher growth rate change depending on spatial location and time an increase in the biomass of competitive species leads to negative impacts on all species an increase in the mortality rate related to the term mpipsum in eq 1 an increase in the grazing pressure and a decrease in nutrient for the negative impact related to the mortality rate since mpipsum mpip1 mpip2 all intraspecific and interspecific competition coefficients are equal to m in our model for the negative impact through grazing an increase in phytoplankton biomass leads to an increase in predator biomass which increases predation pressure on all phytoplankton species a decrease in nutrient concentration is due to an increase in phytoplankton biomass as represented in eqs 4 and 5 which in turn causes a decrease in the growth rate of all species in summary niche differences among phytoplankton species are due to differences in the growth rate as in previous studies follows et al 2007 dutkiewicz et al 2009 and all negative impacts among species are explicitly calculated 2 3 base experiment in the base experiment used in masuda et al 2017 240 virtual phytoplankton species were seeded we set 12 characteristic curves for fi t 5 for gi l and 4 for hi no3 nh4 fig 3 a c which are idealized representations of the observed trade offs litchman and klausmeier 2008 for optimum temperature eppley 1972 raven and geider 1988 light requirement richardson et al 1983 and nutrient uptake litchman et al 2007 fi t is given by f i t e k g p p t e 0 05 t t o p t i 2 where kgpp is the temperature coefficient for a photosynthetic rate of 0 0693 c 1 and hereafter topt i is called the optimum temperature for species i the combination of the 12 5 4 characteristic curves yields 240 species with different traits after the calculation for 22 years in the base experiment we identified 29 surviving species whose relative abundances of biomass integrated over the whole model domain are greater than 0 001 and in a quasi steady state during the experiment these species have traits fitted to oceanic environments the biomass of the dominant 11 species amounts to 95 of all phytoplankton biomass and hereafter we call these species abundant species and the other species rare species 2 4 species divided experiments we implemented experiments designed to explore competitive exclusion and coexistence among species occupying similar niches at the end of year 10 in the base experiment we selected four target species table 1 fig 3d g from the 29 surviving species in the base experiment and divided a target species into 80 subspecies with perfect reproductive isolation the four target species were selected as they have different characters of spatial distribution and different total biomasses the subpolar abundant species phy spa located in the central part of the subpolar gyre the subtropical abundant species phy sta located in a peripheral part of the subtropical gyre the subpolar rare species phy spr located close to the subtropical subpolar gyre boundary and the subtropical rare species phy str located around the shadow zone which is southern and eastern ends of the subtropical gyre luyten et al 1983 when species division is implemented at year 10 the total biomass of the four selected species is in a quasi steady state fig 10 the subspecies have a slightly different temperature trait fi t and the same light and nutrient traits gi l and hi no3 nh4 as the original species for fi t the optimum temperature for a subspecies is randomly distributed within a range of 1 c of the original species optimum temperature e g the subspecies of phy sta with an optimum temperature of 6 c have optimum temperatures ranging from 5 c to 7 c note that our model does not include the effects of acclimation which would cause to change experimental results the initial biomass distributions of the subspecies were 1 80 of the distribution of the original species the following two experiments were conducted from model year 11 to year 90 the experiment for subspecies originated from the division of phy spa and phy sta hereafter we call it the phy spa sta divided experiment and the experiment for phy spr and phy str phy spr str divided experiment for saving computational resources we implemented the simulation for 80 by 2 subspecies originated from phy spa and phy sta in one calculation since their habitats are not overlapped these experiments include the remaining 238 species where most of the 238 species whose biomass drops to a numerical noise level by year 11 are removed to save computational resources 2 5 0d model experiments to confirm the effects of dispersion on competitive exclusion we built an offline zero dimensional 0d version masuda et al 2017 in which phytoplankton and zooplankton are not transported by oceanic currents that is effects of dispersion on phytoplankton competition are removed the 0d version is composed of numerous independent box models corresponding to each grid point in the offline 0d version phytoplankton concentration and zooplankton concentration were the prognostic variables but the other components such as nitrate ammonia and don concentrations were given by a time interpolation of the 5 day averaged values at each grid point obtained in the 3d version we conducted three experiments using the offline 0d version corresponding to the 3d version of the base experiment phy spa sta divided experiment and phy spr str divided experiment except that the 0d base experiment was calculated for 10 years in the 0d version of the base experiment we employed 906 010 box models 301 points in longitude 301 points in latitude and 10 levels in the 0d version of the species divided experiment we employed 90 601 box models 301 points in longitude 301 points in latitude and 1 level the initial values of the simulated species in the 0d versions are the same as those in the 3d version 3 results 3 1 difference in exclusion time between 0d and 3d versions the effects of dispersion on competitive exclusion were estimated by comparing between the 0d and 3d versions of the base experiment in the 3d version the number of species in a grid box which had a relative abundance larger than 0 1 an index of α diversity decreases in the initial several years and takes a value of around 6 0 a near equilibrium state is obtained after year 10 fig 4 in the 0d version the number of species having relative abundance larger than 0 1 rapidly drops to be nearly 1 0 at year 10 implying that a phytoplankton species has outcompeted the other species in almost all grid boxes resulting in competitive exclusion the comparison between the 0d and 3d versions indicates that dispersion caused by advection and diffusion negates the progress of competitive exclusion or at least significantly delays the progress of competitive exclusion in the 0d and 3d versions of species divided experiments the number of subspecies with relative abundance larger than 0 1 at each grid point was counted and then it was averaged in the habitats fig 11 of the original species of the 80 subspecies fig 5 in the 0d version simulations the number of subspecies having relative abundance larger than 0 1 monotonically decreases with time at the end of the experiments the number of subspecies having relative abundance larger than 0 1 in the 0d versions ranges from 3 3 to 5 0 and the trend to decrease continues if the 0d experiment is extended the decrease in α diversity would further progress decreases inαdiversity in the 3d versions of species divided experiments proceeds far more slowly on a time scale of 80 years compared to those in the 0d versions the longer exclusion time in the 3d version than in the 0d version indicates that dispersion negates or significantly delays the progress of competitive exclusion our results also demonstrated that the limiting similarity crucially depends on whether dispersion exists or not in the 3d species divided experiments the number of subspecies having relative abundance more than 0 1 at the end of the experiments is around 50 and 35 in the division of phy spa and phy sta respectively it is unlikely that these numbers of subspecies rapidly decrease to be much smaller than those at the end of the experiments if the experimental period is extended it is notable that competitive exclusion among subspecies having similar niches proceeds slower than that among species having somewhat different niches because in the 0d versions of the base experiment competitive exclusion process is nearly completed within 10 years fig 4 however it continues even after 60 years in the 0d versions of the species divided experiments fig 5 the assumption of macarthur and levins 1967 that greater niche overlap causes stronger competitive exclusion does not agree with our results these differences in the time scale of the competitive exclusion might depend on our setting of niche many subspecies having similar niches have similar growth rates in an environment and therefore the difference in their competitive ability is relatively small 3 2 persistence of subspecies in the species divided experiments in the 3d species divided experiments the surviving subspecies are estimated based on the long term trend of their total biomass fig 6 in line with previous studies exploring phytoplankton coexistence using ogcm we do not intend to prove permanent coexistence but to show coexistence for longer than a few thousand generations 80 years is roughly equivalent to 4000 generations on an assumption of phytoplankton doubling time of a week as shown in fig 6 many subspecies maintain their biomass for 80 years indicating that species having nearly overlapping niches can coexist for over a few thousand generations some subspecies whose total biomass is smaller than 102 moln are obviously outcompeted but their exclusion time is significantly longer than that in the base experiment in which 202 species of the initial 240 species are outcompeted within 10 years as in the 0d experiments competitive exclusion among similar species proceeds more slowly than that among more differentiated species for the division of phy spa 62 subspecies have quasi stable biomass larger than 108 moln at the end of the experiment and are regarded as surviving ones all these subspecies have the optimum temperature ranging from 5 39 c to 7 c without exception where fig 6a and b give us information about the relation between temporal biomass variation of a subspecies and its optimum temperature the other 18 subspecies whose optimum temperature is less than 5 39 c decrease their biomass with time and is expected to be extinct in the future in also the division of phy sta phy spr and phy str phytoplankton biomass and survival clearly depend on the optimum temperature with respect to subspecies of phy sta 11 subspecies which have optimum temperatures below 19 3 c are extinct from year 36 to 38 but the other 69 subspecies persist for 80 years for the subspecies of phy spr there are distinct temporal variations in their biomass but extinct subspecies do not occur at least during the experimental period the distinct temporal variations are due to strong environmental variability caused by intense mesoscale eddy activity in the habitats of phy spr fig 1b and fig 3f in the division of phy str most of the subspecies whose optimum temperature is apart from 21 9 c are already extinct or in the process of extinction but 10 subspecies whose optimum temperature is around 21 9 c have stable biomass larger than 106 moln for species survival we did not apply the invasion trial to the oceanic phytoplankton community oceanic currents continuously transport a phytoplankton species from its suitable habitat to regions unsuitable for survival and therefore an invader phytoplankton species does not necessarily have sufficient time in which the invader acquires biomass and reaches an equilibrium state in our previous work masuda et al 2017 we found that the consequence of an invasion is not uniquely determined by per capita growth rate but also by the amount of immigration and emigration caused by oceanic currents 3 3 species coexistence at a local point in the 3d species divided experiment of phy spa phy sta and phy spr many subspecies survive resulting in high local diversity in the case of phy spa where 62 subspecies survive the number of coexisting species at a grid point drastically increases compared to the 3d base experiment as shown by the relative species abundance fig 7 a and b at a subpolar grid point marked by the asterisk in fig 7c and d at the point there are 67 surviving species including all 62 subspecies originating from phy spa and 5 non divided species the latter of which are common in the base experiment coexistence of several dozens of phytoplankton species at a local grid point has not been achieved in previous modeling studies this is because the possibility of the coexistence of similar species that have close niches is excluded beforehand in simulation studies including our base experiment and or because simulation of several dozens of species has been difficult to carry out before the present study due to the limitation of computational resources a snapshot of the shannon index for total species diversity using natural logarithms in the base experiment fig 7c is less than 1 0 in most regions except around the western boundary currents and their extension areas compared with the base experiment the shannon index in the species divided experiment of phy spa and phy sta fig 7d drastically increases in and around the habitats of the original species fig 3d and e the index value above 3 5 spreads over a wide range of the subpolar region 3 4 nitrogen source sink dynamics as shown in fig 8 a c the habitats of subspecies originating from phy spa closely overlap and simultaneously gradually shift to the outside of the subpolar gyre with increase in the set of optimum temperatures the overlap and shift of habitats are also found for subspecies of phy sta not shown for each subspecies originating from phy spa and an adjacent species having an optimum temperature of 8 c fig 8d we calculated nutrient uptake minus nutrient release at each grid point by 1 γ f i t g i l h i n o 3 n h 4 p i r e k r t p i m p i p sum g e k g t 1 e λ p sum p sum zoo p i p sum the distributions of the nutrient uptake minus nutrient release fig 8e h indicate that a part of phytoplankton biomass is transported from regions with total gain red regions to those with total loss blue regions the transport or dispersion of biomass acts as a key mechanism for maintaining phytoplankton concentration note that locations where a phytoplankton subspecies gains its biomass significantly change with time due to environmental variability fig 12 the dynamical change in regions with total gain and loss is closely related to the coexistence of subspecies having a similar optimum temperature however the following paragraph describes a rather statistic situation for convenience at a subpolar point located at 5 e 46 n and 55 m shown by the asterisk in fig 8 there exist species whose optimum temperature is 5 39 c and 8 0 c at the point total nutrient loss i e total biomass loss occurs for these two species fig 8e and h without the transport of biomass the two species will be extinct at the point although the species with an optimum temperature of 8 0 c is the most abundant as shown in fig 7b we can regard the transport of biomass as source sink dynamics pulliam 1988 at every point the difference of total nutrient gain among species is compensated by the transport of biomass in the 0d experiments without the transport of biomass total nutrient gain of a species during a year should be zero at every grid point assuming that interannual change is ignored this restriction for resources is imposed on classical theoretical studies exploring species coexistence without including dispersion by removing this restriction for resources coexistence of many species is realized 3 5 influence of species division on adjacent species the division of a species into as many as 80 subspecies has impacts on other original species without division in the division of phy spa with an optimum temperature of 6 c its subspecies have optimum temperatures from 5 c to 7 c and then the division presses species adjacent to phy spa in the 3d species divided experiment the total biomass summed up for the 80 subspecies is 10 or more percent larger than that of original phy spa in the 3d base experiment fig 9 this total biomass increase for phy spa group is nearly equal to the decrement of the adjacent species which has an optimum temperature of 8 c and has the same traits for light and nutrient as those of phy spa the species division causes little impact on species which have an optimum temperature of 10 c 12 c and 14 c and inhabit areas distant from phy spa s habitat in the division of phy sta with an optimum temperature of 20 c the total biomass of an adjacent species having an optimum temperature of 22 c decreases by 52 for 80 years however the rate of decrease in its total biomass reduces with time and its total biomass reaches a quasi steady state in the last few decades in the division of the two abundant species subspecies originated from species division coexist with extant non divided species we note that coexistence with extant non divided species does not necessarily occur in the division of phy str with an optimum temperature of 12 c an adjacent species with an optimum temperature of 10 c is extinct 4 discussion 4 1 niche overlap and competitive exclusion in macarthur and levins 1967 a higher degree of niche overlap leads to stronger competitive exclusion this is based on the assumption that the intraspecific competitive coefficient increases with a higher degree of niche overlap furthermore effects of dispersion are not considered in their study in our study in which niche is represented as a species specific response of the growth rate to an environmental condition all intraspecific effects are explicitly calculated and dispersion is explicitly represented a higher degree of niche overlap does not necessarily result in competitive exclusion as discussed in begon et al 2006 there is no general rule that determines the relation between niche overlap and competitive exclusion competitive exclusion depends on what types of niche or niche axes species have and what types of competition rules occur competitive exclusion is also influenced by dispersion our experiments suggest that competitive exclusion in a biological community significantly depends on whether the community is an open or closed system 4 2 niche theory and neutral theory the observed shannon index for all phytoplankton across taxonomic groups typically ranges from 0 to 3 in the global ocean irigoien et al 2004 rodríguez ramos et al 2015 and from 1 3 to 1 9 in an atlantic transect chust et al 2013 for diatoms in the open pacific ocean the shannon index varies from about 1 to 3 5 sugie and suzuki 2017 it is unlikely that the open ocean maintains a shannon index larger than 3 5 within a basin scale of a few thousand kilometers as in our results if computational resources are not limited we expect that further division of phy spa will lead to further increases in species diversity of course infinite division without extinction will be impossible since a minimum level of species biomass is necessary for persistence in order to resist consecutive transport from a habitat masuda et al 2017 there has been no study showing a possibility that simulated phytoplankton diversity is higher than the observed diversity we suggest two possible explanations for simulated diversity being higher than reality the first is the difference in focal spatial scales in our model the shannon index is calculated in a grid box with a scale of 0 1 which is considerably larger than the observational scales it has been demonstrated that the observed species richness of oceanic phytoplankton increases with an increase in sample volume in a range from a few milliliters to more than 10 l whereas a species volume curve increases steeply for smaller volumes and gradually levels off for larger volumes cermeño et al 2014 the second explanation is that the phytoplankton diversity obtained in our study is potential diversity without the limitation of the speciation rate the division of the selected species is regarded as speciation at an extremely high rate even if the division of a species would result in the coexistence of closely allied species radiative speciation needs to be associated with isolation processes our finding that the deterministic estimate of diversity without the limitation of the speciation rate can be higher than the observed diversity suggests that random speciation processes are a significant underlying mechanism in structuring species rich phytoplankton assemblages the crucial role of the speciation rate in determining the number of coexisting species in our experiment is the same as in the neutral theory hubbell 2001 here we note that the relative abundance in our simulation is not necessarily determined by random processes as in the neutral theory but by deterministic processes since the relative abundance depends on optimum temperature fig 6 the relation between niche overlap and competitive exclusion is closely related to the problem what mechanisms determine the number of coexisting species if niche overlap causes competitive exclusion the limiting similarity determines the number of coexisting species and niche differentiation schoener 1974 is observed we have demonstrated that there is a case in which niche overlap does not result in competitive exclusion in this case the number of coexisting species in a biological community is not determined by the limiting similarity but by the frequency of speciation events 5 conclusions contributing to solving hutchinson s paradox we studied the limiting similarity for oceanic phytoplankton communities in spatiotemporally variable 3d conditions simulated by a numerical model some presuppositions for niche and competition rules in our study are different from those in traditional theoretical studies concerning the limiting similarity due to the employment of an ogcm oceanic general circulation model an ogcm can simulate realistic temperature light and nutrient distributions and oceanic eddies so that it is a powerful tool to represent spatiotemporally variable environments in our study niches of each phytoplankton species are represented by a species specific response of growth rate to an environmental condition and species having a relatively higher growth rate become competitive as in previous studies follows et al 2007 dutkiewicz et al 2009 which species is competitive depends on spatial location and time increase in biomass of competitive species causes negative impacts on all species through increase in the grazing rate and mortality rate and decrease in nutrient the negative impacts are explicitly calculated in our study while such impacts are represented in the competitive coefficient assumed to be related to the degree of niche overlap in macarthur and levins 1967 therefore our study is free from the controversial assumption abrams 1983 connecting niche overlap and the competitive coefficient another significant difference from previous studies is the introduction of temporal change in dispersion due to dynamics of oceanic currents competition among species having nearly overlapping niches was explored by numerical experiments in which a target persistent species in a quasi equilibrium community was divided into 80 similar subspecies which were slightly different from one another at the optimum temperature for population growth to identify the effects of dispersion on competitive exclusion we also implemented the 0d experiments in which oceanic currents causing dispersion are artificially removed compared to the 0d experiments decrease in α diversity with time in the 3d experiments proceeds far more slowly on a time scale of several decades the results indicate that dispersion negates or significantly delays the progress of competitive exclusion we demonstrated that the limiting similarity crucially depends on whether dispersion exists or not in the 3d experiments we found cases in which most of the 80 similar subspecies coexist at a local point for over 80 years due to the restriction of computational resources coexistence in our model is limited for about 80 years and permanent coexistence is not necessarily assured total biomass and resultant survival of a species are uniquely determined by its optimum temperature for the roles of dispersion on local diversity we found that the transport of phytoplankton biomass caused by dispersion i e source sink dynamics pulliam 1988 is indispensable for maintaining local diversity without the transport total nutrient gain of a species during a year should be zero at every grid point and the restriction is implicitly imposed on our 0d experiments and macarthur and levins 1967 our study offers a way to reconcile the niche and neutral theories when niche overlap mainly results in competitive exclusion the number of coexisting species in a biological community is determined by the limiting similarity otherwise when niche overlap does not result in competitive exclusion the number of coexisting species is determined by the speciation rate as in the neutral theory

24828,g e hutchinson raised the paradox of how a number of phytoplankton species competing for the same resources are able to coexist in a relatively isotropic environment as a key for solving the paradox we focused on the limiting similarity which prohibits the coexistence of similar species we expected that the limiting similarity will be mitigated by some factors which are not represented in traditional theoretical studies but can be represented if we use a three dimensional 3d model the use of a 3d model enables us to explore the limiting similarity without using the controversial assumption connecting niche overlap with the competitive exclusion in previous theoretical studies furthermore while constant or no dispersion is given in theoretical studies it is explicitly represented in a 3d model the coexistence of similar species in 3d environments was explored by dividing a target persistent species in a quasi equilibrium community into 80 subspecies which were slightly different from one another at the optimum temperature for population growth in the experiments we found cases in which several dozens of species having nearly overlapping niches coexist stably at a point for over 80 years the comparison of experiments with and without dispersion by oceanic currents revealed that dispersion negates the progress of competitive exclusion or significantly delays the exclusion the result that species having nearly overlapping niches are able to coexist also highlights the crucial role of the specific rate in determining the number of coexisting species if the number of coexisting species is not determined by the limiting similarity it will be determined by the frequency of speciation events as in the neutral theory keywords oceanic phytoplankton limiting similarity competitive exclusion dispersion ogcm oceanic general circulation model species coexistence introduction the paradox of the plankton was raised by hutchinson 1961 how is it possible for a number of species to coexist in a relatively isotropic or unstructured environment all competing for the same sorts of materials the observed huge bunch of phytoplankton species seems to conflict with the competitive exclusion principle which was demonstrated by chemostat experiments gause 1934 the competitive exclusion principle states that when two species compete for the same resource one species will always outcompete the other macarthur and levins 1967 analyzed the limit to the similarity among competing species for their stable coexistence the limiting similarity of macarthur and levins comes from the assumption that the competition coefficient is related to overlap in resource utilization curves whereas some subsequent theoretical studies considered the assumption controversial abrams 1983 leimar et al 2013 many studies have proposed coexistence mechanisms related to niche differentiation partitioning plural resources is proposed in the resource ratio hypothesis of tilman 1985 where the maximum number of coexisting species is determined by the number of nutrients if two species are competing for two limiting resources coexistence is possible under the conditions that a species is more restricted by one resource and the other species is more restricted by the other resource and that each species consumes more the restricted resource than the other resource in the case of oceanic phytoplankton coexistence due to resource partitioning occurs between nitrogen fixers and the other taxa in most of the subtropical region the growth of nitrogen fixers is more restricted by iron or phosphate concentration than the other taxa whereas the other taxa are restricted by nitrogen which is unnecessary for nitrogen fixers partitioning space and or time is also an effective coexistence mechanism which includes concepts of the storage effect chesson and warner 1981 chesson 1985 environmental gradients kohyama 1993 begon et al 2006 and spatiotemporal heterogeneity levin and paine 1974 paine and levin 1981 in these studies biological chemical and physical conditions differ in space and or time and species exhibit different responses to spatial or temporal variability conversely species differences are not necessary for coexistence in the neutral theory hubbell 2001 in which the species composition of a biological assemblage is regulated by the speciation rate durrett and levin 1996 and limitations on dispersion tilman 1994 hurtt and pacala 1995 ehrlén and eriksson 2000 contrary to niche theory which considers a biological assemblage to be deterministic the neutral theory considers a biological assembly as a continuously changing nonequilibrium assembly structured by stochastic processes many studies have tried to reconcile these two contrasting theories tilman 2004 gravel et al 2006 adler et al 2007 rosindell et al 2011 in the reconciliation a key is the dispersal limitation which prevents the most competitive species occupying its appropriate habitat sites hubbell 2001 argues that a complete continuum is possible in the quantitative degree to which niche assembly versus dispersal assembly controls the local community structure another coexistence mechanism is based on the preference of predators which is demonstrated by keystone predation paine 1966 and density dependent predation abrams and matsuda 1996 chesson and kuang 2008 showed the potential of predation to promote coexistence or to promote exclusion in the same way as resource competition in oceanic phytoplankton communities size selective grazing armstrong 2003 wirtz 2013 is a significant coexistence mechanism due to the wide range of size variation from picoplankton 0 2 2 μm to microplankton 20 200 μm sieburth et al 1978 recent studies using the darwin model follows et al 2007 dutkiewicz et al 2009 combined with a 3d oceanic general circulation model hereafter ogcm indicated that niche difference plays a central role in the coexistence of phytoplankton species in these and subsequent studies niche is represented as species specific growth rate response to an oceanic environmental condition such as temperature light intensity and nutrient concentration species having a relatively higher growth rate become more competitive and the competitive advantage of a species changes depending on the spatiotemporally variable environmental conditions an ogcm can simulate realistic temperature light and nutrient distributions and oceanic eddies so that it is a powerful tool to represent spatiotemporally variable environments in studies using ogcms it is not required to use the assumption connecting niche overlap and the competitive coefficient in macarthur and levins 1967 the use of ogcms enables us to explore the limiting similarity without using the controversial assumption of macarthur and levins 1967 however this exploration awaits challenge if phytoplankton species having nearly overlapping niches can coexist in a simulated oceanic environment this situation will play a central role in solving hutchinson s paradox the other important role of ogcm in exploring the limiting similarity is the explicit representation of oceanic currents and resultant phytoplankton dispersion using an ogcm frees us from the assumption of constant dispersion rates using the darwin model lévy et al 2014 found that phytoplankton dispersion by oceanic currents increases local species diversity however since a situation in which many similar species are packed is not considered in the experiments in previous ogcm studies we know little about the roles of dispersion on the limiting similarity the purpose of our study is the exploration of the limiting similarity in a spatiotemporally variable oceanic environment with a special concern on the roles of dispersion caused by oceanic currents in terrestrial plant communities pacala and tilman 1994 showed that a spatial model is a useful tool for exploring the limiting similarity compared to spatial models of terrestrial plant communities an oceanic 3d phytoplankton model is simple in significant processes concerning species competition when a site is released by the death of an individual of a terrestrial plant species complex processes operate until the site is occupied by another individual and thereby an implicit representation is necessary in an oceanic phytoplankton model this kind of implicit representation of species competition is unnecessary dispersion of kernels propagules or spores of terrestrial plants is a complex and species specific process for example it is related to seed size and dispersal agents ehrlén and eriksson 2000 in the ocean dispersion of phytoplankton is rarely species specific but it relies on oceanic currents 2 model and design of the experiments the physical and biological models used in this study are the same as those in masuda et al 2017 and therefore we outline them briefly here 2 1 physical model we used an ogcm meteorological research institute community ocean model mri com developed at the meteorological research institute of the japan meteorological agency tsujino et al 2010 nakano et al 2015 the model has a rectangular domain of 0ºe 30ºe and 25ºn 55ºn and its horizontal resolution is 0 1 0 1 to explicitly reproduce oceanic mesoscale eddies the model represents idealized subtropical and subpolar regions it has 40 vertical layers of which the upper 20 layers have the same thickness of 10 m if the sea surface height variation is zero the model was driven by a seasonal cycle of wind stress and the restoring temperature at the sea surface the time step is 15 minutes year 1 was defined as starting after the connection of the physical and biological models our idealized model has sufficient ability to represent the characteristic dynamic structures in the real ocean the simulated oceanic surface temperature fig 1 a clearly shows the meridional gradient and mesoscale variabilities on a scale of a few hundred kilometers the vertical temperature gradient and temperature variability fig 1b are appropriately expressed in the model the mesoscale temperature variabilities are created by mesoscale eddies fig 1c for basin scale circulation the subtropical gyre with clockwise circulation is formed in about the southern half of the model domain and in the remaining northern half the subpolar gyre is formed fig 1c the subtropical gyre has the strong western boundary current corresponding to kuroshio or gulf stream whose maximum velocity greater than 100 cm s 1 is well represented in the model the model reproduces oceanic mesoscale eddies that lead to temporal changes in current strength and direction fig 1d therefore phytoplankton can be transported in various directions 2 2 biological model the prognostic variables in our biological model are the concentration of a few hundred phytoplankton species concentration of one zooplankton species acting as a general predator dissolved organic nitrogen don particulate organic nitrogen pon nitrate and ammonia all of which compose a nitrogen cycle fig 2 the rate of change in the phytoplankton concentration pi for a virtual species i and the zooplankton concentration z is described by the following set of equations 1 p i t 1 γ f i t g i l h i n o 3 n h 4 p i r e k r t p i m p i p sum g e k g t 1 e λ p sum p sum z p i p sum advection diffusion 2 p sum i 1 n p i 3 z t β z g e k g t 1 e λ p sum p sum z m z e k m t z 2 advection diffusion where t l no3 and nh4 are temperature light intensity nitrate concentration and ammonia concentration respectively γ r kr m g kg λ p sum βz mz and km are constant parameters masuda et al 2017 and n represents the total number of phytoplankton species in the phytoplankton equation eq 1 the first to fourth terms on the right hand side represent photosynthesis minus extracellular excretion respiration mortality by the density effect and mortality by predation respectively phytoplankton species differ in the dependency of their rate of photosynthesis on temperature light intensity and nutrient concentration which are denoted by fi t gi l and hi no3 nh4 respectively note that mortality via the density effect is represented not by mpipi but by mpipsum if we divide one phytoplankton species into two artificial species each with half the concentration of the original species the representation using mpipsum does not change the total mortality one zooplankton species with no grazing preference does not contribute to the coexistence of phytoplankton species caused by grazing preference the grazing pressure is given by the ivlev formulation ivlev 1961 which is commonly assumed in oceanic phytoplankton models kishi et al 2007 intending to clarify the roles of dispersion on competition we did not treat mechanisms that obviously enable species coexistence at a local point without dispersion e g resource partitioning and size selective grazing note that these resource partitioning and size selective grazing are included in the darwin model follows et al 2007 dutkiewicz et al 2009 the rates of change in nitrate and ammonia are described by the following equations 4 n o 3 t i 1 n 1 γ f i t g i l h i n o 3 n h 4 p i r e k r t p i r new i v n i t 0 e k n i t t n h 4 advection diffusion 5 n h 4 t i 1 n 1 γ f i t g i l h i n o 3 n h 4 p i r e k r t p i 1 r new i v nit 0 e k nit t n h 4 excretion by zooplankton remineralization of don advection diffusion vnit 0 and knit are constant parameters and r new i takes a value from 0 to 1 depending on relative concentration of nitrate and ammonia on the right hand side in eqs 4 and 5 the first term represents the flow of inorganic nitrogen to phytoplankton and the second term represents nitrification respectively in eq 5 the detailed formulae of excretion by zooplankton and remineralization of don are described in masuda et al 2017 pon is sinking matter which is distributed in the vertical direction and decomposed into don competition among phytoplankton species occurs due to the following processes simulated plural phytoplankton species have different growth rates from one another which are shown in the first term on the right hand side in eq 1 the growth rate of each species changes depending on temperature light and nutrient condition and therefore competitive species with a relatively higher growth rate change depending on spatial location and time an increase in the biomass of competitive species leads to negative impacts on all species an increase in the mortality rate related to the term mpipsum in eq 1 an increase in the grazing pressure and a decrease in nutrient for the negative impact related to the mortality rate since mpipsum mpip1 mpip2 all intraspecific and interspecific competition coefficients are equal to m in our model for the negative impact through grazing an increase in phytoplankton biomass leads to an increase in predator biomass which increases predation pressure on all phytoplankton species a decrease in nutrient concentration is due to an increase in phytoplankton biomass as represented in eqs 4 and 5 which in turn causes a decrease in the growth rate of all species in summary niche differences among phytoplankton species are due to differences in the growth rate as in previous studies follows et al 2007 dutkiewicz et al 2009 and all negative impacts among species are explicitly calculated 2 3 base experiment in the base experiment used in masuda et al 2017 240 virtual phytoplankton species were seeded we set 12 characteristic curves for fi t 5 for gi l and 4 for hi no3 nh4 fig 3 a c which are idealized representations of the observed trade offs litchman and klausmeier 2008 for optimum temperature eppley 1972 raven and geider 1988 light requirement richardson et al 1983 and nutrient uptake litchman et al 2007 fi t is given by f i t e k g p p t e 0 05 t t o p t i 2 where kgpp is the temperature coefficient for a photosynthetic rate of 0 0693 c 1 and hereafter topt i is called the optimum temperature for species i the combination of the 12 5 4 characteristic curves yields 240 species with different traits after the calculation for 22 years in the base experiment we identified 29 surviving species whose relative abundances of biomass integrated over the whole model domain are greater than 0 001 and in a quasi steady state during the experiment these species have traits fitted to oceanic environments the biomass of the dominant 11 species amounts to 95 of all phytoplankton biomass and hereafter we call these species abundant species and the other species rare species 2 4 species divided experiments we implemented experiments designed to explore competitive exclusion and coexistence among species occupying similar niches at the end of year 10 in the base experiment we selected four target species table 1 fig 3d g from the 29 surviving species in the base experiment and divided a target species into 80 subspecies with perfect reproductive isolation the four target species were selected as they have different characters of spatial distribution and different total biomasses the subpolar abundant species phy spa located in the central part of the subpolar gyre the subtropical abundant species phy sta located in a peripheral part of the subtropical gyre the subpolar rare species phy spr located close to the subtropical subpolar gyre boundary and the subtropical rare species phy str located around the shadow zone which is southern and eastern ends of the subtropical gyre luyten et al 1983 when species division is implemented at year 10 the total biomass of the four selected species is in a quasi steady state fig 10 the subspecies have a slightly different temperature trait fi t and the same light and nutrient traits gi l and hi no3 nh4 as the original species for fi t the optimum temperature for a subspecies is randomly distributed within a range of 1 c of the original species optimum temperature e g the subspecies of phy sta with an optimum temperature of 6 c have optimum temperatures ranging from 5 c to 7 c note that our model does not include the effects of acclimation which would cause to change experimental results the initial biomass distributions of the subspecies were 1 80 of the distribution of the original species the following two experiments were conducted from model year 11 to year 90 the experiment for subspecies originated from the division of phy spa and phy sta hereafter we call it the phy spa sta divided experiment and the experiment for phy spr and phy str phy spr str divided experiment for saving computational resources we implemented the simulation for 80 by 2 subspecies originated from phy spa and phy sta in one calculation since their habitats are not overlapped these experiments include the remaining 238 species where most of the 238 species whose biomass drops to a numerical noise level by year 11 are removed to save computational resources 2 5 0d model experiments to confirm the effects of dispersion on competitive exclusion we built an offline zero dimensional 0d version masuda et al 2017 in which phytoplankton and zooplankton are not transported by oceanic currents that is effects of dispersion on phytoplankton competition are removed the 0d version is composed of numerous independent box models corresponding to each grid point in the offline 0d version phytoplankton concentration and zooplankton concentration were the prognostic variables but the other components such as nitrate ammonia and don concentrations were given by a time interpolation of the 5 day averaged values at each grid point obtained in the 3d version we conducted three experiments using the offline 0d version corresponding to the 3d version of the base experiment phy spa sta divided experiment and phy spr str divided experiment except that the 0d base experiment was calculated for 10 years in the 0d version of the base experiment we employed 906 010 box models 301 points in longitude 301 points in latitude and 10 levels in the 0d version of the species divided experiment we employed 90 601 box models 301 points in longitude 301 points in latitude and 1 level the initial values of the simulated species in the 0d versions are the same as those in the 3d version 3 results 3 1 difference in exclusion time between 0d and 3d versions the effects of dispersion on competitive exclusion were estimated by comparing between the 0d and 3d versions of the base experiment in the 3d version the number of species in a grid box which had a relative abundance larger than 0 1 an index of α diversity decreases in the initial several years and takes a value of around 6 0 a near equilibrium state is obtained after year 10 fig 4 in the 0d version the number of species having relative abundance larger than 0 1 rapidly drops to be nearly 1 0 at year 10 implying that a phytoplankton species has outcompeted the other species in almost all grid boxes resulting in competitive exclusion the comparison between the 0d and 3d versions indicates that dispersion caused by advection and diffusion negates the progress of competitive exclusion or at least significantly delays the progress of competitive exclusion in the 0d and 3d versions of species divided experiments the number of subspecies with relative abundance larger than 0 1 at each grid point was counted and then it was averaged in the habitats fig 11 of the original species of the 80 subspecies fig 5 in the 0d version simulations the number of subspecies having relative abundance larger than 0 1 monotonically decreases with time at the end of the experiments the number of subspecies having relative abundance larger than 0 1 in the 0d versions ranges from 3 3 to 5 0 and the trend to decrease continues if the 0d experiment is extended the decrease in α diversity would further progress decreases inαdiversity in the 3d versions of species divided experiments proceeds far more slowly on a time scale of 80 years compared to those in the 0d versions the longer exclusion time in the 3d version than in the 0d version indicates that dispersion negates or significantly delays the progress of competitive exclusion our results also demonstrated that the limiting similarity crucially depends on whether dispersion exists or not in the 3d species divided experiments the number of subspecies having relative abundance more than 0 1 at the end of the experiments is around 50 and 35 in the division of phy spa and phy sta respectively it is unlikely that these numbers of subspecies rapidly decrease to be much smaller than those at the end of the experiments if the experimental period is extended it is notable that competitive exclusion among subspecies having similar niches proceeds slower than that among species having somewhat different niches because in the 0d versions of the base experiment competitive exclusion process is nearly completed within 10 years fig 4 however it continues even after 60 years in the 0d versions of the species divided experiments fig 5 the assumption of macarthur and levins 1967 that greater niche overlap causes stronger competitive exclusion does not agree with our results these differences in the time scale of the competitive exclusion might depend on our setting of niche many subspecies having similar niches have similar growth rates in an environment and therefore the difference in their competitive ability is relatively small 3 2 persistence of subspecies in the species divided experiments in the 3d species divided experiments the surviving subspecies are estimated based on the long term trend of their total biomass fig 6 in line with previous studies exploring phytoplankton coexistence using ogcm we do not intend to prove permanent coexistence but to show coexistence for longer than a few thousand generations 80 years is roughly equivalent to 4000 generations on an assumption of phytoplankton doubling time of a week as shown in fig 6 many subspecies maintain their biomass for 80 years indicating that species having nearly overlapping niches can coexist for over a few thousand generations some subspecies whose total biomass is smaller than 102 moln are obviously outcompeted but their exclusion time is significantly longer than that in the base experiment in which 202 species of the initial 240 species are outcompeted within 10 years as in the 0d experiments competitive exclusion among similar species proceeds more slowly than that among more differentiated species for the division of phy spa 62 subspecies have quasi stable biomass larger than 108 moln at the end of the experiment and are regarded as surviving ones all these subspecies have the optimum temperature ranging from 5 39 c to 7 c without exception where fig 6a and b give us information about the relation between temporal biomass variation of a subspecies and its optimum temperature the other 18 subspecies whose optimum temperature is less than 5 39 c decrease their biomass with time and is expected to be extinct in the future in also the division of phy sta phy spr and phy str phytoplankton biomass and survival clearly depend on the optimum temperature with respect to subspecies of phy sta 11 subspecies which have optimum temperatures below 19 3 c are extinct from year 36 to 38 but the other 69 subspecies persist for 80 years for the subspecies of phy spr there are distinct temporal variations in their biomass but extinct subspecies do not occur at least during the experimental period the distinct temporal variations are due to strong environmental variability caused by intense mesoscale eddy activity in the habitats of phy spr fig 1b and fig 3f in the division of phy str most of the subspecies whose optimum temperature is apart from 21 9 c are already extinct or in the process of extinction but 10 subspecies whose optimum temperature is around 21 9 c have stable biomass larger than 106 moln for species survival we did not apply the invasion trial to the oceanic phytoplankton community oceanic currents continuously transport a phytoplankton species from its suitable habitat to regions unsuitable for survival and therefore an invader phytoplankton species does not necessarily have sufficient time in which the invader acquires biomass and reaches an equilibrium state in our previous work masuda et al 2017 we found that the consequence of an invasion is not uniquely determined by per capita growth rate but also by the amount of immigration and emigration caused by oceanic currents 3 3 species coexistence at a local point in the 3d species divided experiment of phy spa phy sta and phy spr many subspecies survive resulting in high local diversity in the case of phy spa where 62 subspecies survive the number of coexisting species at a grid point drastically increases compared to the 3d base experiment as shown by the relative species abundance fig 7 a and b at a subpolar grid point marked by the asterisk in fig 7c and d at the point there are 67 surviving species including all 62 subspecies originating from phy spa and 5 non divided species the latter of which are common in the base experiment coexistence of several dozens of phytoplankton species at a local grid point has not been achieved in previous modeling studies this is because the possibility of the coexistence of similar species that have close niches is excluded beforehand in simulation studies including our base experiment and or because simulation of several dozens of species has been difficult to carry out before the present study due to the limitation of computational resources a snapshot of the shannon index for total species diversity using natural logarithms in the base experiment fig 7c is less than 1 0 in most regions except around the western boundary currents and their extension areas compared with the base experiment the shannon index in the species divided experiment of phy spa and phy sta fig 7d drastically increases in and around the habitats of the original species fig 3d and e the index value above 3 5 spreads over a wide range of the subpolar region 3 4 nitrogen source sink dynamics as shown in fig 8 a c the habitats of subspecies originating from phy spa closely overlap and simultaneously gradually shift to the outside of the subpolar gyre with increase in the set of optimum temperatures the overlap and shift of habitats are also found for subspecies of phy sta not shown for each subspecies originating from phy spa and an adjacent species having an optimum temperature of 8 c fig 8d we calculated nutrient uptake minus nutrient release at each grid point by 1 γ f i t g i l h i n o 3 n h 4 p i r e k r t p i m p i p sum g e k g t 1 e λ p sum p sum zoo p i p sum the distributions of the nutrient uptake minus nutrient release fig 8e h indicate that a part of phytoplankton biomass is transported from regions with total gain red regions to those with total loss blue regions the transport or dispersion of biomass acts as a key mechanism for maintaining phytoplankton concentration note that locations where a phytoplankton subspecies gains its biomass significantly change with time due to environmental variability fig 12 the dynamical change in regions with total gain and loss is closely related to the coexistence of subspecies having a similar optimum temperature however the following paragraph describes a rather statistic situation for convenience at a subpolar point located at 5 e 46 n and 55 m shown by the asterisk in fig 8 there exist species whose optimum temperature is 5 39 c and 8 0 c at the point total nutrient loss i e total biomass loss occurs for these two species fig 8e and h without the transport of biomass the two species will be extinct at the point although the species with an optimum temperature of 8 0 c is the most abundant as shown in fig 7b we can regard the transport of biomass as source sink dynamics pulliam 1988 at every point the difference of total nutrient gain among species is compensated by the transport of biomass in the 0d experiments without the transport of biomass total nutrient gain of a species during a year should be zero at every grid point assuming that interannual change is ignored this restriction for resources is imposed on classical theoretical studies exploring species coexistence without including dispersion by removing this restriction for resources coexistence of many species is realized 3 5 influence of species division on adjacent species the division of a species into as many as 80 subspecies has impacts on other original species without division in the division of phy spa with an optimum temperature of 6 c its subspecies have optimum temperatures from 5 c to 7 c and then the division presses species adjacent to phy spa in the 3d species divided experiment the total biomass summed up for the 80 subspecies is 10 or more percent larger than that of original phy spa in the 3d base experiment fig 9 this total biomass increase for phy spa group is nearly equal to the decrement of the adjacent species which has an optimum temperature of 8 c and has the same traits for light and nutrient as those of phy spa the species division causes little impact on species which have an optimum temperature of 10 c 12 c and 14 c and inhabit areas distant from phy spa s habitat in the division of phy sta with an optimum temperature of 20 c the total biomass of an adjacent species having an optimum temperature of 22 c decreases by 52 for 80 years however the rate of decrease in its total biomass reduces with time and its total biomass reaches a quasi steady state in the last few decades in the division of the two abundant species subspecies originated from species division coexist with extant non divided species we note that coexistence with extant non divided species does not necessarily occur in the division of phy str with an optimum temperature of 12 c an adjacent species with an optimum temperature of 10 c is extinct 4 discussion 4 1 niche overlap and competitive exclusion in macarthur and levins 1967 a higher degree of niche overlap leads to stronger competitive exclusion this is based on the assumption that the intraspecific competitive coefficient increases with a higher degree of niche overlap furthermore effects of dispersion are not considered in their study in our study in which niche is represented as a species specific response of the growth rate to an environmental condition all intraspecific effects are explicitly calculated and dispersion is explicitly represented a higher degree of niche overlap does not necessarily result in competitive exclusion as discussed in begon et al 2006 there is no general rule that determines the relation between niche overlap and competitive exclusion competitive exclusion depends on what types of niche or niche axes species have and what types of competition rules occur competitive exclusion is also influenced by dispersion our experiments suggest that competitive exclusion in a biological community significantly depends on whether the community is an open or closed system 4 2 niche theory and neutral theory the observed shannon index for all phytoplankton across taxonomic groups typically ranges from 0 to 3 in the global ocean irigoien et al 2004 rodríguez ramos et al 2015 and from 1 3 to 1 9 in an atlantic transect chust et al 2013 for diatoms in the open pacific ocean the shannon index varies from about 1 to 3 5 sugie and suzuki 2017 it is unlikely that the open ocean maintains a shannon index larger than 3 5 within a basin scale of a few thousand kilometers as in our results if computational resources are not limited we expect that further division of phy spa will lead to further increases in species diversity of course infinite division without extinction will be impossible since a minimum level of species biomass is necessary for persistence in order to resist consecutive transport from a habitat masuda et al 2017 there has been no study showing a possibility that simulated phytoplankton diversity is higher than the observed diversity we suggest two possible explanations for simulated diversity being higher than reality the first is the difference in focal spatial scales in our model the shannon index is calculated in a grid box with a scale of 0 1 which is considerably larger than the observational scales it has been demonstrated that the observed species richness of oceanic phytoplankton increases with an increase in sample volume in a range from a few milliliters to more than 10 l whereas a species volume curve increases steeply for smaller volumes and gradually levels off for larger volumes cermeño et al 2014 the second explanation is that the phytoplankton diversity obtained in our study is potential diversity without the limitation of the speciation rate the division of the selected species is regarded as speciation at an extremely high rate even if the division of a species would result in the coexistence of closely allied species radiative speciation needs to be associated with isolation processes our finding that the deterministic estimate of diversity without the limitation of the speciation rate can be higher than the observed diversity suggests that random speciation processes are a significant underlying mechanism in structuring species rich phytoplankton assemblages the crucial role of the speciation rate in determining the number of coexisting species in our experiment is the same as in the neutral theory hubbell 2001 here we note that the relative abundance in our simulation is not necessarily determined by random processes as in the neutral theory but by deterministic processes since the relative abundance depends on optimum temperature fig 6 the relation between niche overlap and competitive exclusion is closely related to the problem what mechanisms determine the number of coexisting species if niche overlap causes competitive exclusion the limiting similarity determines the number of coexisting species and niche differentiation schoener 1974 is observed we have demonstrated that there is a case in which niche overlap does not result in competitive exclusion in this case the number of coexisting species in a biological community is not determined by the limiting similarity but by the frequency of speciation events 5 conclusions contributing to solving hutchinson s paradox we studied the limiting similarity for oceanic phytoplankton communities in spatiotemporally variable 3d conditions simulated by a numerical model some presuppositions for niche and competition rules in our study are different from those in traditional theoretical studies concerning the limiting similarity due to the employment of an ogcm oceanic general circulation model an ogcm can simulate realistic temperature light and nutrient distributions and oceanic eddies so that it is a powerful tool to represent spatiotemporally variable environments in our study niches of each phytoplankton species are represented by a species specific response of growth rate to an environmental condition and species having a relatively higher growth rate become competitive as in previous studies follows et al 2007 dutkiewicz et al 2009 which species is competitive depends on spatial location and time increase in biomass of competitive species causes negative impacts on all species through increase in the grazing rate and mortality rate and decrease in nutrient the negative impacts are explicitly calculated in our study while such impacts are represented in the competitive coefficient assumed to be related to the degree of niche overlap in macarthur and levins 1967 therefore our study is free from the controversial assumption abrams 1983 connecting niche overlap and the competitive coefficient another significant difference from previous studies is the introduction of temporal change in dispersion due to dynamics of oceanic currents competition among species having nearly overlapping niches was explored by numerical experiments in which a target persistent species in a quasi equilibrium community was divided into 80 similar subspecies which were slightly different from one another at the optimum temperature for population growth to identify the effects of dispersion on competitive exclusion we also implemented the 0d experiments in which oceanic currents causing dispersion are artificially removed compared to the 0d experiments decrease in α diversity with time in the 3d experiments proceeds far more slowly on a time scale of several decades the results indicate that dispersion negates or significantly delays the progress of competitive exclusion we demonstrated that the limiting similarity crucially depends on whether dispersion exists or not in the 3d experiments we found cases in which most of the 80 similar subspecies coexist at a local point for over 80 years due to the restriction of computational resources coexistence in our model is limited for about 80 years and permanent coexistence is not necessarily assured total biomass and resultant survival of a species are uniquely determined by its optimum temperature for the roles of dispersion on local diversity we found that the transport of phytoplankton biomass caused by dispersion i e source sink dynamics pulliam 1988 is indispensable for maintaining local diversity without the transport total nutrient gain of a species during a year should be zero at every grid point and the restriction is implicitly imposed on our 0d experiments and macarthur and levins 1967 our study offers a way to reconcile the niche and neutral theories when niche overlap mainly results in competitive exclusion the number of coexisting species in a biological community is determined by the limiting similarity otherwise when niche overlap does not result in competitive exclusion the number of coexisting species is determined by the speciation rate as in the neutral theory

24829,resting life stages e g dormant seeds and resting eggs have important implications for ecological and evolutionary processes in this study we simulated the impact of different environmental scenarios on the dynamics of resting eggs that make up an egg bank of a common fresh water ostracod heterocypris incongruens crustacea our goal was to investigate how the persistence and the wind mediated spatial distribution of the species in vernal temporary ponds on lampedusa island southern italy were affected a general model for selection on seed germination in unpredictable environments was used to simulate within pond egg bank dynamics metapopulation dynamics were simulated using levin s and hanski s models assuming three generalized spatial patterns of pond distribution random aggregated along the main wind direction evenly spaced along the main wind direction and two dispersion processes random walk and wind shear we applied global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis gsua to the models we estimated the egg bank growth rate based on 30 year simulations under present climatic conditions and assuming a 2 c rise in winter temperature under global climate change hatching rate and deterioration rate were the most important input factors for the dynamics of the egg bank in warmer winter conditions the probability that a pond water balance is positive a reliable hydroperiod estimation was the most important factor in the egg bank simulation dynamics regular distribution of ponds along the wind gradient and wind shear had the highest dispersal and colonizing potential considering the percentage of empty ponds reached 60 levins model predicted that the equilibrium varied between 0 and 8 of colonized ponds while hanski s model predicted values between 0 and 20 in hanski s model the rescue effect increased the probability of occupied ponds potential colonizing resting eggs and extinction rate were positively and negatively correlated to the percentage of colonized ponds respectively our simulations can be generalized to aquatic invertebrate taxa that inhabit temporary ponds have egg banks colonize habitats using few propagules and disperse passively

with variable and often extreme local environmental conditions e g time to full development and reproduction physiological mechanisms for surviving dry periods wiggins et al 1980 king et al 1996 hairston 1996 brendonck and de meester 2003 de meester et al 2005 crustacean dormant eggs can be dispersed over long distance by water fowl wind and human mediated dispersal cáceres and soluk 2002 de meester et al 2002 lockwood et al 2005 roman and darling 2007 resting eggs as well as seeds can be considered to some extent as space and time travelers but there are few studies in which both processes have been reported but see levin et al 1984 venable and brown 1988 cohen 1966 proposed a general model of selection on germination in an unpredictable environment the germination of seeds of desert annuals has been the subject of several empirical and theoretical studies brown and venable 1986 evans and dennehy 2005 gremer and venable 2014 cohen s model was applied to describe the optimal hatching strategy of resting eggs of crustaceans and rotifers in unpredictable ponds spencer et al 2001 maffei et al 2005 vanoverbeke and de meester 2009 garcía roger et al 2014 ponds and pools may be considered as aquatic islands in a terrestrial landscape the boundaries of local populations are easily determined and they fit the basic scheme of metapopulation theory levins 1969 caudill 2003 a metapopulation is a collection of patchy subpopulations connected by occasionally dispersing individuals begon et al 2006 perc et al 2013 each patch has a substantial extinction probability and long term population persistence occurs only at a regional level in the metapopulation thanks to colonization events there are currently many metapopulation models from the original by levins 1969 to more sophisticated ones harrison and taylor 1997 hanski 1999 smith and green 2005 metapopulation theory integrates processes occurring within populations with spatially structured interactions among local populations that enable the assessment of metapopulation persistence the metapopulation approach has been important for the development of spatial ecology and its application to conservation in metapopulations plant or animal populations are connected through dispersal and a combination of movement shared climate drivers and compensatory processes determine whether dynamics of individual populations reflect the dynamics of the aggregate metapopulation kendal 2000 the consideration of metapopulation structure has improved the management of different species okamoto et al 2018 in this study we used heterocypris incongruens crustacea ostracoda a species with a worldwide distribution as a model organism ostracods are important components of temporary ponds and survive dry periods as dormant eggs meisch 2000 dormant resting eggs are small 130 µm rossi et al 2013 and resistant to desiccation making the species a good disperser individual parthenogenetic females of h incongruens can produce both resting and non resting eggs genetically homogeneous during their whole reproductive cycle fecundity and proportion of resting eggs vary by clonal lineage environmental conditions e g temperature and photoperiod and their interaction rossi and menozzi 1990 1993 rossi et al 1998 2016 most resting eggs usually hatch synchronously at the start of each hydroperiod although changes in physicochemical conditions and maternal effects may affect hatching phenology rossi et al 2004 rossi et al 2015 on lampedusa island natural freshwater bodies form in autumn and winter following rainfall hydroperiod is variable and relatively unpredictable depending on precipitation and temperature rossi et al 2016 a parthenogenetic population of h incongruens was found only in a pond in the southeastern part of the island rossi et al 2007 theoretically the colonization of a new pond by a clonal lineage could start with a single egg and the effect of demographic events e g effective population size biased sex ratio and inbreeding depression on colonizing success may be excluded badosa et al 2017 because of high population growth rates and short generation time of the species in this work we developed a model of egg bank dynamics using a stepwise approach to capture different processes using lampedusa island as case study 1 the local dynamics of a pond egg bank 2 the spatial colonization of temporary ponds through wind mediated dispersal 3 the metapopulation dynamics the model is fitted to pond egg bank field data at present climatic conditions and to simulated within pond egg bank dynamics under a rise in winter temperature of 2 c due to global climate change urban 2015 we performed global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis gsua to evaluate models in terms of output uncertainty and factors importance for model outputs marino et al 2008 convertino et al 2014 2 material and methods we used the general model proposed by cohen 1966 to simulate within pond egg bank dynamics in unpredictable environments then we simulated the spatial colonization of temporary ponds by resting eggs by four different wind mediated dispersal models finally we used both levins 1969 and hanski 1982 models to simulate metapopulation dynamics combining extinction rate estimated by cohen s model and colonization rates estimated by dispersal models we tested our overall simulation results using lampedusa island as a case study lampedusa island located in the southern part of the mediterranean sea between sicily and tunisia 35 25 n 12 35 e has a sub triangular shape with a maximum length of about 11 km an area of 20 2 km2 and a sub planar surface tilted toward the southwest bellavere et al 1999 bellavere et al 2002 ephemeral water bodies form only after precipitations that occur almost only from september to april with highly variable intensity rossi et al 2017 water collects potentially everywhere but the majority of ponds were recorded in the northwestern part of the island the ponds highly variable hydroperiod has a maximum duration of 40 days and depends on precipitation temperature location and on the size of the pond to estimate potential hydroperiod we calculated mean monthly water balance as the difference between rainfall and potential evapotranspiration in the period from 1959 to 2009 potential evapotranspiration is the amount of water that could be evaporated and transpired if there were a sufficient amount of water available calculated by the algorithm proposed by thornthwaite 1948 http onlinecalc sdsu edu when water balance is positive it is reasonable to assume that a pool exists this approach produced hydroperiod estimates that fitted empirical observations over several years 1997 1998 1999 2004 and 2009 rossi et al 2016 considering the prevailing rocky nature of the substrate soil infiltration a process that may significantly contribute to the availability of temporary waters was not considered however it would have had a negative contribute to water balance making hydroperiod shorter and less reliable the monthly probability of positive water balance was calculated at present climatic conditions and assuming a rise in winter temperature of 2 c due to climate change the mean monthly precipitation was considered equal to the present condition a parthenogenetic population of h incongruens was found in a pond cavallo bianco located in the southeastern part of the island rossi et al 2007 to assess the production of resting eggs per female data on fecundity of clonal lineages of h incongruens from cavallo bianco were obtained by life table experiments rossi et al 2016 fecundity is temperature and photoperiod dependent clonal lineages were replicated across experiments that were carried out at 24 c and 12 light hours 12 dark hours photoperiod corresponding to the beginning of the rain season late september early october at 14 c and 10 light hours 14 dark hours photoperiod corresponding to the december february period and at 16 c and 12 light hours 12 dark hours photoperiod corresponding to late october or march rossi et al 2017 clonal lineages from cavallo bianco showed a mean age at deposition of 29 39 days and produced about 27 67 eggs per female and about 5 25 resting eggs per female rossi et al 2016 we assumed that the risk related to reproduction production of a new cohort of resting eggs in such ephemeral habitats varies according to potential hydroperiod and that only one generation may complete a reproductive cycle in a single hydroperiod 2 1 cohen model stochastic exponential growth rate the general model of cohen 1966 to compute the growth rate of seed banks in unpredictable environment was used to simulate within pond egg bank dynamics eq 1 cohen s model starts from a discrete balance law for the seed bank according to a gain term given by the production of new seeds and a loss term accounting for both decay and no germination the mathematical expectation of the specific growth rate was obtained by summing over the time steps and taking the logarithm for details see equations 2 4 in cohen 1966 in our perspective considering a semelparous organism that reproduces only once in its lifetime each growth and reproductive cycle is completed within a discrete time interval the average number of hatching eggs is a random variable depending on the amount of resting eggs produced by the previous generation and on environmental conditions and it was assumed to be independent of population density a fraction h of the total number of eggs hatches every time of the eggs that do not hatch another fraction d decays every time finally the same steps performed by cohen lead in our context to the equation 1 log λ 1 p log 1 h 1 d p log 1 h 1 d hy where log λ is the egg bank growth rate p is the probability that the water balance is positive h is the hatching rate d is the egg deterioration rate and y is the mean number of resting eggs produced per female rossi et al 2016 to perform the global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis gsua on cohen equation we assigned and estimated the distribution of the four factors hatching rate h probability that the water balance is positive p mean number of resting eggs produced per female y and deterioration rate d in present climatic conditions and assuming a rise in winter temperature of 2 c warmer winter probability that the water balance is positive p and mean number of resting eggs production y distributions were fitted from data rossi et al 2016 with loglikelihood method for hatching rate h and deterioration rate d parameters uniform distributions were assumed supplementary material tab 1sm and tab 2sm to explore the relationship between each factor and the cohen equation output log λ a latin hypercube samplings lhs method was applied to obtain 1000 combinations of the factors supplementary material r scritp 1 to evaluate the uncertainty of model output in both climatic conditions cumulative density functions cdfs and probability density functions pdfs of log λ were estimated to compare cdfs obtained in the present and warmer winter conditions kolmogorov smirnov test was used saltelli et al 2008 to perform a quantitative analysis of model sensitivity the sobol method was applied sobol 1993 saltelli et al 2008 the sobol method quantifies the influence of each input factors variation and factors interaction effects on the model output the most important input factors were ranked the improved formula of mauntz was used to estimate the first order sensitivity indices si and total effect indices for each factor st supplementary material r script 1 the sobol first order index measured the contribution of each input factor to the uncertainty of the model the analyses were performed with r package sensitivity and pse r core team 2017 the egg bank dynamics eb were simulated assuming exponential growth eq 2 over30 time steps years 2 e b t e b 0 e t log λ where ebt is the number of resting eggs at time t eb0 is the number of resting eggs at time 0 and log λ is the egg bank growth rate computed by cohen equation eq 1 we assumed that the environmental conditions are stable over 30 years and that there is no effect of competition of course for r strategists such as h incongruens absence of intra specific competition may be plausible in the early phase of population growth before the pond dries out intra specific competition may trigger specific responses such as cannibalism that we observed in laboratory crowded conditions rossi et al 2011 global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis was performed on eq 2 the distributions of factors hatching rate h probability that the water balance is positive p mean number of resting eggs produced per female y and deterioration rate d implicit in log λ were the same assumed on cohen equation whereas for factor eb0 a uniform distribution was assumed with ranges between 10 and 1000 supplementary material tab 1sm and tab 2sm in order to evaluate the contribution of each factor and hence the most important one for the model output ebt lhs sampling and sobol method were performed for each time step 2 2 pond distribution wind mediated dispersal simulation and colonization rate we assumed that one source pond and 10 sink ponds each of 5 m2 surface area a mean value considering minimum and maximum dimensions recorded by bellavere et al 1999 were distributed in a 500 500 m dispersal landscape according to three generalized spatial patterns of pond distribution one random and two along the main wind south west direction fig 1 random distributed ponds were uniformly distributed in space and hence the distance between the centroid of each pond is variable as an arbitrary factor if prevailing winds determine the spatial dispersal of resting eggs ostracods would be found only in the s e quadrant we called aggregate the distribution of ponds that were randomly distributed only in the fourth quadrant se and hence the distance between the centroid of each pond is variable as an arbitrary factor we called regular the distribution of ponds that were distributed only in the fourth quadrant regularly spaced 20 m in south west direction dispersion occurs only when water balance is less or equal to 0 vanschoenwinkel et al 2008 and it is reduced by annual deterioration rate estimated equal to 0 36 rossi personal observation there are no environmental obstacles to dispersion and a normal distribution of resting eggs dispersal distance was obtained considering a mean monthly distance of 30 m and a 5 m standard deviation vanschoenwinkel et al 2009 we considered wind mediated dispersal according to two dispersion models 1 random walk 2 wind shear dispersion models can take many different forms but the most widely used are based on the extensions of a simple random walk process codling 2008 the first model random walk was uncorrelated and unbiased the direction of movement is completely independent from the previous directions while the location after each step taken is dependent only on the location in the previous step the process is markovian with regard to the location weiss 1994 in the second model biased random walk wind shear the bias is due to a fixed wind direction in this model we considered the mean main wind direction in lampedusa 329 se direction and the relative standard deviation 10 83 we simulated six different annual amounts of dispersed resting eggs dre from the source pond 50 100 250 500 1000 2000 the simulations were performed with personal r script supplementary material r script 2 crawley 2013 and r package maptools r core team 2017 each simulation was replicated 100 times and the mean number of potential colonizing resting eggs pcre that reached sinks per year was estimated with the r package fitdistrplus r core team 2017 in each simulation the dispersal potential dp that is the maximum number of empty ponds reached by at least one egg normalized to the total number of ponds was recorded the relation between the potential dispersion and the annual amount of dispersed resting eggs dre from the source was fitted with the function nls nonlinear least square in r r core team 2017 the relation between the maximum number of empty ponds reached by at least one egg dp and the number of dispersed resting eggs dre was fitted on a michaelis menten function dp a dre 1 b dre the relation between the mean number of potential colonizing resting eggs pcre and the annual amount of dispersed resting eggs dre from the source was fitted with a liner regression for each spatial pattern and wind mediated dispersal the colonization rate c was computed as 3 c pcre p t o t dp mw w where pcre is the mean number of potential colonizing resting eggs that reached sinks per year ptot is the number of total patches and dp is the maximum number of empty ponds reached by at least one egg normalized to the total number of ponds mw is the percentage of months with positive water balance and is a constant value equal to 0 50 6 out of 12 months while w is a mean probability of positive water balance on lampedusa island rossi et al 2016 2 3 metapopulation dynamics levins 1969 introduced an important class of metapopulation models to determine given an initial value p0 the fraction of occupied patches in a homogeneous habitat p which is described by the differential equation 4 d p dt c p 1 p e p where in 4 the colonization rate c is the number of successfully colonized empty patches per time unit and the extinction rate e is the number of extinctions in occupied patches per time unit if p 1 all patches are occupied while if p 0 regional extinction occurred eq 4 is consistent for c e and admits in addition to the trivial null solution the equilibrium value p 1 e c which turns out to be globally asymptotically stable namely the fraction of occupied patches evolves towards p no matter what the initial value is hanski s model incorporates the rescue effect as the idea that emigrants from surrounding occupied patches may reduce the probability of local extinction brown and kodric brown 1977 the relevant equation is 5 d p dt c p 1 p e p 1 p with a given initial value p0 when p is small p 0 5 the extinction function e p increases as more patches are occupied when p is large p 0 5 the extinction function decreases as a result of the rescue effect in levins s model the extinction function e p always increases as more patches are occupied in contrast to levins s model the deterministic version of hanski s model can have different behaviour if c e p goes to 1 and if c e p goes to 0 the stochastic version of eq 5 behaves similarly if variation in rates of colonization and or extinction is sufficiently large gotelli 1991 global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis was performed for both levins and hanski models discretized with euler method along 100

summarized in table 3sm supplementary material to explore the relationship between each factor and the metapopulation models output pt lhs method was applied to obtain 1000 combinations supplementary material r script 3 to evaluate the uncertainty of models output in all combinations of pond distribution and dispersion models cumulative density functions cdfs of percentage of occupied colonized ponds were estimated to perform a quantitative analysis of model sensitivity partial rank correlation coefficients prccs were computed for both metapopulation models for each combination of ponds distribution and dispersion model 4 for each factor 4 and three times along 100 years 10 50 100 years marino et al 2008 saltelli et al 2010 to evaluate the correlation between factors and models output prcc values were compared with 0 by t test 3 results 3 1 cohen model and exponential growth equation the simulated mean annual growth rate of the egg bank log λ 1 47 sd 1 27 was lower in

were negatively correlated to the egg bank growth rate log λ while a positive correlation was found with the probability of a positive water balance p and the mean number of resting eggs per female y fig 2 in present climatic conditions hatching rate h and egg deterioration rate d were the most important factors both 0 32 first order sensitivity indices and 0 32 and 0 36 total effect indices respectively fig 3 in warmer winter conditions egg deterioration rate d and the probability of a positive water balance p were the most important factors with first order sensitivity indices 0 36 and 0 29 respectively total effect index st was equal to 0 36 for egg deterioration rate d and 0 45 for the probability that the water balance is positive p the input factor p interacts with all the other input factors but egg deterioration rate d in both climatic conditions mean number of resting eggs per female y was the least important factor in simulations of egg bank dynamics the importance of different factors varied with climatic conditions and years fig 4 in present conditions egg deterioration rate d hatching rate h and probability that water balance is positive p were the most important factors and their importance increased with time within 7 years for egg deterioration rate d and hatching rate h and within 3 years for probability that water balance is positive p in warmer winter conditions probability that the water balance is positive p egg deterioration rate d and hatching rate h were the most important factors and their importance increased with time within 7 years for probability that the water balance is positive p and egg deterioration rate d and within 3 years for hatching rate h in both climatic conditions at the beginning number of resting eggs at time 0

considering random distribution and random walk or aggregated distribution and wind shear both models predicted that the metapopulation does not persist and the population that actually inhabits the source pond will go extinct supplementary material fig 2sm a b d e considering regular distribution and wind shear both models predicted that the metapopulation dynamics reach an equilibrium different from zero supplementary material fig 2sm c f levins model predicted that the equilibrium varied between 0 and 8 of colonized ponds while hanski s model predicted that the equilibrium varied between 0

percentage of colonized ponds respectively supplementary material table 6sm the percentage of colonized ponds at time zero p0 was positively related to the output only at year 10 4 discussion and conclusion we used a stepwise model approach to study the dynamics of resting eggs in temporary ponds and its role in the persistence of aquatic invertebrates in temporary unpredictable habitats we evaluated two processes dormancy and dispersal the two strategies are often indicated as alternatives to cope with environmental fluctuations resting eggs have a key role in both as life forms capable of dispersal in time and space our model parametrization is based on field data of a common ostracod species heterocypris incongruens however our simulation approach can be extended to a broad number of aquatic invertebrates e g rotifers and crustaceans that cope with environment uncertainty persist in temporary habitats disperse passively via resting eggs and colonize new habitats from a few propagules temporary ponds host specialist species that survive recurrent dry periods thanks to drought resistant dormant life stages generally eggs that accumulate in the sediment as egg banks from there the following generations are recruited when a suitable hydroperiod is re established wiggins et al 1980 king et al 1996 williams 2006 brendonck et al 2017 cohen s model 1966 is one of the most quoted in the literature of dormancy and germination strategies in unpredictable environments and it it has been used to describe the optimal hatching strategy of crustaceans and rotifers spencer et al 2001 maffei et al 2005 vanoverbeke and de meester 2009 garcía roger et al 2014 egg banks have the potential to buffer population fluctuations to prevent local extinctions to maintain genetic variation and to increase effective population size de stasio 1989 gyllstrom and hansson 2004 hedrick 1995 brendonck and de meester 2003 nunney 2015 moreover despite the fact that resting egg banks may reduce the rate of evolution under certain conditions there is evidence of their role in rapid population growth and local adaptation resulting in the effective monopolization of resources yielding a strong priority effect hairston and de stasio 1988 cousyn et al 2001 de meester et al 2002 2011 latta et al 2012 orsini et al 2013 actually a major threat and a filter for putative colonists is the probability of a successful growth by global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis gsua we showed that hatching rate and egg deterioration rate were the most important factors in egg dynamics both factors were negatively correlated to the model output actually persistence and reproduction depend on the timing of the organims life cycle and the pond hydroperiod pyke 2005 vanschoenwinkel et al 2013 brendonck et al 2015 if the hydroperiod is shorter than the life cycle the result will be a demographic decline with a depletion of the egg bank proportional to the resting eggs hatching rate coping with uncertainty in the length of the growing season organisms hedge their bets adopting a risk spread strategy hatching spread hatching delays and asynchrony may be adaptive and better than to maximize and synchronize the hatching rate cohen 1966 maffei et al 2005 garcía roger et al 2014 the combination of a metapopulation approach with the evolutionarily expected optimal patterns for resting egg hatching is a way to get insights into the persistence of many aquatic invertebrates and this provides a motivation for modelling fréville et al 2013 and manna et al 2017 used the methods by cheptou who developed a hidden markov based inference method of seed bank dispersal and population extinction parameters from census data in order to use a model as a reasonable description of a natural phenomenon both a qualitative agreement between empirical observations and theoretical predictions and a good fitting of the model to field data are required persistence of h incongruens in lampedusa is linked to the egg bank growth rate and it will increase with warmer winters in warmer winter conditions the probability that the water balance is positive interacts more than in present climatic conditions with other input factors on sensitivity of egg bank growth rate this may be due to lower variability in water balance due to higher temperature the probability that the water balance is positive a reliable hydroperiod estimation was also the most important factor in egg bank dynamics however at equal rainfall we do not know the effect of a mismatch between temperature and photoperiod due to the altered timing of seasons and winter warming on adaptive potential production and hatching phenology of resting eggs lund et al 2016 toyota et al 2019 the combination of a regular distribution of ponds along prevailing wind direction and wind shear showed the highest dispersal potential 60 of empty ponds reached this was obtained at the maximum mean number of potential colonizing resting eggs this value is compatible with field data by rossi et al 2011 by two models of metapopulation dynamics levins 1969 and hanski 1982 we simulated the egg bank dynamics of h incongruens and the spatial colonization of temporary ponds by wind dispersal showing the successful colonization of regularly distributed ponds along wind shear se direction levins model predicted that the equilibrium varied between 0 and 8 of colonized ponds while hanski s model predicted values up to 20 in hanski s model the rescue effect increased the probability of occupied ponds in both models potential colonizing resting eggs and dispersal potential were positively correlated to the model output and to persistence probability for metapopulation our simulation is in agreement with field observation and potential colonization of h inconguens on lampedusa where we found the species only in the south eastern part of the island in cavallo bianco pond rossi et al 2007 if wind dispersal acts successfully only in regularly distributed ponds along wind shear with a prevailing wind from the northwest to the south east we cannot expect colonization of northern ponds by eggs that leave from cavallo bianco pond located in the southeastern part of the island moreover we cannot expect a successful southern colonization because putative wind dispersed propagules would end up in the sea there is no metapopulation structure of h incongruens on lampedusa and cavallo bianco could be the last regularly distributed ponds along the wind direction colonized by h incongruens the role of dispersal in structuring freshwater zooplankton communities is poorly understood cohen and shurin 2003 regional processes might be expected to play a large role due to the relative isolation of lakes and ponds and the lack of obvious dispersal mechanisms for most species according to cohen and shurin 2003 most of the species able to persist in the temporary ponds were also able to disperse over land natural ponds are expected to be more frequently invaded from the regional pool of species local processes are predicted to be more important than dispersal in structuring communities when dispersal rates greatly exceed extinction probabilities however it is very difficult to measure the effects of dispersal on the dynamics of local egg banks depending on the type of habitat resting stages can be dispersed to a variable degree by wind water movements waterfowl animals or humans brendonck and de meester 2003 cohen and shurin 2003 incagnone et al 2014 vanschoenwinkel et al 2009 pincel et al 2016 in ephemeral ponds that frequently dry out the impact of wind is expected especially in sites such as lampedusa a flat barren island in the sicily channel vanschoenwinkel et al 2009 showed that wind dispersal mode was effective on very local scales in open landscapes and may be relevant for shallow aquatic systems that dry periodically this may be the case for vernal ponds rock pools and even larger temporary ponds in arid and semi arid areas williams 2006 vanschoenwinkel et al 2009 rivas et al 2018 to be picked up a propagule must first be exposed to the wind this situation is common for aquatic systems that dry out regularly exposing the egg bank brendonck and de meester 2003 williams 2006 it has been shown that wind dispersal is maximum immediately after the last water has evaporated and it already occurred at wind speeds of around 6 7 km h vanschoenwinkel et al 2008 parekh et al 2014 pincel et al 2016 brendonck and riddoch 1999 quantified wind dispersal of resting eggs of branchipodopsis wolfi inhabiting shallow rock pools in southern africa they captured only a limited number of viable eggs during a whole month in the dry season if wind dispersal occurs on dry ponds beyond dispersal parameters such as the amount of dispersed resting eggs mean number of potential colonizing resting eggs and dispersal potential that are functions of temperature photoperiod and hydroperiod we should consider that wind direction and speeds change during the year the spatial configuration and the dispersal mode in case of ponds aligned along the wind direction allow the colonization especially in the initial phases 10 years in this case the effect of colonization rate prevails on extinction rate to maintain a metapopulation structure cohen and shurin 2003 stressed that colonization should be relatively homogeneous over short distances 1 km however zooplankton dispersal by wind may result in low rates of successful colonization because propagules randomly reached empty patches across the landscape cohen and shurin 2003 vanschoenwinkel et al 2009 this is in accordance with our simulation results which showed that the maximum dispersal potential the maximum number of potential colonizing resting eggs and the maximum colonization rate were obtained by a combination between regular distribution of empty ponds along main wind direction and wind shear wind may have an important role in colonization success both in the formation of ponds aelonian ponds and in the dispersal of resting eggs increasing the probability that propagules should reach suitable habitats along its direction cohen and shurin 2003 declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments we would like to dedicate this paper to the

24829,resting life stages e g dormant seeds and resting eggs have important implications for ecological and evolutionary processes in this study we simulated the impact of different environmental scenarios on the dynamics of resting eggs that make up an egg bank of a common fresh water ostracod heterocypris incongruens crustacea our goal was to investigate how the persistence and the wind mediated spatial distribution of the species in vernal temporary ponds on lampedusa island southern italy were affected a general model for selection on seed germination in unpredictable environments was used to simulate within pond egg bank dynamics metapopulation dynamics were simulated using levin s and hanski s models assuming three generalized spatial patterns of pond distribution random aggregated along the main wind direction evenly spaced along the main wind direction and two dispersion processes random walk and wind shear we applied global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis gsua to the models we estimated the egg bank growth rate based on 30 year simulations under present climatic conditions and assuming a 2 c rise in winter temperature under global climate change hatching rate and deterioration rate were the most important input factors for the dynamics of the egg bank in warmer winter conditions the probability that a pond water balance is positive a reliable hydroperiod estimation was the most important factor in the egg bank simulation dynamics regular distribution of ponds along the wind gradient and wind shear had the highest dispersal and colonizing potential considering the percentage of empty ponds reached 60 levins model predicted that the equilibrium varied between 0 and 8 of colonized ponds while hanski s model predicted values between 0 and 20 in hanski s model the rescue effect increased the probability of occupied ponds potential colonizing resting eggs and extinction rate were positively and negatively correlated to the percentage of colonized ponds respectively our simulations can be generalized to aquatic invertebrate taxa that inhabit temporary ponds have egg banks colonize habitats using few propagules and disperse passively

with variable and often extreme local environmental conditions e g time to full development and reproduction physiological mechanisms for surviving dry periods wiggins et al 1980 king et al 1996 hairston 1996 brendonck and de meester 2003 de meester et al 2005 crustacean dormant eggs can be dispersed over long distance by water fowl wind and human mediated dispersal cáceres and soluk 2002 de meester et al 2002 lockwood et al 2005 roman and darling 2007 resting eggs as well as seeds can be considered to some extent as space and time travelers but there are few studies in which both processes have been reported but see levin et al 1984 venable and brown 1988 cohen 1966 proposed a general model of selection on germination in an unpredictable environment the germination of seeds of desert annuals has been the subject of several empirical and theoretical studies brown and venable 1986 evans and dennehy 2005 gremer and venable 2014 cohen s model was applied to describe the optimal hatching strategy of resting eggs of crustaceans and rotifers in unpredictable ponds spencer et al 2001 maffei et al 2005 vanoverbeke and de meester 2009 garcía roger et al 2014 ponds and pools may be considered as aquatic islands in a terrestrial landscape the boundaries of local populations are easily determined and they fit the basic scheme of metapopulation theory levins 1969 caudill 2003 a metapopulation is a collection of patchy subpopulations connected by occasionally dispersing individuals begon et al 2006 perc et al 2013 each patch has a substantial extinction probability and long term population persistence occurs only at a regional level in the metapopulation thanks to colonization events there are currently many metapopulation models from the original by levins 1969 to more sophisticated ones harrison and taylor 1997 hanski 1999 smith and green 2005 metapopulation theory integrates processes occurring within populations with spatially structured interactions among local populations that enable the assessment of metapopulation persistence the metapopulation approach has been important for the development of spatial ecology and its application to conservation in metapopulations plant or animal populations are connected through dispersal and a combination of movement shared climate drivers and compensatory processes determine whether dynamics of individual populations reflect the dynamics of the aggregate metapopulation kendal 2000 the consideration of metapopulation structure has improved the management of different species okamoto et al 2018 in this study we used heterocypris incongruens crustacea ostracoda a species with a worldwide distribution as a model organism ostracods are important components of temporary ponds and survive dry periods as dormant eggs meisch 2000 dormant resting eggs are small 130 µm rossi et al 2013 and resistant to desiccation making the species a good disperser individual parthenogenetic females of h incongruens can produce both resting and non resting eggs genetically homogeneous during their whole reproductive cycle fecundity and proportion of resting eggs vary by clonal lineage environmental conditions e g temperature and photoperiod and their interaction rossi and menozzi 1990 1993 rossi et al 1998 2016 most resting eggs usually hatch synchronously at the start of each hydroperiod although changes in physicochemical conditions and maternal effects may affect hatching phenology rossi et al 2004 rossi et al 2015 on lampedusa island natural freshwater bodies form in autumn and winter following rainfall hydroperiod is variable and relatively unpredictable depending on precipitation and temperature rossi et al 2016 a parthenogenetic population of h incongruens was found only in a pond in the southeastern part of the island rossi et al 2007 theoretically the colonization of a new pond by a clonal lineage could start with a single egg and the effect of demographic events e g effective population size biased sex ratio and inbreeding depression on colonizing success may be excluded badosa et al 2017 because of high population growth rates and short generation time of the species in this work we developed a model of egg bank dynamics using a stepwise approach to capture different processes using lampedusa island as case study 1 the local dynamics of a pond egg bank 2 the spatial colonization of temporary ponds through wind mediated dispersal 3 the metapopulation dynamics the model is fitted to pond egg bank field data at present climatic conditions and to simulated within pond egg bank dynamics under a rise in winter temperature of 2 c due to global climate change urban 2015 we performed global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis gsua to evaluate models in terms of output uncertainty and factors importance for model outputs marino et al 2008 convertino et al 2014 2 material and methods we used the general model proposed by cohen 1966 to simulate within pond egg bank dynamics in unpredictable environments then we simulated the spatial colonization of temporary ponds by resting eggs by four different wind mediated dispersal models finally we used both levins 1969 and hanski 1982 models to simulate metapopulation dynamics combining extinction rate estimated by cohen s model and colonization rates estimated by dispersal models we tested our overall simulation results using lampedusa island as a case study lampedusa island located in the southern part of the mediterranean sea between sicily and tunisia 35 25 n 12 35 e has a sub triangular shape with a maximum length of about 11 km an area of 20 2 km2 and a sub planar surface tilted toward the southwest bellavere et al 1999 bellavere et al 2002 ephemeral water bodies form only after precipitations that occur almost only from september to april with highly variable intensity rossi et al 2017 water collects potentially everywhere but the majority of ponds were recorded in the northwestern part of the island the ponds highly variable hydroperiod has a maximum duration of 40 days and depends on precipitation temperature location and on the size of the pond to estimate potential hydroperiod we calculated mean monthly water balance as the difference between rainfall and potential evapotranspiration in the period from 1959 to 2009 potential evapotranspiration is the amount of water that could be evaporated and transpired if there were a sufficient amount of water available calculated by the algorithm proposed by thornthwaite 1948 http onlinecalc sdsu edu when water balance is positive it is reasonable to assume that a pool exists this approach produced hydroperiod estimates that fitted empirical observations over several years 1997 1998 1999 2004 and 2009 rossi et al 2016 considering the prevailing rocky nature of the substrate soil infiltration a process that may significantly contribute to the availability of temporary waters was not considered however it would have had a negative contribute to water balance making hydroperiod shorter and less reliable the monthly probability of positive water balance was calculated at present climatic conditions and assuming a rise in winter temperature of 2 c due to climate change the mean monthly precipitation was considered equal to the present condition a parthenogenetic population of h incongruens was found in a pond cavallo bianco located in the southeastern part of the island rossi et al 2007 to assess the production of resting eggs per female data on fecundity of clonal lineages of h incongruens from cavallo bianco were obtained by life table experiments rossi et al 2016 fecundity is temperature and photoperiod dependent clonal lineages were replicated across experiments that were carried out at 24 c and 12 light hours 12 dark hours photoperiod corresponding to the beginning of the rain season late september early october at 14 c and 10 light hours 14 dark hours photoperiod corresponding to the december february period and at 16 c and 12 light hours 12 dark hours photoperiod corresponding to late october or march rossi et al 2017 clonal lineages from cavallo bianco showed a mean age at deposition of 29 39 days and produced about 27 67 eggs per female and about 5 25 resting eggs per female rossi et al 2016 we assumed that the risk related to reproduction production of a new cohort of resting eggs in such ephemeral habitats varies according to potential hydroperiod and that only one generation may complete a reproductive cycle in a single hydroperiod 2 1 cohen model stochastic exponential growth rate the general model of cohen 1966 to compute the growth rate of seed banks in unpredictable environment was used to simulate within pond egg bank dynamics eq 1 cohen s model starts from a discrete balance law for the seed bank according to a gain term given by the production of new seeds and a loss term accounting for both decay and no germination the mathematical expectation of the specific growth rate was obtained by summing over the time steps and taking the logarithm for details see equations 2 4 in cohen 1966 in our perspective considering a semelparous organism that reproduces only once in its lifetime each growth and reproductive cycle is completed within a discrete time interval the average number of hatching eggs is a random variable depending on the amount of resting eggs produced by the previous generation and on environmental conditions and it was assumed to be independent of population density a fraction h of the total number of eggs hatches every time of the eggs that do not hatch another fraction d decays every time finally the same steps performed by cohen lead in our context to the equation 1 log λ 1 p log 1 h 1 d p log 1 h 1 d hy where log λ is the egg bank growth rate p is the probability that the water balance is positive h is the hatching rate d is the egg deterioration rate and y is the mean number of resting eggs produced per female rossi et al 2016 to perform the global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis gsua on cohen equation we assigned and estimated the distribution of the four factors hatching rate h probability that the water balance is positive p mean number of resting eggs produced per female y and deterioration rate d in present climatic conditions and assuming a rise in winter temperature of 2 c warmer winter probability that the water balance is positive p and mean number of resting eggs production y distributions were fitted from data rossi et al 2016 with loglikelihood method for hatching rate h and deterioration rate d parameters uniform distributions were assumed supplementary material tab 1sm and tab 2sm to explore the relationship between each factor and the cohen equation output log λ a latin hypercube samplings lhs method was applied to obtain 1000 combinations of the factors supplementary material r scritp 1 to evaluate the uncertainty of model output in both climatic conditions cumulative density functions cdfs and probability density functions pdfs of log λ were estimated to compare cdfs obtained in the present and warmer winter conditions kolmogorov smirnov test was used saltelli et al 2008 to perform a quantitative analysis of model sensitivity the sobol method was applied sobol 1993 saltelli et al 2008 the sobol method quantifies the influence of each input factors variation and factors interaction effects on the model output the most important input factors were ranked the improved formula of mauntz was used to estimate the first order sensitivity indices si and total effect indices for each factor st supplementary material r script 1 the sobol first order index measured the contribution of each input factor to the uncertainty of the model the analyses were performed with r package sensitivity and pse r core team 2017 the egg bank dynamics eb were simulated assuming exponential growth eq 2 over30 time steps years 2 e b t e b 0 e t log λ where ebt is the number of resting eggs at time t eb0 is the number of resting eggs at time 0 and log λ is the egg bank growth rate computed by cohen equation eq 1 we assumed that the environmental conditions are stable over 30 years and that there is no effect of competition of course for r strategists such as h incongruens absence of intra specific competition may be plausible in the early phase of population growth before the pond dries out intra specific competition may trigger specific responses such as cannibalism that we observed in laboratory crowded conditions rossi et al 2011 global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis was performed on eq 2 the distributions of factors hatching rate h probability that the water balance is positive p mean number of resting eggs produced per female y and deterioration rate d implicit in log λ were the same assumed on cohen equation whereas for factor eb0 a uniform distribution was assumed with ranges between 10 and 1000 supplementary material tab 1sm and tab 2sm in order to evaluate the contribution of each factor and hence the most important one for the model output ebt lhs sampling and sobol method were performed for each time step 2 2 pond distribution wind mediated dispersal simulation and colonization rate we assumed that one source pond and 10 sink ponds each of 5 m2 surface area a mean value considering minimum and maximum dimensions recorded by bellavere et al 1999 were distributed in a 500 500 m dispersal landscape according to three generalized spatial patterns of pond distribution one random and two along the main wind south west direction fig 1 random distributed ponds were uniformly distributed in space and hence the distance between the centroid of each pond is variable as an arbitrary factor if prevailing winds determine the spatial dispersal of resting eggs ostracods would be found only in the s e quadrant we called aggregate the distribution of ponds that were randomly distributed only in the fourth quadrant se and hence the distance between the centroid of each pond is variable as an arbitrary factor we called regular the distribution of ponds that were distributed only in the fourth quadrant regularly spaced 20 m in south west direction dispersion occurs only when water balance is less or equal to 0 vanschoenwinkel et al 2008 and it is reduced by annual deterioration rate estimated equal to 0 36 rossi personal observation there are no environmental obstacles to dispersion and a normal distribution of resting eggs dispersal distance was obtained considering a mean monthly distance of 30 m and a 5 m standard deviation vanschoenwinkel et al 2009 we considered wind mediated dispersal according to two dispersion models 1 random walk 2 wind shear dispersion models can take many different forms but the most widely used are based on the extensions of a simple random walk process codling 2008 the first model random walk was uncorrelated and unbiased the direction of movement is completely independent from the previous directions while the location after each step taken is dependent only on the location in the previous step the process is markovian with regard to the location weiss 1994 in the second model biased random walk wind shear the bias is due to a fixed wind direction in this model we considered the mean main wind direction in lampedusa 329 se direction and the relative standard deviation 10 83 we simulated six different annual amounts of dispersed resting eggs dre from the source pond 50 100 250 500 1000 2000 the simulations were performed with personal r script supplementary material r script 2 crawley 2013 and r package maptools r core team 2017 each simulation was replicated 100 times and the mean number of potential colonizing resting eggs pcre that reached sinks per year was estimated with the r package fitdistrplus r core team 2017 in each simulation the dispersal potential dp that is the maximum number of empty ponds reached by at least one egg normalized to the total number of ponds was recorded the relation between the potential dispersion and the annual amount of dispersed resting eggs dre from the source was fitted with the function nls nonlinear least square in r r core team 2017 the relation between the maximum number of empty ponds reached by at least one egg dp and the number of dispersed resting eggs dre was fitted on a michaelis menten function dp a dre 1 b dre the relation between the mean number of potential colonizing resting eggs pcre and the annual amount of dispersed resting eggs dre from the source was fitted with a liner regression for each spatial pattern and wind mediated dispersal the colonization rate c was computed as 3 c pcre p t o t dp mw w where pcre is the mean number of potential colonizing resting eggs that reached sinks per year ptot is the number of total patches and dp is the maximum number of empty ponds reached by at least one egg normalized to the total number of ponds mw is the percentage of months with positive water balance and is a constant value equal to 0 50 6 out of 12 months while w is a mean probability of positive water balance on lampedusa island rossi et al 2016 2 3 metapopulation dynamics levins 1969 introduced an important class of metapopulation models to determine given an initial value p0 the fraction of occupied patches in a homogeneous habitat p which is described by the differential equation 4 d p dt c p 1 p e p where in 4 the colonization rate c is the number of successfully colonized empty patches per time unit and the extinction rate e is the number of extinctions in occupied patches per time unit if p 1 all patches are occupied while if p 0 regional extinction occurred eq 4 is consistent for c e and admits in addition to the trivial null solution the equilibrium value p 1 e c which turns out to be globally asymptotically stable namely the fraction of occupied patches evolves towards p no matter what the initial value is hanski s model incorporates the rescue effect as the idea that emigrants from surrounding occupied patches may reduce the probability of local extinction brown and kodric brown 1977 the relevant equation is 5 d p dt c p 1 p e p 1 p with a given initial value p0 when p is small p 0 5 the extinction function e p increases as more patches are occupied when p is large p 0 5 the extinction function decreases as a result of the rescue effect in levins s model the extinction function e p always increases as more patches are occupied in contrast to levins s model the deterministic version of hanski s model can have different behaviour if c e p goes to 1 and if c e p goes to 0 the stochastic version of eq 5 behaves similarly if variation in rates of colonization and or extinction is sufficiently large gotelli 1991 global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis was performed for both levins and hanski models discretized with euler method along 100 years considering three generalized spatial patterns of ponds distribution random aggregated according main wind direction regular along main wind direction and two dispersion models random walk wind

ponds dp mean probability of positive water balance mw eq 3 extinction rate e and percentage of colonized ponds at the beginning of simulation p0 in levins and hunski models eqs 4 and 5 were summarized in table 3sm supplementary material to explore the relationship between each factor and the metapopulation models output pt lhs method was applied to obtain 1000 combinations supplementary material r script 3 to evaluate the uncertainty of models output in all combinations of pond distribution and dispersion models cumulative density functions cdfs of percentage of occupied colonized ponds were estimated to perform a quantitative analysis of model sensitivity partial rank correlation coefficients prccs were computed for both metapopulation models for each combination of ponds distribution and dispersion model 4 for each factor 4 and three times along 100 years 10 50 100 years marino et al 2008 saltelli et al 2010 to evaluate the correlation between factors and models output prcc values were compared with 0 by t test 3 results 3 1 cohen model and exponential growth equation the simulated mean annual growth rate of the egg bank log λ 1 47 sd 1 27 was lower in

were negatively correlated to the egg bank growth rate log λ while a positive correlation was found with the probability of a positive water balance p and the mean number of resting eggs per female y fig 2 in present climatic conditions hatching rate h and egg deterioration rate d were the most important factors both 0 32 first order sensitivity indices and 0 32 and 0 36 total effect indices respectively fig 3 in warmer winter conditions egg deterioration rate d and the probability of a positive water balance p were the most important factors with first order sensitivity indices 0 36 and 0 29 respectively total effect index st was equal to 0 36 for egg deterioration rate d and 0 45 for the probability that the water balance is positive p the input factor p interacts with all the other input factors but egg deterioration rate d in both climatic conditions mean number of resting eggs per female y was the least important factor in simulations of egg bank dynamics the importance of different factors varied with climatic conditions and years fig 4 in present conditions egg deterioration rate d hatching rate h and probability that water balance is positive p were the most important factors and their importance increased with time within 7 years for egg deterioration rate d and hatching rate h and within 3 years for probability that water balance is positive p in warmer winter conditions probability that the water balance is positive p egg deterioration rate d and hatching rate h were the most important factors and their importance increased with time within 7 years for probability that the water balance is positive p and egg deterioration rate d and within 3 years for hatching rate h in both climatic conditions at the beginning number of resting eggs at time 0 eb0 was the most important factor and its importance decreased steeply within the first year 3 2 pond distribution wind mediated dispersal simulation and colonization rate for 3 out of 4 combinations of spatial pattern and wind mediated dispersal dispersal potential dp increased with dispersed resting eggs dre until a plateau fig 5 the simulation under random distribution of ponds and random walk

considering random distribution and random walk or aggregated distribution and wind shear both models predicted that the metapopulation does not persist and the population that actually inhabits the source pond will go extinct supplementary material fig 2sm a b d e considering regular distribution and wind shear both models predicted that the metapopulation dynamics reach an equilibrium different from zero supplementary material fig 2sm c f levins model predicted that the equilibrium varied between 0 and 8 of colonized ponds while hanski s model predicted that the equilibrium varied between 0

percentage of colonized ponds respectively supplementary material table 6sm the percentage of colonized ponds at time zero p0 was positively related to the output only at year 10 4 discussion and conclusion we used a stepwise model approach to study the dynamics of resting eggs in temporary ponds and its role in the persistence of aquatic invertebrates in temporary unpredictable habitats we evaluated two processes dormancy and dispersal the two strategies are often indicated as alternatives to cope with environmental fluctuations resting eggs have a key role in both as life forms capable of dispersal in time and space our model parametrization is based on field data of a common ostracod species heterocypris incongruens however our simulation approach can be extended to a broad number of aquatic invertebrates e g rotifers and crustaceans that cope with environment uncertainty persist in temporary habitats disperse passively via resting eggs and colonize new habitats from a few propagules temporary ponds host specialist species that survive recurrent dry periods thanks to drought resistant dormant life stages generally eggs that accumulate in the sediment as egg banks from there the following generations are recruited when a suitable hydroperiod is re established wiggins et al 1980 king et al 1996 williams 2006 brendonck et al 2017 cohen s model 1966 is one of the most quoted in the literature of dormancy and germination strategies in unpredictable environments and it it has been used to describe the optimal hatching strategy of crustaceans and rotifers spencer et al 2001 maffei et al 2005 vanoverbeke and de meester 2009 garcía roger et al 2014 egg banks have the potential to buffer population fluctuations to prevent local extinctions to maintain genetic variation and to increase effective population size de stasio 1989 gyllstrom and hansson 2004 hedrick 1995 brendonck and de meester 2003 nunney 2015 moreover despite the fact that resting egg banks may reduce the rate of evolution under certain conditions there is evidence of their role in rapid population growth and local adaptation resulting in the effective monopolization of resources yielding a strong priority effect hairston and de stasio 1988 cousyn et al 2001 de meester et al 2002 2011 latta et al 2012 orsini et al 2013 actually a major threat and a filter for putative colonists is the probability of a successful growth by global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis gsua we showed that hatching rate and egg deterioration rate were the most important factors in egg dynamics both factors were negatively correlated to the model output actually persistence and reproduction depend on the timing of the organims life cycle and the pond hydroperiod pyke 2005 vanschoenwinkel et al 2013 brendonck et al 2015 if the hydroperiod is shorter than the life cycle the result will be a demographic decline with a depletion of the egg bank proportional to the resting eggs hatching rate coping with uncertainty in the length of the growing season organisms hedge their bets adopting a risk spread strategy hatching spread hatching delays and asynchrony may be adaptive and better than to maximize and synchronize the hatching rate cohen 1966 maffei et al 2005 garcía roger et al 2014 the combination of a metapopulation approach with the evolutionarily expected optimal patterns for resting egg hatching is a way to get insights into the persistence of many aquatic invertebrates and this provides a motivation for modelling fréville et al 2013 and manna et al 2017 used the methods by cheptou who developed a hidden markov based inference method of seed bank dispersal and population extinction parameters from census data in order to use a model as a reasonable description of a natural phenomenon both a qualitative agreement between empirical observations and theoretical predictions and a good fitting of the model to field data are required persistence of h incongruens in lampedusa is linked to the egg bank growth rate and it will increase with warmer winters in warmer winter conditions the probability that the water balance is positive interacts more than in present climatic conditions with other input factors on sensitivity of egg bank growth rate this may be due to lower variability in water balance due to higher temperature the probability that the water balance is positive a reliable hydroperiod estimation was also the most important factor in egg bank dynamics however at equal rainfall we do not know the effect of a mismatch between temperature and photoperiod due to the altered timing of seasons and winter warming on adaptive potential production and hatching phenology of resting eggs lund et al 2016 toyota et al 2019 the combination of a regular distribution of ponds along prevailing wind direction and wind shear showed the highest dispersal potential 60 of empty ponds reached this was obtained at the maximum mean number of potential colonizing resting eggs this value is compatible with field data by rossi et al 2011 by two models of metapopulation dynamics levins 1969 and hanski 1982 we simulated the egg bank dynamics of h incongruens and the spatial colonization of temporary ponds by wind dispersal showing the successful colonization of regularly distributed ponds along wind shear se direction levins model predicted that the equilibrium varied between 0 and 8 of colonized ponds while hanski s model predicted values up to 20 in hanski s model the rescue effect increased the probability of occupied ponds in both models potential colonizing resting eggs and dispersal potential were positively correlated to the model output and to persistence probability for metapopulation our simulation is in agreement with field observation and potential colonization of h inconguens on lampedusa where we found the species only in the south eastern part of the island in cavallo bianco pond rossi et al 2007 if wind dispersal acts successfully only in regularly distributed ponds along wind shear with a prevailing wind from the northwest to the south east we cannot expect colonization of northern ponds by eggs that leave from cavallo bianco pond located in the southeastern part of the island moreover we cannot expect a successful southern colonization because putative wind dispersed propagules would end up in the sea there is no metapopulation structure of h incongruens on lampedusa and cavallo bianco could be the last regularly distributed ponds along the wind direction colonized by h incongruens the role of dispersal in structuring freshwater zooplankton communities is poorly understood cohen and shurin 2003 regional processes might be expected to play a large role due to the relative isolation of lakes and ponds and the lack of obvious dispersal mechanisms for most species according to cohen and shurin 2003 most of the species able to persist in the temporary ponds were also able to disperse over land natural ponds are expected to be more frequently invaded from the regional pool of species local processes are predicted to be more important than dispersal in structuring communities when dispersal rates greatly exceed extinction probabilities however it is very difficult to measure the effects of dispersal on the dynamics of local egg banks depending on the type of habitat resting stages can be dispersed to a variable degree by wind water movements waterfowl animals or humans brendonck and de meester 2003 cohen and shurin 2003 incagnone et al 2014 vanschoenwinkel et al 2009 pincel et al 2016 in ephemeral ponds that frequently dry out the impact of wind is expected especially in sites such as lampedusa a flat barren island in the sicily channel vanschoenwinkel et al 2009 showed that wind dispersal mode was effective on very local scales in open landscapes and may be relevant for shallow aquatic systems that dry periodically this may be the case for vernal ponds rock pools and even larger temporary ponds in arid and semi arid areas williams 2006 vanschoenwinkel et al 2009 rivas et al 2018 to be picked up a propagule must first be exposed to the wind this situation is common for aquatic systems that dry out regularly exposing the egg bank brendonck and de meester 2003 williams 2006 it has been shown that wind dispersal is maximum immediately after the last water has evaporated and it already occurred at wind speeds of around 6 7 km h vanschoenwinkel et al 2008 parekh et al 2014 pincel et al 2016 brendonck and riddoch 1999 quantified wind dispersal of resting eggs of branchipodopsis wolfi inhabiting shallow rock pools in southern africa they captured only a limited number of viable eggs during a whole month in the dry season if wind dispersal occurs on dry ponds beyond dispersal parameters such as the amount of dispersed resting eggs mean number of potential colonizing resting eggs and dispersal potential that are functions of temperature photoperiod and hydroperiod we should consider that wind direction and speeds change during the year the spatial configuration and the dispersal mode in case of ponds aligned along the wind direction allow the colonization especially in the initial phases 10 years in this case the effect of colonization rate prevails on extinction rate to maintain a metapopulation structure cohen and shurin 2003 stressed that colonization should be relatively homogeneous over short distances 1 km however zooplankton dispersal by wind may result in low rates of successful colonization because propagules randomly reached empty patches across the landscape cohen and shurin 2003 vanschoenwinkel et al 2009 this is in accordance with our simulation results which showed that the maximum dispersal potential the maximum number of potential colonizing resting eggs and the maximum colonization rate were obtained by a combination between regular distribution of empty ponds along main wind direction and wind shear wind may have an important role in colonization success both in the formation of ponds aelonian ponds and in the dispersal of resting eggs increasing the probability that propagules should reach suitable habitats along its direction cohen and shurin 2003 declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments we would like to dedicate this paper to the
