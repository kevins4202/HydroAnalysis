17180,algae as primary producers in riverine ecosystems are found in two distinct habitats benthic and pelagic algae typically prevalent in shallow small and deep large streams respectively over an entire river continuum spatiotemporal patterns of the two algal communities reflect specificity in habitat preference determined by geomorphic structure hydroclimatic controls and spatiotemporal heterogeneity in nutrient loads from point and diffuse sources by representing these complex interactions between geomorphic hydrologic geochemical and ecological processes we present here a new river network scale dynamic model cnandy for pelagic a and benthic b algae competing for energy and one limiting nutrient phosphorus p we used the urbanized weser river basin in germany 7th order 8 4 million population 46 k km2 as a case study and analyzed simulations for equilibrium mass and concentrations under steady median river discharge we also examined p a and b spatial patterns in four sub basins we found an emerging pattern characterized by scaling of p and a concentrations over stream order ω whereas b concentration was described by three distinct phases furthermore an abrupt algal regime shift occurred in intermediate streams from b dominance in ω 3 to exclusive a presence in ω 6 modeled and long term basin scale monitored dissolved p concentrations matched well for ω 4 and with overlapping ranges in ω 3 power spectral analyses for the equilibrium p a and b mass distributions along hydrological flow paths showed stronger clustering compared to geomorphological attributes and longer spatial autocorrelation distance for a compared to b we discuss the implications of our findings for advancing hydro ecological concepts guiding monitoring informing management of water quality restoring aquatic habitat and extending cnandy model to other river basins graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eutrophication regime shifts hortonian scaling spatial autocorrelation 1 introduction algae are primary producers in streams and rivers and are used as indicators to assess water quality and ecological status allan and castillo 2007 stevenson and smol 2015 identifying potential hot spots for eutrophication pelagic and benthic algal blooms in impaired aquatic ecosystems resulting from anthropogenic pressures is key for mitigation and restoration le moal et al 2019 however at the scale of an entire river network this task is challenging as convolution along all flow paths is required to discern longitudinal patterns of pelagic and benthic algal communities as hypothesized by the river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 such challenges are mainly attributed to the spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics in dominant coupled processes complex feedbacks among land use patterns generating point and diffuse sources of nutrients geomorphic attributes of the river network structure hydrologic conditions discharge and water stage and geochemical dynamics in stream processes combine to shape the ecological algal dynamics across river networks dong et al 2017 it is noteworthy that most efforts to develop process based models of algal dynamics in rivers have focused only on pelagic algal community existing models cover a single river reach such as riverstrahler billen et al 1994 aissa grouz et al 2018 and qsim schöl et al 1999 as well as the entire river network such as tapir istvánovics et al 2014 qual net minaudo et al 2018 and the ann based model soro et al 2020 process based models of coupled pelagic benthic algal dynamics have been proposed pelletier et al 2006 jäger et al 2017 jäger and borchardt 2018 however their application has so far been restricted to a single reach to our knowledge and available review papers e g sharma and kansal 2013 wasp7 is the only comprehensive process based model simulating both pelagic and benthic algal dynamics with coupled carbon nitrogen phosphorus processes using a mass balance framework over entire river networks ambrose and wool 2009 however most process based complex models for simulating algal dynamics in river networks require extensive amount of observed data and or estimates for fitting or calibrating model parameters flipo et al 2004 model simulations for a selected small study area typically match observed data only after thorough calibration of many model parameters hipsey et al 2020 it is highly challenging to apply complex models at meso scales or in data poor river basins because of the daunting task of collecting and characterizing data or because of the sparse availability of observational data caused by extensive resources needed for systematic long term monitoring campaigns over the whole catchment mannina and viviani 2010 rutherford christopher et al 2020 particularly in developing countries chapra 2011 given these limitations and over parameterization problems wellen et al 2015 there is an increasing awareness of the need for simpler process based approaches in modeling river water quality and aquatic ecosystems by emphasizing holistic system understanding and for screening purposes kirchner 2006 jackson blake and starrfelt 2015 embracing this spirit a process based parsimonious model for algal dynamics under steady state river systems was developed chapra et al 2014 but only for benthic algal community and at the scale of a single reach parsimonious but process based models for both pelagic and benthic algae at the whole river network scale inevitably face two key challenges in data model comparisons 1 uncertainty in parameter estimation and 2 sparsity in observational data for model validation time series data are often available at a single location e g basin outlet or synoptic sampling at multiple locations but at infrequent intervals a possible alternative can be reliance on spatial analysis approaches for identifying spatial patterns of water quality and ecological status with the potential for transferring to other basins yang et al 2019a in this spirit we develop a river network scale parsimonious model named cnandy coupled complex algal nutrient dynamics fig 1 a section 2 1 for simulating the coupled dynamics of pelagic and benthic algae competing for one limiting nutrient phosphorus p and energy solar radiation we link at the river network scale the following key processes 1 variability in water stage and discharge across all streams 2 heterogeneity of point and diffuse sources of p 3 in stream geochemical processes for p cycling hyporheic uptake and 4 two dominant controls nutrient and light driving competitive growth of pelagic and benthic algae our modeling analyses can contribute to informing action plans for protection of river water quality and aquatic ecosystems to manage eutrophication such as demanded by the eu water framework directive european commission 2000 and the united nations resolution on global water quality unep jrc 2019 our analyses of a river basin wide case study weser river in germany details in section 2 2 are interpreted to test two primary hypotheses one related to spatial patterns of the competing algal communities over the entire river network and the other related to scaling of nutrient and algal patterns across the river network hierarchy the river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 and the process based reach scale model simulations jäger et al 2017 jäger and borchardt 2018 suggest a longitudinal gradient from benthic algae dominance in upstream shallow streams to pelagic algae prevalence in deeper downstream reaches we hypothesize that spatial patterns of pelagic and benthic algae would exhibit distinct mutually exclusive but predictable regimes across the river network with shifts between pelagic and benthic algal regimes occurring wherever light penetration is significantly limited by the river stage and pelagic algal shading universally consistent scaling signatures exist within river network structure dodds and rothman 2000 rodríguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 yang and paik 2017 and are reflected also in scaling of hydraulic geometry leopold and maddock 1953 dong et al 2019 geochemical attributes basu et al 2011 bertuzzo et al 2017 human settlement patterns fang et al 2018 yang et al 2019a and anthropogenic pressures descriptors miyamoto et al 2011 yang et al 2019b on this basis we hypothesize that ecological metrics e g algal biomass gross algal primary production would also exhibit similar scaling features 2 methods and materials 2 1 cnandy model structure for each reach i with a length li two types of algal habitats exist a streambed with a width wi and a surface water column with a depth di from the surface to the streambed we assume one algal taxon that can grow in both benthic and pelagic habitats such as species of the genera navicula dinobryon scenedesmus jäger et al 2017 jäger and borchardt 2018 relying on needed nutrients and light resources algal dynamics are coupled with macro and micro nutrients in reality however in the spirit of a parsimonious approach discussed before we consider only nutrient phosphorus which is known to be the key limiting nutrient for algal growth in many fresh waters and to often trigger eutrophication carpenter 2008 aissa grouz et al 2018 liang et al 2020 we assume vertically well mixed dissolved p within a reach equally available for both pelagic and benthic algae hence one state variable for dissolved inorganic phosphorus p in the units of mass is coupled with state variables for benthic and pelagic algae b and a respectively in the mass units based on a mass balance approach in each river reach we assume steady state water flow with a constant mean velocity vi that transports both the dissolved nutrient and the pelagic algae based on a single reach model developed for the coupled dynamics of phosphorus and two competing algae jäger et al 2017 jäger and borchardt 2018 we describe the temporal dynamics of the three state variables for every reach pi bi and ai in our network model as 1 d p i d t ϕ i w w t p ϕ i d s j e j q j p j v j q i p i v i c g b i b i c g a i a i v

parameters are defined in table s1 in the supplementary information si the input loads of nutrient phosphorus in reach i consist of three types 1 discharges from wastewater treatment plants wwtps as ϕi wwtp point source loads 2 delivered from direct drainage areas categorized by different land covers as ϕi ds diffuse source loads and 3 transported from all upstream reaches j as j e j q j p j v j where ej is an element of the connectivity matrix marking river flow existence i e ei 1 ei 0 if no flow exists between the upstream reach j and the downstream reach i and qj is river discharge and vj is of the volume of the upstream reach j we assume that both ϕi wwtp and ϕi ds are temporally invariant for each reach i the advection mechanism leads to the output flux of the dissolved nutrient for the reach i as qipi vi moreover the dissolved nutrient phosphorus in reach i is removed by two key processes 1 nutrient uptake by both benthic and pelagic algae in reach i to contribute to gross primary production for both algal communities assuming a constant algal nutrient to carbon quota c as c gb ibi ga iai where gb i and ga i are the growth rate of benthic and pelagic algae respectively and 2 natural attenuation through hyporheic zone of which the net uptake rate is inversely related to the depth d as vf i di where vf i is the uptake velocity for phosphorus in the hyporheic zone basu et al 2011 in this study we assume spatially homogeneous vf as 0 17 m day estimated from our former study yang et al 2019b we implicitly consider abiotic processes for p into the first order decay term by assuming a net sink effect for each reach regeneration of p in the water column through recycling of dead algae is not explicitly expressed in the model processes because it would be of minor importance when compared to anthropogenic nutrient p loads from point and diffuse sources in urbanized and cultivated catchments the decisions were based on the goal to develop a parsimonious approach that considers the first order dominant processes and sources new algal biomass is produced at gross production rate gb i on the streambed and at ga i in the water column of reach i existing algae in the benthic and pelagic habitats of reach i are lost at the rate of μ l b and μ l a respectively here we assume that grazing effects in each habit dominantly contribute to the loss rates due to scouring effect benthic algae suffer additional loss at rate μ s the detached benthic algae emigrate to the water column and in turn are involved in pelagic algae biomass advective flux for pelagic algae is embedded in the temporal dynamics of pelagic algae in reach i which are the influx from direct upstream reaches and the outflux at the reach i downstream the gross production rate of benthic algae is related to the light intensity that penetrates on the streambed id i the available nutrient and the density effect with maximum concentration for benthic algae under neither light nor nutrient limitations bk 4 g b i μ p i d i i d i h p i p i m v i 1 b i b k s i the light intensity is vertically attenuated by light blocking of pelagic algae with an attenuation coefficient k and by background turbidity with coefficient kbg according to lambert beer s law with light intensity on the top of water column io id i is expressed as 5 i d i i o exp d i k a i v i k b g following huisman and weissing 1995 and more recent works e g jäger and borchardt 2018 we assume that light and a single dissolved nutrient co limit primary production of pelagic algae in reach i as 6 g a i i i d p i μ p i i d i i d h p i p i m v i where ii d is the light intensity that penetrates in reach i at depth d since vertically well mixed water in reach i is assumed pelagic algae production can be expressed huisman and weissing 1995 by averaging eq 6 over the water depth of reach i di as 7 g a i μ p 1 d i k a i v i k b g ln h i o h i d i p i p i m v i we ran the model under steady state river discharge condition spatially homogeneous light intensity at the water surface and constant but spatially variable nutrient loads input seasonally variable shading from riparian vegetation especially in small upstream reaches and seasonal temperature variations were not considered in this model initial conditions were set as spatially homogeneous concentrations with 50 mgp m3 for dissolved phosphorus 200 mgc m3 for pelagic algae and 100 mgc m2 for benthic algae being aligned with reference conditions boundary condition at the river basin outlet was considered as existing advective flux for nutrient and pelagic algae we numerically integrated the model equations until the system reached the temporal equilibrium state for all three state variables all time derivative almost equal to zero specifically we simulated the system through a forward explicit euler scheme until starting from the initial condition steady state was reached the differences between two subsequent timesteps of every state variable are less than 10 6 we used a daily timestep which always ensured convergence to the steady state solution note that the steady state solution is independent of the initial condition but an initial condition close to the steady state solution can accelerate convergence mass and concentration at the equilibrium for a given variable z z p a and b are denoted as z and z conc respectively we estimated depth di and width wi for each reach i based on power law scaling with river discharge qi for the same frequency of occurrence well known as downstream hydraulic geometry leopold and maddock 1953 as 8 w i k w q i α w 9 d i k d q i α d where the power law exponents α w 0 5 and α d 0 4 are consistently found from many rivers leopold and maddock 1953 knighton 1998 and coefficients kw 10 m1 3α w s α w and k d 0 25 m1 3α d s α d since kw and k d are positively correlated knighton 1998 we note that changing their values would insignificantly affect varying spatial patterns at a river network scale for the state variables at the equilibrium 2 2 study area our study area is germany s largest national river basin weser river of 46 k km2 fig 1 b the river network was extracted using 100 m x 100 m grid dems with a channel forming area of 10 km2 zink et al 2017 the delineated river network consists of 1700 stream segments here a segment means a channel portion between two successive confluences the main stem 700 km long stretches from a small tributary in south eastern part to the basin outlet with the final 7th stream order horton 1945 strahler 1957 small streams with low orders from 1 to 3 account for 86 of a total length of 12 k km note that again our core interest is the river network scale spatial dynamics of the coupled p and two algal communities under a temporally representative hydrological condition we considered steady state median river discharge over the entire weser river by multiplying drainage area of a given point within the river network with median value of specific discharge q 203 mm yr in may 1950 2019 measured at the intschede gaging station shown in fig 1 b spatial variability in hydroclimatic forcing is out of our scope here total phosphorus inputs to the weser river are estimated as 3440 tons p yr with 28 from point sources and 72 from diffuse sources essential descriptions for the point and diffuse sources and the monitoring data are given in below three sub sections detailed information for the study area such as hydrological conditions and p loads estimation by land covers is described in si sec s1 2 2 1 point sources of p in the weser river basin 845 wastewater treatment plants wwtps serving 8 4 million people with 97 connection eea 2017 with a mean density of 2 wwtps 100 km2 and a mean separate distance of 11 km fig 1 c were identified from national scale reliable dataset for 8900 wwtps in germany büttner 2020 german wwtps are categorized based on the magnitude serving population equivalent as five class sizes based on german regulations https www gesetze iminternet de abwv anhang 1 html two largest class sizes deploy the mandatory tertiary treatment technology to satisfy regulatory nutrient loads discharged while the other three small class sizes have no regulatory requirements eec 1991 around 957 tons p yr loads for 2012 2016 are discharged to the weser river from all wwtps and the two large class sizes 31 of total wwtps contribute to 680 tons p yr discharge 71 of total larger class sizes wwtps are clustered toward the basin outlet while smaller ones towards upstream yang et al 2019a 2 2 2 diffuse sources of p land cover patterns in the weser river basin were based on the corine land cover clc 100 m grid data version 20 for 2012 year to be consistent with point source loads data reference time https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover the clc spatial map for the weser river basin fig 1 d manifests the dominance of agricultural areas 59 the scattered urban areas 9 and upstream clustered formation of forest semi natural areas 31 2 2 3 archived monitoring data the scope of available monitoring dataset aligned with this study should be stressed 1 only pelagic chlorophyll a concentration during march to october 2000 2018 at the hemelingen station which is located most downstream without tidal effect shown in fig 1 b skums 2019 2 orthophosphate as phosphorus and total phosphorus concentrations during january to december 2000 2018 at the hemelingen station bfg 2019 and 3 soluble reactive phosphorus srp concentration at 300 locations covering all 7 stream orders obtained from the official eionet european environmental information and observation network and wfd sample sites we used the first two dataset for estimating key model parameters details in si sec s2 and the last one for our model validation to maximize the available data application given in section 3 2 2 3 data analysis metrics spatial pattern analyses were implemented through two primary aspects 1 the spatial hierarchy by stream orders ω in a river network or by the associated contributing drainage areas that comprehensively characterize geomorphic features in a given river basin and 2 the power spectral to quantify the patterns of the longitudinal distributions of our interested variables along flow paths detailed explanation and the associated references are given in si sec s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial patterns of phosphorus and algal biomass a conc and b conc exhibited opposite spatial trends a conc was higher in larger streams along the main stem fig 2 a while b conc was higher in small headwater streams fig 2 b these results are aligned with well known habitat preferences hilton et al 2006 jäger and borchardt 2018 indicating that our model formulation and simulations generate essential aspects of the drivers for growth of the two algae competing for light and nutrient si fig s1 the contrasting patterns between a conc and b conc result from three factors 1 benthic algae outcompete pelagic algae for available p in small streams and lower river stage promotes sufficient light penetration 2 pelagic algae dominate in larger streams where light limitations from depth and pelagic algal shading combine to preclude benthic algae and 3 higher density of pelagic algae limits growth by self shading given the lack of monitoring data for the network scale algal concentrations within the network to corroborate the simulated spatial patterns for a conc and b conc we relied on the eu scale authorized assessment status in 2016 for phytoplankton and macrophytes phytobenthos for the weser river basin european environment agency 2018 figs 2 c and d as the two indicators from four biological quality elements determining ecological status for surface water bodies under the eu wfd european commission 2000 we stress that simulation results of a parsimonious model cannot be always demonstrated through empirical data e g chapra et al 2014 in that case the relevant proxy can be used for indirect demonstration of parsimonious model results note that the color coded status levels cannot directly be compared with the spatial gradients in a conc and b conc because the status assessment criteria are based on taxonomic abundance and composition of the indicative parameters nevertheless the referred maps figs 2 c and d indirectly support the occurrence of pelagic algae mostly in large streams fig 2 a and the prevalence of benthic algae in small streams fig 2 b respectively despite cumulative input p loads lower p conc in larger streams resulted from combined losses via in stream spiraling and algal uptake while locally higher p conc in smaller streams was mainly attributed to p loads from wwtps fig 2 e mean of p conc 148 mgp m3 over the entire weser river exceeded by almost 50 the level needed to achieve good ecological status 100 mgp m3 for total p as defined by the eu wfd heidecke et al 2015 over stream orders distinct patterns for p conc a conc and b conc emerged fig 2 f consistent changes for p conc and a conc over ω were respectively quantified using hortonian scaling ratios of rpc 1 43 and rac 1 91 r2 0 9 p 0 01 for b conc ω based pattern was characterized by an inverse logistic curve as ω decreased with three distinct phases plateau transitional and absence this emergent pattern for b conc with lower coefficient of variation cv for smaller ω clearly represented consistently preferred habitats in small streams for benthic algae indeed a conc in ω 4 and b conc in ω 5 were larger than their respective detectable concentrations manifesting the mutual exclusivity in dominance regime for the two algal communities compared to the mutually exclusive zones algal regime transitional zones in intermediate streams ω 4 5 had 10 80 smaller gross primary production gpp estimated for the two algae gppa b with higher cv fig 2 g because of abrupt transition from benthic to pelagic algae dominance fig 2 h the algal regime shift is expected to be a general phenomenon across diverse river basins because of the distinct habitat preference between pelagic and benthic algae vannote et al 1980 jäger and borchardt 2018 however since the algal regime shift is affected by multiple attributes of the river basins and algal traits we cannot conclude that other river basins would show the same regime shift we reported here note that simulation results presented herein are based on the effects of best representative grazers for a given steady median river discharge si sec s2 role of grazers on the spatial patterns is presented in si sec s4 and figs s2 s3 3 2 comparisons to phosphorus long term monitoring data for ω 3 the range of srp concentrations monitored in may during 2000 2015 period fig 3 a and the corresponding simulated values of p conc overlapped but the median values were about two times different at the 1 significance level kruskal wallis test figs 3 b c and d in contrast for the higher order streams ω 4 there were no significant differences between the two distributions figs 3 b e and f the discrepancy for small streams is attributable to non concurrent sampling times and intervals over the 16 year monitoring furthermore small streams with low orders are the most heterogeneous in terms of hydrologic biogeochemical and ecological conditions and have variations in light intensity and temperature at monitoring times on the other hand the simulated p conc were based on spatial homogeneity in environmental factors and constant median discharge nevertheless data model match in ω 4 suggests the pronounced effects of converging river flows and accumulated nutrient loads towards downstream to reduce the impacts of spatial heterogeneities mcguire et al 2014 3 3 heterogeneity among four sub basins spatial heterogeneity of diffuse and point sources p loads across the weser river basin contributed to variabilities in p conc a conc and b conc in four sub basins fulda werra leine and aller see fig 1 b si table s2 using the empirical probability density functions pdfs and their statistical moments weser river sub basins were placed in two groups for p conc a conc and b conc but for different reasons si fig s4 fulda and werra were grouped for p conc distributions because of their common patterns for more distributed point source p loads from smaller wwtps and lower magnitude of diffuse source p loads per unit area basin shape contributed to grouping werra and leine for a conc because continuous longer main stem in these more elongated sub basins is favorable habitat of pelagic algae for b conc aller sub basin was distinct from the others because larger number of smaller streams in this least elongated basin received directly larger point source p loads see figs 1 b and c and si table s2 such differences in nutrient and algal spatial patterns would help understand likely outcomes in two large urbanized international river basins elbe rhine in germany and other eu basins intensive monitoring within one of the most representative sub basins combined with fewer locations in the other three sub basins of the weser river basin would be an option for optimizing limited resources for monitoring program establishment in future 3 4 spatial scaling along hydrologic flow paths the geomorphic area distance function dg x fig 4 a characterized the physical structure of the river network with peaks in dg x reflecting the larger number of distal 1st order streams in the dendritic branching network compared to dg x both the geochemical distance function for the simulated equilibrium p mass p dp x fig 4 b and the distance function for the simulated equilibrium pelagic algae mass a da x fig 4 c were more skewed towards the basin outlet ψ p 0 9 ψ a 0 5 overall the magnitude of spatial fluctuations in dp x and da x increased towards the basin outlet these findings reflect the higher cumulative p and a mass in larger streams core of the main stem than in smaller streams merging tributaries interestingly the distance function for the simulated equilibrium benthic algal mass b db x fig 4 d showed not only similar skewness ψ b 1 0 but also almost identical shape with dg x such coincidence resulted from small streams serving as the preferred habitats for benthic algae thus dg x serves as an excellent indicator for benthic algal biomass distribution in a river basin if p concentrations are above the thresholds required to support algal growth in the weser river basin and its four sub basins power spectral analyses for all distance functions showed a distinct bi fractal pattern fig 4 e power law fits in spectral plots slopes βg βp βa and βb in fig 4 e were significant for all four sub basins and the entire weser river basin r2 0 84 p 0 01 the values of βg 1 7 2 0 had consistent spectral slopes 1 2 2 1 resulting from fractal river network structure marani et al 1994 fang et al 2018 for the weser river the spectral slope βg was significantly lower than all the other three exponents an average of 2 4 p 0 01 indicating stronger spatial autocorrelation in dp x da x and db x than dg x accordingly p a and b were more clustered in the longitudinal direction indeed degree of their clustering was 60 larger than clustering of population in the weser river basin no city with 5 m inhabitants yang et al 2019a suggesting stronger effects of environmental controls on the coupled p and algae than on pattern of urban settlements threshold frequency f differentiating between the spatial autocorrelation signal and no memory i e zero slope was the highest for dg x meaning the least interference of random noise in dg x on average 40 smaller f values for da x than those for db x indicated longer distance required to manifest spatial autocorrelation for pelagic algae the behavior of pelagic and benthic algae may be compared to fish and benthic macroinvertebrates respectively based on underlying similarity in rivers i e transport floating moving along flows vs static attached crawling on stream bottom more than eight times longer spatial autocorrelation distance for fish than that for benthic macroinvertebrates lloyd et al 2006 grenouillet et al 2008 supports the feasibility of our findings moreover βb was 12 higher than βa at 5 confidence level indicates stronger clustering in the distribution of b than a 3 5 limitations and potential applications of cnandy model we acknowledge that the cnandy model needs further improvement to reflect a wider range of environmental conditions and controls we need to expand the current model framework to transient flows driven by seasonal and intra annual variations in stochastic hydroclimatic forcing we will further explore alternative approaches to estimate statistical distributions of the state variables for each reach of interest we do not consider spatial heterogeneities in benthic habitat conditions associated benthic algal coverage in small streams and hydrodynamic variabilities and shading from riparian vegetation which produce nonuniform patterns of pelagic algae coverage in larger streams the effects of spatial and temporal variations in temperature are also not considered in our modeling nevertheless the simulations we present provide an improved understanding of the complex drivers for the emergent spatial patterns of competing pelagic and benthic algae at the river network scale spatially variable nutrient p loads and steady river discharge reflect landscape attributes e g spatial patterns of human settlements and hydroclimatic drivers e g median discharge based on landscape filtering of precipitation moreover the general framework of the cnandy model can be used for simulating nutrient and algal responses in other large urbanized river basins by extending our earlier work on scaling of urban settlements and surrogate p loads in rhine and elbe river basins yang et al 2019a extensions to other river basins is also feasible as are specific scenario based simulations to inform targeted management strategies and to understand climate change impacts on eutrophication 3 6 ecological and management implications in the weser river most small streams ω 3 are projected to be dominated by large biomass of benthic algae thus compromising the integrity of aquatic habitats supporting high biological diversity besemer et al 2013 baattrup pedersen et al 2018 targeted approaches to reduce p loads both from point and diffuse sources are required to improve water quality and ecological status of these most numerous and important streams büttner et al 2020 although remarkable 70 reduction of total p loads input was achieved over the past few decades si fig s5 management choices include upgrading some of the small wwtps serving larger communities to advanced treatment technologies however installing such centralized upgraded wastewater treatment systems is an expensive option alternatively deploying nature inspired nutrient treatment e g constructed wetlands in conjunction with current primary and secondary wastewater treatment bolton et al 2019 may be a cost effective option pelagic algae are likely to be prevalent in larger streams ω 5 in the weser river network which compromise various ecosystem services along the river and in the estuary restoration of larger deep river reaches is confronted by challenges of large flow volumes high discharge various engineered structures e g dams flow diversions and engineered drainage of croplands have all changed geomorphic features and hydrologic dynamics of the river networks and play a major role in deteriorating water quality and ecological status of the entire river network palmer and ruhi 2019 projecting climate change impacts requires an understanding of dramatic shifts in extreme hydrologic events with associated geochemical and ecological alterations in river networks mosley 2015 increased flow variabilities intense floods extended droughts and land use changes have already caused widespread adverse impacts in river basins in germany reinermann et al 2019 rest of the eu buras et al 2020 and elsewhere in the world michalak 2016 accordingly the algal regime shifts we noted for steady discharge are likely to vary in time under transient flow conditions resulting from stochastic hydroclimatic forcing at daily scales and seasonality in river hydrologic regimes xia et al 2020 the algal regime transition zones we identified here from cnandy model simulations are likely to shift downstream during persistent drought conditions when median river discharge and stage are significantly lower e g as low as 100 m3 s as observed during persistent heatwaves and droughts in germany during may nov for 2018 2019 bfg 2019 and upstream during high discharge and water stage during spring floods furthermore increased duration and magnitude of droughts will lead to more intense benthic dominance in a larger fraction of the river network while increased frequency of larger floods will contribute to stripping of benthic algal mats and export of pelagic algae farther downstream with implications to receiving surface waters lakes estuaries 4 conclusions we presented a new river network scale model cnandy to simulate coupled pelagic benthic algae and nutrient spatial dynamics driven by competition for limiting nutrient p and energy light the salient contribution of the cnandy model was to deploy parsimonious descriptions for complex hydrologic geochemical ecological processes over the entire river network facilitating investigation of both pelagic and benthic algal responses to spatially heterogeneous nutrient inputs from point and diffuse sources our model simulations under steady median river discharge for germany s largest national river network weser river showed mutual exclusivity between pelagic and benthic algae dominance aligned with well known contrasting habitat preference of the two algae large deep streams for pelagic and small shallow ones for benthic our simulated concentrations for pelagic and benthic algae were consistent with the available ecological data and those for phosphorus corresponded surprisingly well with the long term nutrient monitoring data over the river basin the novel elements of our study were the emergent spatial patterns for the biomass and concentrations of benthic and pelagic algae and phosphorus concentration over the large river network with heterogeneous point and diffuse sources of phosphorus stream order based consistent scaling characterized the concentrations of pelagic algae and phosphorus algal regime shift from benthic to pelagic algae dominance was reveled in intermediate order streams mainly attributed to the change of river network geometry and the associated hydrologic conditions longitudinal spatial scaling features for algal biomass related to their spatial autocorrelations were identified across the weser river basin and within four sub basins future efforts will focus on incorporating spatially heterogeneous and dynamic conditions including transient river discharge and impacts of seasonal changes in temperature and riparian shading high spatial resolution algal monitoring data are needed for further validation of modeling analyses and these have to cover benthic and pelagic habitats consistently the model results may inform respective monitoring designs the general cnandy model may also support the advancement of mechanistic hydro ecological concepts and theory regarding environmental processes and controls in aquatic ecosystems and are useful for guiding future water

network scale dynamic model cnandy for pelagic a and benthic b algae competing for energy and one limiting nutrient phosphorus p we used the urbanized weser river basin in germany 7th order 8 4 million population 46 k km2 as a case study and analyzed simulations for equilibrium mass and concentrations under steady median river discharge we also examined p a and b spatial patterns in four sub basins we found an emerging pattern characterized by scaling of p and a concentrations over stream order ω whereas b concentration was described by three distinct phases furthermore an abrupt algal regime shift occurred in intermediate streams from b dominance in ω 3 to exclusive a presence in ω 6 modeled and long term basin scale monitored dissolved p concentrations matched well for ω 4 and with overlapping ranges in ω 3 power spectral analyses for the equilibrium p a and b mass distributions along hydrological flow paths showed stronger clustering compared to geomorphological attributes and longer spatial autocorrelation distance for a compared to b we discuss the implications of our findings for advancing hydro ecological concepts guiding monitoring informing management of water

autocorrelation 1 introduction algae are primary producers in streams and rivers and are used as indicators to assess water quality and ecological status allan and castillo 2007 stevenson and smol 2015 identifying potential hot spots for eutrophication pelagic and benthic algal blooms in impaired aquatic ecosystems resulting from anthropogenic pressures is key for mitigation and restoration le moal et al 2019 however at the scale of an entire river network this task is challenging as convolution along all flow paths is required to discern longitudinal patterns of pelagic and benthic algal communities as hypothesized by the river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 such challenges are mainly attributed to the spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics in dominant coupled processes complex feedbacks among land use patterns generating point and diffuse sources of nutrients geomorphic attributes of the river network structure hydrologic conditions discharge and water stage and geochemical dynamics in stream processes combine to shape the ecological algal dynamics across river networks dong et al 2017 it is noteworthy that most efforts to develop process based models of algal dynamics in rivers have focused only on pelagic algal community existing models cover a single river reach such as riverstrahler billen et al 1994 aissa grouz et al 2018 and qsim schöl et al 1999 as well as the entire river network such as tapir istvánovics et al 2014 qual net minaudo et al 2018 and the ann based model soro et al 2020 process based models of coupled pelagic benthic algal dynamics have been proposed pelletier et al 2006 jäger et al 2017 jäger and borchardt 2018 however their application has so far been restricted to a single reach to our knowledge and available review papers e g sharma and kansal 2013 wasp7 is the only comprehensive process based model simulating both pelagic and benthic algal dynamics with coupled carbon nitrogen phosphorus processes using a mass balance framework over entire river networks ambrose and wool 2009 however most process based complex models for simulating algal dynamics in river networks require extensive amount of observed data and or estimates for fitting or calibrating model parameters flipo et al 2004 model simulations for a selected small study area typically match observed data only after thorough calibration of many model parameters hipsey et al 2020 it is highly challenging to apply complex models at meso scales or in data poor river basins because of the daunting task of collecting and characterizing data or because of the sparse availability of observational data caused by extensive resources needed for systematic long term monitoring campaigns over the whole catchment mannina and viviani 2010 rutherford christopher et al 2020 particularly in developing countries chapra 2011 given these limitations and over parameterization problems wellen et al 2015 there is an increasing awareness of the need for simpler process based approaches in modeling river water quality and aquatic ecosystems by emphasizing holistic system understanding and for screening purposes kirchner 2006 jackson blake and starrfelt 2015 embracing this spirit a process based parsimonious model for algal dynamics under steady state river systems was developed chapra et al 2014 but only for benthic algal community and at the scale of a single reach parsimonious but process based models for both pelagic and benthic algae at the whole river network scale inevitably face two key challenges in data model comparisons 1 uncertainty in parameter estimation and 2 sparsity in observational data for model validation time series data are often available at a single location e g basin outlet or synoptic sampling at multiple locations but at infrequent intervals a possible alternative can be reliance on spatial analysis approaches for identifying spatial patterns of water quality and ecological status with the potential for transferring to other basins yang et al 2019a in this spirit we develop a river network scale parsimonious model named cnandy coupled complex algal nutrient dynamics fig 1 a section 2 1 for simulating the coupled dynamics of pelagic and benthic algae competing for one limiting nutrient phosphorus p and energy solar radiation we link at the river network scale the following key processes 1 variability in water stage and discharge across all streams 2 heterogeneity of point and diffuse sources of p 3 in stream geochemical processes for p cycling hyporheic uptake and 4 two dominant controls nutrient and light driving competitive growth of pelagic and benthic algae our modeling analyses can contribute to informing action plans for protection of river water quality and aquatic ecosystems to manage eutrophication such as demanded by the eu water framework directive european commission 2000 and the united nations resolution on global water quality unep jrc 2019 our analyses of a river basin wide case study weser river in germany details in section 2 2 are interpreted to test two primary hypotheses one related to spatial patterns of the competing algal communities over the entire river network and the other related to scaling of nutrient and algal patterns across the river network hierarchy the river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 and the process based reach scale model simulations jäger et al 2017 jäger and borchardt 2018 suggest a longitudinal gradient from benthic algae dominance in upstream shallow streams to pelagic algae prevalence in deeper downstream reaches we hypothesize that spatial patterns of pelagic and benthic algae would exhibit distinct mutually exclusive but predictable regimes across the river network with shifts between pelagic and benthic algal regimes occurring wherever light penetration is significantly limited by the river stage and pelagic algal shading universally consistent scaling signatures exist within river network structure dodds and rothman 2000 rodríguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 yang and paik 2017 and are reflected also in scaling of hydraulic geometry leopold and maddock 1953 dong et al 2019 geochemical attributes basu et al 2011 bertuzzo et al 2017 human settlement patterns fang et al 2018 yang et al 2019a and anthropogenic pressures descriptors miyamoto et al 2011 yang et al 2019b on this basis we hypothesize that ecological metrics e g algal biomass gross algal primary production would also exhibit similar scaling features 2 methods and materials 2 1 cnandy model structure for each reach i with a length li two types of algal habitats exist a streambed with a width wi and a surface water column with a depth di from the surface to the streambed we assume one algal taxon that can grow in both benthic and pelagic habitats such as species of the genera navicula dinobryon scenedesmus jäger et al 2017 jäger and borchardt 2018 relying on needed nutrients and light resources algal dynamics are coupled with macro and micro nutrients in reality however in the spirit of a parsimonious approach discussed before we consider only nutrient phosphorus which is known to be the key limiting nutrient for algal growth in many fresh waters and to often trigger eutrophication carpenter 2008 aissa grouz et al 2018 liang et al 2020 we assume vertically well mixed dissolved p within a reach equally available for both pelagic and benthic algae hence one state variable for dissolved inorganic phosphorus p in the units of mass is coupled with state variables for benthic and pelagic algae b and a respectively in the mass units based on a mass balance approach in each river reach we assume steady state water flow with a constant mean velocity vi that transports both the dissolved nutrient and the pelagic algae based on a single reach model developed for the coupled dynamics of phosphorus and two competing algae jäger et al 2017 jäger and borchardt 2018 we describe the temporal dynamics of the three state variables for every reach pi bi and ai in our network model as 1 d p i d t ϕ i w w t p ϕ i d s j e j q j p j v j q i p i v i c g b i b i c g a i a i v

parameters are defined in table s1 in the supplementary information si the input loads of nutrient phosphorus in reach i consist of three types 1 discharges from wastewater treatment plants wwtps as ϕi wwtp point source loads 2 delivered from direct drainage areas categorized by different land covers as ϕi ds diffuse source loads and 3 transported from all upstream reaches j as j e j q j p j v j where ej is an element of the connectivity matrix marking river flow existence i e ei 1 ei 0 if no flow exists between the upstream reach j and the downstream reach i and qj is river discharge and vj is of the volume of the upstream reach j we assume that both ϕi wwtp and ϕi ds are temporally invariant for each reach i the advection mechanism leads to the output flux of the dissolved nutrient for the reach i as qipi vi moreover the dissolved nutrient phosphorus in reach i is removed by two key processes 1 nutrient uptake by both benthic and pelagic algae in reach i to contribute to gross primary production for both algal communities assuming a constant algal nutrient to carbon quota c as c gb ibi ga iai where gb i and ga i are the growth rate of benthic and pelagic algae respectively and 2 natural attenuation through hyporheic zone of which the net uptake rate is inversely related to the depth d as vf i di where vf i is the uptake velocity for phosphorus in the hyporheic zone basu et al 2011 in this study we assume spatially homogeneous vf as 0 17 m day estimated from our former study yang et al 2019b we implicitly consider abiotic processes for p into the first order decay term by assuming a net sink effect for each reach regeneration of p in the water column through recycling of dead algae is not explicitly expressed in the model processes because it would be of minor importance when compared to anthropogenic nutrient p loads from point and diffuse sources in urbanized and cultivated catchments the decisions were based on the goal to develop a parsimonious approach that considers the first order dominant processes and sources new algal biomass is produced at gross production rate gb i on the streambed and at ga i in the water column of reach i existing algae in the benthic and pelagic habitats of reach i are lost at the rate of μ l b and μ l a respectively here we assume that grazing effects in each habit dominantly contribute to the loss rates due to scouring effect benthic algae suffer additional loss at rate μ s the detached benthic algae emigrate to the water column and in turn are involved in pelagic algae biomass advective flux for pelagic algae is embedded in the temporal dynamics of pelagic algae in reach i which are the influx from direct upstream reaches and the outflux at the reach i downstream the gross production rate of benthic algae is related to the light intensity that penetrates on the streambed id i the available nutrient and the density effect with maximum concentration for benthic algae under neither light nor nutrient limitations bk 4 g b i μ p i d i i d i h p i p i m v i 1 b i b k s i the light intensity is vertically attenuated by light blocking of pelagic algae with an attenuation coefficient k and by background turbidity with coefficient kbg according to lambert beer s law with light intensity on the top of water column io id i is expressed as 5 i d i i o exp d i k a i v i k b g following huisman and weissing 1995 and more recent works e g jäger and borchardt 2018 we assume that light and a single dissolved nutrient co limit primary production of pelagic algae in reach i as 6 g a i i i d p i μ p i i d i i d h p i p i m v i where ii d is the light intensity that penetrates in reach i at depth d since vertically well mixed water in reach i is assumed pelagic algae production can be expressed huisman and weissing 1995 by averaging eq 6 over the water depth of reach i di as 7 g a i μ p 1 d i k a i v i k b g ln h i o h i d i p i p i m v i we ran the model under steady state river discharge condition spatially homogeneous light intensity at the water surface and constant but spatially variable nutrient loads input seasonally variable shading from riparian vegetation especially in small upstream reaches and seasonal temperature variations were not considered in this model initial conditions were set as spatially homogeneous concentrations with 50 mgp m3 for dissolved phosphorus 200 mgc m3 for pelagic algae and 100 mgc m2 for benthic algae being aligned with reference conditions boundary condition at the river basin outlet was considered as existing advective flux for nutrient and pelagic algae we numerically integrated the model equations until the system reached the temporal equilibrium state for all three state variables all time derivative almost equal to zero specifically we simulated the system through a forward explicit euler scheme until starting from the initial condition steady state was reached the differences between two subsequent timesteps of every state variable are less than 10 6 we used a daily timestep which always ensured convergence to the steady state solution note that the steady state solution is independent of the initial condition but an initial condition close to the steady state solution can accelerate convergence mass and concentration at the equilibrium for a given variable z z p a and b are denoted as z and z conc respectively we estimated depth di and width wi for each reach i based on power law scaling with river discharge qi for the same frequency of occurrence well known as downstream hydraulic geometry leopold and maddock 1953 as 8 w i k w q i α w 9 d i k d q i α d where the power law exponents α w 0 5 and α d 0 4 are consistently found from many rivers leopold and maddock 1953 knighton 1998 and coefficients kw 10 m1 3α w s α w and k d 0 25 m1 3α d s α d since kw and k d are positively correlated knighton 1998 we note that changing their values would insignificantly affect varying spatial patterns at a river network scale for the state variables at the equilibrium 2 2 study area our study area is germany s largest national river basin weser river of 46 k km2 fig 1 b the river network was extracted using 100 m x 100 m grid dems with a channel forming area of 10 km2 zink et al 2017 the delineated river network consists of 1700 stream segments here a segment means a channel portion between two successive confluences the main stem 700 km long stretches from a small tributary in south eastern part to the basin outlet with the final 7th stream order horton 1945 strahler 1957 small streams with low orders from 1 to 3 account for 86 of a total length of 12 k km note that again our core interest is the river network scale spatial dynamics of the coupled p and two algal communities under a temporally representative hydrological condition we considered steady state median river discharge over the entire weser river by multiplying drainage area of a given point within the river network with median value of specific discharge q 203 mm yr in may 1950 2019 measured at the intschede gaging station shown in fig 1 b spatial variability in hydroclimatic forcing is out of our scope here total phosphorus inputs to the weser river are estimated as 3440 tons p yr with 28 from point sources and 72 from diffuse sources essential descriptions for the point and diffuse sources and the monitoring data are given in below three sub sections detailed information for the study area such as hydrological conditions and p loads estimation by land covers is described in si sec s1 2 2 1 point sources of p in the weser river basin 845 wastewater treatment plants wwtps serving 8 4 million people with 97 connection eea 2017 with a mean density of 2 wwtps 100 km2 and a mean separate distance of 11 km fig 1 c were identified from national scale reliable dataset for 8900 wwtps in germany büttner 2020 german wwtps are categorized based on the magnitude serving population equivalent as five class sizes based on german regulations https www gesetze iminternet de abwv anhang 1 html two largest class sizes deploy the mandatory tertiary treatment technology to satisfy regulatory nutrient loads discharged while the other three small class sizes have no regulatory requirements eec 1991 around 957 tons p yr loads for 2012 2016 are discharged to the weser river from all wwtps and the two large class sizes 31 of total wwtps contribute to 680 tons p yr discharge 71 of total larger class sizes wwtps are clustered toward the basin outlet while smaller ones towards upstream yang et al 2019a 2 2 2 diffuse sources of p land cover patterns in the weser river basin were based on the corine land cover clc 100 m grid data version 20 for 2012 year to be consistent with point source loads data reference time https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover the clc spatial map for the weser river basin fig 1 d manifests the dominance of agricultural areas 59 the scattered urban areas 9 and upstream clustered formation of forest semi natural areas 31 2 2 3 archived monitoring data the scope of available monitoring dataset aligned with this study should be stressed 1 only pelagic chlorophyll a concentration during march to october 2000 2018 at the hemelingen station which is located most downstream without tidal effect shown in fig 1 b skums 2019 2 orthophosphate as phosphorus and total phosphorus concentrations during january to december 2000 2018 at the hemelingen station bfg 2019 and 3 soluble reactive phosphorus srp concentration at 300 locations covering all 7 stream orders obtained from the official eionet european environmental information and observation network and wfd sample sites we used the first two dataset for estimating key model parameters details in si sec s2 and the last one for our model validation to maximize the available data application given in section 3 2 2 3 data analysis metrics spatial pattern analyses were implemented through two primary aspects 1 the spatial hierarchy by stream orders ω in a river network or by the associated contributing drainage areas that comprehensively characterize geomorphic features in a given river basin and 2 the power spectral to quantify the patterns of the longitudinal distributions of our interested variables along flow paths detailed explanation and the associated references are given in si sec s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial patterns of phosphorus and algal biomass a conc and b conc exhibited opposite spatial trends a conc was higher in larger streams along the main stem fig 2 a while b conc was higher in small headwater streams fig 2 b these results are aligned with well known habitat preferences hilton et al 2006 jäger and borchardt 2018 indicating that our model formulation and simulations generate essential aspects of the drivers for growth of the two algae competing for light and nutrient si fig s1 the contrasting patterns between a conc and b conc result from three factors 1 benthic algae outcompete pelagic algae for available p in small streams and lower river stage promotes sufficient light penetration 2 pelagic algae dominate in larger streams where light limitations from depth and pelagic algal shading combine to preclude benthic algae and 3 higher density of pelagic algae limits growth by self shading given the lack of monitoring data for the network scale algal concentrations within the network to corroborate the simulated spatial patterns for a conc and b conc we relied on the eu scale authorized assessment status in 2016 for phytoplankton and macrophytes phytobenthos for the weser river basin european environment agency 2018 figs 2 c and d as the two indicators from four biological quality elements determining ecological status for surface water bodies under the eu wfd european commission 2000 we stress that simulation results of a parsimonious model cannot be always demonstrated through empirical data e g chapra et al 2014 in that case the relevant proxy can be used for indirect demonstration of parsimonious model results note that the color coded status levels cannot directly be compared with the spatial gradients in a conc and b conc because the status assessment criteria are based on taxonomic abundance and composition of the indicative parameters nevertheless the referred maps figs 2 c and d indirectly support the occurrence of pelagic algae mostly in large streams fig 2 a and the prevalence of benthic algae in small streams fig 2 b respectively despite cumulative input p loads lower p conc in larger streams resulted from combined losses via in stream spiraling and algal uptake while locally higher p conc in smaller streams was mainly attributed to p loads from wwtps fig 2 e mean of p conc 148 mgp m3 over the entire weser river exceeded by almost 50 the level needed to achieve good ecological status 100 mgp m3 for total p as defined by the eu wfd heidecke et al 2015 over stream orders distinct patterns for p conc a conc and b conc emerged fig 2 f consistent changes for p conc and a conc over ω were respectively quantified using hortonian scaling ratios of rpc 1 43 and rac 1 91 r2 0 9 p 0 01 for b conc ω based pattern was characterized by an inverse logistic curve as ω decreased with three distinct phases plateau transitional and absence this emergent pattern for b conc with lower coefficient of variation cv for smaller ω clearly represented consistently preferred habitats in small streams for benthic algae indeed a conc in ω 4 and b conc in ω 5 were larger than their respective detectable concentrations manifesting the mutual exclusivity in dominance regime for the two algal communities compared to the mutually exclusive zones algal regime transitional zones in intermediate streams ω 4 5 had 10 80 smaller gross primary production gpp estimated for the two algae gppa b with higher cv fig 2 g because of abrupt transition from benthic to pelagic algae dominance fig 2 h the algal regime shift is expected to be a general phenomenon across diverse river basins because of the distinct habitat preference between pelagic and benthic algae vannote et al 1980 jäger and borchardt 2018 however since the algal regime shift is affected by multiple attributes of the river basins and algal traits we cannot conclude that other river basins would show the same regime shift we reported here note that simulation results presented herein are based on the effects of best representative grazers for a given steady median river discharge si sec s2 role of grazers on the spatial patterns is presented in si sec s4 and figs s2 s3 3 2 comparisons to phosphorus long term monitoring data for ω 3 the range of srp concentrations monitored in may during 2000 2015 period fig 3 a and the corresponding simulated values of p conc overlapped but the median values were about two times different at the 1 significance level kruskal wallis test figs 3 b c and d in contrast for the higher order streams ω 4 there were no significant differences between the two distributions figs 3 b e and f the discrepancy for small streams is attributable to non concurrent sampling times and intervals over the 16 year monitoring furthermore small streams with low orders are the most heterogeneous in terms of hydrologic biogeochemical and ecological conditions and have variations in light intensity and temperature at monitoring times on the other hand the simulated p conc were based on spatial homogeneity in environmental factors and constant median discharge nevertheless data model match in ω 4 suggests the pronounced effects of converging river flows and accumulated nutrient loads towards downstream to reduce the impacts of spatial heterogeneities mcguire et al 2014 3 3 heterogeneity among four sub basins spatial heterogeneity of diffuse and point sources p loads across the weser river basin contributed to variabilities in p conc a conc and b conc in four sub basins fulda werra leine and aller see fig 1 b si table s2 using the empirical probability density functions pdfs and their statistical moments weser river sub basins were placed in two groups for p conc a conc and b conc but for different reasons si fig s4 fulda and werra were grouped for p conc distributions because of their common patterns for more distributed point source p loads from smaller wwtps and lower magnitude of diffuse source p loads per unit area basin shape contributed to grouping werra and leine for a conc because continuous longer main stem in these more elongated sub basins is favorable habitat of pelagic algae for b conc aller sub basin was distinct from the others because larger number of smaller streams in this least elongated basin received directly larger point source p loads see figs 1 b and c and si table s2 such differences in nutrient and algal spatial patterns would help understand likely outcomes in two large urbanized international river basins elbe rhine in germany and other eu basins intensive monitoring within one of the most representative sub basins combined with fewer locations in the other three sub basins of the weser river basin would be an option for optimizing limited resources for monitoring program establishment in future 3 4 spatial scaling along hydrologic flow paths the geomorphic area distance function dg x fig 4 a characterized the physical structure of the river network with peaks in dg x reflecting the larger number of distal 1st order streams in the dendritic branching network compared to dg x both the geochemical distance function for the simulated equilibrium p mass p dp x fig 4 b and the distance function for the simulated equilibrium pelagic algae mass a da x fig 4 c were more skewed towards the basin outlet ψ p 0 9 ψ a 0 5 overall the magnitude of spatial fluctuations in dp x and da x increased towards the basin outlet these findings reflect the higher cumulative p and a mass in larger streams core of the main stem than in smaller streams merging tributaries interestingly the distance function for the simulated equilibrium benthic algal mass b db x fig 4 d showed not only similar skewness ψ b 1 0 but also almost identical shape with dg x such coincidence resulted from small streams serving as the preferred habitats for benthic algae thus dg x serves as an excellent indicator for benthic algal biomass distribution in a river basin if p concentrations are above the thresholds required to support algal growth in the weser river basin and its four sub basins power spectral analyses for all distance functions showed a distinct bi fractal pattern fig 4 e power law fits in spectral plots slopes βg βp βa and βb in fig 4 e were significant for all four sub basins and the entire weser river basin r2 0 84 p 0 01 the values of βg 1 7 2 0 had consistent spectral slopes 1 2 2 1 resulting from fractal river network structure marani et al 1994 fang et al 2018 for the weser river the spectral slope βg was significantly lower than all the other three exponents an average of 2 4 p 0 01 indicating stronger spatial autocorrelation in dp x da x and db x than dg x accordingly p a and b were more clustered in the longitudinal direction indeed degree of their clustering was 60 larger than clustering of population in the weser river basin no city with 5 m inhabitants yang et al 2019a suggesting stronger effects of environmental controls on the coupled p and algae than on pattern of urban settlements threshold frequency f differentiating between the spatial autocorrelation signal and no memory i e zero slope was the highest for dg x meaning the least interference of random noise in dg x on average 40 smaller f values for da x than those for db x indicated longer distance required to manifest spatial autocorrelation for pelagic algae the behavior of pelagic and benthic algae may be compared to fish and benthic macroinvertebrates respectively based on underlying similarity in rivers i e transport floating moving along flows vs static attached crawling on stream bottom more than eight times longer spatial autocorrelation distance for fish than that for benthic macroinvertebrates lloyd et al 2006 grenouillet et al 2008 supports the feasibility of our findings moreover βb was 12 higher than βa at 5 confidence level indicates stronger clustering in the distribution of b than a 3 5 limitations and potential applications of cnandy model we acknowledge that the cnandy model needs further improvement to reflect a wider range of environmental conditions and controls we need to expand the current model framework to transient flows driven by seasonal and intra annual variations in stochastic hydroclimatic forcing we will further explore alternative approaches to estimate statistical distributions of the state variables for each reach of interest we do not consider spatial heterogeneities in benthic habitat conditions associated benthic algal coverage in small streams and hydrodynamic variabilities and shading from riparian vegetation which produce nonuniform patterns of pelagic algae coverage in larger streams the effects of spatial and temporal variations in temperature are also not considered in our modeling nevertheless the simulations we present provide an improved understanding of the complex drivers for the emergent spatial patterns of competing pelagic and benthic algae at the river network scale spatially variable nutrient p loads and steady river discharge reflect landscape attributes e g spatial patterns of human settlements and hydroclimatic drivers e g median discharge based on landscape filtering of precipitation moreover the general framework of the cnandy model can be used for simulating nutrient and algal responses in other large urbanized river basins by extending our earlier work on scaling of urban settlements and surrogate p loads in rhine and elbe river basins yang et al 2019a extensions to other river basins is also feasible as are specific scenario based simulations to inform targeted management strategies and to understand climate change impacts on eutrophication 3 6 ecological and management implications in the weser river most small streams ω 3 are projected to be dominated by large biomass of benthic algae thus compromising the integrity of aquatic habitats supporting high biological diversity besemer et al 2013 baattrup pedersen et al 2018 targeted approaches to reduce p loads both from point and diffuse sources are required to improve water quality and ecological status of these most numerous and important streams büttner et al 2020 although remarkable 70 reduction of total p loads input was achieved over the past few decades si fig s5 management choices include upgrading some of the small wwtps serving larger communities to advanced treatment technologies however installing such centralized upgraded wastewater treatment systems is an expensive option alternatively deploying nature inspired nutrient treatment e g constructed wetlands in conjunction with current primary and secondary wastewater treatment bolton et al 2019 may be a cost effective option pelagic algae are likely to be prevalent in larger streams ω 5 in the weser river network which compromise various ecosystem services along the river and in the estuary restoration of larger deep river reaches is confronted by challenges of large flow volumes high discharge various engineered structures e g dams flow diversions and engineered drainage of croplands have all changed geomorphic features and hydrologic dynamics of the river networks and play a major role in deteriorating water quality and ecological status of the entire river network palmer and ruhi 2019 projecting climate change impacts requires an understanding of dramatic shifts in extreme hydrologic events with associated geochemical and ecological alterations in river networks mosley 2015 increased flow variabilities intense floods extended droughts and land use changes have already caused widespread adverse impacts in river basins in germany reinermann et al 2019 rest of the eu buras et al 2020 and elsewhere in the world michalak 2016 accordingly the algal regime shifts we noted for steady discharge are likely to vary in time under transient flow conditions resulting from stochastic hydroclimatic forcing at daily scales and seasonality in river hydrologic regimes xia et al 2020 the algal regime transition zones we identified here from cnandy model simulations are likely to shift downstream during persistent drought conditions when median river discharge and stage are significantly lower e g as low as 100 m3 s as observed during persistent heatwaves and droughts in germany during may nov for 2018 2019 bfg 2019 and upstream during high discharge and water stage during spring floods furthermore increased duration and magnitude of droughts will lead to more intense benthic dominance in a larger fraction of the river network while increased frequency of larger floods will contribute to stripping of benthic algal mats and export of pelagic algae farther downstream with implications to receiving surface waters lakes estuaries 4 conclusions we presented a new river network scale model cnandy to simulate coupled pelagic benthic algae and nutrient spatial dynamics driven by competition for limiting nutrient p and energy light the salient contribution of the cnandy model was to deploy parsimonious descriptions for complex hydrologic geochemical ecological processes over the entire river network facilitating investigation of both pelagic and benthic algal responses to spatially heterogeneous nutrient inputs from point and diffuse sources our model simulations under steady median river discharge for germany s largest national river network weser river showed mutual exclusivity between pelagic and benthic algae dominance aligned with well known contrasting habitat preference of the two algae large deep streams for pelagic and small shallow ones for benthic our simulated concentrations for pelagic and benthic algae were consistent with the available ecological data and those for phosphorus corresponded surprisingly well with the long term nutrient monitoring data over the river basin the novel elements of our study were the emergent spatial patterns for the biomass and concentrations of benthic and pelagic algae and phosphorus concentration over the large river network with heterogeneous point and diffuse sources of phosphorus stream order based consistent scaling characterized the concentrations of pelagic algae and phosphorus algal regime shift from benthic to pelagic algae dominance was reveled in intermediate order streams mainly attributed to the change of river network geometry and the associated hydrologic conditions longitudinal spatial scaling features for algal biomass related to their spatial autocorrelations were identified across the weser river basin and within four sub basins future efforts will focus on incorporating spatially heterogeneous and dynamic conditions including transient river discharge and impacts of seasonal changes in temperature and riparian shading high spatial resolution algal monitoring data are needed for further validation of modeling analyses and these have to cover benthic and pelagic habitats consistently the model results may inform respective monitoring designs the general cnandy model may also support the advancement of mechanistic hydro ecological concepts and theory regarding environmental processes and controls in aquatic ecosystems and are useful for guiding future water

upgrade policies on different industries vary significantly the consumption orientation policies have a similar performance on direct water consumption reductions in the municipality of chongqing industrial technology upgrade policies applied to the primary industry will generate larger reductions of water consumption i e 10 1 units reduction of total water consumption in the system since the primary industry can influence other industries through intermediate utilization the contribution of interactions for the reductions of direct water consumption was 10 38 where policies implemented on the primary industry and construction industry have the most significant interaction in addition the industry of production and supply of water is closely related to most of the industries since its technical improved can reduce the indirect water consumption of the majority of industries the results provide bases for supporting the municipality s efforts in formulating desired water management policies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords factorial analysis water management policy simulation industrial technology upgrade consumption orientation municipality 1 introduction as an essential element water plays a critical role during the development of human society during the last few decades the rapid economic growth population explosion and need for improved quality of life have resulted in widespread concerns related to water scarcity greve et al 2018 liu et al 2017 steen olsen et al 2012 yang et al 2012 it has become evident that water scarcity is increasingly perceived as a global system risk due to the increased water demand and the limited water supply liu et al 2017b ma et al 2020 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 it is thus desired to have better management measures to alleviate water scarcity in addition rapid urbanization and globalization over the last few decades have generated a significant growth in production and consumption activities around the world ali 2017 these activities have critical effects on the allocation of water resources embodied in goods and services consequently comparative analysis for water management policies simultaneously from different perspectives can better help policymakers to formulate targeted policies previously a number of efforts have been conducted to alleviate environmental pressures e g water scarcity and greenhouse gasses ghg emissions through investigating different policies alcon et al 2014 cao et al 2019 danilina and grigoriev 2020 gu et al 2014 jenn et al 2019 kahil et al 2016 li et al 2019 liu et al 2020 niedertscheider et al 2018 park et al 2018 stavenhagen et al 2018 york et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b for example alcon et al 2014 evaluated water policy preferences to decrease supply uncertainty through employing a choice experiment method gu et al 2014 calculated the effects of energy conservation policy on water use for chosen significant industrial sectors in china which indicated that current energy policies fail to deal with water saving issues kahil et al 2016 studied water scarcity and climate change policies in the jucar basin of spain through using an integrated hydro economic model demonstrating that water pricing is a weak policy choice for private and environmental profits as well as equity stavenhagen et al 2018 identified four cities i e berlin copenhagen tallinn and zaragoza in europe with a low per capita residential water utility to examine the most effective policies for water demand management suggesting that tariff reforms is impactful policies only in one case in order to assess these environmental concerns many tools have been employed to help explore the effective paths to the sustainable development of environment ali 2017 he et al 2020 jeong et al 2019 lindenschmidt and rokaya 2019 liu et al 2018b liu et al 2019a skelton et al 2011 zhai et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 among them two approaches i e the production based approach pba and the consumption based approach cba are widely adopted to assess these pressures on the environment the pba can estimate environmental pressures e g water scarcity and ghg emissions generated from production activities within a country boundary ali 2017 liu et al 2018b for instance kim and kim 2012 established a decomposition model to compare the influence of both production technical efficiency and technology change on the emissions of carbon dioxide in the organization for economic co operation and development oecd countries and non oecd countries ji and chen 2016 employed life cycle assessment and input output analysis to estimate the carbon emission when the wind farms in china were constructed operated and dismantled chai et al 2018 used a mixed unit input output model to measure lifer cycle water consumption and emissions of coal fired power production in china implying that the life cycle gray water footprint was determined by petroleum pollution nevertheless pba does not take into consideration of environmental stresses regarding imports and exports as a complementary approach cba can evaluate the environmental pressures caused by final demand which takes export and import activities into account ali 2017 franzen and mader 2018 especially various environmental pressures complying with the approach of consumer responsibility has been quantified through the cba in recent years ali 2017 for instance davis and caldeira 2010 employed a global consumption based carbon dioxide emission inventory to analyze related energy and carbon intensities based on consumption mi et al 2016 quantified consumption based carbon dioxide emissions for thirteen chinese cities through employing an input output model and found that capital formation contributed the most to consumption based emissions malik et al 2019 presented detailed information regarding the developments in the field of multiregional input output analysis and applied to examine consumption based environmental and social footprints li et al 2020 proposed consumption based planetary boundary pb water footprint indicators to traced the pathways of pb exceeded water and surplus water for the processing of certain commodities and deal with existing water conservation policy challenges in china and further the pba can evaluate the environmental pressures generated from production activities within a country while it does not consider the environmental pressures embodied in imports by comparison since cba places the responsibility of environmental pressures on the consumer it can take into account environmental pressure related to imports although the mechanisms of environmental issues accounting are different cba can be a complementary approach of pba in order to examine environmental concerns more comprehensively some studies have been conducted through adopting pba and cba simultaneously to explore the differences of environmental pressures generated from production and consumption activities among these studies environmental concerns related to ghg emissions are investigated most nevertheless these studies associated with water scarcity are limited for example steininger et al 2014 examined the potential benefits such as emission quotas and emission reductions of a switch from a production to a consumption based policy based on the criteria of justice and economic performance to finding that industrialized consumption based policy would not inherently improve efficiency jakob et al 2014 studied the efficacy of climate policy induced by emission leakage from both consumption and production perspectives and provided an appropriate pattern of countries responsibility for global emissions liu et al 2018 proposed an environmentally extended input output simulation model and applied it to the province of saskatchewan canada to facilitate the formulation of integrated ghg mitigation policy for various industries from the perspectives of both production and consumption han et al 2017 used a multi regional input output analysis to study the interactions of water demands in mainland china and national international economic transactions to explore the water flows related to economic flows from production and consumption perspectives to further comprehensively reveal the relationships between production activities and consumption attributions a number of efforts have been conducted via employing structural path analysis spa as a powerful tool to assess the connections among them llop and ponce alifonso 2015 skelton et al 2011 zhang et al 2020a spa can not only quantify environmental transmissions in the upstream process but also identify important paths with the highest environmental improvement potential by tracing back the intricate production chain hong et al 2016 therefore spa has been introduced in a number of ecological studies to help get insight into relevant environmental concerns e g ghg emission energy supply and water use for instance zhang et al 2017 established a quantitative study to follow primary energy through domestic supply chains through using spa method li et al 2018 employed the spa technique to study carbon emissions in india based on the latest input output tables and social accounting matrix sam tables feng et al 2019 constructed a food energy water physical input output model to estimate food energy and water flows and at the same time adopted spa to identify significant supply chain paths these studies regarding spa were mainly focused on environmental implications while few efforts were made to employ spa for supporting the formulation of environmental policies however most previous studies about water management policies were conducted with consideration of limited factors the composite effects from multidimensional interactive water management policies for various industries could also be as significant as those from individual impact factors while no previous study has been undertaken to address them also there has been a scare in studying water scarcity from both production and consumption perspectives within an input output framework therefore as an extension of previous studies the objective of this study is to develop a factorial water policy simulation model fws to investigate the composite effects of multidimensional interactive water management policies from both production and consumption perspectives the developed fws will then be applied to the municipality of chongqing to explore the most effective pathways of water consumption reductions in detail i simulation of different policies and comparisons among the simulation results will be undertaken from both production and consumption perspectives to examine the behaviors of various industrial sectors based on the identified significant industries through spa ii fws will then be developed to analyze the composite effects of multidimensional interactive water management policies based on the simulation results iii a detailed analysis for key industry i e water production and supply will be conducted to explore the effects of its technology improvement on other industrial sectors it is expected that this study would provide bases for supporting the municipality s efforts in formulating desired water management policies 2 methodology 2 1 development of factorial water policy simulation model a factorial water policy simulation model fws is developed to facilitate the analysis of direct indirect and total water consumption among different industries through simulating industrial technology upgrade policy itup and consumption orientation policy cop in fact the itup and cop are each supposed to be a class of policies which are from the perspectives of production and consumption respectively the itups are from the perspective of production to study the effects of water management policies specifically industrial technology upgrade is the way to improve productive progress for reducing water consumption therefore itups are to achieve the objective through production activities such as technology mandates and environmental standards when the itups are applied to industries water utilization of industries can be reduced through improving industries production technology for instance improving the irrigation efficiency of agriculture will influence its whole production structure which will further cut the water demand of agriculture the cops work through reducing the consumption of water intensive commodities for example water resource taxes will change the final demands of a certain product which will further decrease this product s consumption the major differences between the itup and cop are the work ways to be specific the itup is a bottom up way which works by decreasing the water demand of productive process and finally affects the total water consumption while the cop is a top down way which works by reducing the final consumption and finally influences the total water consumption in an urban metabolism system each component is closely connected with others through interactive flows in detail the concept of urban metabolism is first introduced by wolman in 1965 wolman 1965 he defined the urban metabolism as all the materials and commodities needed to sustain the city s inhabitants at home at work and at play in addition a metabolic cycle also includes the wastes and residues of daily life removed and disposed of with a minimum of nuisance and hazard the metabolic flow including nutrients energy water and materials has been considered in the metabolic cycle thus urban metabolism has been widely employed to provide an effective way to trace the social economic and natural process within cities and to link the emissions with consumption and transformation of raw materials carréon and worrell 2018 fan et al 2019 kennedy et al 2011 pincetl et al 2012 walker et al 2014 in this study significant industries are firstly identified through fws then the itup and cop are analyzed to support related policymaking regarding significant industries and different reduction policies of water consumption a factorial analysis is undertaken to further investigate industry performance under different scenarios which will offer an in depth basis for specific water resources management the model framework is shown in fig 1 fws is based on the leontief i o framework leontief 1986 in a general i o framework an economy has n sectors where each sector i produces a unique good to better reflect the economic structure and water consumption conditions the iot should be further aggregated thus the water consumption among different industries can be obtained through using the aggregated iot and the direct water consumption data as shown in eq 1 to eq 7 chen et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 1 x i j 1 n z i j f i for i 1 to n 2 a i j z i j x j 3 x i a 1 f 4 p ɛ z ɛ x 5 ɛ p x z 1 6 ip ɛ z 7 t p i j 1 n i p i j p i where x i is the total output of sector i and the element of matrix x z i j is the amount of good i that is consumed by sector j and the element of matrix z f i is the final demand of sector i and the element of matrix f a i j is the technical coefficient between sector i input and sector j output and the element of matrix a ɛ is the embodied water consumption coefficient matrix i is the identity matrix p ip represent the direct water consumption matrix and indirect water consumption matrix respectively p i is the direct water consumption of sector i i p i j is the water flow from sector i to sector j t p i is the total water consumption of sector i x x i j n n x i j x i i j x i j 0 i j when identifying significant industries the structural path analysis spa is a powerful technique to decomposes aggregated direct and indirect effects into contributions of individual step by step supply chain paths feng et al 2019 liang et al 2016 the concept of production layer pl here is defined as each term in the power series expansion pl t a t if we consider water consumption intensity the water consumption of total and different production layers can be calculated through eq 8 and eq 9 feng et al 2019 skelton et al 2011 8 w ɛ i a 1 f ɛ if ɛ af ɛ a 2 f ɛ a 3 f 9 w i 0 ε i f i w i 1 ε i a i f w i 2 ε i a i af w i 3 ε i a i a 2 f where w is the total water consumption of all sectors at all production layers w i 0 is the direct water consumption of sector i at pl0 w i 1 w i 2 w i 3 denote the indirect water consumption of sector i at pl1 pl2 and pl3 respectively a i is the 1 n row vector of all intermediate purchases from sector i to further trace water flow chains of intermediate products trade through production layers of a system the embodied water flow among industries at different layers can be expressed as eq 10 skelton et al 2011 10 w ji 1 0 ε j a ji f i w kj 2 1 ε k a kj a j f w lk 3 2 ε l a lk a k af where w j i 1 0 measures the water flow among industries embodied in the flow of intermediate products between pl1 and pl0 w k j 2 1 measures the water flow among industries embodied in the flow of intermediate products between pl2 and pl1 w l k 3 2 measures the water flow among industries embodied in the flow of intermediate products between pl3 and pl2 when simulating the itup on one industry the technical coefficient of the specific industry will decrease to a certain degree if there is no demand change it will further lead to the change of intermediate value flows and total output across all industries the direct water consumption of the specific industry will decrease related to the change rate and the ratio of its water demand while other industries will change to the same degree as the total output change therefore the amount of direct water consumption indirect water consumption and total water consumption after itup application can be acquired through eq 11 to eq 20 11 a m n i a m n α m n 12 x i i a i 1 f 13 z i x i a i 14 p i i p i x i i x i i n p i x i i x i α m n i p m n i p n i n 15 ɛ i p i x i z i 1 16 i p i ɛ i z i 17 t p i p i i p i 18 d w i p i p 19 i w i i p i ip 20 t w i t p i tp where α m n is the change rate of the technology that the units of good m to produce 1 unit of good n a m n is the units of good m to produce 1 unit of good n a m n i is the units of good m to produce 1 unit of good n after the application of itup x i a i z i represent the total output matrix technology coefficient matrix and intermediate value flow matrix after the application of itup respectively p i i is the direct water consumption of sector i after the application of itup ɛ i is the embodied water consumption coefficient matrix after the application of itup p i i p i t p i represent the direct water consumption matrix indirect water consumption matrix and the total water consumption matrix after the application of itup respectively d w i i w i t w i represent the reductions of direct water consumption indirect water consumption and total water consumption matrix after the application of itup respectively when simulating the cop aimed at a certain industry the final demand of the specific industry will decrease to a certain degree which will further result in a total output change across all industries liu et al 2018b if the technology is no change the direct water consumption of a certain industry will alter to the same degree as the variation of total output thus the amount of direct water consumption indirect water consumption and total water consumption after cop application can be calculated through eq 21 to eq 30 21 f n c f n β n 22 x c i a 1 f c 23 z c a c x c 24 p i c p i x i c x i 25 ɛ c p c x c z c 1 26 i p c ɛ c z c 27 t p c p c i p c 28 d w c p c p 29

f c z c represent the total output matrix final demand matrix and intermediate value flow matrix after the application of cop respectively p i c is the direct water consumption of sector i after the application of cop p c i p c t p c represent the direct water consumption matrix indirect water consumption matrix and the total water consumption matrix after the application of cop respectively d w c i w c t w c represent the reductions of direct water consumption indirect water consumption and total water consumption matrix after the application of cop respectively in the urban water metabolism system different types of water management policies implemented on various industries and their interactions will affect water consumption of different industries significantly factorial analysis fa is a powerful way to examine the main effects and interactions of multiple factors on a response variable liu et al 2017a 2018a song et al 2018 based on the spa and single policy simulation fa is introduced to further analyze the interaction among water management policies on significant industries in fws a multiple factor and two level 2k factorial design is adopted to estimate the effects of a factor at two levels of other factors the two levels of different factors are the low levels and the high level taking a 22 fa as a case the statistic effects model and the summation of squares for single factor and two factors interaction are calculated as eq 31 to 40 montgomery 2017 31 y i j k μ τ i η j τ η i j ξ i j k i 1 2 a j 1 2 b k 1 2 n 32 y i j k 1 n y i j k 33 y i j 1 b k 1 n y i j k

overall mean effect τ i is the effect of factor a at ith level β j is the effect of factor b at jth level τ β i j is the interactive effect of factor a and factor b ξ i j k is a random error component s s a s s b and s s a b are the sums of squares of factor a factor b and their interaction respectively s s t and s s e are the total of square and the random error respectively in this study various water management policies implemented on different industries that are identified based on simulation results are chosen as the factors i e 24 to investigate the main effects and complex interaction of these factors on system performance since the inputs of the model are all deterministic numbers the developed model is a deterministic model thus it is not necessary to replicate the calculation of fws in this study moreover high order interaction effects will be considered as the error item due to the limitation of the degree of freedom the fa was implemented in the software minitab all of the approaches are integrated within fws to tackle urban water resource scarcity from a systematic perspective 2 2 data sources the chongqing input output table iot is taken from chongqing statistical yearbook published by the chongqing statistics bureau chongqing bureau of statistics 2013 in addition the data regarding water consumption for each industry are obtained from chongqing statistical yearbook chongqing bureau of statistics 2013 china statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics 2013 and chongqing water resource bulletin chongqing water resource bureau 2013 all of these data are issued by authorized agencies the iot of 2012 is the latest data that can be obtained in the municipality of chongqing based on the water consumption conditions the 42 industries are further aggregated into 22 industries for the better analyses of the chongqing water metabolism system as shown in table 1 to be specific there are three principles to be considered when the 42 industries are aggregated into 22 ones firstly the industries with significant water consumption are reserved secondly the industries with significant impacts on economic growth e g the contribution of gdp are reserved finally water related industries e g the production and supply of water are reserved since this paper aims at investigating water related policies 2 3 case study area chongqing as an inland city is situated in the southwest of china hui et al 2006 similar to other inland cities its economy grew slowly and far lagged behind those along the coast before the mid 1990s bao et al 2019 fortunately the economy of chongqing began to increase after it was designated as a municipality directly managed by the chinese central government on 14 march 1997 especially from 2009 to 2017 the gdp of chongqing increased averaging over 14 per year becoming the city with the fastest economic growth in china bao et al 2019 in addition chongqing covers an area of about 82 403 square kilometers as 2 39 times as larger as the other three municipalities i e beijing shanghai and tianjin its permanent population has a rapid growth from 28 16 million in 2007 to 30 75 million in 2017 bao et al 2019 liu et al 2019b nowadays chongqing has been the economic cultural educational communications and shipping centers of the upper yangtze river region however a series of environmental concerns e g ghg emissions solid wastes management and water scarcity have gradually emerged due to the economic and population rapid growth hui et al 2006 liu et al 2018 tan et al 2016 the environmental issues of chongqing not only influence its ecological safety and sustainable development but also have significant effects on the regions surrounding the yangtze river since chongqing is located in the upper reach of the yangtze river yu et al 2017 2015 as a major industrial city in southwest china the economy of chongqing largely depends on the development of heavy industry which resulted in challenges in reducing ghg emissions and alleviating water shortage tan et al 2016 in the master plan 1996 2020 of chongqing one of the strategic objectives is to strengthen the manufacturing industry as a critical part of chongqing s economy bao et al 2019 the output from the manufacturing industry contributed 44 1 of chongqing s gdp in 2017 there are two leading industries in the manufacturing industry as the automobile and motorcycle industry and the electronic industry accounting for over 33 of the gross industrial output in the master plan 1996 2020 of chongqing the development of the tertiary industry is another strategic objective especially for finance commerce real estate transportation telecommunications and tourism bao et al 2019 in 2017 the tertiary industry accounted for 49 of the city s total gdp in addition the output from the primary agriculture only contributed a small portion to the economic growth of chongqing while its water consumption is significant there is a contradiction between economic growth i e the development of different industries and environmental protection therefore it is significant to examine the benefits of environmental policies from the perspective of industries that have great impacts on the gdp of chongqing in this study thirty eight policy scenarios are designed to examine the effects of different water management policies on various industries in detail fourteen policy scenarios i e seven industrial technology upgrade scenarios and seven consumption orientation scenarios are first designed based on the results of spa i e section 3 1 the factorial analysis is further designed according to the comparison of simulation results i e section 3 3 in addition the water production and supply industry psw is an important industry in the urban water metabolism system which can produce water and supply water to other industries this industry is closely related to all industries and affects the water consumption of all industries therefore the extra twenty four policy scenarios have been designed to comprehensively examine the relationship between psw and other industries and further analyze the effects of different water management policies on psw and other industries 3 results 3 1 identification of significant industries through structure path analysis the embodied consumption of water paths and their corresponding relative contribution for each pl are shown in table 2 in detail the water consumed at zeroth pl is named the direct water while the water used in other pls is called indirect water for the urban water metabolism system most of the water is consumed in the zeroth pl accounting for 57 71 of the total water consumption this means that the direct water is more important than indirect water for chongqing water metabolism system in addition water consumption in the lower pl e g pl1 and pl2 is larger than that in the higher pl e g pl4 and pl5 for example the proportion of water consumption in the first pl is 25 68 while that in the fifth pl is only 0 67 therefore the water consumed in the high pl can be ignored since their contributions are especially low to the system to identify the industries that influenced water consumption significantly four pls i e pl0 pl1 pl2 and pl3 are chosen to further examine the interactive impacts of water consumption among different industries and the results are summarized in fig 2 the width of the line represents the amount of water consumption transferred from one industry to another and the direction of water flow is from high pl to low pl additionally the length of rectangles with a specific color denotes the total water consumption of a specific industry under the specific pl in this system there are five industries i e mft mtc ose con and mte that principally consume direct water and three industries i e faff mc and psw that mainly use indirect water in detail the water consumption of mft mtc ose con and mte in zeroth pl is much larger than their water consumption in other pls which means that they dominantly consume direct water on the contrary faff mc and psw in zeroth pl consume less water than their water consumption in other pls which indicates that their water consumption is dominated by indirect water for mft and mtc their water flows mostly come from faff in high pl which means their water consumption will be affected significantly by faff although ose receives some water from faff and ose it is primarily influenced by psw the contributions of mpm and spm to con are fewer than that of psw to con these suggested that psw are important for ose and con besides the water flows of mte mc and faff in low pl stem largely from themselves in high pl which means that they can reduce water consumption by improving their production technologies it is worth noting that the water consumption of psw in zeroth pl is almost zero while its water consumption in other pls is large since psw is the industry that produces and supplies water to other industries psw directly consume little water consequently the above significant industries i e faff mft mtc ose con mc and mte are selected to further examine the impacts when considering itups and cops 3 2 simulation of policies based on technology upgrade and consumption orientation based on the above analysis industries with major impacts on water consumptions have been selected to simulate itups and cops and the policy simulation scenarios are designed in table 3 the reductions of direct water consumption dw indirect water consumption iw and total water consumption tw for all industries under fourteen scenarios are revealed in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively in detail dw and tw are presented by the first axis on the left and iw is presented by the secondary axis on the right as shown in fig 3 both indirect water consumption and total water consumption vary significantly across the seven scenarios i e s1 to s7 which reflects the various roles of different industries in mitigating water scarcity when considering the tw itups for faff i e s1 ose i e s4 mc i e s6 and con i e s5 rank at the top in contrast policies on mft i e s2 and mte i e s7 show similar reductions while mtc i e s3 has the smallest changes to be specific the policy on faff i e s1 can realize 10 1 units reduction of total water consumption with its reductions on direct water consumption and indirect water consumption being 7 6 units and 2 5 units respectively policies on faff i e s1 ose i e s4 and con i e s5 have relatively large reductions on direct water consumption since the direct water consumption of these three industries is the highest in the past for the performance of iw policies on faff i e s1 mc i e s6 and mft i e s2 result in relatively large reductions the results indicate that indirect water consumption differs from direct water consumption due to the complex interactions among different industries which further influences the variations of total water consumption moreover faff has the best performance for dw iw and tw indicating that the application of itup on faff is significant to alleviate the water shortage in the municipality of chongqing by comparing the five subfigures i e 1 4 5 6 and 7 in fig 3 it can be seen that direct water consumption of one industry will reduce most when the itup is applied to it however iw and tw present various trends under different scenarios which can further reveal the relationships of different industries a similar trend can be observed in fig 3 4 and 5 where the dw is far larger than iw furthermore itups applied to con i e s5 and ose i e s4 will decrease the direct water consumption of the psw industry notably showing that psw and these two industries are closely related to each other the iw of faff and mft are the highest in scenario 1 followed by ose mc mtc and mtf this result demonstrates that faff influences the mft industries remarkably through intermediate utilization there is a similar trend in scenarios 2 and 3 where the dw of faff are larger than that of mft and mtc especially for mft this result denotes that the application of itups on mft i e s2 and mtc i e s3 affects the reductions mainly through decreasing the water consumption of faff as shown in fig 3 6 the application of itup on mc leads to large reductions of indirect water consumption in other industries among them the reductions in con mte and ose are the most obvious similarly the reductions of direct water consumption on ose results in a remark decrease of indirect water consumption of mte fin and con industries fig 4 indicates the results of cops simulation it can be seen that the dw iw and tw of these seven scenarios i e s8 to s14 are much smaller than the results of the first seven scenarios i e s1 to s7 in addition similar change trends of direct water consumption can be observed when comparing cops and itups on the faff mft mtc and mte industries as shown in fig 4 the application of cop on con i e s12 results in the highest sum of the iw of all industries followed by faff i e s8 mft i e s9 and ose i e s11 in detail the policy implemented on faff i e s8 leads to the highest sum of the dw of all industries followed by con ose and mft while the policy applied to con i e s12 results in the highest sum of the iw of all industries followed by mft mte and ose these results are different from the simulation results of itups showing the need to apply various policies based on their spatial characteristics in contrast cop on mtc i e s10 shows the smallest reductions for the various types of water consumption which is similar to the result of itup on mtc i e s3 this reflects the fact that mtc is not sensitive for itup and cop as shown in fig 4 5 the cop on con will not only result in the changes of direct water consumption of psw industry remarkably but also affect that of other industries e g psp mpm and tsp which is different from the result of itup on con i e s5 this result demonstrates that the consumption decline of con will affect most of the other industries a similar trend can be observed in fig 4 7 where the changes for direct water consumption of psw wrt and spm are influenced simultaneously by comparing fig 4 2 and 3 the direct water consumption of faff is reduced notably which means that faff is a significant industry that is closely related to mft and mtc in scenario 8 the cop applied to faff leads to the changes in various types of water consumption on faff and the slight reduction of indirect water consumption on mft which much differs from the application of itup on faff this result indicates that the itup applied to faff i e s1 will be more sensitive than the cop i e s8 considering that faff is a significant industry for chongqing it is recommended to apply the itup to faff 3 3 comparation analysis of policies based on technology upgrade and consumption orientation according to the above simulation results the impacts of various policies on different industries vary remarkably to further analyze the best solutions for the urban water metabolism system the comparison of direct indirect and total water consumption of different policies is shown in fig 5 specifically the left subfigure of fig 5 denotes the results based on itups while the right shows the impacts of cops on seven significant industries for instance the s1 in fig 5 represents the itup implemented on faff while the s8 denotes the application of cop in the same industry by comparing the changes in total water consumption it can be seen that s1 ranks at the top indicating the faff is a key industry to realize the water saving target thus it is desired that itup is implemented on faff to maximize the reductions of water consumption s2 and s9 have similar changes related to the dw iw and tw demonstrating that the application of itup and cop on mft have no obvious difference similar changes also can be observed in s7 and s10 it is worth noting that the tw of s3 is not only similar to that of s10 but also the smallest the result shows the contributions of mtc to the water consumption mitigation are insignificant although the tw in s5 i e 5 4 units is similar to that in s12 i e 5 6 units the iw in s5 i e 0 6 units is much smaller than that in s12 i e 2 7 units this result suggests that the itup on con can largely decrease the direct water consumption while the cop on con reduces the total water consumption through both direct water consumption and intermediate utilization as the major tertiary industry in the municipality of chongqing ose performs a significant role in reducing total water consumption it can be seen that total water consumption in s4 declines much larger than that in s11 to be specific the changes of direct water consumption in s4 i e 5 4 units are more than twice times the changes of its indirect water consumption i e 2 3 units however in s11 indirect water consumption drops a similar degree with direct water consumption these results indicate that itup will be a better option than cop for ose to alleviate water shortage a similar conclusion can be obtained for the mc industry according to the results of s6 and s13 where the tw in s6 is 6 2 units and that in s13 is only 1 3 units in general the itups have a better performance on faff ose and mc than cops from the perspectives of dw iw and tw as for con the itup on it has a worse result of iw than the cop on it from the perspective of tw there is no obvious difference for mtc mft and mte when the itups and cops are implemented on them respectively 3 4 impacts from policies on industries and their interactions according to the simulation results various water management policies i e itups and cops implemented on different industries i e faff mft mtc ose con mc and mte have different impacts on the urban water metabolism system according to comparative outputs four industries i e faff ose con and mc which have obvious differences when itups and cops applied to them respectively have been selected to further analyze their interactive relationships thus a factorial analysis is undertaken to quantitively tackle the single factor effect as shown in table 4 and fig 6 and the interaction effect as shown in fig 7 to be specific the x axis represents the policies on four industries and the y axis represents the dw iw and tw respectively to better investigate the effects of the main factors on the water saving ability of the system table 4 offers the sum of squares contributions f value and p value for the main factors and their interactions responded to dw iw and tw it is denoted that water management policies on faff are more significant than policies on con and mc for these three indicators it is also worth noting that water management policies implemented on faff have great impacts in terms of indirect water consumption with its contribution being 52 86 when policies are applied to ose it primarily contributes to dw which accounts for 34 97 of the reductions of direct water consumption in addition policies on ose has limited contribution in terms of iw with its contribution being 2 66 in comparison policies implemented on con have significant impacts on the indirect water consumption accounting for 13 21 of iw when policies are applied to mc the results of iw and tw are similar from the perspective of dw the contribution of interactions is 10 38 which is much higher than the effects of water management policies on con i e 0 45 this result further indicates that it is important to study the interaction between main factors as shown in fig 6 a similar trend can be observed when considering two water management policies implemented on faff ose and mc from the perspective of iw and tw while in con is contrary this result further reveals that itups applied to faff ose and mc respectively will be better for reducing the indirect water consumption of faff ose and mc while cop implemented on con will be better for decreasing the indirect water consumption of con as for the changes of direct water consumption itups on four industries i e faff ose con and mc are better than cops on these industries the interactions of different water management policies on different industries for dw iw and tw are revealed in fig 7 it can be seen that there are intersecting lines in the three subfigures with different patterns for example the interactions plot of policies on faff and con are shown on the faff con subfigure of fig 7 1 the red dotted line implies the changes of con when itup and cop applied to faff respectively and cop implemented on con the blue solid line denotes the effects of policies on faff when itup implemented on con the red dotted line and the blue solid line have a similar trend that is ascendant when the policies on faff changes from low level to high level the intersecting line represents that the effect of policies on faff will vary when policies on con are at different levels which further reveals that the effects of dw will be better when the itups implemented on faff and con simultaneously in contrast as shown in fig 7 2 the effect of iw is better when the itup applied to faff and the cop on the con these results manifest that the combination of policies implemented on faff and con has a significant interactive effect on the system s water consumption when considering the interactions of policies on con and ose the application of itup on ose and at the same time the cop on con can gain better effects in alleviating water shortage 3 5 impacts of water related policies for water production and supply industry for the urban water metabolism system psw is an important industry that produces water and supplies water to other industries to achieve the target of alleviating water shortage it is an effective approach through improving its technology to reduce water consumption during the water production and supply process thus the technology improvement scenarios of psw are designed in table 5 in detail the effects of improving psw s technology to other industries are revealed through comparing the scenario results from s15 to s36 in addition the differences between itup and cop implemented on psw respectively are analyzed through conducting the simulation of s37 and s38 the results of these scenarios are summarized in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 1 the itup on psw i e s37 can result in a decrease in indirect water consumption of most industries especially for con spm mte and ose this means the psw is closely related to most industries by comparing fig 8 1 and 2 it can be seen that itup on psw reduces the indirect water consumption of most industries remarkably while the application of cop on psw only decreases the water consumption in the psw industry the result shows that itup on psw can reduce the water consumption of other industries through the intermediate utilization while the consumption decline of psw will not affect other industries moreover the reductions in different water consumption caused by itups are larger than those affected by cops hence it is recommended that itups are more suitable for psw than cops fig 8 3 summarizes the results of dw iw and tw due to the technology improvement of psw supplied water to different industries there is no obvious difference in water consumption that can be observed from s15 to s36 in addition to s30 demonstrating that psw contributes water to other industries evenly s30 analyzes the impacts due to the technology improvement of psw provided water to itself and it has the worst performance to mitigate the water shortage because psw consumes little direct water the details of these scenarios are presented in supporting information therefore it is more significant for psw to improve its technology in other industries than itself 4 discussion although the municipality of chongqing is located in the upper reaches of the yangtze it still belongs to the water deficient area in addition water demand in chongqing is growing with the progress of industrialization and urbanization which is exacerbating the water scarcity in this municipality it is thus desired to propose targeted water management strategies aimed at target industries for alleviating water scarcity according to the above analysis the performances of different water management policies implemented on the same industry vary significantly which shows the significance of targeted policies on a specific industry it is found that the impacts of itups on different industries vary significantly and the cops lead to similar reductions of direct water consumption in the municipality of chongqing china the itup applied to the faff industry can generate relatively large reductions of water consumption in the system because the faff industry can influence other industries through intermediate utilization in contrast it is recommended to apply the cop to the con industry the differences among results of itups and cops simulation further indicate the need to apply various policies to different industries according to their spatial characteristics policies on con can reduce water consumption through less consuming direct water primarily while similar policies on ose can decrease water consumption by affecting indirect water consumption mostly the contribution of interactions for the reductions of direct water consumption was 10 38 where policies on faff and con interacted the most from the perspective of reductions of total water consumption better water saving performance can be obtained when the itup applied to mc and at the same time the cop implemented on con similar suggestions were recommended to ose and con where the itup on ose and meanwhile the cop on con besides the itups applied to the faff and other industries i e ose con and mc simultaneously can reduce more water consumption the psw industry was closely related to most industries since its technical improved can reduce the indirect water consumption of those industries moreover the itup was more suitable for psw than the cop in terms of water consumption reductions to realize the water consumption reduction targets the water consumption reductions in faff ose con and psw industries were key issues in the municipality of chongqing according to the city s water conservancy development in coming years it is vital to improving water use efficiency in detail faff as one of the water consuming industries in chongqing was desired to reduce its water consumption through applying the itup since faff can affect other industries through intermediate utilization it was significant to consider other water intensive industries i e ose and con simultaneously according to factorial analysis it is recommended to implement itup on ose and at the same time cop on con as a special industry in the urban water metabolism system psw can produce water and supply water to other industries moreover this industry consumes little direct water but can affect the direct water consumption of other industries consequently it was suggested to upgrade the technology of supplying water to other industries to achieve the targets of alleviating water sacristy 5 conclusion in this study a factorial water policy simulation model fws has been developed to facilitate integrated industrial water management policy development from the perspectives of industrial technology upgrade and consumption orientation the developed model has been applied to the municipality of chongqing china to promote urban water metabolism analysis a series of industries i e faff mft mtc ose con mc and mte which have major impacts on water consumption have been first identified based on the results of spa the itups and cops have been applied to the seven identified industries respectively to examine the effects of reducing water consumption under different industries fa has been undertaken to further investigate the effects of the main factors i e various water management policies implemented on different industries and their interactive relationships based on the simulation results furthermore the impacts of technology improvement of psw to alleviate water scarcity have been analyzed comprehensively since psw was a vital industry in the urban water metabolism system the application to the municipality of chongqing china has illustrated the applicability and superiority of the factorial water policy simulation model it was found that different water management policies implemented on different industries have various performances in terms of water consumption reductions in the municipality of chongqing faff has the best performances for the implementation of itup which reveals the significance of itup applied to this industry for the performance of cops applied to the industries con has the best ones in contrast mft has the lowest water consumption reductions whichever water management policies are implemented on this industry in addition the interactive effects of faff and con are the most obvious among all industries which shows the different policies respectively implemented on them can produce different interactive effects as the key industry in the urban water metabolism system itups on psw i e s15 to s37 has better performances of water consumption reductions than cop on psw i e s38 among different itups on psw i e s15 to s36 the performances are similar except for psw upgrade the technology for itself i e s30 therefore the different industries are suggested to be implemented with different water management policies according to their industrial characteristics to alleviate water scarcity some limitations will be tackled in future research first the cost of different itups and cops will be taken into account to reflect the economic impacts of various policies second a stochastic analysis will be introduced to deal with the inherent uncertainties of the data and the calculation process declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this research was supported by the national key research and development plan

17181,industrial water management policies are prevalent around the world to alleviate global water scarcity it is indispensable to simulate the effects of different water management policies on various industries in the socioeconomic system to explore the most effective water consumption reduction pathways in this study a factorial water policy simulation model is developed to investigate the composite effects of multidimensional interactive water management policies from both production and consumption perspectives structural path analysis and factorial analysis are introduced simultaneously to help support policy formulation according to local reality and further examine the impacts of the main factors and their interactions respectively the developed model has been applied to the municipality of chongqing china to demonstrate the applicability and superiority of the factorial water policy simulation model it was found that the impacts of industrial technology upgrade policies on different industries vary significantly the consumption orientation policies have a similar performance on direct water consumption reductions in the municipality of chongqing industrial technology upgrade policies applied to the primary industry will generate larger reductions of water consumption i e 10 1 units reduction of total water consumption in the system since the primary industry can influence other industries through intermediate utilization the contribution of interactions for the reductions of direct water consumption was 10 38 where policies implemented on the primary industry and construction industry have the most significant interaction in addition the industry of production and supply of water is closely related to most of the industries since its technical improved can reduce the indirect water consumption of the majority of industries the results provide bases for supporting the municipality s efforts in formulating desired water management policies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords factorial analysis water management policy simulation industrial technology upgrade consumption orientation municipality 1 introduction as an essential element water plays a critical role during the development of human society during the last few decades the rapid economic growth population explosion and need for improved quality of life have resulted in widespread concerns related to water scarcity greve et al 2018 liu et al 2017 steen olsen et al 2012 yang et al 2012 it has become evident that water scarcity is increasingly perceived as a global system risk due to the increased water demand and the limited water supply liu et al 2017b ma et al 2020 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 it is thus desired to have better management measures to alleviate water scarcity in addition rapid urbanization and globalization over the last few decades have generated a significant growth in production and consumption activities around the world ali 2017 these activities have critical effects on the allocation of water resources embodied in goods and services consequently comparative analysis for water management policies simultaneously from different perspectives can better help policymakers to formulate targeted policies previously a number of efforts have been conducted to alleviate environmental pressures e g water scarcity and greenhouse gasses ghg emissions through investigating different policies alcon et al 2014 cao et al 2019 danilina and grigoriev 2020 gu et al 2014 jenn et al 2019 kahil et al 2016 li et al 2019 liu et al 2020 niedertscheider et al 2018 park et al 2018 stavenhagen et al 2018 york et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b for example alcon et al 2014 evaluated water policy preferences to decrease supply uncertainty through employing a choice experiment method gu et al 2014 calculated the effects of energy conservation policy on water use for chosen significant industrial sectors in china which indicated that current energy policies fail to deal with water saving issues kahil et al 2016 studied water scarcity and climate change policies in the jucar basin of spain through using an integrated hydro economic model demonstrating that water pricing is a weak policy choice for private and environmental profits as well as equity stavenhagen et al 2018 identified four cities i e berlin copenhagen tallinn and zaragoza in europe with a low per capita residential water utility to examine the most effective policies for water demand management suggesting that tariff reforms is impactful policies only in one case in order to assess these environmental concerns many tools have been employed to help explore the effective paths to the sustainable development of environment ali 2017 he et al 2020 jeong et al 2019 lindenschmidt and rokaya 2019 liu et al 2018b liu et al 2019a skelton et al 2011 zhai et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 among them two approaches i e the production based approach pba and the consumption based approach cba are widely adopted to assess these pressures on the environment the pba can estimate environmental pressures e g water scarcity and ghg emissions generated from production activities within a country boundary ali 2017 liu et al 2018b for instance kim and kim 2012 established a decomposition model to compare the influence of both production technical efficiency and technology change on the emissions of carbon dioxide in the organization for economic co operation and development oecd countries and non oecd countries ji and chen 2016 employed life cycle assessment and input output analysis to estimate the carbon emission when the wind farms in china were constructed operated and dismantled chai et al 2018 used a mixed unit input output model to measure lifer cycle water consumption and emissions of coal fired power production in china implying that the life cycle gray water footprint was determined by petroleum pollution nevertheless pba does not take into consideration of environmental stresses regarding imports and exports as a complementary approach cba can evaluate the environmental pressures caused by final demand which takes export and import activities into account ali 2017 franzen and mader 2018 especially various environmental pressures complying with the approach of consumer responsibility has been quantified through the cba in recent years ali 2017 for instance davis and caldeira 2010 employed a global consumption based carbon dioxide emission inventory to analyze related energy and carbon intensities based on consumption mi et al 2016 quantified consumption based carbon dioxide emissions for thirteen chinese cities through employing an input output model and found that capital formation contributed the most to consumption based emissions malik et al 2019 presented detailed information regarding the developments in the field of multiregional input output analysis and applied to examine consumption based environmental and social footprints li et al 2020 proposed consumption based planetary boundary pb water footprint indicators to traced the pathways of pb exceeded water and surplus water for the processing of certain commodities and deal with existing water conservation policy challenges in china and further the pba can evaluate the environmental pressures generated from production activities within a country while it does not consider the environmental pressures embodied in imports by comparison since cba places the responsibility of environmental pressures on the consumer it can take into account environmental pressure related to imports although the mechanisms of environmental issues accounting are different cba can be a complementary approach of pba in order to examine environmental concerns more comprehensively some studies have been conducted through adopting pba and cba simultaneously to explore the differences of environmental pressures generated from production and consumption activities among these studies environmental concerns related to ghg emissions are investigated most nevertheless these studies associated with water scarcity are limited for example steininger et al 2014 examined the potential benefits such as emission quotas and emission reductions of a switch from a production to a consumption based policy based on the criteria of justice and economic performance to finding that industrialized consumption based policy would not inherently improve efficiency jakob et al 2014 studied the efficacy of climate policy induced by emission leakage from both consumption and production perspectives and provided an appropriate pattern of countries responsibility for global emissions liu et al 2018 proposed an environmentally extended input output simulation model and applied it to the province of saskatchewan canada to facilitate the formulation of integrated ghg mitigation policy for various industries from the perspectives of both production and consumption han et al 2017 used a multi regional input output analysis to study the interactions of water demands in mainland china and national international economic transactions to explore the water flows related to economic flows from production and consumption perspectives to further comprehensively reveal the relationships between production activities and consumption attributions a number of efforts have been conducted via employing structural path analysis spa as a powerful tool to assess the connections among them llop and ponce alifonso 2015 skelton et al 2011 zhang et al 2020a spa can not only quantify environmental transmissions in the upstream process but also identify important paths with the highest environmental improvement potential by tracing back the intricate production chain hong et al 2016 therefore spa has been introduced in a number of ecological studies to help get insight into relevant environmental concerns e g ghg emission energy supply and water use for instance zhang et al 2017 established a quantitative study to follow primary energy through domestic supply chains through using spa method li et al 2018 employed the spa technique to study carbon emissions in india based on the latest input output tables and social accounting matrix sam tables feng et al 2019 constructed a food energy water physical input output model to estimate food energy and water flows and at the same time adopted spa to identify significant supply chain paths these studies regarding spa were mainly focused on environmental implications while few efforts were made to employ spa for supporting the formulation of environmental policies however most previous studies about water management policies were conducted with consideration of limited factors the composite effects from multidimensional interactive water management policies for various industries could also be as significant as those from individual impact factors while no previous study has been undertaken to address them also there has been a scare in studying water scarcity from both production and consumption perspectives within an input output framework therefore as an extension of previous studies the objective of this study is to develop a factorial water policy simulation model fws to investigate the composite effects of multidimensional interactive water management policies from both production and consumption perspectives the developed fws will then be applied to the municipality of chongqing to explore the most effective pathways of water consumption reductions in detail i simulation of different policies and comparisons among the simulation results will be undertaken from both production and consumption perspectives to examine the behaviors of various industrial sectors based on the identified significant industries through spa ii fws will then be developed to analyze the composite effects of multidimensional interactive water management policies based on the simulation results iii a detailed analysis for key industry i e water production and supply will be conducted to explore the effects of its technology improvement on other industrial sectors it is expected that this study would provide bases for supporting the municipality s efforts in formulating desired water management policies 2 methodology 2 1 development of factorial water policy simulation model a factorial water policy simulation model fws is developed to facilitate the analysis of direct indirect and total water consumption among different industries through simulating industrial technology upgrade policy itup and consumption orientation policy cop in fact the itup and cop are each supposed to be a class of policies which are from the perspectives of production and consumption respectively the itups are from the perspective of production to study the effects of water management policies specifically industrial technology upgrade is the way to improve productive progress for reducing water consumption therefore itups are to achieve the objective through production activities such as technology mandates and environmental standards when the itups are applied to industries water utilization of industries can be reduced through improving industries production technology for instance improving the irrigation efficiency of agriculture will influence its whole production structure which will further cut the water demand of agriculture the cops work through reducing the consumption of water intensive commodities for example water resource taxes will change the final demands of a certain product which will further decrease this product s consumption the major differences between the itup and cop are the work ways to be specific the itup is a bottom up way which works by decreasing the water demand of productive process and finally affects the total water consumption while the cop is a top down way which works by reducing the final consumption and finally influences the total water consumption in an urban metabolism system each component is closely connected with others through interactive flows in detail the concept of urban metabolism is first introduced by wolman in 1965 wolman 1965 he defined the urban metabolism as all the materials and commodities needed to sustain the city s inhabitants at home at work and at play in addition a metabolic cycle also includes the wastes and residues of daily life removed and disposed of with a minimum of nuisance and hazard the metabolic flow including nutrients energy water and materials has been considered in the metabolic cycle thus urban metabolism has been widely employed to provide an effective way to trace the social economic and natural process within cities and to link the emissions with consumption and transformation of raw materials carréon and worrell 2018 fan et al 2019 kennedy et al 2011 pincetl et al 2012 walker et al 2014 in this study significant industries are firstly identified through fws then the itup and cop are analyzed to support related policymaking regarding significant industries and different reduction policies of water consumption a factorial analysis is undertaken to further investigate industry performance under different scenarios which will offer an in depth basis for specific water resources management the model framework is shown in fig 1 fws is based on the leontief i o framework leontief 1986 in a general i o framework an economy has n sectors where each sector i produces a unique good to better reflect the economic structure and water consumption conditions the iot should be further aggregated thus the water consumption among different industries can be obtained through using the aggregated iot and the direct water consumption data as shown in eq 1 to eq 7 chen et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 1 x i j 1 n z i j f i for i 1 to n 2 a i j z i j x j 3 x i a 1 f 4 p ɛ z ɛ x 5 ɛ p x z 1 6 ip ɛ z 7 t p i j 1 n i p i j

the element of matrix f a i j is the technical coefficient between sector i input and sector j output and the element of matrix a ɛ is the embodied water consumption coefficient matrix i is the identity matrix p ip represent the direct water consumption matrix and indirect water consumption matrix respectively p i is the direct water consumption of sector i i p i j is the water flow from sector i to sector j t p i is the total water consumption of sector i x x i j n n x i j x i i j x i j 0 i j when identifying significant industries the structural path analysis spa is a powerful technique to decomposes aggregated direct and indirect effects into contributions of individual step by step supply chain paths feng et al 2019 liang et al 2016 the concept of production layer pl here is defined as each term in the power series expansion pl t a t if we consider water consumption intensity the water consumption of total and different production layers can be calculated through eq 8 and eq 9 feng et al 2019 skelton et al 2011 8 w ɛ i a 1 f ɛ if ɛ af ɛ a 2 f ɛ a 3 f 9 w i 0 ε i f i w i 1 ε i a i f w i 2 ε i a i af w i 3 ε i a i a 2 f where w is the total water consumption of all sectors at all production layers w i 0 is the direct water consumption of sector i at pl0 w i 1 w i 2 w i 3 denote the indirect water consumption of sector i at pl1 pl2 and pl3 respectively a i is the 1 n row vector of all intermediate purchases from sector i to further trace water flow chains of intermediate products trade through production layers of a system the embodied water flow among industries at different layers can be expressed as eq 10 skelton et al 2011 10 w ji 1 0 ε j a ji f i w kj 2 1 ε k a kj a j f w lk 3 2 ε l a lk a k af where w j i 1 0 measures the water flow among industries embodied in the flow of intermediate products between pl1 and pl0 w k j 2 1 measures the water flow among industries embodied in the flow of intermediate products between pl2 and pl1 w l k 3 2 measures the water flow among industries embodied in the flow of intermediate products between pl3 and pl2 when simulating the itup on one industry the technical coefficient of the specific industry will decrease to a certain degree if there is no demand change it will further lead to the change of intermediate value flows and total output across all industries the direct water consumption of the specific industry will decrease related to the change rate and the ratio of its water demand while other industries will change to the same degree as the total output change therefore the amount of direct water consumption indirect water consumption and total water consumption after itup application can be acquired through eq 11 to eq 20 11 a m n i a m n α m n 12 x i i a

α m n is the change rate of the technology that the units of good m to produce 1 unit of good n a m n is the units of good m to produce 1 unit of good n a m n i is the units of good m to produce 1 unit of good n after the application of itup x i a i z i represent the total output matrix technology coefficient matrix and intermediate value flow matrix after the application of itup respectively p i i is the direct water consumption of sector i after the application of itup ɛ i is the embodied water consumption coefficient matrix after the application of itup p i i p i t p i represent the direct water consumption matrix indirect water consumption matrix and the total water consumption matrix after the application of itup respectively d w i i w i t w i represent the reductions of direct water consumption indirect water consumption and total water consumption matrix after the application of itup respectively when simulating the cop aimed at a certain industry the final demand of the specific industry will decrease to a certain degree which will further result in a total output change across all industries liu et al 2018b if the technology is no change the direct water consumption of a certain industry will alter to the same degree as the variation of total output thus the amount of direct water consumption indirect water consumption and total water consumption after cop application can be calculated through eq 21 to eq 30 21 f n c f n β n 22 x c i a 1 f c 23 z c a c x c 24 p i c p i x i c x i 25 ɛ c p c x c z c 1 26 i p c ɛ c z c 27 t p c p c i p c 28 d w c p c p 29

system different types of water management policies implemented on various industries and their interactions will affect water consumption of different industries significantly factorial analysis fa is a powerful way to examine the main effects and interactions of multiple factors on a response variable liu et al 2017a 2018a song et al 2018 based on the spa and single policy simulation fa is introduced to further analyze the interaction among water management policies on significant industries in fws a multiple factor and two level 2k factorial design is adopted to estimate the effects of a factor at two levels of other factors the two levels of different factors are the low levels and the high level taking a 22 fa as a case the statistic effects model and the summation of squares for single factor and two factors interaction are calculated as eq 31 to 40 montgomery 2017 31 y i j k μ τ i η j τ η i j ξ i j k i 1 2 a j 1 2 b k 1 2 n 32 y i j k 1 n y i j k 33 y i j 1 b k 1 n y i j k

s s a s s b and s s a b are the sums of squares of factor a factor b and their interaction respectively s s t and s s e are the total of square and the random error respectively in this study various water management policies implemented on different industries that are identified based on simulation results are chosen as the factors i e 24 to investigate the main effects and complex interaction of these factors on system performance since the inputs of the model are all deterministic numbers the developed model is a deterministic model thus it is not necessary to replicate the calculation of fws in this study moreover high order interaction effects will be considered as the error item due to the limitation of the degree of freedom the fa was implemented in the software minitab all of the approaches are integrated within fws to tackle urban water resource scarcity from a systematic perspective 2 2 data sources the chongqing input output table iot is taken from chongqing statistical yearbook published by the chongqing statistics bureau chongqing bureau of statistics 2013 in addition the data regarding water consumption for each industry are obtained from chongqing statistical yearbook chongqing bureau of statistics 2013 china statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics 2013 and chongqing water resource bulletin chongqing water resource bureau 2013 all of these data are issued by authorized agencies the iot of 2012 is the latest data that can be obtained in the municipality of chongqing based on the water consumption conditions the 42 industries are further aggregated into 22 industries for the better analyses of the chongqing water metabolism system as shown in table 1 to be specific there are three principles to be considered when the 42 industries are aggregated into 22 ones firstly the industries with significant water consumption are reserved secondly the industries with significant impacts on economic growth e g the contribution of gdp are reserved finally water related industries e g the production and supply of water are reserved since this paper aims at investigating water related policies 2 3 case study area chongqing as an inland city is situated in the southwest of china hui et al 2006 similar to other inland cities its economy grew slowly and far lagged behind those along the coast before the mid 1990s bao et al 2019 fortunately the economy of chongqing began to increase after it was designated as a municipality directly managed by the chinese central government on 14 march 1997 especially from 2009 to 2017 the gdp of chongqing increased averaging over 14 per year becoming the city with the fastest economic growth in china bao et al 2019 in addition chongqing covers an area of about 82 403 square kilometers as 2 39 times as larger as the other three municipalities i e beijing shanghai and tianjin its permanent population has a rapid growth from 28 16 million in 2007 to 30 75 million in 2017 bao et al 2019 liu et al 2019b nowadays chongqing has been the economic cultural educational communications and shipping centers of the upper yangtze river region however a series of environmental concerns e g ghg emissions solid wastes management and water scarcity have gradually emerged due to the economic and population rapid growth hui et al 2006 liu et al 2018 tan et al 2016 the environmental issues of chongqing not only influence its ecological safety and sustainable development but also have significant effects on the regions surrounding the yangtze river since chongqing is located in the upper reach of the yangtze river yu et al 2017 2015 as a major industrial city in southwest china the economy of chongqing largely depends on the development of heavy industry which resulted in challenges in reducing ghg emissions and alleviating water shortage tan et al 2016 in the master plan 1996 2020 of chongqing one of the strategic objectives is to strengthen the manufacturing industry as a critical part of chongqing s economy bao et al 2019 the output from the manufacturing industry contributed 44 1 of chongqing s gdp in 2017 there are two leading industries in the manufacturing industry as the automobile and motorcycle industry and the electronic industry accounting for over 33 of the gross industrial output in the master plan 1996 2020 of chongqing the development of the tertiary industry is another strategic objective especially for finance commerce real estate transportation telecommunications and tourism bao et al 2019 in 2017 the tertiary industry accounted for 49 of the city s total gdp in addition the output from the primary agriculture only contributed a small portion to the economic growth of chongqing while its water consumption is significant there is a contradiction between economic growth i e the development of different industries and environmental protection therefore it is significant to examine the benefits of environmental policies from the perspective of industries that have great impacts on the gdp of chongqing in this study thirty eight policy scenarios are designed to examine the effects of different water management policies on various industries in detail fourteen policy scenarios i e seven industrial technology upgrade scenarios and seven consumption orientation scenarios are first designed based on the results of spa i e section 3 1 the factorial analysis is further designed according to the comparison of simulation results i e section 3 3 in addition the water production and supply industry psw is an important industry in the urban water metabolism system which can produce water and supply water to other industries this industry is closely related to all industries and affects the water consumption of all industries therefore the extra twenty four policy scenarios have been designed to comprehensively examine the relationship between psw and other industries and further analyze the effects of different water management policies on psw and other industries 3 results 3 1 identification of significant industries through structure path analysis the embodied consumption of water paths and their corresponding relative contribution for each pl are shown in table 2 in detail the water consumed at zeroth pl is named the direct water while the water used in other pls is called indirect water for the urban water metabolism system most of the water is consumed in the zeroth pl accounting for 57 71 of the total water consumption this means that the direct water is more important than indirect water for chongqing water metabolism system in addition water consumption in the lower pl e g pl1 and pl2 is larger than that in the higher pl e g pl4 and pl5 for example the proportion of water consumption in the first pl is 25 68 while that in the fifth pl is only 0 67 therefore the water consumed in the high pl can be ignored since their contributions are especially low to the system to identify the industries that influenced water consumption significantly four pls i e pl0 pl1 pl2 and pl3 are chosen to further examine the interactive impacts of water consumption among different industries and the results are summarized in fig 2 the width of the line represents the amount of water consumption transferred from one industry to another and the direction of water flow is from high pl to low pl additionally the length of rectangles with a specific color denotes the total water consumption of a specific industry under the specific pl in this system there are five industries i e mft mtc ose con and mte that principally consume direct water and three industries i e faff mc and psw that mainly use indirect water in detail the water consumption of mft mtc ose con and mte in zeroth pl is much larger than their water consumption in other pls which means that they dominantly consume direct water on the contrary faff mc and psw in zeroth pl consume less water than their water consumption in other pls which indicates that their water consumption is dominated by indirect water for mft and mtc their water flows mostly come from faff in high pl which means their water consumption will be affected significantly by faff although ose receives some water from faff and ose it is primarily influenced by psw the contributions of mpm and spm to con are fewer than that of psw to con these suggested that psw are important for ose and con besides the water flows of mte mc and faff in low pl stem largely from themselves in high pl which means that they can reduce water consumption by improving their production technologies it is worth noting that the water consumption of psw in zeroth pl is almost zero while its water consumption in other pls is large since psw is the industry that produces and supplies water to other industries psw directly consume little water consequently the above significant industries i e faff mft mtc ose con mc and mte are selected to further examine the impacts when considering itups and cops 3 2 simulation of policies based on technology upgrade and consumption orientation based on the above analysis industries with major impacts on water consumptions have been selected to simulate itups and cops and the policy simulation scenarios are designed in table 3 the reductions of direct water consumption dw indirect water consumption iw and total water consumption tw for all industries under fourteen scenarios are revealed in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively in detail dw and tw are presented by the first axis on the left and iw is presented by the secondary axis on the right as shown in fig 3 both indirect water consumption and total water consumption vary significantly across the seven scenarios i e s1 to s7 which reflects the various roles of different industries in mitigating water scarcity when considering the tw itups for faff i e s1 ose i e s4 mc i e s6 and con i e s5 rank at the top in contrast policies on mft i e s2 and mte i e s7 show similar reductions while mtc i e s3 has the smallest changes to be specific the policy on faff i e s1 can realize 10 1 units reduction of total water consumption with its reductions on direct water consumption and indirect water consumption being 7 6 units and 2 5 units respectively policies on faff i e s1 ose i e s4 and con i e s5 have relatively large reductions on direct water consumption since the direct water consumption of these three industries is the highest in the past for the performance of iw policies on faff i e s1 mc i e s6 and mft i e s2 result in relatively large reductions the results indicate that indirect water consumption differs from direct water consumption due to the complex interactions among different industries which further influences the variations of total water consumption moreover faff has the best performance for dw iw and tw indicating that the application of itup on faff is significant to alleviate the water shortage in the municipality of chongqing by comparing the five subfigures i e 1 4 5 6 and 7 in fig 3 it can be seen that direct water consumption of one industry will reduce most when the itup is applied to it however iw and tw present various trends under different scenarios which can further reveal the relationships of different industries a similar trend can be observed in fig 3 4 and 5 where the dw is far larger than iw furthermore itups applied to con i e s5 and ose i e s4 will decrease the direct water consumption of the psw industry notably showing that psw and these two industries are closely related to each other the iw of faff and mft are the highest in scenario 1 followed by ose mc mtc and mtf this result demonstrates that faff influences the mft industries remarkably through intermediate utilization there is a similar trend in scenarios 2 and 3 where the dw of faff are larger than that of mft and mtc especially for mft this result denotes that the application of itups on mft i e s2 and mtc i e s3 affects the reductions mainly through decreasing the water consumption of faff as shown in fig 3 6 the application of itup on mc leads to large reductions of indirect water consumption in other industries among them the reductions in con mte and ose are the most obvious similarly the reductions of direct water consumption on ose results in a remark decrease of indirect water consumption of mte fin and con industries fig 4 indicates the results of cops simulation it can be seen that the dw iw and tw of these seven scenarios i e s8 to s14 are much smaller than the results of the first seven scenarios i e s1 to s7 in addition similar change trends of direct water consumption can be observed when comparing cops and itups on the faff mft mtc and mte industries as shown in fig 4 the application of cop on con i e s12 results in the highest sum of the iw of all industries followed by faff i e s8 mft i e s9 and ose i e s11 in detail the policy implemented on faff i e s8 leads to the highest sum of the dw of all industries followed by con ose and mft while the policy applied to con i e s12 results in the highest sum of the iw of all industries followed by mft mte and ose these results are different from the simulation results of itups showing the need to apply various policies based on their spatial characteristics in contrast cop on mtc i e s10 shows the smallest reductions for the various types of water consumption which is similar to the result of itup on mtc i e s3 this reflects the fact that mtc is not sensitive for itup and cop as shown in fig 4 5 the cop on con will not only result in the changes of direct water consumption of psw industry remarkably but also affect that of other industries e g psp mpm and tsp which is different from the result of itup on con i e s5 this result demonstrates that the consumption decline of con will affect most of the other industries a similar trend can be observed in fig 4 7 where the changes for direct water consumption of psw wrt and spm are influenced simultaneously by comparing fig 4 2 and 3 the direct water consumption of faff is reduced notably which means that faff is a significant industry that is closely related to mft and mtc in scenario 8 the cop applied to faff leads to the changes in various types of water consumption on faff and the slight reduction of indirect water consumption on mft which much differs from the application of itup on faff this result indicates that the itup applied to faff i e s1 will be more sensitive than the cop i e s8 considering that faff is a significant industry for chongqing it is recommended to apply the itup to faff 3 3 comparation analysis of policies based on technology upgrade and consumption orientation according to the above simulation results the impacts of various policies on different industries vary remarkably to further analyze the best solutions for the urban water metabolism system the comparison of direct indirect and total water consumption of different policies is shown in fig 5 specifically the left subfigure of fig 5 denotes the results based on itups while the right shows the impacts of cops on seven significant industries for instance the s1 in fig 5 represents the itup implemented on faff while the s8 denotes the application of cop in the same industry by comparing the changes in total water consumption it can be seen that s1 ranks at the top indicating the faff is a key industry to realize the water saving target thus it is desired that itup is implemented on faff to maximize the reductions of water consumption s2 and s9 have similar changes related to the dw iw and tw demonstrating that the application of itup and cop on mft have no obvious difference similar changes also can be observed in s7 and s10 it is worth noting that the tw of s3 is not only similar to that of s10 but also the smallest the result shows the contributions of mtc to the water consumption mitigation are insignificant although the tw in s5 i e 5 4 units is similar to that in s12 i e 5 6 units the iw in s5 i e 0 6 units is much smaller than that in s12 i e 2 7 units this result suggests that the itup on con can largely decrease the direct water consumption while the cop on con reduces the total water consumption through both direct water consumption and intermediate utilization as the major tertiary industry in the municipality of chongqing ose performs a significant role in reducing total water consumption it can be seen that total water consumption in s4 declines much larger than that in s11 to be specific the changes of direct water consumption in s4 i e 5 4 units are more than twice times the changes of its indirect water consumption i e 2 3 units however in s11 indirect water consumption drops a similar degree with direct water consumption these results indicate that itup will be a better option than cop for ose to alleviate water shortage a similar conclusion can be obtained for the mc industry according to the results of s6 and s13 where the tw in s6 is 6 2 units and that in s13 is only 1 3 units in general the itups have a better performance on faff ose and mc than cops from the perspectives of dw iw and tw as for con the itup on it has a worse result of iw than the cop on it from the perspective of tw there is no obvious difference for mtc mft and mte when the itups and cops are implemented on them respectively 3 4 impacts from policies on industries and their interactions according to the simulation results various water management policies i e itups and cops implemented on different industries i e faff mft mtc ose con mc and mte have different impacts on the urban water metabolism system according to comparative outputs four industries i e faff ose con and mc which have obvious differences when itups and cops applied to them respectively have been selected to further analyze their interactive relationships thus a factorial analysis is undertaken to quantitively tackle the single factor effect as shown in table 4 and fig 6 and the interaction effect as shown in fig 7 to be specific the x axis represents the policies on four industries and the y axis represents the dw iw and tw respectively to better investigate the effects of the main factors on the water saving ability of the system table 4 offers the sum of squares contributions f value and p value for the main factors and their interactions responded to dw iw and tw it is denoted that water management policies on faff are more significant than policies on con and mc for these three indicators it is also worth noting that water management policies implemented on faff have great impacts in terms of indirect water consumption with its contribution being 52 86 when policies are applied to ose it primarily contributes to dw which accounts for 34 97 of the reductions of direct water consumption in addition policies on ose has limited contribution in terms of iw with its contribution being 2 66 in comparison policies implemented on con have significant impacts on the indirect water consumption accounting for 13 21 of iw when policies are applied to mc the results of iw and tw are similar from the perspective of dw the contribution of interactions is 10 38 which is much higher than the effects of water management policies on con i e 0 45 this result further indicates that it is important to study the interaction between main factors as shown in fig 6 a similar trend can be observed when considering two water management policies implemented on faff ose and mc from the perspective of iw and tw while in con is contrary this result further reveals that itups applied to faff ose and mc respectively will be better for reducing the indirect water consumption of faff ose and mc while cop implemented on con will be better for decreasing the indirect water consumption of con as for the changes of direct water consumption itups on four industries i e faff ose con and mc are better than cops on these industries the interactions of different water management policies on different industries for dw iw and tw are revealed in fig 7 it can be seen that there are intersecting lines in the three subfigures with different patterns for example the interactions plot of policies on faff and con are shown on the faff con subfigure of fig 7 1 the red dotted line implies the changes of con when itup and cop applied to faff respectively and cop implemented on con the blue solid line denotes the effects of policies on faff when itup implemented on con the red dotted line and the blue solid line have a similar trend that is ascendant when the policies on faff changes from low level to high level the intersecting line represents that the effect of policies on faff will vary when policies on con are at different levels which further reveals that the effects of dw will be better when the itups implemented on faff and con simultaneously in contrast as shown in fig 7 2 the effect of iw is better when the itup applied to faff and the cop on the con these results manifest that the combination of policies implemented on faff and con has a significant interactive effect on the system s water consumption when considering the interactions of policies on con and ose the application of itup on ose and at the same time the cop on con can gain better effects in alleviating water shortage 3 5 impacts of water related policies for water production and supply industry for the urban water metabolism system psw is an important industry that produces water and supplies water to other industries to achieve the target of alleviating water shortage it is an effective approach through improving its technology to reduce water consumption during the water production and supply process thus the technology improvement scenarios of psw are designed in table 5 in detail the effects of improving psw s technology to other industries are revealed through comparing the scenario results from s15 to s36 in addition the differences between itup and cop implemented on psw respectively are analyzed through conducting the simulation of s37 and s38 the results of these scenarios are summarized in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 1 the itup on psw i e s37 can result in a decrease in indirect water consumption of most industries especially for con spm mte and ose this means the psw is closely related to most industries by comparing fig 8 1 and 2 it can be seen that itup on psw reduces the indirect water consumption of most industries remarkably while the application of cop on psw only decreases the water consumption in the psw industry the result shows that itup on psw can reduce the water consumption of other industries through the intermediate utilization while the consumption decline of psw will not affect other industries moreover the reductions in different water consumption caused by itups are larger than those affected by cops hence it is recommended that itups are more suitable for psw than cops fig 8 3 summarizes the results of dw iw and tw due to the technology improvement of psw supplied water to different industries there is no obvious difference in water consumption that can be observed from s15 to s36 in addition to s30 demonstrating that psw contributes water to other industries evenly s30 analyzes the impacts due to the technology improvement of psw provided water to itself and it has the worst performance to mitigate the water shortage because psw consumes little direct water the details of these scenarios are presented in supporting information therefore it is more significant for psw to improve its technology in other industries than itself 4 discussion although the municipality of chongqing is located in the upper reaches of the yangtze it still belongs to the water deficient area in addition water demand in chongqing is growing with the progress of industrialization and urbanization which is exacerbating the water scarcity in this municipality it is thus desired to propose targeted water management strategies aimed at target industries for alleviating water scarcity according to the above analysis the performances of different water management policies implemented on the same industry vary significantly which shows the significance of targeted policies on a specific industry it is found that the impacts of itups on different industries vary significantly and the cops lead to similar reductions of direct water consumption in the municipality of chongqing china the itup applied to the faff industry can generate relatively large reductions of water consumption in the system because the faff industry can influence other industries through intermediate utilization in contrast it is recommended to apply the cop to the con industry the differences among results of itups and cops simulation further indicate the need to apply various policies to different industries according to their spatial characteristics policies on con can reduce water consumption through less consuming direct water primarily while similar policies on ose can decrease water consumption by affecting indirect water consumption mostly the contribution of interactions for the reductions of direct water consumption was 10 38 where policies on faff and con interacted the most from the perspective of reductions of total water consumption better water saving performance can be obtained when the itup applied to mc and at the same time the cop implemented on con similar suggestions were recommended to ose and con where the itup on ose and meanwhile the cop on con besides the itups applied to the faff and other industries i e ose con and mc simultaneously can reduce more water consumption the psw industry was closely related to most industries since its technical improved can reduce the indirect water consumption of those industries moreover the itup was more suitable for psw than the cop in terms of water consumption reductions to realize the water consumption reduction targets the water consumption reductions in faff ose con and psw industries were key issues in the municipality of chongqing according to the city s water conservancy development in coming years it is vital to improving water use efficiency in detail faff as one of the water consuming industries in chongqing was desired to reduce its water consumption through applying the itup since faff can affect other industries through intermediate utilization it was significant to consider other water intensive industries i e ose and con simultaneously according to factorial analysis it is recommended to implement itup on ose and at the same time cop on con as a special industry in the urban water metabolism system psw can produce water and supply water to other industries moreover this industry consumes little direct water but can affect the direct water consumption of other industries consequently it was suggested to upgrade the technology of supplying water to other industries to achieve the targets of alleviating water sacristy 5 conclusion in this study a factorial water policy simulation model fws has been developed to facilitate integrated industrial water management policy development from the perspectives of industrial technology upgrade and consumption orientation the developed model has been applied to the municipality of chongqing china to promote urban water metabolism analysis a series of industries i e faff mft mtc ose con mc and mte which have major impacts on water consumption have been first identified based on the results of spa the itups and cops have been applied to the seven identified industries respectively to examine the effects of reducing water consumption under different industries fa has been undertaken to further investigate the effects of the main factors i e various water management policies implemented on different industries and their interactive relationships based on the simulation results furthermore the impacts of technology improvement of psw to alleviate water scarcity have been analyzed comprehensively since psw was a vital industry in the urban water metabolism system the application to the municipality of chongqing china has illustrated the applicability and superiority of the factorial water policy simulation model it was found that different water management policies implemented on different industries have various performances in terms of water consumption reductions in the municipality of chongqing faff has the best performances for the implementation of itup which reveals the significance of itup applied to this industry for the performance of cops applied to the industries con has the best ones in contrast mft has the lowest water consumption reductions whichever water management policies are implemented on this industry in addition the interactive effects of faff and con are the most obvious among all industries which shows the different policies respectively implemented on them can produce different interactive effects as the key industry in the urban water metabolism system itups on psw i e s15 to s37 has better performances of water consumption reductions than cop on psw i e s38 among different itups on psw i e s15 to s36 the performances are similar except for psw upgrade the technology for itself i e s30 therefore the different industries are suggested to be implemented with different water management policies according to their industrial characteristics to alleviate water scarcity some limitations will be tackled in future research first the cost of different itups and cops will be taken into account to reflect the economic impacts of various policies second a stochastic analysis will be introduced to deal with the inherent uncertainties of the data and the calculation process declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this research was supported by the national key research and development plan

17182,microcystin lr mc lr a polypeptide toxin generated by cyanobacteria threatens the safety of drinking water supplies in this study fulvic acid fa was separated into two molecular weight mw ranges to evaluate the effects of fa size on mc lr degradation in the chlorine uv process the rates of mc lr degradation were significantly reduced in fa containing water 3 7 10 3 s 1 for small mw fa 4 3 10 3 s 1 for large mw fa as compared with fa free water 4 9 10 3 s 1 the contributions of clo to mc lr degradation were dramatically lower in small mw fa water 0 4 than large mw fa 13 9 and fa free water 17 4 suggesting inhibition by lignin like substances in fa in the transformation of cl to clo and scavenging clo monochlorination and hydroxylation occurred in the first step of the mc lr degradation process the accumulation of intermediate products in the chlorine uv process indicated that small mw fa inhibited further degradation of mc lr small mw fa rather than mc lr degradation was the dominant factor in minimizing mc lr cytotoxicity toward a human intestinal epithelial cell line graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microcystin lr fulvic acid molecular weight chlorine uv process photodegradation detoxification 1 introduction cyanobacteria are globally ubiquitous they grow in a wide range of water bodies including lakes reservoirs and slow current streams with favorable temperature and nutrients funkey et al 2014 gardner et al 2017 these water bodies are often used as sources of drinking water cyanobacteria produce a group of toxins called microcystins mcs that are released to water after cyanobacteria death and become water contaminants brophy et al 2019 hu and rzymski 2019 janssen 2019 mcs are cyclic peptides containing seven amino acids two of which can be substituted by different kinds of amino acid moieties duan et al 2018 their structures tend to be stable mcs can persist after exposure to harsh conditions such as boiling microcystin lr mc lr is among the most prevalent and most toxic of the mcs the structure of mc lr is illustrated in fig s1 all mcs have a side chain of 2s 3s 8s 9s 3 amino 9 methoxy 2 6 8 trimethyl 10 phenyldeca 4 6 dienoic acid adda the structural differences among the mcs are attributable to amino acid groups at positions 2 and 4 mc lr includes leucine l at position 2 and arginine r at position 4 the inclusion of double bonds in adda and the arginine chains are critical for expressing antibody binding specificity which in turn is critical for inducing toxicity sharma et al 2012 ufelmann et al 2012 zong et al 2013 therefore damaging to the adda group or the arginine group can result in a decrease in the toxicity of mc lr the world health organization who has suggested an upper limit concentration of mc lr as 1 0 μg l in drinking water world health organization 2017 the chlorine uv process cl uv is among the family of advanced oxidation processes aops that are effective for the degradation of a wide variety of recalcitrant pollutants the structure of mc lr suggests that it should be susceptible to degradation by the chlorine uv process because the unsaturated c c bonds within the adda and mdha moieties as well as the n h bonds within its arginine moiety facilitate reactions with radicals and free chlorine he et al 2012 remucal and manley 2016 in fact mc lr degradation and detoxification by the chlorine uv process have been demonstrated under controlled laboratory conditions zhang et al 2016 in this process free chlorine hocl and ocl pka 7 5 will cause n chlorination of unbound amine groups and also oxidation and hydration at double bond structures within the adda group the n cl bond within this molecule is known to be photolabile and to generate an amine radical and a chlorine radical as a result of uv photolysis li and blatchley 2009 de laat et al 2010 photolysis of hocl and ocl results in the production of reactive oxygen species ros such as the hydroxyl radical oh which along with the chlorine radical can be transformed into other reactive chlorine species rcs buxton et al 1988 sun et al 2016 duan et al 2017 these radicals are strong oxidants and have the potential to attack the mc lr molecule in turn this may lead to alteration of toxicity khanna et al 1992 among these reactive intermediates the hydroxyl radical tends to be non selective and is likely to react with many functional groups of mc lr while rcs which include the chlorine radical cl the chlorine oxide radical clo and the dichloride radical anion cl2 tend to be selective toward electron rich groups alfassi et al 1989 alegre et al 2000 guo et al 2017 thus the photodegradation of mc lr in the presence of free chlorine will involve several reaction pathways that will operate in parallel the steady state concentration of radicals and their contributions to contaminant degradation will be influenced by the matrix of dissolved constituents within a water supply hou et al 2018 karci et al 2018 fulvic acid fa represents a principal component of natural organic matter nom that is an active participant in several chemical treatment processes zhang et al 2014 fa has been characterized by an average chemical formula of c135h182o95n5s2 with an average molecular weight of 3 456 kda chin et al 1994 li et al 2013 its structure can be characterized as a loose assembly of aromatic organic polymers with many carboxyl groups cooh phenolic oh alcoholic oh and a small number of amino acid groups fa can function as an internal filter to protect dissolved constituents from photolysis plancque et al 2001 reemtsma and these 2005 these and reemtsma 2005 alvarez puebla et al 2006 however the number of functional groups components and uv absorbance varies with fa molecular weight mw which also varies with geographical location decrease from upstream to downstream of a river chin et al 1994 wang et al 2010 thus the effects of fa on photolysis vary with the molecular weight of fa as such raw waters from different areas can demonstrate different contaminant degradation performance in the chlorine uv process because of different fa molecular weight distributions therefore an essential need exists to define the effects of fa molecular weight on mc lr degradation and detoxification previous research has indicated that mc lr causes liver toxicity by inhibiting a class of protein phosphatases including protein phosphatase 1 pp1 and protein phosphatase 2a pp2a fontanillo and koehn 2018 he et al 2018 thus the focus of previous research has been on the effects of mc lr and its photolysis products on liver cytotoxicity often using human hepatoma cells and the pp2a assay kit to assess toxicity reactions duan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 however ingestion of water containing mc lr and its chlorine uv products will first come into contact with the gastrointestinal epithelial cells chen et al 2005 wu et al 2018 kubickova et al 2019 therefore it can be inferred that human intestinal epithelial cells may be injured by exposure to mc lr and its degradation products however there is little information in the literature related to the effects of mc lr and its degradation products on human intestinal epithelial cells the nature of damage to these cells in this process is largely undefined the central hypothesis of this study was that different fa mw fractions would yield different effects on mc lr photolysis in the chlorine uv process which in turn will result in different cytotoxicity responses in human digestive tract cells to test this hypothesis fa was divided into two mw fractions then the kinetics of mc lr degradation in the chlorine uv process in the presence of different fa mw fractions was investigated and the contributions of photolysis and radical based mechanisms to mc lr degradation were examined finally the cytotoxicity of mc lr and its degradation products were assessed using a human ileocecal adenocarcinoma cell line hct 8 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sources of chemicals are shown in si text s1 2 2 experimental procedures water samples 30 ml were contained in a petri dish with a quartz plate lid which included 1 0 μm mc lr buffered to ph 7 0 by 10 mm phosphate buffer this initial mc lr concentration was used in decay experiments to facilitate quantification by hplc hcl and ammonium hydroxide were used to adjust the ph of the sample to 7 0 for lc ms ms to avoid the damage that could be caused by other buffers such as phosphate within the mass spectrometer in the radical steady state concentration experiments nb ba dmob were spiked into water samples as radical probe compounds tba was added as a scavenger to remove specific radicals such as ho cl clo while retaining other radicals the dose of probe compounds and scavenger used in this study are mentioned in si text s3 and s4 prior to the isolation of different mw size fractions the fa standard sample solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm glass fiber membrane filter which had previously been placed in a muffle furnace at 500 c to remove organic contaminants afterward the filtrate was separated using a 10 kda molecular weight cutoff filter millipore ultrafiltration membranes to two size fractions because the ratios of components in dom are quite different between below 10 kda and above 10 kda while the component difference in dom below 10 kda are less significant the filtrate fraction with fa above 10 kda will be referred to as the large mw fa solution while the fa fraction with mw below 10 kda will be referred to as the small mw fa solution these solutions were diluted to reach 10 mg c l and then stored at 4 c prior to use the experiments were started by spiking aqueous solution of mc lr with a naocl stock solution in a petri dish that was placed under a uv254 collimated beam which yielded irradiance of 3 82 10 10 einstein cm2 a magnetic stirrer was employed to mix the water samples during uv exposure at pre determined time intervals 1 0 ml samples were collected and 0 1 mg sodium sulfite was added to quench the residual chlorine the samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane filter to remove impurities and then the amounts of residual mc lr products and toxicity were quantified the experiments with uv254 irradiation alone without hocl and chlorination alone without uv254 irradiation were conducted following the same procedures the residual free chlorine and total chlorine were detected in separate experiments without quenching all experiments were conducted in triplicate and the relative standard deviation of the three replicates was below 5 in all the experiments 2 3 analytical methods steady state concentrations of radicals and their contributions to mc lr photolysis the analytical methods to measure free chlorine combined chlorine mc lr and its products components of fa are detailed in si text s2 steady state concentrations of radicals and their contributions to mc lr photolysis presented in si text s3 and s4 2 4 cytotoxicity tests cytotoxicity toward hct 8 cells was measured by lactate dehydrogenase ldh release using a cytotoxicity assay kit thermo scientific frederick md roberts et al 2001 briefly hct 8 atcc ccl 244 cells were grown in dulbecco s modified eagle s medium supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum atlanta biologicals on 24 well tissue culture plates cell membrane damage releases ldh into the cell culture media extracellular ldh in the media was quantified by a coupled enzymatic reaction in which ldh catalyzed the conversion of lactate to pyruvate via nad reduction to nadh diaphorase then used nadh to reduce a tetrazolium salt int to a red formazan product that was measured by absorbance at 490 nm formazan formation was assumed to be directly proportional to the amount of ldh released into the medium which is indicative of cytotoxicity the details of the experiment and cytotoxicity calculation equation are presented in si text s5 and eq s12 2 5 statistical analysis the statistical analysis including mean values standard deviations linear regressions and t tests were performed using statistical product and service solutions spss software results with p values 0 05 are reported as significant for t tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of mc lr degradation with the chlorine uv254 process uv254 alone and chlorine alone the decomposition of mc lr by uv254 photolysis chlorine and the chlorine uv254 process with different mw fa was examined as is shown in fig 1 and table s1 mc lr degradation followed pseudo first order degradation kinetics in all five processes the chlorine uv254 process yielded faster degradation of mc lr than either uv254 alone or chlorination alone regardless of the presence or absence of fa the mc lr photolysis rate constant was 0 0003 s 1 under uv254 irradiation alone while this rate became 0 0016 s 1 when an initial chlorine concentration of 42 μm was applied without uv254 irradiation these results are similar to those reported previously zhang et al 2019 among the three chlorine uv254 process experiments mc lr degradation was the fastest when fa was absent reaching degradation rate constant of 0 0049 s 1 3 fold higher than that of chlorine alone the degradation rate constant of mc lr was 0 0043 s 1 in the large mw fa solution in chlorine uv254 process the degradation rate constant after the same exposure period was 0 0037 s 1 in the presence of small mw fa 3 2 contributions of uv254 radiation free chlorine and radicals to the degradation of mc lr in fa solutions as shown in fig s2 there was about 85 free chlorine decay in the chlorine uv254 process in the fa free solution within 10 min while only 64 and 24 free chlorine decay was observed in the same time period for the large fa and small fa solutions respectively these trends indicate fa especially small mw fa prevents free chlorine decay and this effect will further disturb the generation of rcs and weaken the mc lr degradation rate fig s3 a b and c and table s2 present the relative concentration variations of different probe compounds and their corresponding first order kinetic constants based on this information the steady state concentrations of different radicals were calculated through the use of eq s1 s3 in si the results of these calculations are summarized in table 1 the ho ss was similar in each of the fa solutions however there was a significantly higher value of cl ss and lower value of clo ss in the small mw fa solution than in the large mw fa and fa free solutions this indicated that the presence of fa in water had minimal effect on ho ss but a profound effect on the steady state concentrations of rcs specifically small mw fa enhanced the concentration of chlorine radical and decreased the chlorine oxide radical while large mw fa increased both of them since rcs tend to be relatively selective radicals that tend to react preferentially with electron rich functional groups such as diene phenyl ring moieties and arginine moieties duan et al 2018 the degradation of mc lr by the chlorine uv254 process can be reasonably expected to be influenced by the presence or absence of fa constituents the contributions of different factors to mc lr degradation was calculated by eq s4 s11 in si coupled with the observed mc lr first order decay constants derived from the experiments with radical scavengers fig s4 and table s3 the results are presented in fig 2 direct photolysis by uv254 irradiation represented a small contribution to mc lr removal in all three chlorine uv254 processes in each case direct photolysis was responsible for less than 7 of observed degradation the rate of direct photolysis in solutions containing fa was reduced by the inner filter effect of fa degradation of mc lr by direct reaction with free chlorine was responsible for 49 45 and 39 of overall mc lr degradation in the small fa large fa and fa free solutions respectively the contribution of hydroxyl radical to mc lr degradation was similar in all three uv254 based experiments with 8 63 in fa free solution and 9 84 and 10 67 in the large fa and small fa solutions respectively the observed similarity of the contribution of hydroxyl radical to mc lr degradation in all three experiments was consistent with the calculated steady state concentration of ho in these experiments rcs also contributed to mc lr decay in the chlorine uv254 process however there were large differences in the contributions of rcs to mc lr decay in these three fa solutions for example the chlorine oxide radical was responsible for 14 0 and 17 4 of mc lr decay in the fa free and large mw fa experiments respectively which was far greater than that of 0 4 in the small mw fa solution by contrast the contributions of chlorine radicals were 1 86 and 0 67 in fa free and large mw fa solutions respectively which was much lower than that observed in the small mw fa solution at 9 74 this indicated that the small mw fa significantly altered the generation of different rcs which in turn influenced the degradation of mc lr the contribution of cl2 and ozone toward mc lr degradation was not taken into account in this study that is because of the lower second order reaction rate constants of cl2 and ozone toward mc lr and their relatively low steady state concentration as shown in table s4 the second order reaction rate constant for reaction of mc lr with cl2 is 2 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of mc lr with other radicals in addition the concentration of cl2 in the chlorine uv process has also been reported to be of the same order of magnitude as other radicals the contributions of radical mediated reactions toward mc lr degradation will be governed by the product of their second order reaction rate constant and their steady state concentration pan et al 2020 this information suggests that cl2 will be 2 3 orders of magnitude less effective than other radicals in solution for mc lr degradation therefore this study did not take cl2 into account also previous literature reported that the second order reaction rate constant of ozone toward mc lr was 4 1 105 m 1 s 1 which is 2 5 orders of magnitude lower than that of radicals toward mc lr onstad et al 2007 additionally it has been reported that the quantum yield of ozone formation in chlorine uv254 process is 0 074 mole einstein while the corresponding quantum yields for formation of reactive radicals are 0 133 mole einstein for ho and 0 278 mole einstein for cl thereby suggesting that the steady state concentration of ozone will orders of magnitude lower than that of the participating radicals buxton and subhani 1972b bulman et al 2019 this information suggested that the contribution of ozone to the oxidation of mc lr would be orders of magnitude lower than that of the radicals thus ozone was not taken into account in the chlorine uv254 process the contribution of other to mc lr degradation are about 26 22 5 as well as 30 2 in small mw fa large mw fa and fa free solution respectively these effects may be attributable to contributions of nitrogenous radicals which are generated from the arginine moiety of mc lr during chlorine uv254 treatment process however the second order reaction rate constants between nitrogenous radicals and mc lr are unknown and there is no specific scavenger to remove nitrogenous radicals thus the contribution of each nitrogenous radical to pollutant degradation could not be estimated directly in the current time nonetheless comparing the observed first order rate constants for mc lr decay in these two chlorine uv254 treatment groups with different mw fa the difference of other to the contribution of mc lr degradation was about 3 5 indicating that fa molecular weight may not lead to large differences of nitrogenous radical contribution to mc lr degradation therefore the change of observed degradation rate constants of mc lr in different mw fa solutions could account for the variation of the contribution of cl and clo to mc lr degradation in order to reveal the mechanism of the different contributions of radicals to mc lr photolysis rates in different fa solutions the components of fa were quantified by ft icr ms afterward the ft icr ms information was visualized on van krevelen diagrams to show formulas which were present in different compound classes fig s5 presents the van krevelen diagrams and the ft icr ms spectra of different mw fa which indicates prevalence of seven different components of fa although the location of a compound on a van krevelen diagram does not directly indicate if the compound belongs to a particular class compound compositions tend to be structurally similar to compounds within that class kim et al 2003 therefore this method of analysis provided an indication of the composition of fa these data were then used to calculate the relative contribution of each component type for both fa size fractions the data presented in fig 3 indicate that the lignin ratio decreases from 90 2 to 81 4 as the fa molecular weight increased from below 10 kda to above 10 kda this change will affect the steady state concentration of clo which will then change the contribution of clo to mc lr degradation two pathways may account for this difference on the one hand chloroform will be produced when lignin reacts with free chlorine and cl rook 1977 wever and barnett 2017 this reaction rate constant varies with the molecular weight of nom in the solutions the second order rate constants of fulvic acid with cl and humic acid with cl are k fa cl 6 6 108 1 11 109 mc 1 s 1 and k ha cl 4 26 108 5 3 108 mc 1 s 1 respectively while the generation rate constants from cl to clo are around 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 buxton and subhani 1972a buxton and subhani 1972b kläning and wolff 1985 these rate constants indicate that there will be competition between the transformation reaction of cl to clo and the reaction of cl vs fa ha where the competition of fa was much higher than that of ha also the average molecular weights of fa and ha are 1517 2019 da and 2977 3320 da and the lignin ratios of fa and ha are about 65 and 15 77 indicating that the higher lignin ratio material small molecular weight fa will have a higher competition to react with cl which in turn hinders the transformation from cl to clo and then decreases the contribution of clo to mc lr photo degradation qin et al 2019 guo et al 2020 therefore clo contributes less to mc lr photodecay in small mw fa solutions higher lignin ratio than in large mw fa solutions lower lignin ratio and fa free solution on the other hand the lignin components in fa may also quench clo previous research has indicated that the lignin component in dom tends to react with clo indicating that small mw fa with high lignin ratio tends to quench more clo which also diminishes the contribution of clo to mc lr photo degradation bulman and remucal 2020 it should be noted that the reaction of lignin like components with cl does not necessarily mean a low cl steady state concentration the concentration of cl depends on both its consumption in the reaction with lignin like components and its generation from free chlorine as shown in fig s2 the free chlorine decay constant is 0 0025 s 1 and 0 0016 s 1 in fa free and large mw fa solution while it is 0 0006 s 1 in small mw fa solution demonstrating that there is a higher residual free chlorine dose in small fa solution than in fa free and large mw fa solution during the photo degradation process therefore a higher residual free chlorine concentration tends to generate more cl in small molecular weight solution than that in the other two solutions while the reaction between lignin and cl only has competition with the generation of clo from cl it will not affect the generation of cl from free chlorine thus there is a higher steady state concentration of cl and a lower steady state concentration of clo in small molecular weight fa solution than that in large molecular weight fa or fa free solution moreover composition ratio changes were evident among the tannins protein like components as well as condensed aromatics where the ratios increased from 4 06 to 5 45 from 0 37 to 1 65 as well as from 3 78 to 10 31 respectively the ratios of tannins and protein like components were small suggesting they are not likely to affect the contributions of radicals to mc lr degradation however the ratio of the condensed aromatics had a comparatively large change which had a lower ratio of hydrogen to carbon and contained less phenolic hydroxyl group electron rich functional groups berg et al 2019 therefore the chlorine radical had the rare possibility to react with condensed aromatics which in turn would not reduce the transformation of cl to clo 3 3 the effect of fa on mc lr photo degradation products in the chlorine uv254 process measurements of combined chlorine concentration were conducted using the n n diethyl 1 4 phenylenediamine with potassium iodize dpd ki method at chlorine mc lr molar ratio of 11 1 initial chlorine dose of 11 μm as cl2 and initial mc lr dose of 1 μm after 3 hours of exposure in the chlorine uv process the residual chlorine concentration was reduced to below the detection limit 0 1 μm as cl2 indicating that free chlorine was essentially consumed in this reaction thus the signal of total chlorine with the dpd ki method represented combined chlorine fig 4 presents the combined chlorine concentration in different fa conditions generally the highest combined chlorine concentration was present in the fa free solution with a value at 6 73 μm while corresponding values of 5 35 μm and 3 53 μm were observed in the large and small mw fa solutions respectively which were 79 and 53 of combined chlorine concentration present in the fa free solution the combined chlorine signal can be treated as n chlorinated mc lr or its degraded fragment shang and blatchley 1999 weaver et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 therefore the information presented in fig 4 implies that both of these fa mw fractions inhibit mc lr chlorination since the arginine side chain of mc lr has several substitution reaction positions it can be inferred that fa will prevent this chain from being chlorinated this inhibition is much more significant in a small fa solution than in a large fa solution in order to further reveal the mechanism of the chlorination inhibition of fa and the rate variation of mc lr photo decay in different fa solutions the kinetic constants of free chlorine decay in different fa solutions were calculated and shown in fig 4 there was a high value of chlorine decay kinetic constant at 0 0025 s 1 in the fa free solution while this value decreased to 0 0016 and 0 0006 s 1 in the large and small mw fa solutions respectively this trend coincided with variations of combined chlorine concentration indicating fa decreased the chlorine decay rate which then diminished the quantum yield rate and the transformation from free chlorine to a series of radicals finally diminishing the chlorination of the arginine chain in mc lr the chlorinated arginine group with n cl bonds will generate chlorine radicals and nitrogenous radicals under exposure to uv254 radiation to promote the decay of mc lr therefore it can be inferred that the rate of photo decay of mc lr will be positively correlated with the combined chlorine concentration this is consistent with the behavior illustrated in fig 1 and fig 4 wherein the mc lr in the fa free solution demonstrated the highest decay rate under uv254 irradiation and contained the highest combined chlorine dose while the mc lr in small mw fa solution demonstrated the opposite trends more generally only those n h bonds within the mc lr that were not associated with peptide bonds were assumed to undergo chlorine substitution i e formation of an n cl bond because n chlorination within peptide bonds tends to be a slow process soltermann et al 2015 therefore n h bonds associated with peptide bonds were assumed to not contribute to the formation of combined chlorine the relative primary radical generation from mc lr photolysis in this reaction was calculated for estimating the relatively amount of nitrogenous radicals from arginine moiety shen et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 the rate of primary radical generation is directly proportional to the production of ε254 фinn 254 which could be calculated by the formula 1 1 d m d t 2 303 e 254 ε 254 φ i n n 254 m 1000 c m 3 l where m refers to concentration of mc lr mol l e 254 refers to uv254 photon irradiance einstein cm2 s ε 254 refers to molar absorption coefficient of mc lr l mol cm under uv254 irradiation and φ inn 254 refers to the innate quantum yield of mc lr photolysis mole einstein the product of ε254 фinn 254 was calculated as 3248 l cm 1 einstein 1 for the small mw fa solution and 3757 l cm 1 einstein 1 for the large mw fa solution both of which were smaller than the corresponding product for the fa free solution which was 4266 l cm 1 einstein 1 these results indicate that fa quenches or inhibits the formation of nitrogenous radical generation from mc lr photolysis by the chlorine uv254 process and small mw fa had a higher inhibitory effect than large mw fa thus there is more combined chlorine and nitrogenous radicals generated in the chlorine uv254 process in large mw fa solutions and contribute more to the mc lr photodegradation than in small mw fa solutions fig s6 illustrates the dynamic behavior of the main mc lr products resulting from the chlorine uv254 process or chlorination alone in different fa solutions the peak area of the eic plot extracted and integrated from original mass spectra by setting specific m z value was employed here to represent the relative amount of each mc lr photo degradation product fig s6a and fig s6b illustrate the dynamics of monochloro hydroxy mc lr and monochloro mc lr respectively which are monochlorination products of mc lr indicating that chlorine substitution represents an important reaction pathway in this process this reaction may occur within the adda chain or the arginine group the quantities of these two products decreased with time after roughly 2 min of reaction time in all treatments monochloro hydroxy mc lr was generated most rapidly in the fa free solution followed by large mw fa and chlorine alone treatment while its formation was least effective in the small fa solution monochloro mc lr displayed similar temporal trends as monochloro hydroxy mc lr in the three chlorine uv254 treatments however its quantity increased continuously with time in each experiment thereby indicating that monochloro mc lr is relatively stable as to the behaviors of monohydroxy mc lr and dihydroxy mc lr in fig s6c and fig s6d their relative rates of formation in the three chlorine uv254 treatments followed the order fa free solution large mw fa solution small mw fa solution dihydroxy mc lr in the chlorine alone treatment remained at a lower generation amount than the other three groups while monohydroxy mc lr had a higher generation amount in the chlorine alone treatment than that in the small mw fa treatment but lower than the other two chlorine uv254 treatment groups usually monohydroxy mc lr behaved as a transition product between mc lr and dihydroxy mc lr antoniou et al 2008 this phenomenon demonstrated that fa especially small mw fa prevented the hydroxylation of mc lr leading to low hydroxyl generation rate in fa solution nevertheless monohydroxy mc lr is difficult to transform to dihydroxy mc lr in the chlorine alone treatment because of lack of hydroxyl radical resulting in monohydroxy mc lr being the main composition of hydroxylated mc lr zhang et al 2016 fig s6 e f g present three intermediate products of mc lr from hydroxylation and chlorination to mineralization where all three products had a relatively high rate of formation at the beginning of the experiment then decreased with the experiment time in fa free solution and large mw fa solution this phenomenon indicated that radicals may be generated and used to further oxidize or mineralize the chlorinated and hydroxylated mc lr in free fa and large mw fa solution onstad et al 2007 furthermore the results also illustrated that large mw fa could only slightly weaken the performance of the chlorine uv254 process and has not deeply changed the reaction process however the continuously increasing trend of the products at m z 811 and 795 in the small mw fa solution indicated that the intermediate product was not effectively degraded because of the lack of radical at the end of the photochemical process illustrating that small mw fa prevented the mc lr mineralization process and promoted the accumulation of the intermediate product onstad et al 2007 in the chlorine alone case three products were still maintained at a very low level through all time points this is because this treatment method does not generate enough radical and they cannot promote further oxidization after generating monochloride mc lr ho et al 2006 merel et al 2009 the proposed transformation pathway of mc lr during chlorine uv254 or chlorine alone processes is summarized in fig 5 3 4 mc lr and its degradation products digestive tract cytotoxicity in chlorine uv254 process in different mw fa solutions fig 6 presents the cytotoxicity see eq s12 change of mc lr and its degradation products in the chlorine uv254 or chlorination alone process in fa or fa free solution where all cytotoxicity treatments decreased significantly p 0 05 after chlorine uv254 or chlorination alone compared to the non treated samples the cytotoxicity of the samples in the fa free small and large mw fa solutions with chlorine uv254 process of 60 min were decreased by 67 9 73 5 and 52 5 however this value was only 43 4 in the chlorination alone treatment suggesting that the chlorine uv254 process was a better mc lr detoxification system than chlorine alone process this is believed to be attributable to the fact that the mc lr concentration was not significantly decreased in the chlorination alone treatment compared to that of chlorine uv254 treatment the initial cytotoxicity of mc lr in the fa free solution with the chlorine uv254 process and chlorination alone process were 14 69 and 14 34 respectively while they were 7 69 and 6 88 in the small and large mw fa solution respectively suggesting that fa significantly p 0 05 decreased the cytotoxicity of mc lr whether mc lr was photo degraded by chlorine uv254 process or not park et al 2017 karci et al 2018 since fa has many functional groups which can diminish the bioavailability of toxic compounds this phenomenon may be attributed to the effect of fa on decreasing mc lr bioavailability weaver et al 2009 karci et al 2018 comparing the two mw fa solutions with the chlorine uv254 process the cytotoxicity of mc lr in small mw fa solution decreased from 7 69 to 2 05 while this value decreased from 6 88 to 3 27 in large mw fa solution indicating that small mw fa had better performance on mc lr detoxification than large mw fa although there is a higher mc lr degradation rate in the large mw fa solution consequently it appears that the reduction in mc lr bioavailability by fa contributed more to detoxification than mc lr photolysis berg et al 2019 additionally small mw fa showed better detoxification than large mw fa probably resulting from a higher intensity of functional group in small mw fa solution than the large one where the two mw fas have the same fa concentration in mg c l high functional group intensity on fa means higher possibility to react with mc lr which then decrease the bioavailability of mc lr and its products karci et al 2018 generally there will be a better performance on mc lr detoxification under a higher mc lr degradation rate without the effect of fa because of a greater decrease of mc lr dose in the chlorine uv process than in chlorine alone treatment process however fa plays two different roles in mc lr detoxification in the chlorine uv process first fa especially small mw fa will hinder the photo degradation of mc lr during the chlorine uv process which has a negative effect on mc lr detoxication second fa especially small mw fa will decrease mc lr bioavailability through its functional group and promote the detoxification of mc lr thus the observed cytotoxicity of mc lr will be influenced by the combined effects of these two processes although the second process appears to dominate the detoxification of mc lr 4 conclusions this study focused on the effect of fa molecular weight and composition on the mc lr photo degradation in chlorine uv254 process the results indicated that fa in smaller mw more significantly decreased the mc lr photo degradation rate in the chlorine uv254 process compared with that by large mw fa inhibition was mainly attributed to the lignin like moieties in fa molecule which hindered the transformation of cl to clo and scavenged clo the intermediate products of mc lr tended to be accumulated in the chlorine uv254 process in the presence of small mw fa while almost all the mc lr was transformed into small products in the presence of large mw fa nevertheless the fa rather than chlorine uv254 process was the main reason of mc lr cytotoxicity reduction in this process these findings serve as a reference to operators of waterworks for optimizing the combined application of chlorine and uv irradiation to optimize mc lr degradation in waterworks with the raw water containing lower average mw fa e g water intake within the downstream reaches of a river it may be appropriate to increase the dose of a secondary oxidant such as potassium permanganate to remove fa and enhance the mc lr photo degradation however this approach will be less important for facilities in which raw water is taken from areas that are characterized by relatively high mw fa often in upstream reaches of rivers moreover the results are beneficial for establishing a model to predict the performance of mc lr degradation rate and

17182,microcystin lr mc lr a polypeptide toxin generated by cyanobacteria threatens the safety of drinking water supplies in this study fulvic acid fa was separated into two molecular weight mw ranges to evaluate the effects of fa size on mc lr degradation in the chlorine uv process the rates of mc lr degradation were significantly reduced in fa containing water 3 7 10 3 s 1 for small mw fa 4 3 10 3 s 1 for large mw fa as compared with fa free water 4 9 10 3 s 1 the contributions of clo to mc lr degradation were dramatically lower in small mw fa water 0 4 than large mw fa 13 9 and fa free water 17 4 suggesting inhibition by lignin like substances in fa in the transformation of cl to clo and scavenging clo monochlorination and hydroxylation occurred in the first step of the mc lr degradation process the accumulation of intermediate products in the chlorine uv process indicated that small mw fa inhibited further degradation of mc lr small mw fa rather than mc lr degradation was the dominant factor in minimizing mc lr cytotoxicity toward a human intestinal epithelial cell line graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microcystin lr fulvic acid molecular weight chlorine uv process photodegradation detoxification 1 introduction cyanobacteria are globally ubiquitous they grow in a wide range of water bodies including lakes reservoirs and slow current streams with favorable temperature and nutrients funkey et al 2014 gardner et al 2017 these water bodies are often used as sources of drinking water cyanobacteria produce a group of toxins called microcystins mcs that are released to water after cyanobacteria death and become water contaminants brophy et al 2019 hu and rzymski 2019 janssen 2019 mcs are cyclic peptides containing seven amino acids two of which can be substituted by different kinds of amino acid moieties duan et al 2018 their structures tend to be stable mcs can persist after exposure to harsh conditions such as boiling microcystin lr mc lr is among the most prevalent and most toxic of the mcs the structure of mc lr is illustrated in fig s1 all mcs have a side chain of 2s 3s 8s 9s 3 amino 9 methoxy 2 6 8 trimethyl 10 phenyldeca 4 6 dienoic acid adda the structural differences among the mcs are attributable to amino acid groups at positions 2 and 4 mc lr includes leucine l at position 2 and arginine r at position 4 the inclusion of double bonds in adda and the arginine chains are critical for expressing antibody binding specificity which in turn is critical for inducing toxicity sharma et al 2012 ufelmann et al 2012 zong et al 2013 therefore damaging to the adda group or the arginine group can result in a decrease in the toxicity of mc lr the world health organization who has suggested an upper limit concentration of mc lr as 1 0 μg l in drinking water world health organization 2017 the chlorine uv process cl uv is among the family of advanced oxidation processes aops that are effective for the degradation of a wide variety of recalcitrant pollutants the structure of mc lr suggests that it should be susceptible to degradation by the chlorine uv process because the unsaturated c c bonds within the adda and mdha moieties as well as the n h bonds within its arginine moiety facilitate reactions with radicals and free chlorine he et al 2012 remucal and manley 2016 in fact mc lr degradation and detoxification by the chlorine uv process have been demonstrated under controlled laboratory conditions zhang et al 2016 in this process free chlorine hocl and ocl pka 7 5 will cause n chlorination of unbound amine groups and also oxidation and hydration at double bond structures within the adda group the n cl bond within this molecule is known to be photolabile and to generate an amine radical and a chlorine radical as a result of uv photolysis li and blatchley 2009 de laat et al 2010 photolysis of hocl and ocl results in the production of reactive oxygen species ros such as the hydroxyl radical oh which along with the chlorine radical can be transformed into other reactive chlorine species rcs buxton et al 1988 sun et al 2016 duan et al 2017 these radicals are strong oxidants and have the potential to attack the mc lr molecule in turn this may lead to alteration of toxicity khanna et al 1992 among these reactive intermediates the hydroxyl radical tends to be non selective and is likely to react with many functional groups of mc lr while rcs which include the chlorine radical cl the chlorine oxide radical clo and the dichloride radical anion cl2 tend to be selective toward electron rich groups alfassi et al 1989 alegre et al 2000 guo et al 2017 thus the photodegradation of mc lr in the presence of free chlorine will involve several reaction pathways that will operate in parallel the steady state concentration of radicals and their contributions to contaminant degradation will be influenced by the matrix of dissolved constituents within a water supply hou et al 2018 karci et al 2018 fulvic acid fa represents a principal component of natural organic matter nom that is an active participant in several chemical treatment processes zhang et al 2014 fa has been characterized by an average chemical formula of c135h182o95n5s2 with an average molecular weight of 3 456 kda chin et al 1994 li et al 2013 its structure can be characterized as a loose assembly of aromatic organic polymers with many carboxyl groups cooh phenolic oh alcoholic oh and a small number of amino acid groups fa can function as an internal filter to protect dissolved constituents from photolysis plancque et al 2001 reemtsma and these 2005 these and reemtsma 2005 alvarez puebla et al 2006 however the number of functional groups components and uv absorbance varies with fa molecular weight mw which also varies with geographical location decrease from upstream to downstream of a river chin et al 1994 wang et al 2010 thus the effects of fa on photolysis vary with the molecular weight of fa as such raw waters from different areas can demonstrate different contaminant degradation performance in the chlorine uv process because of different fa molecular weight distributions therefore an essential need exists to define the effects of fa molecular weight on mc lr degradation and detoxification previous research has indicated that mc lr causes liver toxicity by inhibiting a class of protein phosphatases including protein phosphatase 1 pp1 and protein phosphatase 2a pp2a fontanillo and koehn 2018 he et al 2018 thus the focus of previous research has been on the effects of mc lr and its photolysis products on liver cytotoxicity often using human hepatoma cells and the pp2a assay kit to assess toxicity reactions duan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 however ingestion of water containing mc lr and its chlorine uv products will first come into contact with the gastrointestinal epithelial cells chen et al 2005 wu et al 2018 kubickova et al 2019 therefore it can be inferred that human intestinal epithelial cells may be injured by exposure to mc lr and its degradation products however there is little information in the literature related to the effects of mc lr and its degradation products on human intestinal epithelial cells the nature of damage to these cells in this process is largely undefined the central hypothesis of this study was that different fa mw fractions would yield different effects on mc lr photolysis in the chlorine uv process which in turn will result in different cytotoxicity responses in human digestive tract cells to test this hypothesis fa was divided into two mw fractions then the kinetics of mc lr degradation in the chlorine uv process in the presence of different fa mw fractions was investigated and the contributions of photolysis and radical based mechanisms to mc lr degradation were examined finally the cytotoxicity of mc lr and its degradation products were assessed using a human ileocecal adenocarcinoma cell line hct 8 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sources of chemicals are shown in si text s1 2 2 experimental procedures water samples 30 ml were contained in a petri dish with a quartz plate lid which included 1 0 μm mc lr buffered to ph 7 0 by 10 mm phosphate buffer this initial mc lr concentration was used in decay experiments to facilitate quantification by hplc hcl and ammonium hydroxide were used to adjust the ph of the sample to 7 0 for lc ms ms to avoid the damage that could be caused by other buffers such as phosphate within the mass spectrometer in the radical steady state concentration experiments nb ba dmob were spiked into water samples as radical probe compounds tba was added as a scavenger to remove specific radicals such as ho cl clo while retaining other radicals the dose of probe compounds and scavenger used in this study are mentioned in si text s3 and s4 prior to the isolation of different mw size fractions the fa standard sample solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm glass fiber membrane filter which had previously been placed in a muffle furnace at 500 c to remove organic contaminants afterward the filtrate was separated using a 10 kda molecular weight cutoff filter millipore ultrafiltration membranes to two size fractions because the ratios of components in dom are quite different between below 10 kda and above 10 kda while the component difference in dom below 10 kda are less significant the filtrate fraction with fa above 10 kda will be referred to as the large mw fa solution while the fa fraction with mw below 10 kda will be referred to as the small mw fa solution these solutions were diluted to reach 10 mg c l and then stored at 4 c prior to use the experiments were started by spiking aqueous solution of mc lr with a naocl stock solution in a petri dish that was placed under a uv254 collimated beam which yielded irradiance of 3 82 10 10 einstein cm2 a magnetic stirrer was employed to mix the water samples during uv exposure at pre determined time intervals 1 0 ml samples were collected and 0 1 mg sodium sulfite was added to quench the residual chlorine the samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane filter to remove impurities and then the amounts of residual mc lr products and toxicity were quantified the experiments with uv254 irradiation alone without hocl and chlorination alone without uv254 irradiation were conducted following the same procedures the residual free chlorine and total chlorine were detected in separate experiments without quenching all experiments were conducted in triplicate and the relative standard deviation of the three replicates was below 5 in all the experiments 2 3 analytical methods steady state concentrations of radicals and their contributions to mc lr photolysis the analytical methods to measure free chlorine combined chlorine mc lr and its products components of fa are detailed in si text s2 steady state concentrations of radicals and their contributions to mc lr photolysis presented in si text s3 and s4 2 4 cytotoxicity tests cytotoxicity toward hct 8 cells was measured by lactate dehydrogenase ldh release using a cytotoxicity assay kit thermo scientific frederick md roberts et al 2001 briefly hct 8 atcc ccl 244 cells were grown in dulbecco s modified eagle s medium supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum atlanta biologicals on 24 well tissue culture plates cell membrane damage releases ldh into the cell culture media extracellular ldh in the media was quantified by a coupled enzymatic reaction in which ldh catalyzed the conversion of lactate to pyruvate via nad reduction to nadh diaphorase then used nadh to reduce a tetrazolium salt int to a red formazan product that was measured by absorbance at 490 nm formazan formation was assumed to be directly proportional to the amount of ldh released into the medium which is indicative of cytotoxicity the details of the experiment and cytotoxicity calculation equation are presented in si text s5 and eq s12 2 5 statistical analysis the statistical analysis including mean values standard deviations linear regressions and t tests were performed using statistical product and service solutions spss software results with p values 0 05 are reported as significant for t tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of mc lr degradation with the chlorine uv254 process uv254 alone and chlorine alone the decomposition of mc lr by uv254 photolysis chlorine and the chlorine uv254 process with different mw fa was examined as is shown in fig 1 and table s1 mc lr degradation followed pseudo first order degradation kinetics in all five processes the chlorine uv254 process yielded faster degradation of mc lr than either uv254 alone or chlorination alone regardless of the presence or absence of fa the mc lr photolysis rate constant was 0 0003 s 1 under uv254 irradiation alone while this rate became 0 0016 s 1 when an initial chlorine concentration of 42 μm was applied without uv254 irradiation these results are similar to those reported previously zhang et al 2019 among the three chlorine uv254 process experiments mc lr degradation was the fastest when fa was absent reaching degradation rate constant of 0 0049 s 1 3 fold higher than that of chlorine alone the degradation rate constant of mc lr was 0 0043 s 1 in the large mw fa solution in chlorine uv254 process the degradation rate constant after the same exposure period was 0 0037 s 1 in the presence of small mw fa 3 2 contributions of uv254 radiation free chlorine and radicals to the degradation of mc lr in fa solutions as shown in fig s2 there was about 85 free chlorine decay in the chlorine uv254 process in the fa free solution within 10 min while only 64 and 24 free chlorine decay was observed in the same time period for the large fa and small fa solutions respectively these trends indicate fa especially small mw fa prevents free chlorine decay and this effect will further disturb the generation of rcs and weaken the mc lr degradation rate fig s3 a b and c and table s2 present the relative concentration variations of different probe compounds and their corresponding first order kinetic constants based on this information the steady state concentrations of different radicals were calculated through the use of eq s1 s3 in si the results of these calculations are summarized in table 1 the ho ss was similar in each of the fa solutions however there was a significantly higher value of cl ss and lower value of clo ss in the small mw fa solution than in the large mw fa and fa free solutions this indicated that the presence of fa in water had minimal effect on ho ss but a profound effect on the steady state concentrations of rcs specifically small mw fa enhanced the concentration of chlorine radical and decreased the chlorine oxide radical while large mw fa increased both of them since rcs tend to be relatively selective radicals that tend to react preferentially with electron rich functional groups such as diene phenyl ring moieties and arginine moieties duan et al 2018 the degradation of mc lr by the chlorine uv254 process can be reasonably expected to be influenced by the presence or absence of fa constituents the contributions of different factors to mc lr degradation was calculated by eq s4 s11 in si coupled with the observed mc lr first order decay constants derived from the experiments with radical scavengers fig s4 and table s3 the results are presented in fig 2 direct photolysis by uv254 irradiation represented a small contribution to mc lr removal in all three chlorine uv254 processes in each case direct photolysis was responsible for less than 7 of observed degradation the rate of direct photolysis in solutions containing fa was reduced by the inner filter effect of fa degradation of mc lr by direct reaction with free chlorine was responsible for 49 45 and 39 of overall mc lr degradation in the small fa large fa and fa free solutions respectively the contribution of hydroxyl radical to mc lr degradation was similar in all three uv254 based experiments with 8 63 in fa free solution and 9 84 and 10 67 in the large fa and small fa solutions respectively the observed similarity of the contribution of hydroxyl radical to mc lr degradation in all three experiments was consistent with the calculated steady state concentration of ho in these experiments rcs also contributed to mc lr decay in the chlorine uv254 process however there were large differences in the contributions of rcs to mc lr decay in these three fa solutions for example the chlorine oxide radical was responsible for 14 0 and 17 4 of mc lr decay in the fa free and large mw fa experiments respectively which was far greater than that of 0 4 in the small mw fa solution by contrast the contributions of chlorine radicals were 1 86 and 0 67 in fa free and large mw fa solutions respectively which was much lower than that observed in the small mw fa solution at 9 74 this indicated that the small mw fa significantly altered the generation of different rcs which in turn influenced the degradation of mc lr the contribution of cl2 and ozone toward mc lr degradation was not taken into account in this study that is because of the lower second order reaction rate constants of cl2 and ozone toward mc lr and their relatively low steady state concentration as shown in table s4 the second order reaction rate constant for reaction of mc lr with cl2 is 2 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of mc lr with other radicals in addition the concentration of cl2 in the chlorine uv process has also been reported to be of the same order of magnitude as other radicals the contributions of radical mediated reactions toward mc lr degradation will be governed by the product of their second order reaction rate constant and their steady state concentration pan et al 2020 this information suggests that cl2 will be 2 3 orders of magnitude less effective than other radicals in solution for mc lr degradation therefore this study did not take cl2 into account also previous literature reported that the second order reaction rate constant of ozone toward mc lr was 4 1 105 m 1 s 1 which is 2 5 orders of magnitude lower than that of radicals toward mc lr onstad et al 2007 additionally it has been reported that the quantum yield of ozone formation in chlorine uv254 process is 0 074 mole einstein while the corresponding quantum yields for formation of reactive radicals are 0 133 mole einstein for ho and 0 278 mole einstein for cl thereby suggesting that the steady state concentration of ozone will orders of magnitude lower than that of the participating radicals buxton and subhani 1972b bulman et al 2019 this information suggested that the contribution of ozone to the oxidation of mc lr would be orders of magnitude lower than that of the radicals thus ozone was not taken into account in the chlorine uv254 process the contribution of other to mc lr degradation are about 26 22 5 as well as 30 2 in small mw fa large mw fa and fa free solution respectively these effects may be attributable to contributions of nitrogenous radicals which are generated from the arginine moiety of mc lr during chlorine uv254 treatment process however the second order reaction rate constants between nitrogenous radicals and mc lr are unknown and there is no specific scavenger to remove nitrogenous radicals thus the contribution of each nitrogenous radical to pollutant degradation could not be estimated directly in the current time nonetheless comparing the observed first order rate constants for mc lr decay in these two chlorine uv254 treatment groups with different mw fa the difference of other to the contribution of mc lr degradation was about 3 5 indicating that fa molecular weight may not lead to large differences of nitrogenous radical contribution to mc lr degradation therefore the change of observed degradation rate constants of mc lr in different mw fa solutions could account for the variation of the contribution of cl and clo to mc lr degradation in order to reveal the mechanism of the different contributions of radicals to mc lr photolysis rates in different fa solutions the components of fa were quantified by ft icr ms afterward the ft icr ms information was visualized on van krevelen diagrams to show formulas which were present in different compound classes fig s5 presents the van krevelen diagrams and the ft icr ms spectra of different mw fa which indicates prevalence of seven different components of fa although the location of a compound on a van krevelen diagram does not directly indicate if the compound belongs to a particular class compound compositions tend to be structurally similar to compounds within that class kim et al 2003 therefore this method of analysis provided an indication of the composition of fa these data were then used to calculate the relative contribution of each component type for both fa size fractions the data presented in fig 3 indicate that the lignin ratio decreases from 90 2 to 81 4 as the fa molecular weight increased from below 10 kda to above 10 kda this change will affect the steady state concentration of clo which will then change the contribution of clo to mc lr degradation two pathways may account for this difference on the one hand chloroform will be produced when lignin reacts with free chlorine and cl rook 1977 wever and barnett 2017 this reaction rate constant varies with the molecular weight of nom in the solutions the second order rate constants of fulvic acid with cl and humic acid with cl are k fa cl 6 6 108 1 11 109 mc 1 s 1 and k ha cl 4 26 108 5 3 108 mc 1 s 1 respectively while the generation rate constants from cl to clo are around 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 buxton and subhani 1972a buxton and subhani 1972b kläning and wolff 1985 these rate constants indicate that there will be competition between the transformation reaction of cl to clo and the reaction of cl vs fa ha where the competition of fa was much higher than that of ha also the average molecular weights of fa and ha are 1517 2019 da and 2977 3320 da and the lignin ratios of fa and ha are about 65 and 15 77 indicating that the higher lignin ratio material small molecular weight fa will have a higher competition to react with cl which in turn hinders the transformation from cl to clo and then decreases the contribution of clo to mc lr photo degradation qin et al 2019 guo et al 2020 therefore clo contributes less to mc lr photodecay in small mw fa solutions higher lignin ratio than in large mw fa solutions lower lignin ratio and fa free solution on the other hand the lignin components in fa may also quench clo previous research has indicated that the lignin component in dom tends to react with clo indicating that small mw fa with high lignin ratio tends to quench more clo which also diminishes the contribution of clo to mc lr photo degradation bulman and remucal 2020 it should be noted that the reaction of lignin like components with cl does not necessarily mean a low cl steady state concentration the concentration of cl depends on both its consumption in the reaction with lignin like components and its generation from free chlorine as shown in fig s2 the free chlorine decay constant is 0 0025 s 1 and 0 0016 s 1 in fa free and large mw fa solution while it is 0 0006 s 1 in small mw fa solution demonstrating that there is a higher residual free chlorine dose in small fa solution than in fa free and large mw fa solution during the photo degradation process therefore a higher residual free chlorine concentration tends to generate more cl in small molecular weight solution than that in the other two solutions while the reaction between lignin and cl only has competition with the generation of clo from cl it will not affect the generation of cl from free chlorine thus there is a higher steady state concentration of cl and a lower steady state concentration of clo in small molecular weight fa solution than that in large molecular weight fa or fa free solution moreover composition ratio changes were evident among the tannins protein like components as well as condensed aromatics where the ratios increased from 4 06 to 5 45 from 0 37 to 1 65 as well as from 3 78 to 10 31 respectively the ratios of tannins and protein like components were small suggesting they are not likely to affect the contributions of radicals to mc lr degradation however the ratio of the condensed aromatics had a comparatively large change which had a lower ratio of hydrogen to carbon and contained less phenolic hydroxyl group electron rich functional groups berg et al 2019 therefore the chlorine radical had the rare possibility to react with condensed aromatics which in turn would not reduce the transformation of cl to clo 3 3 the effect of fa on mc lr photo degradation products in the chlorine uv254 process measurements of combined chlorine concentration were conducted using the n n diethyl 1 4 phenylenediamine with potassium iodize dpd ki method at chlorine mc lr molar ratio of 11 1 initial chlorine dose of 11 μm as cl2 and initial mc lr dose of 1 μm after 3 hours of exposure in the chlorine uv process the residual chlorine concentration was reduced to below the detection limit 0 1 μm as cl2 indicating that free chlorine was essentially consumed in this reaction thus the signal of total chlorine with the dpd ki method represented combined chlorine fig 4 presents the combined chlorine concentration in different fa conditions generally the highest combined chlorine concentration was present in the fa free solution with a value at 6 73 μm while corresponding values of 5 35 μm and 3 53 μm were observed in the large and small mw fa solutions respectively which were 79 and 53 of combined chlorine concentration present in the fa free solution the combined chlorine signal can be treated as n chlorinated mc lr or its degraded fragment shang and blatchley 1999 weaver et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 therefore the information presented in fig 4 implies that both of these fa mw fractions inhibit mc lr chlorination since the arginine side chain of mc lr has several substitution reaction positions it can be inferred that fa will prevent this chain from being chlorinated this inhibition is much more significant in a small fa solution than in a large fa solution in order to further reveal the mechanism of the chlorination inhibition of fa and the rate variation of mc lr photo decay in different fa solutions the kinetic constants of free chlorine decay in different fa solutions were calculated and shown in fig 4 there was a high value of chlorine decay kinetic constant at 0 0025 s 1 in the fa free solution while this value decreased to 0 0016 and 0 0006 s 1 in the large and small mw fa solutions respectively this trend coincided with variations of combined chlorine concentration indicating fa decreased the chlorine decay rate which then diminished the quantum yield rate and the transformation from free chlorine to a series of radicals finally diminishing the chlorination of the arginine chain in mc lr the chlorinated arginine group with n cl bonds will generate chlorine radicals and nitrogenous radicals under exposure to uv254 radiation to promote the decay of mc lr therefore it can be inferred that the rate of photo decay of mc lr will be positively correlated with the combined chlorine concentration this is consistent with the behavior illustrated in fig 1 and fig 4 wherein the mc lr in the fa free solution demonstrated the highest decay rate under uv254 irradiation and contained the highest combined chlorine dose while the mc lr in small mw fa solution demonstrated the opposite trends more generally only those n h bonds within the mc lr that were not associated with peptide bonds were assumed to undergo chlorine substitution i e formation of an n cl bond because n chlorination within peptide bonds tends to be a slow process soltermann et al 2015 therefore n h bonds associated with peptide bonds were assumed to not contribute to the formation of combined chlorine the relative primary radical generation from mc lr photolysis in this reaction was calculated for estimating the relatively amount of nitrogenous radicals from arginine moiety shen et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 the rate of primary radical generation is directly proportional to the production of ε254 фinn 254 which could be calculated by the formula 1 1 d m d t 2 303 e 254 ε 254 φ i n n 254 m 1000 c m 3 l where m refers to concentration of mc lr mol l e 254 refers to uv254 photon irradiance einstein cm2 s ε 254 refers to molar absorption coefficient of mc lr l mol cm under uv254 irradiation and φ inn 254 refers to the innate quantum yield of mc lr photolysis mole einstein the product of ε254 фinn 254 was calculated as 3248 l cm 1 einstein 1 for the small mw fa solution and 3757 l cm 1 einstein 1 for the large mw fa solution both of which were smaller than the corresponding product for the fa free solution which was 4266 l cm 1 einstein 1 these results indicate that fa quenches or inhibits the formation of nitrogenous radical generation from mc lr photolysis by the chlorine uv254 process and small mw fa had a higher inhibitory effect than large mw fa thus there is more combined chlorine and nitrogenous radicals generated in the chlorine uv254 process in large mw fa solutions and contribute more to the mc lr photodegradation than in small mw fa solutions fig s6 illustrates the dynamic behavior of the main mc lr products resulting from the chlorine uv254 process or chlorination alone in different fa solutions the peak area of the eic plot extracted and integrated from original mass spectra by setting specific m z value was employed here to represent the relative amount of each mc lr photo degradation product fig s6a and fig s6b illustrate the dynamics of monochloro hydroxy mc lr and monochloro mc lr respectively which are monochlorination products of mc lr indicating that chlorine substitution represents an important reaction pathway in this process this reaction may occur within the adda chain or the arginine group the quantities of these two products decreased with time after roughly 2 min of reaction time in all treatments monochloro hydroxy mc lr was generated most rapidly in the fa free solution followed by large mw fa and chlorine alone treatment while its formation was least effective in the small fa solution monochloro mc lr displayed similar temporal trends as monochloro hydroxy mc lr in the three chlorine uv254 treatments however its quantity increased continuously with time in each experiment thereby indicating that monochloro mc lr is relatively stable as to the behaviors of monohydroxy mc lr and dihydroxy mc lr in fig s6c and fig s6d their relative rates of formation in the three chlorine uv254 treatments followed the order fa free solution large mw fa solution small mw fa solution dihydroxy mc lr in the chlorine alone treatment remained at a lower generation amount than the other three groups while monohydroxy mc lr had a higher generation amount in the chlorine alone treatment than that in the small mw fa treatment but lower than the other two chlorine uv254 treatment groups usually monohydroxy mc lr behaved as a transition product between mc lr and dihydroxy mc lr antoniou et al 2008 this phenomenon demonstrated that fa especially small mw fa prevented the hydroxylation of mc lr leading to low hydroxyl generation rate in fa solution nevertheless monohydroxy mc lr is difficult to transform to dihydroxy mc lr in the chlorine alone treatment because of lack of hydroxyl radical resulting in monohydroxy mc lr being the main composition of hydroxylated mc lr zhang et al 2016 fig s6 e f g present three intermediate products of mc lr from hydroxylation and chlorination to mineralization where all three products had a relatively high rate of formation at the beginning of the experiment then decreased with the experiment time in fa free solution and large mw fa solution this phenomenon indicated that radicals may be generated and used to further oxidize or mineralize the chlorinated and hydroxylated mc lr in free fa and large mw fa solution onstad et al 2007 furthermore the results also illustrated that large mw fa could only slightly weaken the performance of the chlorine uv254 process and has not deeply changed the reaction process however the continuously increasing trend of the products at m z 811 and 795 in the small mw fa solution indicated that the intermediate product was not effectively degraded because of the lack of radical at the end of the photochemical process illustrating that small mw fa prevented the mc lr mineralization process and promoted the accumulation of the intermediate product onstad et al 2007 in the chlorine alone case three products were still maintained at a very low level through all time points this is because this treatment method does not generate enough radical and they cannot promote further oxidization after generating monochloride mc lr ho et al 2006 merel et al 2009 the proposed transformation pathway of mc lr during chlorine uv254 or chlorine alone processes is summarized in fig 5 3 4 mc lr and its degradation products digestive tract cytotoxicity in chlorine uv254 process in different mw fa solutions fig 6 presents the cytotoxicity see eq s12 change of mc lr and its degradation products in the chlorine uv254 or chlorination alone process in fa or fa free solution where all cytotoxicity treatments decreased significantly p 0 05 after chlorine uv254 or chlorination alone compared to the non treated samples the cytotoxicity of the samples in the fa free small and large mw fa solutions with chlorine uv254 process of 60 min were decreased by 67 9 73 5 and 52 5 however this value was only 43 4 in the chlorination alone treatment suggesting that the chlorine uv254 process was a better mc lr detoxification system than chlorine alone process this is believed to be attributable to the fact that the mc lr concentration was not significantly decreased in the chlorination alone treatment compared to that of chlorine uv254 treatment the initial cytotoxicity of mc lr in the fa free solution with the chlorine uv254 process and chlorination alone process were 14 69 and 14 34 respectively while they were 7 69 and 6 88 in the small and large mw fa solution respectively suggesting that fa significantly p 0 05 decreased the cytotoxicity of mc lr whether mc lr was photo degraded by chlorine uv254 process or not park et al 2017 karci et al 2018 since fa has many functional groups which can diminish the bioavailability of toxic compounds this phenomenon may be attributed to the effect of fa on decreasing mc lr bioavailability weaver et al 2009 karci et al 2018 comparing the two mw fa solutions with the chlorine uv254 process the cytotoxicity of mc lr in small mw fa solution decreased from 7 69 to 2 05 while this value decreased from 6 88 to 3 27 in large mw fa solution indicating that small mw fa had better performance on mc lr detoxification than large mw fa although there is a higher mc lr degradation rate in the large mw fa solution consequently it appears that the reduction in mc lr bioavailability by fa contributed more to detoxification than mc lr photolysis berg et al 2019 additionally small mw fa showed better detoxification than large mw fa probably resulting from a higher intensity of functional group in small mw fa solution than the large one where the two mw fas have the same fa concentration in mg c l high functional group intensity on fa means higher possibility to react with mc lr which then decrease the bioavailability of mc lr and its products karci et al 2018 generally there will be a better performance on mc lr detoxification under a higher mc lr degradation rate without the effect of fa because of a greater decrease of mc lr dose in the chlorine uv process than in chlorine alone treatment process however fa plays two different roles in mc lr detoxification in the chlorine uv process first fa especially small mw fa will hinder the photo degradation of mc lr during the chlorine uv process which has a negative effect on mc lr detoxication second fa especially small mw fa will decrease mc lr bioavailability through its functional group and promote the detoxification of mc lr thus the observed cytotoxicity of mc lr will be influenced by the combined effects of these two processes although the second process appears to dominate the detoxification of mc lr 4 conclusions this study focused on the effect of fa molecular weight and composition on the mc lr photo degradation in chlorine uv254 process the results indicated that fa in smaller mw more significantly decreased the mc lr photo degradation rate in the chlorine uv254 process compared with that by large mw fa inhibition was mainly attributed to the lignin like moieties in fa molecule which hindered the transformation of cl to clo and scavenged clo the intermediate products of mc lr tended to be accumulated in the chlorine uv254 process in the presence of small mw fa while almost all the mc lr was transformed into small products in the presence of large mw fa nevertheless the fa rather than chlorine uv254 process was the main reason of mc lr cytotoxicity reduction in this process these findings serve as a reference to operators of waterworks for optimizing the combined application of chlorine and uv irradiation to optimize mc lr degradation in waterworks with the raw water containing lower average mw fa e g water intake within the downstream reaches of a river it may be appropriate to increase the dose of a secondary oxidant such as potassium permanganate to remove fa and enhance the mc lr photo degradation however this approach will be less important for facilities in which raw water is taken from areas that are characterized by relatively high mw fa often in upstream reaches of rivers moreover the results are beneficial for establishing a model to predict the performance of mc lr degradation rate and

17183,mineral humic complexes known as mineral associated organic matter maom are ubiquitous in natural waters however the interaction between organic pollutants and maom remains elusive which may affect their degradation process in this study photochemical transformation of chlorophene cp in the presence of maom prepared by coating aluminum hydroxide with humic acid ha hao was investigated our results showed that the degradation of cp was significantly enhanced in the presence of ha hao and the degradation rate constant was 5 times as that with ha only it was because the adsorption of cp to ha hao particles was greatly enhanced and concentration of reactive oxygen species ros was increased on ha hao surfaces which further promoted the reactions between cp and ros the quenching experiments combined with epr technology confirmed that superoxide anion o2 was the primary reactive radical on cp photodegradation more importantly the degradation of cp with ha hao followed a hydroxylation process rather than the oligomerization reaction with ha only spectroscopic analysis provided direct evidence for the formation of hydrogen bonding between cp phenolic hydroxyl group and surface oxygen of hao which would suppress the reactivity of phenolic hydroxyl group consequently the ortho and meta positions of cp became more facile for the hydroxylation reaction this study shows the importance of maom in altering the photochemical behavior and transformation pathway of organic contaminants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mineral associated organic matter selective reaction superoxide anions photodegradation hydroxylation process oligomerization 1 introduction chlorophene o benzyl p chlorophenol cp is widely used as a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent for general cleaning and disinfection in household and farming activities arlos et al 2015 forrez et al 2011 holzem et al 2014 as a result cp has been frequently detected in different environmental matrices bolobajev and goi 2017 the concentrations of cp can be as high as 0 12 μm in wastewater treatment plant influent and up to 0 60 μm in activated sludge sewage systems holzem et al 2014 rayaroth et al 2015 furthermore previous studies demonstrated that cp posed significant environmental risks for example cp was found to induce potential carcinogenic and mutagenic activities in aquatic and soil organisms shi et al 2016 recently it was reported that cp displayed antiandrogenic effect when detected in fish bile which was the most potent antiandrogen with a potency relative to flutamide standard equivalent of 13 rostkowski et al 2011 in addition cp is always associated with suspended particles and sediments after released into the environments due to its relatively hydrophobic property log k ow 3 60 arlos et al 2015 zhang and huang 2003 therefore it is of particular interest to study the transformation processes of cp in the environment for accurate risk assessment yin et al 2010 dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitously distributed in natural waters and sediments which is one of the most relevant photosensitizers to produce reactive oxygen species ros and other reactive intermediates e g excited triplet state of dom 3dom hassett 2006 latch and mcneill 2006 zhou et al 2019 many previous studies have indicated that these reactive species from dom produced after solar irradiation play important roles in the aquatic photodegradation of organic micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides gerecke et al 2001 wenk et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 however dom is readily adsorbed to the surfaces of particle matters or soil minerals from aqueous solution to form mineral associated organic matter maom sander et al 2004 subdiaga et al 2019 via diverse mechanisms including ligand exchange cation bridge van der waals interaction and electrostatic attraction armanious et al 2014 gu et al 1994 thus the major fraction of dom in sediments and aquifers is always presenting on the surface of solid phase rather than in solution subdiaga et al 2019 similar to dom it was reported that particulate organic matter was photochemically active to produce ros under uv or sunlight irradiation such as singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide anions o2 and excited state transients appiani and mcneill 2015 cottrell et al 2013 estapa and mayer 2010 miller and zepp 1979 in addition to their distribution in natural waters and soils dom and maom are among the dominant constituents in wastewater effluent systems lian et al 2020 and their interactions with organic contaminants under simulated solar irradiation are of significant environmental relevance therefore it is expected that maom can also participate in the photodegradation of pollutants but the important distinction was that maom induced degradation would be limited to the adsorbed species compared to dom however the degradation mechanisms of organic pollutants in the presence of maom have not been fully elucidated adlayers of dom on the surface of mineral particles in natural systems can strongly influence the transport transformation and bioavailability of many organic contaminants in soil and water environments via adsorption process cheng et al 2019 jiang et al 2014 yang et al 2020 yu et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 both soil minerals and dom phases may have significant impacts on the fate of organic and inorganic contaminants gu and karthikeyan 2005a b gu et al 2007 zhao et al 2011 for example the adsorption of tetracycline and ciprofloxacin on poorly crystalline or amorphous al and fe oxide minerals was quite rapid via the formation of strong inner sphere complexes between nitrogen or oxygen containing functional groups amide hydroxyl keto and carbonyl groups and surface al and fe gu and karthikeyan 2005a b the presence of maom may also influence the adsorption behavior of pollutants by altering the surface charges and potential adsorption sites of particles chorover et al 1999 wang and xing 2005 in addition the study by wang and xing 2005 indicated that phenanthrene adsorption to maom was significantly enhanced compared to bare mineral phase due to the hydrophobic interactions between phenanthrene and the bound humic substance and their research also suggested that partitioning was the dominant process for hydrophobic contaminants however the information about how the adsorption of organic pollutants may alter their transformation is still missing although plenty of researches have focused on the interactions between organic contaminants and maom murphy et al 1994 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2011 considering the photochemical reactivity of maom interfacial radical formation and further chemical reactions with the adsorbed organic pollutants are plausible therefore it is expected that the interaction between organic pollutants and maom may alter the environmental transformation behavior of adsorbed organics studies have shown that hydrous oxides of al fe and mn are important mineral components of soil particles which can account for up to 50 of the total soil mass gu and karthikeyan 2005b zhang and huang 2003 they are particularly effective in adsorbing and stabilizing organic matter in soils due to their large specific surface areas and high density of surface functional groups chorover and amistadi 2001 it s worth noting that direct chemical transformation reactions for organics are significant in the presence of fe and mn hydr oxides with redox active surfaces which may conceal the photochemical effect of organic matter on the mineral surface so the redox inert aluminum hydroxide hao was chosen as the model mineral which are generally present in wastewater following aluminum coagulation treatment chorghe et al 2017 rosenblum et al 2016 in the present study maom was prepared by coating aluminum hydroxide with humic acid ha hao herein the objective of this study was to compare the photochemical transformation of cp in the presence of maom and free dom under visible light irradiation experiments were conducted to investigate the reaction kinetics of cp at environmentally relevant concentrations and transformed products the reaction mechanisms for these reaction processes were explored with quenching experiments to determine reactive species attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir analysis and density functional theory dft computations on the basis of these experimental results the maom mediated reaction schemes of cp were proposed and compared to those with ha only under the identical irradiation condition it is expected that the findings obtained in this study can contribute to better understanding of different photochemical behaviors and transformation pathways of phenolic pollutants in the presence of ha or maom 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals cp 97 0 purity was purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa and used as received the sample of ha 99 purity was obtained from aladdin shanghai china alcl3 nacl and naoh reagent acs grade and trace metal grade hcl were from fisher scientific fair lawn nj usa benzoquinone bq and tert butanol tba were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa and used as received superoxide dismutase sod was obtained from sigma aldrich s 2515 hplc grade methanol was from merck co ltd germany radical trapping agent 5 5 dimethylpyrroline n oxide dmpo was purchased from dojindo japan fresh stock solutions were prepared for each batch of experiments 2 2 preparation of aluminum hydroxide humic acid complexes the mineral humic complex was prepared by a slightly modified method of chorover et al 1999 briefly ha stock solution was prepared by dissolving 200 mg ha into 1000 ml water then filtered 0 22 μm and stored in the dark two different ha solutions with the initial total organic carbon toc concentrations of 10 and 40 mgc l were reacted with freshly prepared hao to achieve significantly different humic surface coverages on hao gu and karthikeyan 2008 the detailed information of hao synthesis was provided in text s1 three g of hao was mixed with ha in 1 0 l of 0 01 m nacl and the solution was magnetically stirred at 200 rpm for 24 h the solution ph was adjusted to 7 0 by 10 mm hcl and or naoh solution then the suspension was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatant was filtrated through 0 22 μm syringe filter for toc analysis the obtained pellet was resuspended in 0 01 m nacl solution to remove excessive ha and the washing procedure was repeated for at least 5 times finally the synthesized ha hao complex was freeze dried ground and stored at 4 c in the dark before use the carbon content f oc of ha hao complex was calculated based on the difference between the initial and remaining toc values in supernatant after subsequent washing steps according to the adsorption desorption kinetics of ha onto hao described in fig s1 the final organic carbon fractions f oc were determined as 0 31 and 1 28 for the two ha hao samples the amount of ha adsorbed onto hao was also directly analyzed by the toc analyzer using solid phase mode vario toc elementar germany the measured carbon contents in the two samples were 0 30 0 03 and 1 25 0 05 respectively which were in good agreement with the calculated values by measuring the initial and remaining tocs 2 3 batch photochemical experiments the phototransformation experiments were conducted in an xpa 7 photochemical reactor nanjing xujiang electromechanical plant china and the light irradiation was provided by a 500 w xenon lamp equipped with cut off filters λ 420 nm the ancillary facility was similar to that described in our previous study wang et al 2020 the reactions were conducted in quartz tubes containing 1 0 μm cp and either 3 1 mgc l ha 1 g l ha hao f oc 0 31 or 12 8 mgc l ha 1 g l ha hao f oc 1 28 at ph 7 0 10 mm phosphate buffer and the total volume was 40 ml it was noted that 1 g l ha hao with f oc 0 31 and 1 28 contained 3 1 mgc l and 12 8 mgc l ha respectively thus the phototransformation experiments with the equivalent amounts of ha were also conducted for comparison during irradiation the reaction solutions were kept stirring to avoid sedimentation of the particles at each predetermined time interval 0 5 ml reaction solution was sampled and immediately mixed with 0 5 ml methanol in a brown vial then centrifuged and the supernatant was collected to determine the remaining concentration of cp using a hitachi 2100 high performance liquid chromatograph hplc equipped with a fluorescence detector the recovery of remained cp was 95 in the presence of hao and ha hao based on preliminary experiment meanwhile the batch adsorption experiments of cp to hao or ha hao complexes were carried out under the same conditions without irradiation details shown in text s2 all experiments were conducted in triplicates 2 4 probe experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance analysis to determine the reactive species involved in the reactions the probe experiments were also performed the tert butyl alcohol tba and superoxide dismutase sod were used to probe the effect of hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide o2 on cp photodegradation respectively fujii and otani 2017 yin et al 2016 in addition d2o was applied as the solvent instead of h2o to explore the role of 1o2 in the degradation of cp lian et al 2021 to investigate the role of 3dom oxygen purging to increase dissolved oxygen do was conducted in ha and ha hao system in situ irradiation time resolved electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometry bruker e500 9 5 12 germany was selected to identify the production of o2 in ha hao or ha hao system using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as the spin trapping agent under visible light irradiation due to the facile disproportionation in water the formation of o2 radical was examined in dimethylsulfoxide dmso solution li et al 2015 ha hao or ha hao was prepared in 0 05 ml solution with 100 mm dmpo and 10 mg l dmso epr signals of dmpoo2 adduct were detected under 25 min light irradiation the setting of epr spectrometer was as follows scanning frequency 9 7 ghz central field 3480 g sweep width 200 g microwave power 20 mw scanning temperature 298 k 2 5 product analysis of cp by lc ms ms before ms analysis samples were purified and concentrated with cnwbond lcc18 spe cartridges 2 ca0955 0001 1 g 6 ml through the solid phase extraction spe method text s3 the reaction products of cp were identified using a liquid chromatograph time of flight mass spectrometer x500r qtof ab sciex usa equipped with an electrospray ion esi source under a negative ion mode the detailed ms instrumental parameters were shown in text s4 2 6 ftir spectroscopic analysis to investigate the interaction between cp and ha hao ir spectra of cp were obtained using a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyzer ftir bruker tensor 27 germany equipped with an attenuated total reflection atr znse crystal cell to prepare the samples 40 mg hao or ha hao particles were added into 100 μm cp solution with continuous stirring for 72 h in the dark after centrifugation the precipitate was collected and resuspended in 10 ml water then the suspension was immediately centrifuged to obtain cp adsorbed particles which were spread on the surface of atr cell to form a thin layer of concentrated paste the ftir spectra were acquired at a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 with a total of 64 scans the pastes of hao and ha hao without cp were also prepared and their ftir spectra were collected as the controls the subtracted spectra were obtained by subtracting of the controls from the cp treated samples in addition reference spectrum of cp in solution was also acquired under the same condition 2 7 quantum chemical calculations the dft based calculations were performed using gaussian 09 software package at b3lyp 6 311g level wang et al 2018b wang et al 2018c the geometry optimization and vibrational frequency calculations of free cp molecule and cp al mononuclear monodentate complex were conducted to evaluate the possible interaction of cp with ha or ha hao according to the frontier orbital theory the highest occupied molecular orbitals homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals lumo on heavy atoms in cp and cp al complex were calculated and the frontier electron density fed values of fed2 homo fed2 lumo and 2fed2 homo were obtained from gaussian output files to assess the most reactive sites in cp molecule previous studies suggest that an electron is usually extracted at atoms with larger 2fed2 homo ohko et al 2002 and radical reactions are prone to occur at positions with higher values of fed2 homo fed2 lumo lee et al 2001 in addition the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital e homo of free cp and adsorbed cp were also calculated which were often associated with the electron donating ability of the molecule chen et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced phototransformation of cp on ha hao complex surfaces fig 1 shows the photochemical transformation of cp at initial concentration of 1 0 μm in the presence of ha hao or ha hao at ph 7 0 no significant degradation of cp was observed in the control or hao only system after 96 h irradiation indicating that hao was unreactive for the photodegradation of cp however about 36 4 2 2 and 54 1 2 7 of cp were photo removed in the presence of 3 1 and 12 8 mgc l ha after 96 h visible light irradiation respectively the photodegradation followed the apparent pseudo first order kinetics model fig s2 based on the previous studies about the photodegradation of various contaminants in the presence of ha the generation of ros such as oh 1o2 and o2 was the possible clue for the degradation reaction ge et al 2010 li et al 2016 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2019 interestingly the addition of 1 g l ha hao f oc 0 31 or ha hao f oc 1 28 could increase cp degradation to 92 0 2 3 or 99 6 1 4 after 96 h respectively fig 1a consider the levels of total suspended solids 12 372 mg l in natural water or wastewater rossi et al 2005 the degradation kinetics of cp at environmental relevant concentrations were also examined in the presence of ha hao complexes as shown in fig 1b the pseudo first order rate constants k obs h 1 increased with the increment of ha hao concentrations from 20 to 1000 mg l additionally the k obs values in ha hao systems were significantly enhanced by about 5 fold compared to ha systems therefore it is of significant to investigate the effects of ha hao on the photodegradation of organic micropollutants in natural water or wastewater the results suggested that ha hao was photoreactive to degrade adsorbed species appiani and mcneill 2015 and surface effects of ha hao complex might contribute to the enhanced cp phototransformation the previous study of tian et al 2015 was consistent with this conclusion in which adsorbed nitro aromatic compounds on mineral surfaces could be greatly photodegraded because adsorption could concentrate both pollutants and reactive species on mineral surfaces and increase their contact possibility thus the adsorption process of cp to ha hao was important in cp phototransformation which was further explored in the later section fig s3 shows the adsorptions of cp to hao and two different ha hao complexes in dark suggesting that the adsorption of cp to hao or ha hao particles can arrive equilibrium within 2 h and the maximum adsorption can be 0 15 0 23 or 0 39 μmol g to hao ha hao 0 31 or ha hao 1 28 respectively indicating 15 2 22 5 or 38 8 of total added cp are adsorbed to the corresponding particles furthermore the presence of ha increased the adsorption of cp to ha hao 0 31 and ha hao 1 28 by 1 48 and 2 55 fold as compared to hao alone respectively these results suggested the both mineral and organic phases of the particles adsorbed cp 3 2 identification of reactive species in ha and ha hao systems to clarify the role of reactive species on the enhanced degradation reactions quenching experiments with different scavengers tba sod d2o o2 and n2 were conducted in ha and ha hao systems no inhibition was found with the addition of excessive tba 10 mm as an oh scavenger in both ha and ha hao systems fig 2 a which indicated that oh was not responsible for the degradation of cp in either ha or ha hao systems it is noted that adding sod completely inhibited cp removal in ha or ha hao system which might be explained that sod could rapidly quench o2 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 burns et al 2012 buxton et al 1988 it indicated that o2 formed from ha under light irradiation played a dominant role in the removal of cp which was in agreement with many prior reports that the formation of o2 was positively correlated to the hydrophilic phenolic moieties in diverse ha fractions and would initiate the oxidation of various pollutants ma et al 2020 yin et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 in addition a solution containing cp and ha or ha hao was prepared in d2o instead of h2o to explore the role of 1o2 on cp removal since 1o2 has a longer lifetime in d2o solutions than in h2o solutions lian et al 2021 merkel and kearns 1972 if 1o2 attended the reactions the removal of cp would have been increased however the reaction constants k obs of cp transformation in d2o 0 0154 h 1 with ha and 0 0952 h 1 with ha hao were not significantly different from those in h2o these results indicated that 1o2 was not contributed to the cp photodegradation as ground state o2 is a well known quencher of triplet excited states of dom 3dom with high rate constant k 3 dom o2 2 109 m 1 s 1 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 we also monitored cp photodegradation in two systems with o2 purging do 21 5 mg l or n2 saturated do 0 30 mg l to investigate the role of 3dom fig 2a shows that the degradation rate constant of cp upon sparging with o2 was approximately 2 13 fold with ha and 1 41 fold with ha hao higher than the corresponding control group and the n2 sparging deoxygenation could significantly decrease the removal rate of cp it demonstrated that high concentration of do could quench 3dom and enhance the formation of o2 sulzberger et al 1997 resulting higher k obs of cp thus o2 rather than 3dom was the primary reactive radical on cp photodegradation under visible light irradiation however it is inconsistent with the study of lian et al 2021 that 3dom was major radical in the photolysis of 17β estradiol in sewage effluent it could be explained that the reactivity of reactive species with aromatic pollutants was depended on the electron donating properties of substituents on aromatic ring guo et al 2017 zeng and arnold 2013 base on dft calculation e homo for 17β estradiol 0 2151 was higher than cp 0 2277 at the b3lyp 6 311g level suggesting 17β estradiol had better electron donating ability to donate an electron to reactive species to further verify the o2 production in situ epr spectroscopic technique was utilized to monitor the photo induced radicals in the ha and ha hao systems no radical signals were observed in hao control systems fig 2b while the characteristic peaks of dmpoo2 spin adduct a n 14 g a h 8 g were obviously detected in 12 8 mgc l ha solution indicating the generation of o2 from ha under visible light irradiation more interestingly the intensities of the dmpoo2 peaks were enhanced by up to 89 4 in the presence of ha hao compared to ha after 25 min irradiation which was consistent with previous results appiani and mcneill 2015 that the production of ros from particulate organic matter pom was higher than that from dom only there are three possible explanations for a higher production of ros from ha hao compared to ha 1 higher light screening in the ha hao suspension 2 a geometrical effect due to o2 heterogeneous distribution and 3 a lower decay rate of o2 by ha hao compared to ha appiani and mcneill 2015 investigated the production of 1o2 precursor of o2 from pom and dom including the steady state concentrations of 1o2 adsorbed on the pom 1o2 pom and freely dissolved 1o2 in the aqueous phase 1o2 aq they found that 1o2 pom was 30 higher than 1o2 aq in the pom system suggesting more ros was initially produced in the solid phase and less 1o2 diffused from pom to aqueous phase which could be interpreted via the reaction diffusion model thus it supports the hypothesis that higher o2 production from ha hao may be the critical factor for the enhanced degradation of cp 3 3 evolution of phototransformation products of cp the total ion chromatograms of cp samples collected at different reaction time in the presence of ha and ha hao were shown in fig 3 the lc tof ms extracted ion chromatograms eic and the isotope cluster patterns of the proposed reaction intermediates were also displayed in fig s4 in the ha system the parent compound cp m z 217 and five newly generated peaks were observed fig 3a the appearance of two peaks with the same m z of 233 217 17 1 indicated the formation of two monohydroxylated isomers p1a and p1b during cp transformation the other three peaks clustered between 18 0 and 20 0 min had m z 399 p2 and 433 p3a p3b which corresponded to the formation of three types of cp dimers among them p2 m z 399 might be generated from cp coupling via the c o c bond with elimination of one chlorine atom 217 217 35 while two isomers p3a p3b m z 433 might be formed from direct radical coupling via c c or c o c bond 217 217 1 moreover the peak areas of p2 and p3 were obviously higher than that of p1 after 96 h irradiation which suggested that cp dimers were the primary products in ha system these products were consistent with our previous studies on the phototransformation of cp wang et al 2018b wang et al 2020 for comparison four distinct products with m h m z 215 229 233 and 213 were observed in the ha hao system fig 3b before the elution of parent compound cp retention time 15 5 min suggesting more polar products formed in the presence of ha hao notably different degradation products were found among ha and ha hao systems which indicated that cp underwent more selective photochemical reactions with ha hao particles due to the adsorption effect the evolution of these identified products was also monitored by the peak areas from their extracted ion chromatograms fig s5 the total peak areas of p1 p2 and p3 gradually increased during the reaction in the presence of ha fig s5a c but p4 p5 and p6 were almost absent as shown in fig s5d f however the total peak areas of p1 and p4 in the ha hao system increased within the initial reaction period and reached the maximum at 72 h then decreased rapidly in the next 24 h fig s5a and d meanwhile p5 and p6 increased slowly during the whole irradiation period fig s5e and f therefore the formation of significantly different products with different formation rates occurred in the ha hao system compared to the ha alone system these results might be attributed to the interfacial and constrained surface reactions for adsorbed cp to ha hao and the underlying mechanisms that are further discussed in the following section 3 4 proposed transformation mechanisms of cp in ha and ha hao systems atr ftir spectroscopy was applied to investigate the interactions between cp and hao or ha hao complex the ir spectra fig 4 a of cp at different ph 4 2 6 5 7 5 9 5 and 11 2 were collected and the peaks at 1494 1418 cm 1 c c ring stretching vibration 1268 cm 1 co stretching vibration 1164 cm 1 oh deformation bending 1111 cm 1 in plane ch bending vibration and 1075 cm 1 ccl vibration were identified kung and mcbride 1991 peng et al 2018 these spectral peaks did not change at ph 4 2 9 5 but a significant reduction of their intensities was observed at ph 11 2 which could be explained by the deprotonation of cp at ph 9 96 pk a 9 96 for cp zhang and huang 2003 thus cp is present in molecular form when solution ph is near neutral atr ftir spectra fig 4b of adsorbed cp on hao and ha hao at ph 7 0 show the peak corresponding to the stretching vibration of co group at 1268 cm 1 slightly shifted to a higher wavenumber 1274 cm 1 as compared to free cp because of the adsorption of cp to both hao and ha hao at ph 7 in addition the bending band of oh deformation at 1164 cm 1 blue shifted to 1171 cm 1 in the presence of hao and ha hao this minor band shift suggested that adsorbed cp to hao and ha hao surfaces could form weak hydrogen bonding with the surface hydroxyl on aluminum hydroxide due to outer sphere complexation it was consistent with the prior studies that the chlorophenols were physically adsorbed on gibbsite with surface hydroxyl groups doubly coordinated to al kung and mcbride 1991 atr ftir spectra of cp and cp ha complexes were also obtained at ph 7 0 to elucidate the role of ha on cp adsorption fig s6 although no apparent difference was observed between ftir spectra of cp and cp ha complexes a hydrophobic partitioning mechanism of cp and dom maom was proposed based on previous studies benoit et al 1996 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 wang and xing 2005 at the same time the adsorption experiments suggested that the presence of ha indeed enhanced the adsorption of cp on ha hao compared to hao fig s3 overall we could conclude that the increased adsorption of cp on ha hao was mainly attributed to the hydrogen bonding with surface hydroxyl groups on aluminum hydroxide and the hydrophobic interaction with the coating ha in mineral humic complexes to gain more insights into the mechanisms leading to the different reaction pathways of cp in ha or ha hao system quantum chemical calculations were also performed using gaussian 09 program because cp was primarily adsorbed onto the surface of hao by hydrogen bonding outer sphere complex geometry of cp on hao surface was modeled as a monodentate mononuclear configuration at the dft continuum solvent level based on the results from ftir spectra fig 4 fig 5 shows the computed morphology and isosurfaces for the homo and lumo molecular orbitals of free cp and adsorbed cp respectively in the case of the free cp molecule homo orbital was mostly located at the benzene ring and phenolic moieties while lumo orbital was dispersedly located in the benzyl group of cp molecule fig 5a and b the corresponding 2fed2 homo and fed2 homo fed2 lumo values of each atom were also calculated and shown in fig s7 fig s7a shows that cp phenolic radical could be formed after losing one electron from o 15 of the phenolic group due to the highest 2fed2 homo value 0 241 ohko et al 2002 wang et al 2018b and the radicals could further couple with each other to produce dimerization products in agreement with the oligomerization of cp in ha system for the case of adsorbed cp both the homo and lumo orbitals were distributed in the phenolic groups which were distinctly different from those of free cp fig 5c and d it was obvious that the 2fed2 homo value of cp at o 15 was reduced from 0 241 to 0 228 in the presence of hao as compared to free cp fig s7a and c similarly the e homo values representing the electron donating ability of selected phenols to form phenolic radicals were 0 2277 and 0 2149 for free cp and adsorbed cp respectively the results indicated that free cp with higher e homo values was more prone to lose one electron than the adsorbed cp to form a radical intermediate moreover the lumo spatial location was restructured from the benzyl group in free cp to the benzene ring linked to phenolic group in the adsorbed cp see fig 5d as shown in fig s7d the fed2 homo fed2 lumo values at c 11 0 320 and c 12 0 307 positions were significantly higher than those of free cp as radical attack reactions were facile to occur at the sites with higher fed2 homo fed2 lumo values lee et al 2001 the attack at c 11 and c 12 positions seemed to be more likely for the adsorbed cp which was also confirmed by the detection of hydroxylated products i e p1a and p1b there should be two distinct reaction pathways in ha and ha hao systems based on the above identified degradation products atr ftir analysis and dft calculation involving oligomerization and hydroxylation respectively fig 6 in the ha system free cp initially undergoes o2 mediated single electron transfer reaction under light irradiation and cp is converted into three types of free phenoxyl radicals which can couple with each other at different positions to form different dimers i e p2 and p3 more specifically p2 is produced following a chlorine elimination coupling pattern and p3a and p3b are formed from radical coupling reactions by forming cc or co c bonds similar reaction pathway was proposed in our previous study on the oligomerization of cp mediated by mn iii l complex wang et al 2018b by contrast hydroxylated intermediates p1 p4 p5 and p6 are the main products in ha hao system and a different degradation mechanism of cp was proposed initially cp is efficiently adsorbed to ha hao via hydrogen bond interaction through surface hydroxyl groups of alumina octahedral plane and phenolic hydroxyl group of cp phototransformation of adsorbed cp primarily involves hydroxylation by ros fig 6 which is generated in situ from ha in the ha hao composite rather than oligomerization process for detailed transformation pathway two isomers p1a and p1b are firstly generated from cp by adding a hydroxyl group at ortho or meta position on the chlorine containing aromatic ring then these two isomers are easily transformed into p4a and p4b via hydroxyl substitution on the chlorine position fig 6 subsequently p4a and p4b are further oxidized to the corresponding p benzoquinone type products p5a and p5b via two electron transfer then forming p6 by further hydroxylation therefore the predominant transformation of cp in ha hao system is through hydroxylation by o2 to form more polar hydroxylated products fig 6 the toxicity of intermediate products from the environmental photochemistry of contaminants are drawing more and more attention vione and carena 2020 the photochemical products of cp produced in ha system were more toxic than those in ha hao system based on ecosar estimation details in text s5 and fig s8 hence it is expected that the presence of mineral humic complexes may increase photodegradation of organic pollutants and further reduce their toxicity it implied that mechanical disturbance such as resuspension of the sediment and mixing in natural water or wastewater treatment might be a simple and effective way to reduce toxicity of wastewater the ha hao particles play important roles in cp photochemical reactions via promoting the adsorbed amount of cp changing the reactive sites in cp structure and inducing high concentrations of ros from adsorbed ha under light irradiation in this constrained surface environment the reactivity of phenolic hydroxyl group of cp is suppressed due to the formation of hydrogen bond with surface hydroxyl group of alumina octahedral plane which inhibits the generation of phenolic radicals and subsequent oligomerization whereas the other reactive sites such as ortho and meta position in the adsorbed cp molecule become more susceptible attacked involving successive hydroxylation process which is confirmed by dft calculations these conclusion were also supported by the proposed products that more hydroxylated products were produced in ha hao system rather than dimerization products in aqueous ha solution thus the surface induced reactions of cp could contribute to the enhanced removal and the selective transformation on ha hao complexes for comparison positive charged fe oxides such as goethite could also adsorb comparable amounts of dom and negative charged mn oxides and clays exhibited low overall retention of dom chorover and amistadi 2001 which would also contribute to the photochemical reactions of organic compounds in natural waters it should also be emphasized that abiotic transformation reactions must be considered and much more complex in the system containing solid phases of dom fe iii mn iv particulates therefore our findings indicate that maom important components of environmental particles could alter the phototransformation behavior of organic pollutants in the natural environment 4 conclusion dom is ubiquitous in the environment and readily adsorbed to the surfaces of particulates or soil minerals to form maom sander et al 2004 subdiaga et al 2019 resulting in a major fraction of dom existing on the surface of solid phase rather than free in solution it is well known that the presence of dom can induce ros under light irradiation which can degrade organic contaminants in natural water gerecke et al 2001 wenk et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 however the role of maom on the phototransformation of organic compounds was overlooked or mistaken as same as free dom our results indicate that the presence of maom strongly promotes cp removal as compared to free dom under visible light irradiation the enhanced removal of cp was attributed to the increased cp adsorption and the local produced ros with maom particles in the constrained environment the results of this study indicate that particle surfaces play significant impacts on the phototransformation of particle bound organic pollutants such as phenolic compounds in natural environments furthermore it is widely recognized that phenolic chemicals can be effectively transformed and detoxified via one electron transfer coupling reaction in naturally occurring oxidative process qin et al 2015 wang et al 2018b however the presence of particles may interact with these phenolics at environmentally relevant concentrations via complexation or hydrogen bonding between phenolic group and the particle surface kung and mcbride 1991 it is implied that these phenolic contaminants can undergo a different pathway on the surface of these particles as demonstrated in this study cp tends to be hydroxylated and further mineralized on the surface of mineral humic complexes by in situ generated ros under visible light irradiation on the contrary the oxidative oligomerization of free cp is preferred to occur in the presence of ha without mineral particles via the formation of phenoxyl radical and subsequent coupling reactions this study provides new insights into the phototransformation of phenolic compounds on the surface of mineral humic particles therefore the importance of environmental particles on the transformation of organic compounds should not be ignored to fully evaluate their

17183,mineral humic complexes known as mineral associated organic matter maom are ubiquitous in natural waters however the interaction between organic pollutants and maom remains elusive which may affect their degradation process in this study photochemical transformation of chlorophene cp in the presence of maom prepared by coating aluminum hydroxide with humic acid ha hao was investigated our results showed that the degradation of cp was significantly enhanced in the presence of ha hao and the degradation rate constant was 5 times as that with ha only it was because the adsorption of cp to ha hao particles was greatly enhanced and concentration of reactive oxygen species ros was increased on ha hao surfaces which further promoted the reactions between cp and ros the quenching experiments combined with epr technology confirmed that superoxide anion o2 was the primary reactive radical on cp photodegradation more importantly the degradation of cp with ha hao followed a hydroxylation process rather than the oligomerization reaction with ha only spectroscopic analysis provided direct evidence for the formation of hydrogen bonding between cp phenolic hydroxyl group and surface oxygen of hao which would suppress the reactivity of phenolic hydroxyl group consequently the ortho and meta positions of cp became more facile for the hydroxylation reaction this study shows the importance of maom in altering the photochemical behavior and transformation pathway of organic contaminants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mineral associated organic matter selective reaction superoxide anions photodegradation hydroxylation process oligomerization 1 introduction chlorophene o benzyl p chlorophenol cp is widely used as a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent for general cleaning and disinfection in household and farming activities arlos et al 2015 forrez et al 2011 holzem et al 2014 as a result cp has been frequently detected in different environmental matrices bolobajev and goi 2017 the concentrations of cp can be as high as 0 12 μm in wastewater treatment plant influent and up to 0 60 μm in activated sludge sewage systems holzem et al 2014 rayaroth et al 2015 furthermore previous studies demonstrated that cp posed significant environmental risks for example cp was found to induce potential carcinogenic and mutagenic activities in aquatic and soil organisms shi et al 2016 recently it was reported that cp displayed antiandrogenic effect when detected in fish bile which was the most potent antiandrogen with a potency relative to flutamide standard equivalent of 13 rostkowski et al 2011 in addition cp is always associated with suspended particles and sediments after released into the environments due to its relatively hydrophobic property log k ow 3 60 arlos et al 2015 zhang and huang 2003 therefore it is of particular interest to study the transformation processes of cp in the environment for accurate risk assessment yin et al 2010 dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitously distributed in natural waters and sediments which is one of the most relevant photosensitizers to produce reactive oxygen species ros and other reactive intermediates e g excited triplet state of dom 3dom hassett 2006 latch and mcneill 2006 zhou et al 2019 many previous studies have indicated that these reactive species from dom produced after solar irradiation play important roles in the aquatic photodegradation of organic micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides gerecke et al 2001 wenk et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 however dom is readily adsorbed to the surfaces of particle matters or soil minerals from aqueous solution to form mineral associated organic matter maom sander et al 2004 subdiaga et al 2019 via diverse mechanisms including ligand exchange cation bridge van der waals interaction and electrostatic attraction armanious et al 2014 gu et al 1994 thus the major fraction of dom in sediments and aquifers is always presenting on the surface of solid phase rather than in solution subdiaga et al 2019 similar to dom it was reported that particulate organic matter was photochemically active to produce ros under uv or sunlight irradiation such as singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide anions o2 and excited state transients appiani and mcneill 2015 cottrell et al 2013 estapa and mayer 2010 miller and zepp 1979 in addition to their distribution in natural waters and soils dom and maom are among the dominant constituents in wastewater effluent systems lian et al 2020 and their interactions with organic contaminants under simulated solar irradiation are of significant environmental relevance therefore it is expected that maom can also participate in the photodegradation of pollutants but the important distinction was that maom induced degradation would be limited to the adsorbed species compared to dom however the degradation mechanisms of organic pollutants in the presence of maom have not been fully elucidated adlayers of dom on the surface of mineral particles in natural systems can strongly influence the transport transformation and bioavailability of many organic contaminants in soil and water environments via adsorption process cheng et al 2019 jiang et al 2014 yang et al 2020 yu et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 both soil minerals and dom phases may have significant impacts on the fate of organic and inorganic contaminants gu and karthikeyan 2005a b gu et al 2007 zhao et al 2011 for example the adsorption of tetracycline and ciprofloxacin on poorly crystalline or amorphous al and fe oxide minerals was quite rapid via the formation of strong inner sphere complexes between nitrogen or oxygen containing functional groups amide hydroxyl keto and carbonyl groups and surface al and fe gu and karthikeyan 2005a b the presence of maom may also influence the adsorption behavior of pollutants by altering the surface charges and potential adsorption sites of particles chorover et al 1999 wang and xing 2005 in addition the study by wang and xing 2005 indicated that phenanthrene adsorption to maom was significantly enhanced compared to bare mineral phase due to the hydrophobic interactions between phenanthrene and the bound humic substance and their research also suggested that partitioning was the dominant process for hydrophobic contaminants however the information about how the adsorption of organic pollutants may alter their transformation is still missing although plenty of researches have focused on the interactions between organic contaminants and maom murphy et al 1994 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2011 considering the photochemical reactivity of maom interfacial radical formation and further chemical reactions with the adsorbed organic pollutants are plausible therefore it is expected that the interaction between organic pollutants and maom may alter the environmental transformation behavior of adsorbed organics studies have shown that hydrous oxides of al fe and mn are important mineral components of soil particles which can account for up to 50 of the total soil mass gu and karthikeyan 2005b zhang and huang 2003 they are particularly effective in adsorbing and stabilizing organic matter in soils due to their large specific surface areas and high density of surface functional groups chorover and amistadi 2001 it s worth noting that direct chemical transformation reactions for organics are significant in the presence of fe and mn hydr oxides with redox active surfaces which may conceal the photochemical effect of organic matter on the mineral surface so the redox inert aluminum hydroxide hao was chosen as the model mineral which are generally present in wastewater following aluminum coagulation treatment chorghe et al 2017 rosenblum et al 2016 in the present study maom was prepared by coating aluminum hydroxide with humic acid ha hao herein the objective of this study was to compare the photochemical transformation of cp in the presence of maom and free dom under visible light irradiation experiments were conducted to investigate the reaction kinetics of cp at environmentally relevant concentrations and transformed products the reaction mechanisms for these reaction processes were explored with quenching experiments to determine reactive species attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir analysis and density functional theory dft computations on the basis of these experimental results the maom mediated reaction schemes of cp were proposed and compared to those with ha only under the identical irradiation condition it is expected that the findings obtained in this study can contribute to better understanding of different photochemical behaviors and transformation pathways of phenolic pollutants in the presence of ha or maom 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals cp 97 0 purity was purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa and used as received the sample of ha 99 purity was obtained from aladdin shanghai china alcl3 nacl and naoh reagent acs grade and trace metal grade hcl were from fisher scientific fair lawn nj usa benzoquinone bq and tert butanol tba were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa and used as received superoxide dismutase sod was obtained from sigma aldrich s 2515 hplc grade methanol was from merck co ltd germany radical trapping agent 5 5 dimethylpyrroline n oxide dmpo was purchased from dojindo japan fresh stock solutions were prepared for each batch of experiments 2 2 preparation of aluminum hydroxide humic acid complexes the mineral humic complex was prepared by a slightly modified method of chorover et al 1999 briefly ha stock solution was prepared by dissolving 200 mg ha into 1000 ml water then filtered 0 22 μm and stored in the dark two different ha solutions with the initial total organic carbon toc concentrations of 10 and 40 mgc l were reacted with freshly prepared hao to achieve significantly different humic surface coverages on hao gu and karthikeyan 2008 the detailed information of hao synthesis was provided in text s1 three g of hao was mixed with ha in 1 0 l of 0 01 m nacl and the solution was magnetically stirred at 200 rpm for 24 h the solution ph was adjusted to 7 0 by 10 mm hcl and or naoh solution then the suspension was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatant was filtrated through 0 22 μm syringe filter for toc analysis the obtained pellet was resuspended in 0 01 m nacl solution to remove excessive ha and the washing procedure was repeated for at least 5 times finally the synthesized ha hao complex was freeze dried ground and stored at 4 c in the dark before use the carbon content f oc of ha hao complex was calculated based on the difference between the initial and remaining toc values in supernatant after subsequent washing steps according to the adsorption desorption kinetics of ha onto hao described in fig s1 the final organic carbon fractions f oc were determined as 0 31 and 1 28 for the two ha hao samples the amount of ha adsorbed onto hao was also directly analyzed by the toc analyzer using solid phase mode vario toc elementar germany the measured carbon contents in the two samples were 0 30 0 03 and 1 25 0 05 respectively which were in good agreement with the calculated values by measuring the initial and remaining tocs 2 3 batch photochemical experiments the phototransformation experiments were conducted in an xpa 7 photochemical reactor nanjing xujiang electromechanical plant china and the light irradiation was provided by a 500 w xenon lamp equipped with cut off filters λ 420 nm the ancillary facility was similar to that described in our previous study wang et al 2020 the reactions were conducted in quartz tubes containing 1 0 μm cp and either 3 1 mgc l ha 1 g l ha hao f oc 0 31 or 12 8 mgc l ha 1 g l ha hao f oc 1 28 at ph 7 0 10 mm phosphate buffer and the total volume was 40 ml it was noted that 1 g l ha hao with f oc 0 31 and 1 28 contained 3 1 mgc l and 12 8 mgc l ha respectively thus the phototransformation experiments with the equivalent amounts of ha were also conducted for comparison during irradiation the reaction solutions were kept stirring to avoid sedimentation of the particles at each predetermined time interval 0 5 ml reaction solution was sampled and immediately mixed with 0 5 ml methanol in a brown vial then centrifuged and the supernatant was collected to determine the remaining concentration of cp using a hitachi 2100 high performance liquid chromatograph hplc equipped with a fluorescence detector the recovery of remained cp was 95 in the presence of hao and ha hao based on preliminary experiment meanwhile the batch adsorption experiments of cp to hao or ha hao complexes were carried out under the same conditions without irradiation details shown in text s2 all experiments were conducted in triplicates 2 4 probe experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance analysis to determine the reactive species involved in the reactions the probe experiments were also performed the tert butyl alcohol tba and superoxide dismutase sod were used to probe the effect of hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide o2 on cp photodegradation respectively fujii and otani 2017 yin et al 2016 in addition d2o was applied as the solvent instead of h2o to explore the role of 1o2 in the degradation of cp lian et al 2021 to investigate the role of 3dom oxygen purging to increase dissolved oxygen do was conducted in ha and ha hao system in situ irradiation time resolved electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometry bruker e500 9 5 12 germany was selected to identify the production of o2 in ha hao or ha hao system using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as the spin trapping agent under visible light irradiation due to the facile disproportionation in water the formation of o2 radical was examined in dimethylsulfoxide dmso solution li et al 2015 ha hao or ha hao was prepared in 0 05 ml solution with 100 mm dmpo and 10 mg l dmso epr signals of dmpoo2 adduct were detected under 25 min light irradiation the setting of epr spectrometer was as follows scanning frequency 9 7 ghz central field 3480 g sweep width 200 g microwave power 20 mw scanning temperature 298 k 2 5 product analysis of cp by lc ms ms before ms analysis samples were purified and concentrated with cnwbond lcc18 spe cartridges 2 ca0955 0001 1 g 6 ml through the solid phase extraction spe method text s3 the reaction products of cp were identified using a liquid chromatograph time of flight mass spectrometer x500r qtof ab sciex usa equipped with an electrospray ion esi source under a negative ion mode the detailed ms instrumental parameters were shown in text s4 2 6 ftir spectroscopic analysis to investigate the interaction between cp and ha hao ir spectra of cp were obtained using a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyzer ftir bruker tensor 27 germany equipped with an attenuated total reflection atr znse crystal cell to prepare the samples 40 mg hao or ha hao particles were added into 100 μm cp solution with continuous stirring for 72 h in the dark after centrifugation the precipitate was collected and resuspended in 10 ml water then the suspension was immediately centrifuged to obtain cp adsorbed particles which were spread on the surface of atr cell to form a thin layer of concentrated paste the ftir spectra were acquired at a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 with a total of 64 scans the pastes of hao and ha hao without cp were also prepared and their ftir spectra were collected as the controls the subtracted spectra were obtained by subtracting of the controls from the cp treated samples in addition reference spectrum of cp in solution was also acquired under the same condition 2 7 quantum chemical calculations the dft based calculations were performed using gaussian 09 software package at b3lyp 6 311g level wang et al 2018b wang et al 2018c the geometry optimization and vibrational frequency calculations of free cp molecule and cp al mononuclear monodentate complex were conducted to evaluate the possible interaction of cp with ha or ha hao according to the frontier orbital theory the highest occupied molecular orbitals homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals lumo on heavy atoms in cp and cp al complex were calculated and the frontier electron density fed values of fed2 homo fed2 lumo and 2fed2 homo were obtained from gaussian output files to assess the most reactive sites in cp molecule previous studies suggest that an electron is usually extracted at atoms with larger 2fed2 homo ohko et al 2002 and radical reactions are prone to occur at positions with higher values of fed2 homo fed2 lumo lee et al 2001 in addition the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital e homo of free cp and adsorbed cp were also calculated which were often associated with the electron donating ability of the molecule chen et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced phototransformation of cp on ha hao complex surfaces fig 1 shows the photochemical transformation of cp at initial concentration of 1 0 μm in the presence of ha hao or ha hao at ph 7 0 no significant degradation of cp was observed in the control or hao only system after 96 h irradiation indicating that hao was unreactive for the photodegradation of cp however about 36 4 2 2 and 54 1 2 7 of cp were photo removed in the presence of 3 1 and 12 8 mgc l ha after 96 h visible light irradiation respectively the photodegradation followed the apparent pseudo first order kinetics model fig s2 based on the previous studies about the photodegradation of various contaminants in the presence of ha the generation of ros such as oh 1o2 and o2 was the possible clue for the degradation reaction ge et al 2010 li et al 2016 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2019 interestingly the addition of 1 g l ha hao f oc 0 31 or ha hao f oc 1 28 could increase cp degradation to 92 0 2 3 or 99 6 1 4 after 96 h respectively fig 1a consider the levels of total suspended solids 12 372 mg l in natural water or wastewater rossi et al 2005 the degradation kinetics of cp at environmental relevant concentrations were also examined in the presence of ha hao complexes as shown in fig 1b the pseudo first order rate constants k obs h 1 increased with the increment of ha hao concentrations from 20 to 1000 mg l additionally the k obs values in ha hao systems were significantly enhanced by about 5 fold compared to ha systems therefore it is of significant to investigate the effects of ha hao on the photodegradation of organic micropollutants in natural water or wastewater the results suggested that ha hao was photoreactive to degrade adsorbed species appiani and mcneill 2015 and surface effects of ha hao complex might contribute to the enhanced cp phototransformation the previous study of tian et al 2015 was consistent with this conclusion in which adsorbed nitro aromatic compounds on mineral surfaces could be greatly photodegraded because adsorption could concentrate both pollutants and reactive species on mineral surfaces and increase their contact possibility thus the adsorption process of cp to ha hao was important in cp phototransformation which was further explored in the later section fig s3 shows the adsorptions of cp to hao and two different ha hao complexes in dark suggesting that the adsorption of cp to hao or ha hao particles can arrive equilibrium within 2 h and the maximum adsorption can be 0 15 0 23 or 0 39 μmol g to hao ha hao 0 31 or ha hao 1 28 respectively indicating 15 2 22 5 or 38 8 of total added cp are adsorbed to the corresponding particles furthermore the presence of ha increased the adsorption of cp to ha hao 0 31 and ha hao 1 28 by 1 48 and 2 55 fold as compared to hao alone respectively these results suggested the both mineral and organic phases of the particles adsorbed cp 3 2 identification of reactive species in ha and ha hao systems to clarify the role of reactive species on the enhanced degradation reactions quenching experiments with different scavengers tba sod d2o o2 and n2 were conducted in ha and ha hao systems no inhibition was found with the addition of excessive tba 10 mm as an oh scavenger in both ha and ha hao systems fig 2 a which indicated that oh was not responsible for the degradation of cp in either ha or ha hao systems it is noted that adding sod completely inhibited cp removal in ha or ha hao system which might be explained that sod could rapidly quench o2 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 burns et al 2012 buxton et al 1988 it indicated that o2 formed from ha under light irradiation played a dominant role in the removal of cp which was in agreement with many prior reports that the formation of o2 was positively correlated to the hydrophilic phenolic moieties in diverse ha fractions and would initiate the oxidation of various pollutants ma et al 2020 yin et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 in addition a solution containing cp and ha or ha hao was prepared in d2o instead of h2o to explore the role of 1o2 on cp removal since 1o2 has a longer lifetime in d2o solutions than in h2o solutions lian et al 2021 merkel and kearns 1972 if 1o2 attended the reactions the removal of cp would have been increased however the reaction constants k obs of cp transformation in d2o 0 0154 h 1 with ha and 0 0952 h 1 with ha hao were not significantly different from those in h2o these results indicated that 1o2 was not contributed to the cp photodegradation as ground state o2 is a well known quencher of triplet excited states of dom 3dom with high rate constant k 3 dom o2 2 109 m 1 s 1 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 we also monitored cp photodegradation in two systems with o2 purging do 21 5 mg l or n2 saturated do 0 30 mg l to investigate the role of 3dom fig 2a shows that the degradation rate constant of cp upon sparging with o2 was approximately 2 13 fold with ha and 1 41 fold with ha hao higher than the corresponding control group and the n2 sparging deoxygenation could significantly decrease the removal rate of cp it demonstrated that high concentration of do could quench 3dom and enhance the formation of o2 sulzberger et al 1997 resulting higher k obs of cp thus o2 rather than 3dom was the primary reactive radical on cp photodegradation under visible light irradiation however it is inconsistent with the study of lian et al 2021 that 3dom was major radical in the photolysis of 17β estradiol in sewage effluent it could be explained that the reactivity of reactive species with aromatic pollutants was depended on the electron donating properties of substituents on aromatic ring guo et al 2017 zeng and arnold 2013 base on dft calculation e homo for 17β estradiol 0 2151 was higher than cp 0 2277 at the b3lyp 6 311g level suggesting 17β estradiol had better electron donating ability to donate an electron to reactive species to further verify the o2 production in situ epr spectroscopic technique was utilized to monitor the photo induced radicals in the ha and ha hao systems no radical signals were observed in hao control systems fig 2b while the characteristic peaks of dmpoo2 spin adduct a n 14 g a h 8 g were obviously detected in 12 8 mgc l ha solution indicating the generation of o2 from ha under visible light irradiation more interestingly the intensities of the dmpoo2 peaks were enhanced by up to 89 4 in the presence of ha hao compared to ha after 25 min irradiation which was consistent with previous results appiani and mcneill 2015 that the production of ros from particulate organic matter pom was higher than that from dom only there are three possible explanations for a higher production of ros from ha hao compared to ha 1 higher light screening in the ha hao suspension 2 a geometrical effect due to o2 heterogeneous distribution and 3 a lower decay rate of o2 by ha hao compared to ha appiani and mcneill 2015 investigated the production of 1o2 precursor of o2 from pom and dom including the steady state concentrations of 1o2 adsorbed on the pom 1o2 pom and freely dissolved 1o2 in the aqueous phase 1o2 aq they found that 1o2 pom was 30 higher than 1o2 aq in the pom system suggesting more ros was initially produced in the solid phase and less 1o2 diffused from pom to aqueous phase which could be interpreted via the reaction diffusion model thus it supports the hypothesis that higher o2 production from ha hao may be the critical factor for the enhanced degradation of cp 3 3 evolution of phototransformation products of cp the total ion chromatograms of cp samples collected at different reaction time in the presence of ha and ha hao were shown in fig 3 the lc tof ms extracted ion chromatograms eic and the isotope cluster patterns of the proposed reaction intermediates were also displayed in fig s4 in the ha system the parent compound cp m z 217 and five newly generated peaks were observed fig 3a the appearance of two peaks with the same m z of 233 217 17 1 indicated the formation of two monohydroxylated isomers p1a and p1b during cp transformation the other three peaks clustered between 18 0 and 20 0 min had m z 399 p2 and 433 p3a p3b which corresponded to the formation of three types of cp dimers among them p2 m z 399 might be generated from cp coupling via the c o c bond with elimination of one chlorine atom 217 217 35 while two isomers p3a p3b m z 433 might be formed from direct radical coupling via c c or c o c bond 217 217 1 moreover the peak areas of p2 and p3 were obviously higher than that of p1 after 96 h irradiation which suggested that cp dimers were the primary products in ha system these products were consistent with our previous studies on the phototransformation of cp wang et al 2018b wang et al 2020 for comparison four distinct products with m h m z 215 229 233 and 213 were observed in the ha hao system fig 3b before the elution of parent compound cp retention time 15 5 min suggesting more polar products formed in the presence of ha hao notably different degradation products were found among ha and ha hao systems which indicated that cp underwent more selective photochemical reactions with ha hao particles due to the adsorption effect the evolution of these identified products was also monitored by the peak areas from their extracted ion chromatograms fig s5 the total peak areas of p1 p2 and p3 gradually increased during the reaction in the presence of ha fig s5a c but p4 p5 and p6 were almost absent as shown in fig s5d f however the total peak areas of p1 and p4 in the ha hao system increased within the initial reaction period and reached the maximum at 72 h then decreased rapidly in the next 24 h fig s5a and d meanwhile p5 and p6 increased slowly during the whole irradiation period fig s5e and f therefore the formation of significantly different products with different formation rates occurred in the ha hao system compared to the ha alone system these results might be attributed to the interfacial and constrained surface reactions for adsorbed cp to ha hao and the underlying mechanisms that are further discussed in the following section 3 4 proposed transformation mechanisms of cp in ha and ha hao systems atr ftir spectroscopy was applied to investigate the interactions between cp and hao or ha hao complex the ir spectra fig 4 a of cp at different ph 4 2 6 5 7 5 9 5 and 11 2 were collected and the peaks at 1494 1418 cm 1 c c ring stretching vibration 1268 cm 1 co stretching vibration 1164 cm 1 oh deformation bending 1111 cm 1 in plane ch bending vibration and 1075 cm 1 ccl vibration were identified kung and mcbride 1991 peng et al 2018 these spectral peaks did not change at ph 4 2 9 5 but a significant reduction of their intensities was observed at ph 11 2 which could be explained by the deprotonation of cp at ph 9 96 pk a 9 96 for cp zhang and huang 2003 thus cp is present in molecular form when solution ph is near neutral atr ftir spectra fig 4b of adsorbed cp on hao and ha hao at ph 7 0 show the peak corresponding to the stretching vibration of co group at 1268 cm 1 slightly shifted to a higher wavenumber 1274 cm 1 as compared to free cp because of the adsorption of cp to both hao and ha hao at ph 7 in addition the bending band of oh deformation at 1164 cm 1 blue shifted to 1171 cm 1 in the presence of hao and ha hao this minor band shift suggested that adsorbed cp to hao and ha hao surfaces could form weak hydrogen bonding with the surface hydroxyl on aluminum hydroxide due to outer sphere complexation it was consistent with the prior studies that the chlorophenols were physically adsorbed on gibbsite with surface hydroxyl groups doubly coordinated to al kung and mcbride 1991 atr ftir spectra of cp and cp ha complexes were also obtained at ph 7 0 to elucidate the role of ha on cp adsorption fig s6 although no apparent difference was observed between ftir spectra of cp and cp ha complexes a hydrophobic partitioning mechanism of cp and dom maom was proposed based on previous studies benoit et al 1996 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 wang and xing 2005 at the same time the adsorption experiments suggested that the presence of ha indeed enhanced the adsorption of cp on ha hao compared to hao fig s3 overall we could conclude that the increased adsorption of cp on ha hao was mainly attributed to the hydrogen bonding with surface hydroxyl groups on aluminum hydroxide and the hydrophobic interaction with the coating ha in mineral humic complexes to gain more insights into the mechanisms leading to the different reaction pathways of cp in ha or ha hao system quantum chemical calculations were also performed using gaussian 09 program because cp was primarily adsorbed onto the surface of hao by hydrogen bonding outer sphere complex geometry of cp on hao surface was modeled as a monodentate mononuclear configuration at the dft continuum solvent level based on the results from ftir spectra fig 4 fig 5 shows the computed morphology and isosurfaces for the homo and lumo molecular orbitals of free cp and adsorbed cp respectively in the case of the free cp molecule homo orbital was mostly located at the benzene ring and phenolic moieties while lumo orbital was dispersedly located in the benzyl group of cp molecule fig 5a and b the corresponding 2fed2 homo and fed2 homo fed2 lumo values of each atom were also calculated and shown in fig s7 fig s7a shows that cp phenolic radical could be formed after losing one electron from o 15 of the phenolic group due to the highest 2fed2 homo value 0 241 ohko et al 2002 wang et al 2018b and the radicals could further couple with each other to produce dimerization products in agreement with the oligomerization of cp in ha system for the case of adsorbed cp both the homo and lumo orbitals were distributed in the phenolic groups which were distinctly different from those of free cp fig 5c and d it was obvious that the 2fed2 homo value of cp at o 15 was reduced from 0 241 to 0 228 in the presence of hao as compared to free cp fig s7a and c similarly the e homo values representing the electron donating ability of selected phenols to form phenolic radicals were 0 2277 and 0 2149 for free cp and adsorbed cp respectively the results indicated that free cp with higher e homo values was more prone to lose one electron than the adsorbed cp to form a radical intermediate moreover the lumo spatial location was restructured from the benzyl group in free cp to the benzene ring linked to phenolic group in the adsorbed cp see fig 5d as shown in fig s7d the fed2 homo fed2 lumo values at c 11 0 320 and c 12 0 307 positions were significantly higher than those of free cp as radical attack reactions were facile to occur at the sites with higher fed2 homo fed2 lumo values lee et al 2001 the attack at c 11 and c 12 positions seemed to be more likely for the adsorbed cp which was also confirmed by the detection of hydroxylated products i e p1a and p1b there should be two distinct reaction pathways in ha and ha hao systems based on the above identified degradation products atr ftir analysis and dft calculation involving oligomerization and hydroxylation respectively fig 6 in the ha system free cp initially undergoes o2 mediated single electron transfer reaction under light irradiation and cp is converted into three types of free phenoxyl radicals which can couple with each other at different positions to form different dimers i e p2 and p3 more specifically p2 is produced following a chlorine elimination coupling pattern and p3a and p3b are formed from radical coupling reactions by forming cc or co c bonds similar reaction pathway was proposed in our previous study on the oligomerization of cp mediated by mn iii l complex wang et al 2018b by contrast hydroxylated intermediates p1 p4 p5 and p6 are the main products in ha hao system and a different degradation mechanism of cp was proposed initially cp is efficiently adsorbed to ha hao via hydrogen bond interaction through surface hydroxyl groups of alumina octahedral plane and phenolic hydroxyl group of cp phototransformation of adsorbed cp primarily involves hydroxylation by ros fig 6 which is generated in situ from ha in the ha hao composite rather than oligomerization process for detailed transformation pathway two isomers p1a and p1b are firstly generated from cp by adding a hydroxyl group at ortho or meta position on the chlorine containing aromatic ring then these two isomers are easily transformed into p4a and p4b via hydroxyl substitution on the chlorine position fig 6 subsequently p4a and p4b are further oxidized to the corresponding p benzoquinone type products p5a and p5b via two electron transfer then forming p6 by further hydroxylation therefore the predominant transformation of cp in ha hao system is through hydroxylation by o2 to form more polar hydroxylated products fig 6 the toxicity of intermediate products from the environmental photochemistry of contaminants are drawing more and more attention vione and carena 2020 the photochemical products of cp produced in ha system were more toxic than those in ha hao system based on ecosar estimation details in text s5 and fig s8 hence it is expected that the presence of mineral humic complexes may increase photodegradation of organic pollutants and further reduce their toxicity it implied that mechanical disturbance such as resuspension of the sediment and mixing in natural water or wastewater treatment might be a simple and effective way to reduce toxicity of wastewater the ha hao particles play important roles in cp photochemical reactions via promoting the adsorbed amount of cp changing the reactive sites in cp structure and inducing high concentrations of ros from adsorbed ha under light irradiation in this constrained surface environment the reactivity of phenolic hydroxyl group of cp is suppressed due to the formation of hydrogen bond with surface hydroxyl group of alumina octahedral plane which inhibits the generation of phenolic radicals and subsequent oligomerization whereas the other reactive sites such as ortho and meta position in the adsorbed cp molecule become more susceptible attacked involving successive hydroxylation process which is confirmed by dft calculations these conclusion were also supported by the proposed products that more hydroxylated products were produced in ha hao system rather than dimerization products in aqueous ha solution thus the surface induced reactions of cp could contribute to the enhanced removal and the selective transformation on ha hao complexes for comparison positive charged fe oxides such as goethite could also adsorb comparable amounts of dom and negative charged mn oxides and clays exhibited low overall retention of dom chorover and amistadi 2001 which would also contribute to the photochemical reactions of organic compounds in natural waters it should also be emphasized that abiotic transformation reactions must be considered and much more complex in the system containing solid phases of dom fe iii mn iv particulates therefore our findings indicate that maom important components of environmental particles could alter the phototransformation behavior of organic pollutants in the natural environment 4 conclusion dom is ubiquitous in the environment and readily adsorbed to the surfaces of particulates or soil minerals to form maom sander et al 2004 subdiaga et al 2019 resulting in a major fraction of dom existing on the surface of solid phase rather than free in solution it is well known that the presence of dom can induce ros under light irradiation which can degrade organic contaminants in natural water gerecke et al 2001 wenk et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 however the role of maom on the phototransformation of organic compounds was overlooked or mistaken as same as free dom our results indicate that the presence of maom strongly promotes cp removal as compared to free dom under visible light irradiation the enhanced removal of cp was attributed to the increased cp adsorption and the local produced ros with maom particles in the constrained environment the results of this study indicate that particle surfaces play significant impacts on the phototransformation of particle bound organic pollutants such as phenolic compounds in natural environments furthermore it is widely recognized that phenolic chemicals can be effectively transformed and detoxified via one electron transfer coupling reaction in naturally occurring oxidative process qin et al 2015 wang et al 2018b however the presence of particles may interact with these phenolics at environmentally relevant concentrations via complexation or hydrogen bonding between phenolic group and the particle surface kung and mcbride 1991 it is implied that these phenolic contaminants can undergo a different pathway on the surface of these particles as demonstrated in this study cp tends to be hydroxylated and further mineralized on the surface of mineral humic complexes by in situ generated ros under visible light irradiation on the contrary the oxidative oligomerization of free cp is preferred to occur in the presence of ha without mineral particles via the formation of phenoxyl radical and subsequent coupling reactions this study provides new insights into the phototransformation of phenolic compounds on the surface of mineral humic particles therefore the importance of environmental particles on the transformation of organic compounds should not be ignored to fully evaluate their

17184,with the ever growing water pollution issues advanced oxidation processes aops have received growing attention due to their high efficiency in the removal of refractory organic pollutants transition metal sulfides tmss with excellent optical electrical and catalytical performance are of great interest as heterogeneous catalysts these tmss based heterogeneous catalysts have been

keywords transition metal sulfides heterogeneous catalysts waste water treatment advanced oxidation processes 1 introduction in recent decades water pollution aroused by various contaminants e g pharmaceuticals personal care products endocrine disruptors pesticides organic dyes detergents heavy metals have become a critical societal issue due to its adverse effects on humanbeings and ecosystem peng et al 2019 yang et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 in order to eliminate the aquatic environmentalcontaminants numerous technologies have been developed such asmembrane separation sui et al 2018 adsorption tian et al 2018 sedimentation rebosura et al 2021 coagulation flocculation ly et al 2019 and advanced oxidation processes aops chen et al 2018 dong et al 2018a ji et al 2020a ji et al 2018 yi et al 2019 yi et al 2020 however the above available water treatment technologies such as adsorption or coagulation cannot completely destroy or eliminate target pollutants but only concentrate them into other stages likewise membrane separation adsorption and sedimentation technologies mean high operating costs and the risk of secondary pollutants to the ecosystem herney ramirez et al 2010 among these technologies aops are deemed to be the most powerful and eco friendly ones tian et al 2020a aops are based on the in situ generation of highly reactive oxygen species ros such as oh so4 1o2 o2 which consist of a majority of available technologies e g fenton plasma electron beam electrolysis ionizing radiation ultrasound irradiation and wet air oxidation showing excellent potential in the efficient decomposition and satisfactory mineralization of toxic and biorefractory pollutants from the contaminated aqueous system duan et al 2018 gerrity et al 2010 kim et al 2017 kritikos et al 2007 li et al 2019c yang et al 2018 these treatment technologies possess many attractive advantages such as easy operation outstanding efficiency minimal energy consumption simultaneous treatment of multiple contaminants economical and environmentally benign as compared to other technologies antonopoulou et al 2014 dong et al 2020 li et al 2019a li et al 2020c wang et al 2020a to date oxidative degradation reactions initiated by numerous types of transition metal compounds such as metal sulfides zhang et al 2020a ning et al 2020 oxides xin et al 2021 selenides chen et al 2020c phosphides alexopoulou et al 2019 nitrides duan et al 2020 carbides cheng et al 2017 and metal alloys have drawn considerable attention dong et al 2018b especially heterogeneous catalytic oxidation based on transition metal sulfides tmss and their derivates has been deemed as a new hotspot dalui et al 2015 ye et al 2018 ye et al 2020 tmss are one of the most earth abundant and extensivelydistributed semiconductor materials where sulfur anion combines with a metal semi metal or cations to form mxsy the stoichiometries of them are usually as ms m2s m3s4 and ms2 chandrasekaran et al 2019 in the same way the formation of typicalbimetallicsulfides is briefly described as a1 xbxsy a and b represent different metals both x and y are integers zhang et al 2010b zhao et al 2017b there are diverse types of tmss such as the simple and symmetrical sodium chloride pyrite tetrahedral crystal structure anti fluorite and fluorite structural type have been reported huang et al 2020a xu et al 2017b zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 in contrast to other commonly used transition metal catalysts tmss feature higher electrical conductivity rich redox sites superior optical characteristics exceptional mechanical andthermal stabilities as well as robust catalytical performance by virtue of these advantages tmss are extensively applied to light emittingdevices kwon et al 2015 biological labels li et al 2016a solar cells gopi et al 2016 energy conversion andstorage yilmaz et al 2017 cathode materials xing et al 2020 and sensors as well as environmental remediation an et al 2020 babu et al 2018 ji et al 2020a aops based on tmss and their derivates have gained tremendous attentiondue to their unique physicochemical properties as mentioned above in these oxidation processes heterogeneous catalysis induced by tmss based catalysts for water decontamination can be fulfilled with ease to the best of our knowledge there are numbered previous reviews about tmss based catalysts while they are mainly focus on electrochemical energy storage and photocatalysis for environmental remediation with an emphasize on the catalyst synthesis methods characterization techniques morphology and structure control despite the progress in heterogeneouscatalysis for water purification the study on tmss based aops is still in its infancy and the application of tmss based heterogeneous catalysts to treat contaminated water through aops have never been reviewed till now hence the present work intends to provide a timely overview of recent advances in wastewater treatment through tmss based aops firstly the properties regulation strategies of tmss based catalysts are briefly summarized following that the latest progress ontmss based aops for waterpurification is reviewed such as fenton like oxidation photocatalytic oxidation and electrochemical oxidation processes meanwhile the key water chemistry parameters affecting the catalytic performance of tmss based aops are elucidated namely ph temperature dissolved oxygen inorganic species and natural organic matter furthermore the reusability and stability of tmss based catalysts in aops wastewater treatment arepresented ultimately the conclusions and perspectives forfuture aops associated with tmss are proposed 2 strategies for tuning properties of tmss based catalysts the physicochemical properties e g optical electrical catalytical performance of tmss based catalysts are strongly related to their morphology and structure characteristics properties tuningstrategies for tmss based catalysts mainly include artificial size and shape control composition control doping and heterostructure manufacturing in the following part the commonly used strategies for regulating the properties of tmss based catalysts are presented 2 1 shape size and composition control fine adjustment of the physicochemical properties of tmss based catalysts can be achieved by simply controlling their shape size and composition for instance different sizes of cds nanocrystals ncs can be easily obtained by controlling the concentration of cd2 in dodecanethiol solvent zhuang et al 2011 it was found that the emission peaks of photoluminescence pl spectra were blue shifted as the decrease in the size of the cds ncs in the ultrasmall ncs the intensity of pl was reduced obviously due to the increased number of defects previous study revealed that the edge sites of mos2 were the active centresfor catalysis alonso et al 2002 kibsgaard and co workers reported that the morphology tuning of double gyroid mos2 with high surface curvature and high surface area as well as nanoscaled pores at nanoscale preferentially to expose more edge sites kibsgaard et al 2012 the extended three dimensional mesoporous mos2 network structure with a radius of curvature of nanoscale dimensions could significantly change the thermodynamic stabilities of different surface characters by imposing geometric constraints besides the use of silica template during the synthesis process offered the distinct advantage of ready integration into a device architecture for electrochemical application as a result the minimal diffusion limitation was realized and the activity of as obtained catalyst for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction her was highly promoted the density of active sites per surface area would be enhanced 2 4 times relative to nanowires as depicted in fig 1a however the size and shape control sometimes may result in the disappearance of quantum confinement effects and the appearance of the instability of extremely small tmss based catalysts shen et al 2011 observed a sharp emission peak at 471 nm and a broad emission tail at 622 nm in the pl spectra of cds nanorods which were derived from band edge emission and the sulfur vacancies in cds ncs respectively the pl spectra of cds quantum dots qds and cds nanorods were similar in shape while both two center peaks were red shifted from 471 nm to 489 nm and from 622 nm to 650 nm respectively due to the typical quantum size effect since the diameter increased from 5 7 nm to 7 5 nm the stability of structural phase and morphologies of the as prepared tmss based catalysts was closely related to the precursor capping ligands and reaction temperature chakraborty et al 2019 pointed out the presence of different morphology and phase of obtained cu3bis3 nanospheres and nanoflowers could be attributed to the capping effect on the ncs surface induced by oleylamine and 1 dodecanethiol the current voltage i v measurements indicated that both films of different shapes possessed the potential as absorber layers in solar cells while the nanoflower shaped cu3bis3 thin film displayed higher dark current value in comparison with nanosphere shaped ones since its larger particle and crystallite size as well as the decreased grain boundary resistance could reduce electron scattering moreover a high thermoelectric figure of merit zt value of 0 21 was gained at 573 k by increasing the carrier concentration and reducing the lattice thermal conductivity through reducing s content of cufes2 x compound to 1 8 li et al 2013 during the process the phase would vary from tetragonal to cubic gradually accompanied by the refinement of crystal grains besides the exposed facets of the ncs are also important factors affecting the photocatalytic performance of the ncs liu et al 2019 found thevariation of surface ligands and gallium precursors could adjust the morphology of wurtzite cugas2 cgs nanoplates from one dimensional 1d to two dimensional 2d fig 1b c it was verified that the 001 plane facilitated the charge transport based on the theoretical calculation results among these samples the 2d cgs nanoplates exhibited the most satisfactory photocatalytic performance under simulated solar illumination since the higher percentage of exposed 001 facet provided more photo generated electrons as compared to 100 facet besides the 001 facet has some metal properties while the 100 facet remained the semiconductornature which was favorable for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution apart from the common one component tmss the multi nary tmss can be obtained by alloying different metal elements which are expected to display moredistinct structures with tunable optical electrical and catalytic properties balamurugan et al 2017 bhattacharyya and pandey 2016 xu et al 2019 among these alloyed tmss 2d cuco2s4 nanosheets nss band gap e g 2 24 ev induced the formation of highly opened 3d hierarchical architecture to expose most of the surface which endowed them potential abilities to absorb the entire visible light for water splitting reactions and the apparent quantum yield aqy reached to 2 48 chauhan et al 2019 the indirect band gap of cuco2s4 nss alleviated the fast charge recombination moreover cuco2s4 nss possessed a high surface area 62 9 m2 g 1 and donor concentration 7 22 1018 cm 3 as well as a highly populated density of states at the fermi level which were favorable for the adsorption of h on s sites to convert to h2 therefore cuco2s4 nss can be utilized as an efficient photocatalyst for water splitting reactions bhattacharyya and pandey 2016 found that cufes2 qds with tetragonal chalcopyrite structure displayed a tunable band gap in the range of 0 5 2 ev 600 2500 nm and the pl quantum yields qys exceeded 80 the precise control of the qds band gap and particle size could be achieved by slow injection of sulfur and adopted a lower reaction temperature 180 c ternary alloyed tmss consist of earth abundant and eco friendly elements that are also of great interest for energy harvesting and environmental remediation for example cu2znsns4 is an abundant and low toxicity semiconductor material with a direct band gap of 1 5 ev holding great promise for dye sensitized solar cells dsscs xin et al 2011 chen et al 2016 obtained a high power conversion efficiency pce of 7 09 by using leaf like czts plate arrays plar as the pt free counter electrode ce the outstanding performance of dsscs might benefit from their high catalyticsurface area fast photo generated electron transport remarkable catalytic ability towards the i3 electrolyte and the high diffusion coefficient of the i3 moreover the properties of multi nary tmss can be modulated by changing the stoichiometries of anion cation constituents in anion cation alloyed tmss yu et al 2012 reported the synthesis of single crystal like porous cdxzn1 xs nanosheets by a facile cation exchange strategy the pore size of cdxzn1 xs can be controlled by changing the solvent and the cd0 5zn0 5s was fabricated with the molar ratio of zns diethylenetriamine deta cd2 1 2 in water 10 50 nm the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra of porous cd0 5zn0 5s nanosheetsshifted to longer wavelengths and the absorption region was much steeper and higher in comparison with the cd0 5zn0 5s nanorods due to its narrower band gap and stronger absorption ability of photons the porous single crystal like structure was quite favorable for the photocatalytic h2 generation mi and co authors synthesized large scale 3d hierarchical nixco3 xs4 x 0 15 0 42 microflowers by adjusting the co ni atomic ratios and used them as electrode materials for supercapacitors fig 1d mi et al 2014 as shown in fig 1e f the ni0 42co2 5s4 microflowers exhibited optimal discharge capacitance value 321 4 f g 1 a current density of 0 5 a g 1 and a higher degree of reversibility 97 for 1000 cycles at 2 a g 1 the high surface area resulted from the hierarchical microsphere and the elevated level of nickel ratio afforded sufficient electrolyte electrode interface for fast diffusion and reaction thus leading to the enhanced electrochemical performance of nixco3 xs4 microflowers kato et al 2015 reported that the highly active cuga 1 xzn2xs2 e g 2 2 ev upon forming a solid solution between cugas2 and zns which could serve as a promising h2 evolving photocatalyst in the presence of sacrificial reagents s2 and so3 2 the aqy of h2 evolution over the optimized ru loaded cuga 0 8zn0 4s2 up to 3 0 under 420 nm of monochromatic light irradiation the higher activity of cuga 1 xzn2xs2 solid solution relative to cugas2 was attributed to the higher level conduction bands of zn in general the physicochemical properties of tmss based catalysts can be well controlled by tunning their shape size and composition the design of tmss based catalysts in special shape specific flower like hollow hierarchical microsphere and 3d hierarchical architecture etc usually tends to expose more active sites which may result in an enhancement in their optical electrical catalytical performance to some extent the tmss based catalysts with high surface area and abundant pores hold great promise for efficient photocatalysis electrocatalysis and fenton like catalysis besides the preferential exposure of highly active facets and preparation of multi nary tmss are also regarded as effective strategies to obtain desired materials besides the preferential exposure of highly active facets and preparation of multi nary tmss as well as alter the edge site populations also have been confirmed as effective strategies to obtain desired materials 2 2 doping the method of doping also opens up new possibilities for developing advanced materials with tunable properties zhang and co workers demonstrated that the monolayered fe doped ws2 with lateral sizes of 100 µm synthesized using different concentrations of precursor solutions fecl3 exhibited various morphologies such as triangular hexagons and irregular shapes zhang et al 2020c the raman spectra of highly doped fe doped ws2 presented a red shift of 1 cm 1 compared with pristine ws2 which were resulted from the lattice strain and charge doping effects of fe dopants the deep level defect states induced by fe dopant would result in non radiative recombination of photoexcited carriers and further lead to a uniform pl quenching phenomenon in the entire fe doped ws2 flake lai et al 2019 revealed that the fe doped nico2s4 nanosheets wrapped on n s doped ordered mesoporous carbon fe nico2s4 n s cmk 3 delivered reinforced specific capacitance of 197 8 f g 1 and higher stable cycling which were remarkably superior to those of the nico2s4 n s cmk 155 2 f g 1 and fenico2s4 cmk 3 135 9 f g 1 the doping of fe led to the formation of abundant electron enriched ni and coatoms which were potential high energyadsorption sites for ionic liquid ions the presence of abundant open pore volume among neighboring fe nico2s4 nanosheets and the stronger interaction between the fe nico2s4 nanosheets and the conductive carbon host n s cmk 3 were favorable for the capture of ionic liquid consequently theionic liquid polarization effect and transportation ability from fe nico2s4 surface and n s cmk 3 structure were remarkably enhanced xie et al 2017 studied the thermoelectric properties of zn doped cu1 xznxfes2 x 0 0 1 compounds and found that zn can function as an effective donor to increase the carrier concentration and enhance the thermoelectric properties of cufes2 zn doping and zns nanoparticles wereeffective in scattering acoustic phonons with the increase of zn content a fraction of zn atoms in situ generated znsnanoparticles in the matrix which induced an interface thermalresistance and decreased the lattice thermal conductivity on the contrary the carrier concentration and the electricalconductivity enhanced with increasing zn content the highest zt value was measured to be 0 26 at 630 k for cu0 92zn0 08fes2 which was about 80 higher than that of the pristine cufes2 the commonly used doping methods such as substitutional doping during growth ion implantation plasma treatment might inevitably lead to the deformation of tmss crystal structure and the introduction of ionized impurity scattering as well as the reduction of charge mobility conversely the adverse effect of ionized impurities could be eliminated and the mobility and carrier concentration could be well maintained by modulation doping people and bean 1984 xu et al 2017a reported the synthesis of n doped and p doped of mos2 by tio2 and moo3 respectively pl and electrical studies of layer dependent heterostructured composites suggested that the interlayer interaction between tio2 moo3 layers and mos2 surface was very weak thus the lattice strain to mos2 was ignorable the increase of negative trion x peak pl was caused by the increased electron density of mos2 khan and co authors demonstrated a route for significantly enhancing the thermoelectric properties of cucr2s4 by sb doping khan et al 2017 the band structure calculations of cucr2 xsbxs4 models verified that the introduction of sb shifted the material toward the semiconductor side and offered extra electrons to fill some of the holes in the valence bands thus resulting in an enhanced seebeck coefficient and a reduced magnetic moment the material was quite stable even the temperature was up to 650 c the highest zt value was found to be 0 43 with an sb content of x 0 3 at 650 c it was wang and co workers found that the h2 production performance of bi cd and ti doped cds cds composites was superior to undoped cds cds sample especially for bicds cds composite wang et al 2019 the bi cds cds showed the weakest pl peak than other metals doped cds cds samples and the h2 evolution rate of bi cds cds 1 77 mmol h g was verified to be 5 2 times and almost 2 times that of pure cds and undoped cds cds respectively since bi doping could endow efficient electron transfer from cds to bi cds as shown in fig 2a however controllable doping of aliovalent impurities in ncs is very challenging another available doping approach through vacancy formation is developed the vacancies in the doped ncs act as free holes and manifest p type doped material properties with a localized surface plasmon resonance lspr feature appearing in the near infrared nir doping by copper vacancy formation occurs readily because of the low chemical potential and high mobility of copper ions the cu2 xs ncs with tunable plasmonic properties were prepared via cu2s and i2 involved redox process by varying the ratios of iodine to copper inchloroform elimelech et al 2017 the plasma response peak intensity of cu2 xs ncs increased significantly with the elevation of the i cu ratio and accompanied by blue shift owing to the increase of the free hole concentration fig 2b c gao et al 2020 successfully prepared chalcopyrite derived naxmo2 m cu fe mn composites by modulating the impurities si and ca that came from chalcopyrite in the self doping process offering the p2 and o3 type products with improved cycling stability andbetter rate capability li and co authors demonstrated that the properly introduction of sulfur vacancies and elastic strain of monolayer 2h mos2 yield the optimal hydrogen adsorption free energy δgh 0 ev with a high turnover frequency per s vacancy site tofs vacancy 0 31 s 1 at 0 v versus rhe which endowed the molybdenum sulfide based catalyst with unprecedented intrinsic her activity li et al 2016b appropriately increase of s vacancies and the offer of tensile strain would lead the bands to move closer to the fermi level and increase the number of gap states thereby increasing the adsorption strength on the s vacancy site and the active site density the above method of combining vacancies with elastic strain was also suitable for other 2d materials to generate new active sites 2 3 heterostructure manufacturing heterostructured tmss are of considerable interest for applications in catalysis and photonics because of the improvement of the physicochemical properties and the synergistic interactions between different components for instance the quantum efficiency qe at 420 nm of optimized nis cds photocatalyst obtained by hydrothermally loaded nis 1 2 mol on cds surface was measured to be 51 3 zhang et al 2010a the h2 evolution rate was boosted approximately 10 times fairly high up to 0 66 mmol h 1 in contrast to the pure cds meanwhile the hierarchical co9s8 znin2s4 tubular heterostructures have been synthesized by growing 2d znin2s4 nanosheets on 1d hollow co9s8 nanotubes zhang et al 2020a compared with pure znin2s4 tubular heterostructured co9s8 znin2s4 possessed a larger surface and exposed abundant catalytical active sites more importantly the unique hollow structure of co9s8 znin2s4 could ensure multiple light reflection scattering in the cavity and effectively promote the interfacial separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons holes thereby offering an excellent h2 generation rate of 9039 µmol h 1g 1 in the absence of any co catalysts fig 2d almost 100 reduction of crvi was achieved in 45 min using 10 co9s8 znin2s4 asa photocatalyst and exhibited high stable reusabilityafter multiple photocatalytic cycles fig 2e f it was also uncovered that the photocatalytic activity of self assembled zns nixsy heterojunctions in eosin b removal and hydrogen generation was superior to those of single component zns and nixsy sovann khana 2020 the band position measurements and density functional theory dft simulations indicated that nixsy functioned as a co catalyst for zns besides nico2s4 rgo hybrid composite with reinforced rate capacity and high cycling stability of 95 capacitance retention 8000 cycles 5 a g 1 were synthesized by fan et al 2017 the superior electrochemical performance of hybrid electrode was benefited from the hierarchical and porous architectures and synergistic effect between nico2s4 and rgo however the poor interfacial contact between graphene and tmss may hamper their capacitance and stability of hybrid supercapacitors to overcome this drawback phytic acid pa was used as a chelating agent to assist the connection between rgo and nico2s4 nps which could not only influence the morphology and size of nico precursor prgo but also enhanced the interfacial contact between rgo and nico2s4 zheng et al 2018 cation incorporation and exchange processes are most commonly used in heterogeneous nanostructures construction liu et al 2018c reported that the incorporation of divalent cations generated heterogeneous nanoplatelet npls or entirely new binary npls through anisotropic cation exchange in the presence of dodecanethiol ddt and covellite cus npl templates such as cds cu2 xs zns cu2 xs cu0 4zn0 2in0 4s and cu2znsns4 czts npls the conflicts between valence and coordination number of divalent cations could result in the generation of heterogeneousnanostructures for example treatment of cu2 xs using zn2 and cd2 consistently produced cu2 xs zns cds heterostructures while the incorporation of trivalent cations in3 ga3 and fe3 or tetravalent cations sn4 and ge4 produced homogeneous ternary ncs by using cu2 xs as a template and their morphologies were consistent with cu2 xs liu et al 2018b liu et al 2018c macroporous rgo wrapped co9s8 qd was homogenously embedded within a mesoporous hollow carbon polyhedral hcp to obtain the sponge like composites co9s8 qd hcp rgo with superior reversible capacity and exceptional rate behavior chen et al 2017 the double confined nanospace induced by coupled rgo could effectively hamper co9s8 agglomeration and enlarge the lattice parameters of co9s8 crystals thereby promoting the electrochemical performance for sodium storage moreover the double helix structured carrageenan metal hydrogels derived from seaweed biomass were applied to fabricate 3d metal sulfide nanostructure carbon aerogels cas composite daohao li 2016 the unique aerogel structure of as synthesized fes ca endowed itself splendid sodium ion storage performance reversible capacity of 280 ma h g 1 after 200 cycles and rate performance of 222 ma h 1 at 5 a g 1 the presence of ca accelerated charge transfer reaction and promoted the mechanical performance of fes nps as well as buffered the volume changes during the discharge process 3 tmss based advanced oxidation processes the ever growing water pollutionintrigue people to seek efficient and environmentally friendly wastewater treatment technologies a variety of tmss based heterogeneous catalysts have beenfound to be effective for wastewater treatment by different available aops in this part of review the catalytic performance and mechanism of typical tms based aops comprisingfenton like oxidation photocatalytic oxidation and electrochemical oxidation processes are discussed in detail 3 1 fenton like oxidation studies on the chemical oxidants e g ozone o3 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and persulfate s2o8 2 activation by tmss based catalysts have shown that diverse ros can be well generated for efficient water purification in these aops the extensive application of tmss based catalysts in fenton like oxidation toremove organic pollutants is presented in table 1 some earth abundant sulfide minerals can serve asheterogeneous catalysts for efficient degradation of organic contaminants for instance pyrite fes2 exhibited great efficiency for pms activation to degrade and mineralize diethyl phthalate dep zhou et al 2018 in the pms fes2 system different sulfur species were generated from theoxidation of sulfides caused by fe iii and pms among them s2 2 played a vital role in fe ii regeneration and so3 2 was the mainsulfur species committed to pms activation to generate so4 in a recent study by he et al 2021b fes2 was also applied to activate peroxydisulfate pds for the efficient removal of cr vi and2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp simultaneously the disintegration of 2 4 dcp was mainly attributedto the activation of pds by fes2 while the reduction ability of pyrite principally contributed to the removal of cr vi so4 was identified as the predominant oxidative species responsible for the oxidation of 2 4 dcp based on the experiments and dft calculation results fe was verified to be the dominant catalytic site and the reductive sulfur species on the surface of pyrite acted as donors to mediate the cycle of fe2 fe3 meanwhile ferrous sulfide fes ore particles were also considered as an effective fenton like catalyst for the degradation of pchloroaniline pca yuan et al 2015 almost all pca was degraded and 99 of pca wasmineralized in fes ps system the excellent performance was ascribed tothe supply and maintenance of appropriatefe2 concentrations which avoided the excess fe3 accumulated to produce iron hydr oxides and was beneficial to the radical chain reactions apart from iron containing sulfide minerals the natural cus mineral was also proposed as an alternative electron donor to activate ps and 91 6 atrazine atz removal was achieved in 40 min under acidic ph peng et al 2018 pirgalıoğlu and özbelge 2009 investigated the cus o3 system for the treatment of different aqueous single dye solutions it was also found that the catalytic activity of copperions in the solution enhanced the toc removal efficiency and the decomposition of ozone into oh besides the mineral chalcopyrite cufes2 based pms activation process was established for bisphenol s bps degradation peng et al 2020 under the experimental conditions ca 83 0 of bps was removed and 30 5 of bps wasmineralized which was attributed to the promoted fe3 fe2 and cu2 cu redox cycles on the cufes2 surface induced by reductive sulfur species the activation of chemical oxidants by inexpensive and readily available sulfide minerals provided great benefitsfor the application of tmss based aops in remediation of contaminated water nevertheless sometimes natural sulfide minerals are large sized and low purity may constrain their catalytic activity to overcomethis drawback different artificially synthesized tmss based catalysts with highly desirable physicochemical properties were deemed as the alternative heterogeneous catalysts for water decontamination liu and co authors conducted a comparative study using hydrothermal synthesized fes2 syn fes2 and commercial pyrite com fes2 to catalyze h2o2 decomposition for alachlor degradation liu et al 2015 it was revealed that the alachlor degradation rate of syn fes2 h2o2 fenton system 99 was much higher than that of com fes2 h2o2 system 8 at initial ph of 6 2 due to its higher surface area and the improved molecular oxygen activation caused by more surface bound ferrous ions on the surface of syn fes2 fig 3a themechanism for the enhanced fenton oxidation in the syn fes2 system was shown in fig 3b first the fe ii released from fes2 would react with h2o2 to produce oh and fe iii thenalachlor may be directly oxidized and mineralized by the generated oh although the formation of fe hydroxocomplexes on the surface of fes2 was unfavorable for the further reaction themolecular oxygen could be activated by surface bound ferrous ions on the syn fes2 through a single electrontransfer pathway to generate o2 accompanied by the reduction of surface bound ferric ions consequently the efficient fe ii fe iii cycle in the syn fes2 h2o2 system could provide enough surface fe ii for the fenton reaction to generate more oh thus promoting the alachlor degradation the cos2 x obtained by ultrasonic treatment of commercial cos2 cos2 com can also be innovatively employed as a reagent for o2 activation to sustainably release1o2 ji et al 2020b the ultrasonic treatment induced the reduction of oxidesand the pairing of a great number of single electrons on cos2 x surface epr tests suggested that the cos2 com possesseda strong sulfur defect peak at g 2 004 while it disappeared after ultrasonic treatment the newly appeared weak defect peak at g 1 996 represented co defect thus enabled a certain degree of reducibility of cos2 x surface fig 3c 1o2 was verified to be the prominent ros generated bythe cos2 1 5 h fe2 system supplemented by a small quantityof o2 and oh as illustrated in fig 3d the presence of reductive electronpairs at the sdefects could reduce o2 to generate o2 h2o2 through a one two electron process on the surfaceof cos2 1 5 h eqs 1 2 then the o2 was then quickly oxidized to 1o2 with the assist of co4 co3 exposed on the surface of cos2 1 5 h eq 3 besides fe2 could also reduce oxygen to o2 eq 4 thus greatly increasing the concentration of o2 in thesolution meanwhile a large number of fe2 would transform into fe3 and become easier to adsorb and deposit onthe surface of cos2 1 5 h the electron rich surface of cos2 1 5 h promoted the circulation of fe3 fe2 leading to the decomposition of h2o2 eqs 5 6 moreover the capture of o2 also acceleratedthe conversion of fe2 to fe3 thus facilitating theadsorption and deposition of fe3 as well as the decomposition ofh2o2 consequently the generation of the strongestoxidizing oh would be accelerated 1o2 as the main ros was the keyfactor for potential long term effective degradation nearly 100 removal of rhodamine b rhb methyl orange mo phenol and sulfadiazine sd could be achieved in cos2 1 5 h fe2 system under optimal reaction conditions surprising after 30 days the recovery rate of cos2 1 5 h fe2 system was calculated to be 65 which was much higher than those in cos2 1 5 h fe3 52 cos2 1 5 h 39 andcupx 30 furthermore over 96 0 cod removal rate of the nitrobenzene containingactual wastewater by the cos2 1 5 h fe2 system was observed and the use of activated carbonblocked the ion content to a very lowconcentration fig 3e the above results demonstrated the huge potential of cos2 x for the selective long term degradationof organic pollutants in addition mos2 could act as a versatile activator for both pms and ps activation to generate so4 and oh towardscarbamazepine cbz degradation zhou et al 2020a the free diffusion so4 was verified to be the responsible ros in mos2 pms system while surface bound and free diffusion so4 coexisted in the mos2 ps system 1 o2 e defect o2 2 o2 2e defect h2o2 3 o2 co4 co3 1o2 co2 4 fe3 e defect fe2 5 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh 6 fe2 o2 fe3 o2 moreover the multicomponent tmss based catalysts are expected to show moreexcellent catalytic activities than one component ones due to the tandem synergistic effect among different metal ionsand the electron donating effect of reductive sulfur on the cycle of redox couples for example nie et al 2019 reported that the cufes2 pms system was efficient to degrade bpa in this case almost completely bpa removal and 75 toc mineralization were achieved in 20 min which was superior to those in cu2s pms and fes fes2 pms systems they pointed out the as prepared cufes2 nanoparticles possessed abundant surface bound cu and fe2 and the presence of sulfur species played a vital role in enhancing the cycling of cu2 cu and fe3 fe2 as demonstrated in fig 3f cu and fe2 on cufes2 surface activated hso5 to generate so4 and oh eqs 7 8 the regenerated fe2 active sites by the electron transfer from cu to fe3 andthereductive sulfur species induced the continuous formation of ros eqs 9 15 meanwhile the hydrothermal fabricated spinel sulfide carrollite cuco2s4 with high catalytic activity and stability was applied to the activation of pms for the degradation of bisphenol s bps xu et al 2018a it was verified that the neutral ph condition was most favorable for the degradation of bps and the synergistic surface redox couples of cu ii cu i and co iii co ii played a vital role in the catalytic activation of pms to produce so4 quenching experiments and epr studyindicated so4 was the dominant oxidant species for bps elimination apart from binary metal sulfides ternary alloyed cu2fesns4 cfts was also considered as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for pms inducedoxidation more recently kong and his colleagues innovatively synthesized a flower like ternary cu2fesns4 cfts nanomaterial and employed it as the activator of ps for the removal of bpa kong et al 2019 the developed oxidation system exhibited outstanding decontamination potential over a wide ph range of 3 10 in comparison with the monometallic cu fe sn sulfides systems in the czts ps system cu i was oxidized to cu ii accompaniedby the formation of so4 and oh the reduction of fe iii caused by cu i was thermodynamicallylikely to be realized which was more favorable for the redox cycle of fe iii fe ii therefore the synergetic effect between cu i and fe iii wasconductive to the interfacial electron transfer it was also revealed that the fe ii species generated by the complexation of fe ii by the sp3 hybridized s on the surface of cfts played an important role in the tandem synergistic effect among cu fe and sn in their quaternary chalcogenide systems upon ps activation eqs 16 19 the radical quenching tests and esr measurementssuggested that both oh and so4 contributed to the bpa degradation through a surface catalytic process oh produced by so4 oxidize

have been devoted to these tmss based heterogeneous catalysts there are still some deficiencies that need to be further improved typically poor dispersion and minimized surface active sites as well as massive metal ions leaching problemsquite impeded their widespread applications therefore the stability and reusability ofthe fenton like catalysts are highly desired for example li et al 2020b reported that the feco2s4 modified g c3n4 feco2s4 g c3n4 composite was promising for pms activation towards sulfamethoxazole smx degradation in the case of feco2s4 cn pms system 91 9 of smx removal was achieved which was higher than those of feco2s4 pms 60 1 g c3n4 pms 17 8 and pms alone 14 3 systems owing to the synergistic effects between feco2s4 and g c3n4 fig 4a under optimal experimental conditions the concentration of leached metal ions in feco2s4 cn pms systems 0 068 mg l co and 0 03 mg l fe was also lower than those in feco2s4 pms and co3s4 cn pms systems sincethe complexation of metal ions by g c3n4 and the synergistic effect between fe and co ions were conductive to inhibit the excessive metal ions leaching xu et al 2019 uncovered that the al2o3 supported cufes2 catalyst al2o3 cufes2 exhibited highcatalytic activity in activating peroxymonocarbonate pmc to degrade 2 4 dcp in the flowing experiment using fixed bed reactor almost completely removal of 2 4 dcp 99 was obtained over the first 10 h of running even after a long period of operation 216 h the removal efficiency of 2 4 dcp in the effluents was still up to 96 with a low and safe level of cu fe and s species leaching tong et al 2020 fabricated a magnetic fe3o4 deposited flower like mos2 mf composite for h2o2 activation to degrade diclofenac dcf due to the larger synergy effect between fe3o4 and mos2 the catalytic activity of mf composite was superior to fe3o4 mos2 and the physical mixture of fe3o4 and mos2 the presence of mos2 was verified to facilitate the conversion cycle of fe iii fe ii by exposed mo iv and the generated ooh thus improving the generation of oh moreover mf with a saturation magnetization of 40 6 emu g 1 could be easily recycled and exhibited excellent catalytic ability towards sanitary sewage additionally diao and co authors found that fes2 sio2 microsphere presented excellent ciprofloxacin cip decomposing ability in the presence of h2o2 even after seven reused cycles 75 7 diao et al 2017 both the increased adsorption ability resulted from more available active sites on the surfaces of sio2 microspheres and the smoothly continuous fenton reaction induced by controlling the release of aqueous fe2 from fes2 accounted for the promoted degradation of cip in fes2 sio2 h2o2 system ohads was proved to be the major ros responsible for cipelimination moreover tmss can act as excellent co catalysts to accelerate the rate limiting step of the fenton like process through exposed reductive metallic active sites diao and chu 2021 liu et al 2018a luo et al 2020 sheng et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 xing et al 2018 reported that the introduction of commercial 2h type mos2 significantly accelerated the cycleof fe3 fe2 and boosted the decomposition of h2o2 by 47 2 as well as greatly reduced the consumption of h2o2 0 4 mmol l and fe2 0 07 mmol l specifically the k obs value of rhodamine b degradation increased by 18 5 times as compared with the conventional fenton system the mechanism of the mos2 co catalytic fenton system was shown in fig 4b firstly the unsaturated s atoms on the surface of mos2 would capture protons from the solution to produce h2s subsequently theexposed mo4 enable to reduce fe3 to fe2 accompanied by the formation of mo6 eqs 20 21 after that mo6 was further reduced to mo4 with the assistance of h2o2 to ensure the catalytic cycling of mos2 eq 22 additionally in order to overcome the shortcomings of being difficult to recycle and reuse of the 2d mos2 a low cost sponge mos2 go smg 3d composite co catalytic aopsystem was further established by xing s group zhu et al 2020 as shownin fig 4c f thesponge was successfully loaded with mos2 and go and its original network skeleton was fully maintained simultaneously the raman spectra of smg manifested the presence of more surfacedefects which was expected to expose more metal active sites thus greatly enhanced the aops activity furthermore it was pointed out that the exposedmo4 active sites on 3d mos2 could greatly boost theconcentration and stability of fe2 in aops as well as maintain the circulation of iron ions ina stable dynamic cycle fig 4g thereby enhancing the activation ofh2o2 pms similarly a significant co catalytic effect of ws2 on thedecomposition of h2o2 in the photo assisted fenton system was also observed dong et al 2018c the rate limiting step of fe3 fe2 conversion could be significantly accelerated by the exposed reductive w4 active sites on the surface of ws2 which was beneficialto the reduction of cr vi 40 mg l the ws2 co catalytic fenton system could increase the correspondingdegradation rate of phenol and reduction rate of cr vi by 28 9 and 59 9 respectively 20 fe3 mo4 fe2 mo6 21 fe3 h2o2 fe3 o2h h 22 mo6 h2o2 mo4 h2o o2 in a word both natural sulfur containing ores and synthesized materials can be used as fenton like catalysts for chemical oxidants activation e g h2o2 o3 pds and pms towards target pollutants degradation due to the synergistic effect among different metal pairs the catalytic activity of multi nary tmss is generally superior to those of one component ones the stability and reusability of tmss based catalysts can be improved by preparing composite materials based on the above discussion the general catalytic mechanisms of tmss based fenton like systems are proposed scheme 1 metal ions released from tmss can effectively activate chemical oxidants to produce corresponding ros oh so4 1o2 o2 etc the reductive sulfur on their surface can function as an electron donor to promote the cycling of m n 1 mn thereby continuously inducing the fenton like reaction to generate ros for enhanced degradation of target contaminants 3 2 photocatalytic oxidation due to the capability of absorbing visible and or uv light narrow optical bandgaps and charge transport characteristics tmss and their derivatives are regarded as promising candidates for photocatalytic water decontamination the optical properties of tmss based photocatalysts and their applications in wastewater treatment are summarized in table 2 for instance cds sub microspheres with 0 5 µm size possessed a low band gap of 2 26 ev showing potential applications in photodegradation of acetaminophen and levofloxacin al balushi et al 2018 about 85 of acetaminophen and 70 of levofloxacin were removed by visible light irradiation for 4 h respectively fes2 photo fenton system was found to be highly active inphotodegradation of p nitrophenol pnp and completely pnp removal could be achieved within 4 min which was much faster than that of fes2 h2o2 system zeng et al 2019 the improved activity was owing to the accelerated cyclic conversion between fe2 and fe3 under visible light irradiation moreover the 3d hierarchical cu2fesns4 cfts microspheres were explored as an effective photocatalyst for the photodegradation of rhb and about 73 of the dye could be degraded after visible light irradiation for 180 min zhong et al 2015 additionally kush et al 2015 demonstrated the applications of surfactant free cu2znsns4 czts nanoparticles as a multifunctional heterogeneous catalyst for hydrogen oxygen evolution dye degradation and cr vi reduction reactions as depicted in fig 5 a the presence of quintessential oh at the surface of the hydrophilic czts was capable of extracting holes from the czts valence band leading to the rapid production of a great deal of oh and photocatalytic degradation of rhb fig 5b c as for the reduction of cr vi the photogenerated excitons and electrons were transferred to the conduction band of czts accompanied by the capture of excited electrons induced by the adsorbed cr vi complex on the surface of czts simultaneously eqs 23 25 consequently a notable reduction efficiency of cr vi up to 99 8 was observed in 15 minutes with a visible color change of the cr complex solution fig 5d f 23 czts hv ecb h vb 24 cr vi adsczts 3ecb cr iii adsczts 25 cr iii adsczts cr vi cr iii cr vi adsczts numerous studies have revealed that the optical properties and the recombination of charge carriers strongly depended on the shape and crystalline structure of the tmss based photocatalysts for example su et al 2016 compared the photocatalytic activity of znin2s4 samples prepared in different media water ethanol methanol and ethylene glycol among these samples znin2s4 synthesized in ethanol solvent was confirmed to exhibit the best photocatalytic activity which was mainly ascribed to the exposure level of 0001 special facets shenoy and co authors used different morphologies of cds as a probe to explore the influence of morphology 1d nanorods 2d nanosheets and 3d hierarchical on the photocatalytic activity towards erioglaucine eg degradation shenoy et al 2019 it was found that the photocatalytic performance of 3d cds was superior to those of 1d and 2d cds in the photodegradation of eg since its high crystallinity with single crystalline property prevented bulk electron hole pair from recombining moreover the numerousphotocatalytic active sites provided by hierarchical 3d structure promoted the mobility of photogenerated charge carriers quenching tests confirmed that e and o2 were the prevailing ros responsible for the photodegradation of eg chen et al 2012 studied the effect of surface facet on photocatalytic performance for dye degradation it was elucidated that the hexagonal znin2s4 microspheres presented a higher photocatalytic activity in cationic dyes degradation relative to cubic znin2s4 nanoparticles since the hexagonal znin2s4 microspheres consisted of nanolamella petals with 0001 negatively charged s plane which was not only beneficial to the adsorption of cationic dyes via n et 2 groups but also could accumulate the photogenerated holes thereby resulting in higher demethylation efficiency specifically almost 100 demethylation of mb was observed in 5 h over hexagonal znin2s4 microspheres while only ca 46 demethylation of mb was over cubic znin2s4nanoparticles table 3 however most single photocatalysts can only utilize one kind of useful charge carrier to overcome this shortcoming heterojunction photocatalysts were further developed to ensure a broad light absorption range and realize charge separation by separating the electrons and holes to different semiconductors the tmss based heterojunctions have been extensively studiedfor water decontamination to date the widelyinvestigated heterojunctions including type ii heterojunctions rai et al 2015 direct z scheme heterojunctions jiao et al 2019 p n heterojunctions zhou et al 2020b surface heterojunctions li et al 2019b and semiconductor graphene heterojunctions li et al 2011 which were verified to be efficient for improving the photocatalytic performance for instance the go g c3n4 mos2 gcm with ternary layered nanostructures was utilized as an effective photocatalyst for water purification wu et al 2018a it possessed more adsorption and response sites due to the dual effects of 1 methyl 2 pyrrolidinone nmp and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab thus showing great potential in photodegradation of mb rhb crystal violet cv and the photocatalytic reduction of cr vi specifically the sample gcm 7 contains ctab 0 07 g displayed the best photocatalytic performance for the removal of mb thedegradation efficiencies of those composites followed the order below gcm 7 cn mos2 go mos2 implying the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of the ternary gcm heterojunctions the schematic illustration of the photocatalytic process and charge transfer mechanisms in the go g c3n4 mos2 composites was shown in fig 5g the photo induced electrons can transport from the cb of g c3n4 to the cb of mos2 inducing the reduction of cr vi likewise the holes from the vb of mos2 were transferred to the vb of g c3n4 to reduce the compound charge and accumulate abundant electrons in the cb of g c3n4 the internal electron regions of gcm 7 played an irreplaceable role in charge migration between g c3n4 and mos2 leading to the improved photocatalytic performance by virtue of the shorter charge transfer path and superior electrical conductivity of go electron hole recombination was significantly limited the highly dispersed mos2 on the go g c3n4 substrate offered more photocatalytic active sites for the degradation of target contaminants therefore it was expected that the photocatalytic performance by go g c3n4 mos2 composites was significantly improved ren et al 2018 utilized 3d cofe2o4 mos2 heterojunctions as high efficiency photocatalyst for the removal of organic dyes the as obtained composites with 50 molar ratio of mos2 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity towards congo red cr degradation up to 94 9 with a rate constant 0 04413 min 1 which was much superior to pure mos2 the excellent photocatalytic activity of the cofe2o4 mos2 heterojunction was benefited from the synergistic effect of cofe2o4 nanorods and flower like mos2 nanosheets efficient light harvesting ability and the enhanced separation of photogenerated charge carriers at the heterojunctions interface in recent years tmss based type ii heterojunctions and z scheme heterojunctions are most widely used for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants for example cus bifeo3 cus bfo type ii heterojunction was exploited for photocatalytic oxidation of alachlor pesticide achieving 95 degradation and 92 mineralization of alachlor within 60 min with illumination bhoi and mishra 2018 the formation of heterojunctions resulted in a fermi level equilibrium and the band positions of both semiconductors were rearranged thus facilitating the transformation of electrons holes between cus and bfo as a result the as obtained heterojunctions possessed outstanding visible light absorption and charge carrier separation characteristics in comparison with the individual components the mechanistic investigation proved that the concerted effect of vb holes and oh contributed to the efficient oxidation of alachlor the activation of h2o2 at the cb of bifeo3 and the photocatalytic decomposition of h2o at vb lead to the generation of oh meanwhile the vb holes of cus also function as potential oxidizers consequently these transient substances unitedly contributed to the degradation of alachlor on the surface of cus bifeo3 heterojunctions besides the magnetic iron oxide io was introduced into cds qds to constructing type ii heterojunctions the combination of io and cds induced a red shift in absorption edge an enhancement of electron hole pairs lifetimes and a decreased optical band gap it was found that the hole and oh played a critical role in the enhanced photocatalytic degradation of xylenol blue similarly das et al 2019 demonstrated that the cus bi4ti3o12type ii p n heterojunctions could act as an effective photocatalyst for photodegradation of 2 methyl 4 chlorophenoxyacetic acid herbicide mcpa the cus bi4ti3o12 heterojunctions of 10 wt of cus was found to be highly efficient for mcpa degradation about 96 degradation of mcpa was observed in 3 h which was quite higher than that of pure bi4ti3o12 48 the enhanced activity was attributed to the efficient separation of the charge carriers induced by theinternal electric field and the closely microscopic contact between the two phases nevertheless the type ii heterojunctions photocatalysts are beneficial toseparate photogenerated electron hole pairs they still have certain deficiencies on the one hand the electrostatic repulsion between theholes cb electrons of different semiconductors is not conducive to the migration of electrons and holes in the dynamics on the other hand from the perspective of thermodynamics the formation of type ii heterojunctions lowers the redox capacity of charge carriers resulting in the insufficiency of driving force for a specific photocatalytic reaction di et al 2019 xu et al 2018b in contrast direct z scheme heterojunctions photocatalysts can maintain the strong redox ability for driving photocatalytic reactions and realize the spatial separation of reductive and oxidative active sites simultaneously low et al 2017 therefore the direct z scheme photocatalysts are highly desirable for water decontamination for instance z scheme 2d 1d mos2 nanosheet decorated ag2mo2o7 microrods were used as an efficient photocatalyst for the removal of levofloxacin under visible light illumination adhikari et al 2019 the photocatalytic degradation activity of the optimized mos2 ag2mo2o7 photocatalyst with 12 wt mos2 was 5 2 and 6 72 times those of the unitary ag2mo2o7 and mos2 photocatalyst respectively the enhancement in the photocatalytic activity of mos2 ag2mo2o7 mainly resulted from the efficient photogeneration of electron hole pairs and the favorable band positions as well as the massive photogenerated electrons at the interfacial contact of mos2 ag2mo2o7 moreover guo et al 2020 reported the photocatalytic oxidation of 2 4 dcp on hollow flower like polyhedral α fe2o3 defective mos2 ag z schemeheterojunctions specifically ag nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of α fe2o3 defective mos2 via a facile photo deposition process as shown in fig 6 a the relevant xrd patterns of α fe2o3 defective mos2 ag composite confirmed that the coexistence of α fe2o3 and mos2 hinting at their tight incorporation the sem and tem images of the ternary composite presented a hollow flower like structure which was able to provide abundant edge active sites and large specific surface area for efficient light harvesting fig 6b e the optical properties measurements found that the integration of mos2 nanosheets and ag nanoparticles enabled efficiently to prevent the recombination of photogenerated carriers as a result the photocatalytic activity of the ternary composites was significantly improved where 99 removal of 2 4 dcp could be achieved in 105 min of radiation under ph 5 fig 6f the k obs valueof the ternary composite induced photocatalytic system was measured to be 4 3 10 2 min 1 which was 2 20 times higher than those of the unitary and binary materials the epr experiments verified the generation of both oh and o2 fig 6g in this process the photogenerated electrons reacted with o2 to generate o2 and the holes aggregated in the vb of α fe2o3 gained adequate power to degrade contaminant or oxidize h2o to produce oh eqs 26 29 meanwhile the hot electrons generated by the surface plasmon resonance spr effect of ag particles could be injected into mos2 which was beneficial to the separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs moreover photogenerated charge carriers from the catalyst promoted the reduction of fe3 in α fe2o3 to fe2 and further generated ooh through the reaction between fe3 and h2o2 followed by the generation of oh in the fenton process eqs 30 31 besides the existence of electrons was also favorable for the generation of both oh and o2 towards the photodegradation of organic pollutants 26 photocatalyst hv photocatalyst e h 27 o2 e o2 28 o2 2h h2o2 29 h o2 oh pollutants degradedproducts 30 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 31 fe3 h2o2 fe2 ooh h besides the tmss based photocatalysts with desired optical properties by introducing different elements could also be constructed towards specific wastewater treatment applications for example ye et al 2018 prepared p doped znxcd1 xs with rich s vacancies znxcd1 xs p 0 x 1 and utilized it as the photocatalyst for both h2 evolution and photocatalytic oxidation of 5 hydroxymethylfurfural hmf it was uncovered that the impurity level of s vacancies in zn0 5cd0 5s p was closer to the fermi level relative to that in zn0 5cd0 5s which could function as an excellent electron trap center the interstitial p doping also resulted in an enhancement of photocurrent density of zn0 5cd0 5s from 0 85 to 2 85 µa cm2 thus promoting the generation and separation of photogenerated electrons holes the correspondingdiameter of the arc radius on the eis nyquist plot and slope of the m s plot was smaller than that of undoped zn0 5cd0 5s manifesting that zn0 5cd0 5s p possessed a smaller interface resistance and a higher carrier concentration since the solar energy conversion efficiency was low biomass derived compound hmf was desirable to introduce into the photocatalytic system to enhance the efficiency of overall water splitting during this process a notable h2 evolution rate was obtained up to 786 µmol h 1g 1 in the presence of 2 mg ml hmf which was much higher than that of zn0 5cd0 5s p 419 µmol h 1g 1 surprisingly under8 h irradiation about 40 of hmf conversed into the practically valuable oxidation product 2 5 diformylfuran dff an attempt has also been made to employ co ⅱ doped mos2 nano flowers co mos2 nfs as the heterogeneous catalyst to degrade ofloxacin ofx in photo pms system chen et al 2020a under visible irradiation co mos2 0 5 co doping amount was 0 5 nfs exhibitedthe optimal catalytic activity in ofx degradation and the k obs value of co mos2 0 5 nfs 0 085 min 1 was about 9 34 times that of pristine mos2 0 0091 min 1 the enhancement of ofx photodegradation could be ascribed to the superior photo response property and the efficient separation of photogenerated carriers resulted from co doping luo et al 2012 reported the degradation of rhb usingni doped cds hollowspheres as the photocatalyst the 1 2 mol of ni doped cds hollow sphere exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity towards the rhb removal achieving nearly 100 rhb degradation within 35 min the enhanced performance was attributed to the unique hollow spheres which was favorable for the harvest of exciting light the doped ni2 may function as transient trapping sites ofphotogenerated electrons devoting to narrowing the band gap and slowing downthe recombination rate of photogenerated carriers the general catalytic mechanisms of the tmss based photocatalytic oxidation system are displayed in scheme 1 under visible light irradiation tmss are capable of harvesting visible light photons to produce electron hole pairs the cb electrons of tmss based photocatalysts can reduce the molecular oxygen to o2 and further reacted with h species to produce h2o2 in presence of cbelectrons the oh was formed by the interaction of photoexcited electrons o2 and h2o2 the doping of tmss can narrow the band gap and reduce their recombination rate thus improving the photocatalytic performance the construction of heterojunctions can induce a favorable band alignment thus the photogeneratedelectrons can migrate from the cb of different semiconductors while the migration of holes takes place in a reverse direction inthe vb of different semiconductor components simultaneously the higher positive potential of the vb of heterojunctioncan facilitate the generation of oh by oxidation of h2o oh species as a result all the transient species formed participate in thephotocatalytic degradation of target contaminants 3 3 electrochemical oxidation electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have received growing attention owing to their environmental compatibility easy scale up inherent simplicity and safe conditions as well as high effectiveness for the degradation of refractory pollutants in comparison to conventional advanced oxidation processes anodic oxidation ao and electro fenton ef are the most popularized eaops ao is based on the generation of strong oxidizing species oh by means of water oxidation at the surface of o2 overpotentialanode m eq 32 homogeneous oh generated during the ef process from fenton s reaction eq 33 ganiyu et al 2016 h2o2 and fe2 are continuously generated via the electro reduction of o2 and fe3 at a suitable cathode by electro reduction of o2 eqs 34 35 respectively ammar et al 2015 wang et al 2015 in this process an external supply of oxygen is necessary through bubbling the solution or directly fed to a gas chamber similarly the addition of iron source at catalytic amount to the treated solution initially homogeneous ef or embed it onto suitable electrode materials is required heterogeneous ef el kateb et al 2019 thiam et al 2020 although the scientific fundamentals of eaops are now quite well understood the efficiency of h2o2 generation strongly relies on the solution ph and the type of cathode materials yuan et al 2011 to this end tremendous efforts have been made in seeking alternative cathode materials numerous innovative candidates such as metals selenides phosphides nitrides carbides and metal oxides as well as metal sulfides have been synthesized and investigated as both heterogeneous catalyst source and cathode materials to address these challenges 32 m h2o m oh h e 33 fe2 h2o2 h fe3 oh h2o 34 o2 g 2h 2e h2o2 35 fe3 e fe2 among these alternatives tmss based catalysts are quite attractive since they possess excellent electrical conductivity hybrid d orbitals and versatile redox nature which have displayed excellent catalytic performance for oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions as well as water treatment wu et al 2018b the tmss based eaops have recently experienced an impressive development for the treatment of refractory pollutants for example ammar et al 2015 employed pyrite powder as aheterogeneous source of fe2 catalyst for tyrosol ty degradation in the ef process by a boron doped diamond bdd carbon felt cell in the ef pyrite process 76 mineralization was achieved after 6 h at 50 ma which was 8 6 superior to that of ef process under comparable conditions due to the self regulation of ph and soluble fe2 by pyrite without external acidification likewise labiadh et al 2015 employed the pyrite ef system to generate h2o2 in situ and regenerate ferrous ions for the oxidation of azo dye 4 amino 3 hydroxy 2 p tolylazo naphthalene 1 sulfonic acid ahps more than 90 mineralization of ahps was achieved in pyrite ef within 300 min whereas mineralization of ahps in conventional ef process was only 70 under the same reaction time the improvement of pyrite ef system was ascribed to the abundant oh generated simultaneously on both the bdd surface and the pyrite induced fenton s reaction in bulk solution without acidification besides commercial mos2 was adopted as an efficient co catalyst to improve the conversion between fe2 and fe3 of the traditional fe0 ef process by mo4 on the mos2 surface and accompanied by the generation of mo6 eq 20 afterwards mo6 would restore to mo4 with the assist of h2o2 and lead to continuously recycling of iron ions hence generating more oh through fenton reaction eqs 22 and 36 38 the newly developed mos2 fe co catalytic ef process mos2 fe0 ef was confirmed to be effective towards sulfamethazine smt degradation tian et al 2021 completely elimination in 10 min and 42 2 toc removal of smt in 1 h were obtained manifesting an obvious improvement relative to the fe0 ef process 19 4 the electric energy consumption eec of mos2 fe0 ef was determined to be 11 8 kwh kg toc which was only 59 3 of that in fe0 ef process 19 9 kwh kg toc 36 o2 2h 2e h2o2 37 h2o2 fe2 fe3 oh oh 38 fe0 2h2o fe2 2oh h2 apart from the most frequently used pyrite ltaïef and co workers compared the effect of different sources of fe2 on the performances of ef process using homogeneous feso4 and natural heterogeneous catalysts ltaief et al 2018 it was found that all the iron based heterogeneous catalysts i e pyrite chalcopyrite fe2o3 and fe3o4 were able to drive the ef process with better performance in caffeic acid ca mineralization compared with those obtained in the absence of various kinds of iron catalysts toc removal efficiency was lower than 15 particularly chalcopyrite gave the highest abatement of the toc in comparison with pyrite due to the involvement of cu ii subsequently barhoumi et al 2017 developed a novel eaops using chalcopyrite mineral as a heterogeneous catalyst for the degradation and mineralization of tc the performance of ef chalcopyrite process was confirmed to be more superior to the conventional ef using 1 0 g lof chalcopyrite 300 ma current carbon felt cathode and bdd anode acquiring 98 mineralization of the tc solution after 8 h and detoxified the tc solution due to the self regulation of fe2 and cu2 content and solution ph to 3 in the reaction medium as well as their synergistic effect eqs 39 41 therefore oh could be formed in three ways namely electrochemically induced fenton s reaction fe2 and h2o2 fenton like reaction cu and h2o2 and the water oxidation at the bdd anode surface meanwhile it was noticed that oxamic and oxalic acids were more rapidly destroyed when using chalcopyrite since the carboxylate complexes of cu2 were more reactive towards oh resulting in an enhancement of their oxidation rate moreover a photoelectro fenton hpef process was assembled for cephalexin removal by using chalcopyrite as heterogeneous catalysts irradiated with uva light owing to the synergistic effect of photocatalysis and ef process the overall removal of cephalexin by hpef process was observed in 15 min which was partly attributed to the photocatalysis stimulated by chalcopyrite accounted for 38 6 droguett et al 2020 39 cufes2 s 4o2 cu2 fe2 2so4 2 40 cufes2 s 4h o2 cu2 fe2 2s0 s 2h2o 41 cufes2 s 16fe3 8h2o cu2 17fe2 2so4 2 16h nonetheless the pyrite chalcopyrite catalyzed ef processes were verified to be better than other heterogeneous ef processes it may still suffer from excessive metal ions leaching thus hampering the catalyst reusability and requiring sludge management in this context ye et al 2020 have published a study in which highly stable and recyclable mof engineered fes2 c has been utilized as a heterogeneous ef catalyst to promote the electro oxidation of the fluoxetine in an iro2 air diffusion cell 91 of fluoxetine removal was obtained at initial ph of 6 after 60 min at 50 ma with 0 5 g l 1 fes2 c nanocatalysts which outperformed electrochemical oxidation with electrogenerated h2o2 eo h2o2 at initial ph of 3 0 41 conventional ef process with 5 mg l 1 fe2 at initial ph of 3 0 47 and heterogeneous ef process with 0 5 g l 1 natural pyrite at initial ph of 6 0 19 as described in fig 7 a the final ph of fes2 c ef process was measured to be 3 0 with a quite low concentration of dissolved iron 1 4 mg l 1 fig 7b which was much lower than those previously reported ef processes ltaief et al 2018 tian et al 2021 besides the large mineralization of all wastewater components and the remarkable decrease of toxicity were obtained at 6 hsynchronously accordingly the mechanism of fes2 c catalyzed heterogeneous ef process at mild ph was proposed in fig 7c it mainly includes the homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton s reaction mechanisms on the one hand the fes2 core shell nanoparticles acted as fe2 shuttles for homogeneous fenton s reaction to yield oh on the other hand the as obtained catalyst enabled to offer plentiful active sites to minimize the mass transport limitations the accessible fe s bonds were involved in the h2o2 decomposition resulting in the generation of oh pre eminently at fe ii sites additionally the activation of molecular o2 could be stimulated by a higher content of surface bound fe ii on fes2 thereby accelerating the formation of o2 besides the employed bdd anode also contributed to the generation of physisorbed oh given the relatively low concentration of dissolved irons the role of homogeneous fenton s reaction mechanism was insignificant while the heterogeneous mechanism was expected to be dominant therefore the fes2 c nanocomposite was an excellent candidate for heterogeneous ef treatment since the high yield of h2o2 was vitally important for efficient ef process the utilization of novel cathode materials based on tmss is deemed to be an effective strategy to enhance the performance of ef processes very recently mi et al 2020 prepared 3d columnar rgo mos2 ce0 75zr0 25o2 rmc composite as an electro fenton cathode showing outstanding electrochemical performance in ciprofloxacin cip degradation completely removal of ciprofloxacin was achieved within 5 h with a high mineralization rate up to 77 1 in 3 h under optimal conditions which was higher than those in electro absorption process of 48 0 ea using rgo cathode with no addition of fe2 ea ec of 82 4 ec using the rmc cathode with no addition of fe2 the superior degradation performance of rmc cathode was mainly attributed to the improved electron transport properties induced by mos2 doping the reinforced reduction of o2 to h2o2 via the heterogeneous catalysis of ce3 ce4 the effective electro absorption of rgo besides the ceria zirconia solid solution also resulted in enhanced redox properties and oxygen storage capacity furthermore it was also revealed that oh was mainly responsible for the degradation of cip and rmc cathode was more active towards the activation of h2o2 thereby improving the performance of ef process likewise tian and co workers developed fe3o4 fesx doped carbon aerogel ca cathode at 900 c named fesca 900 for the effective elimination of both dimethyl phthalate dmp and 3 chlorophenol 3 cp tian et al 2020b as high as 99 removal of dmp and 3 cp were achieved in 240 min which was higher than those of fesca 850 93 for dmp and 96 for 3 cp feca 900 75 and 81 feca 850 71 and 75 respectively the fesca 900 also presented extremely high toc removal for both dmp 94 and 3 cp 88 fig 8 c d among these cathodes fesca 900 cathode possessed a more positive onset potential of orr at 0 152 v v vs sce and exhibited a higher selectivity of h2o2 generation via 2 e orr 57 in comparison with feca 900 21 as well as accelerated the regeneration of surface fe ii owing to the presence of fesx as a result oh could be continuously produced by decomposing electrogenerated h2o2 on the surface of fesca 900 leading to the outstanding ef degradation performance moreover the introduction of s suppressed the fe leaching and endowed it with exceptional stability and great recyclability since the fe leaching concentration was quite low 2 ppm and the decline of removal efficiency over six cycling tests was negligible the general reaction mechanisms of tmss based eaops are described in scheme 1 tmss based catalysts have a dual role self regulation of the ph without external acidification and act as a solid catalyst tostimulate the heterogeneous fenton s reaction to generate oh when they are employed as the cathode the regeneration kinetics of fe ii or other metal ions on catalysts and electrochemical generation of h2o2 can be promoted thus resulting in a great deal of oh production and avoiding excessive iron leaching simultaneously besides the introduction of light irradiation is beneficial to eaops because photocatalysis also contributes to pollutant degradation to some extent 3 4 comparison of different tmss based aops to date it is revealed that a great number of tmss based catalysts have huge potential in aops for water purification the great popularity and widespread applicability of tmss based aops fenton like oxidation photocatalytic oxidation and electrochemical oxidation may be attributed to many aspects as follows in brief diverse reactive oxygen species can be generated under relatively mild pressure and temperature conditions and the oxidation processes are easy operation without complicated reaction devices usually the reaction system is cost effective with relatively satisfactory mineralization efficiency of target contaminants these three oxidation systems are independent of each other enables easy implementation as an integrated treatment process moreover they can be well combined with biological treatment processes which is beneficial to decontamination of wastewater with complex composition although tmss based aops possess many advantages there are still some shortcomings that required to be further improved for example among the three oxidation systems the fenton like oxidation is the most sensitive one to water chemistry and the type of oxidant will also affect the performance of the established oxidation systems to some extent the mineralization efficiency of target pollutants is relatively lower as compared to the other two systems sometimes the residual oxidant may also lead to high biological toxicity besides the leaching of poisonous metal ions may lead to secondary pollution thus the post treatment of effluent will increase operating costs while electrochemical oxidation using clean electricity as the driving force it can often obtain a higher mineralization efficiency if necessary the external supply of oxidant or fe resource may result in an enhancement in catalytic performance the oxidation system is less dependent on ph and it can also largely avoid the secondary pollution caused by the leaching of metal ions however electrochemical oxidation is mostly limited to fe bearing tmss and the preparation of electrodes based on tmss is relatively complicated tmss based catalysts have been extensively studied for photocatalysis the photocatalysis systems do not require additional energy input except for light source and there is almost no risk of secondary pollution however the initiate of photocatalysis reaction requires a specific device and the penetration of solar light is limited which greatly hampered the practical application and increased the capital expenses unlike the other two oxidation systems pristine tmss or natural sulfur containing minerals without any modification will be inactive for light irradiation in some cases the optical properties of tmss need to be further adjusted to achieve high photocatalytic efficiency and more attentions should pay to the photocorrosion of tmss based catalysts and guaranteeadequatepotential energy of charges sometimes it will be a judicious choice to reasonably integrate different water treatment processes 4 effect of water chemistry on degradation efficiency water chemistry has a significant effect on the performance of tmss based aops assuch some important factors e g ph temperature contaminant concentration dissolved oxygen natural organic matters and inorganics pecies affecting these processes are discussed in the following sections 4 1 effect of ph the solution ph is one of the most important aspects of aops wastewater treatment as it not only plays an important role in the decomposition of oxidants but also influences the surface charge of the tmss based catalysts and the speciation of the substrate to be transformed ao et al 2020 wang et al 2020b generally when the solution ph is greater than the ph value at point of zero charge phpzc the surface of tmss based catalysts is negatively charged otherwise positively charged for instance the phpzc of feco2s4 cn was measured to be 5 9 li et al 2020b therefore the surface of feco2s4 cn was positively charged under the investigated ph of 3 5 and 5 0 while it was negatively charged at the initial ph of 6 5 8 0 and 9 5 the smx mainly existed as anionic species under the ph range of 3 5 9 5 thus the initial ph of3 5 and 5 0 was more favorable for the smx degradation due to the enhancement of interaction between feco2s4 cnand smx as compared to that at alkaline conditions about 87 5 90 6 60 and 51 5 of smx were degraded at ph of 3 5 5 0 8 0 and 9 5 under buffer controlled experiment conditions respectively furthermore the species distribution and decomposition of oxidants are also significantly influenced by the solution ph the proportion of so5 2 would increase with the increase of ph value pms pka1 0 and pka2 9 4 resulting in enhancedelectrostatic repulsion between pms and the negatively charged surface ofcuco2s4 particles xu et al 2018a in addition the decomposition of pms under alkaline ph was hampered and so4 would convert to oh consequently the degradation of bps was inhibited under alkaline ph meanwhile it was also reported that partial decomposition of o3 into oh was accelerated at high ph which was beneficial to the degradation of target pollutants pirgalıoğlu and özbelge 2009 despite the decomposition of h2o2 to o2 and h2o would weaken the oxidation ability of h2o2 the negative effect was negligible for the tmss based aops systems yang et al 2020 qian et al 2014 found that the methylene blue mb degradation efficiency under acidic conditions was unsatisfactory ph 3 0 and only 43 5 of mb was removed while the performance under alkaline conditions was much better than those of acidic conditions even at strong alkaline conditions in cus ncs rgo h2o2 system 93 1 at ph of 11 0 in the study of zhang et al 2020b over the investigated ph range of 4 0 9 0 the degradation efficiency of sulfadiazine sdz was barely changed hinting that the activity of the cu2znsns4 h2o2 system was not influenced by the variation of solution ph fig 8a likewise a slight enhancement of sdz degradation efficiency under alkaline conditions was also observed with the increase of solution ph since a higher ph could provide a higher oh concentration to produce oh 4 2 effect of temperature the temperature of the reaction medium is another important parameter commonly addressed in dealing with water pollution by the tms based aops systems generally higher temperature enhances the mass transfer of reactants and kinetic constants moreira et al 2017 for instance wu et al 2020 studied the degradationefficiencies of tc withrespect to various reaction temperatures it was confirmed that the tc degradationefficiencies increased from 89 to 100 with the reaction temperature raised from 15 c to 45 c which was ascribed to the endothermic reaction of the pms activation process similarly the enhanced mb degradation in cus ncs rgo h2o2 system with the rising temperature was observed qian et al 2014 the degradation efficiency of mb reached 95 2 only in 10 min at 45 c while 93 0 degradation efficiency of mb needed 18 min at 35 c and even90 min at 25 c the results suggested that a higher temperaturemay not significantly accelerate the degradation efficiency but significantly influence the degradation kinetic constants in thecuco2s4 pms system the k obs value of bps degradation increased from 0 086 min 1 to 0 444 min 1 as the temperature waselevated from 15 c to 45 c fig 8b xu et al 2018a accordingly the activation energy ea for this process was determined to be 40 67 kj mol 1 manifesting that cuco2s4 was a potentially useful catalyst for water purification underambient temperature 4 3 effect of dissolved oxygen dissolved oxygen do is also acritical parameter of water chemistry when tmss based catalysts are exposed to the air do could be reduced to o2 or h2o2 via single electron ortwo electron transfer routes thereby affecting the degradation performance of these aops systems indirectly liu and co workers investigated the effect of molecular oxygen on alachlor degradation in thesyn fes2 h2o2 system under different atmospheric conditions liu et al 2015 as shown in fig 8c thealachlor degradation efficiency under argon was obviously lower than that under air when theinitial alachlor concentration was 0 033 mmol l correspondingly the k obs value of alachlordegradation under argon 0 0130 was only 59 of that under air 0 0221 these results suggested that the molecular oxygen activation process was involved in thesyn fes2 h2o2 system and the surface reactionsbetween ros and iron species organic molecules would be restrained under argon condition furthermore the degradation efficiency of smx in the n2 saturated feco2s4 cn pms system was reduced by 30 4 as compared with air conditions indicating the existence of o2 and 1o2 was partially derived from the do in reaction solution li et al 2020b conversely the bubbling of o2 into fes sulfite process would slightly hamper thedegradation of propranolol chen et al 2020b the result was probably attributed to the fast transformation of structural fe ii to fe iii at oxic conditions since the excessive do was enabled to alter the dissolution of fes moreover the generated bubbles might retard electron transportamong active substances nevertheless there is a limited amount of studies about the effect of do on the performance of tmss based aops which should be highly addressed in further researches 4 4 effect of inorganic species the ubiquitous inorganic anions e g cl po4 3 hco3 no3 andso4 2 in natural watersusually act as radical scavengers in the catalytic oxidation of water borne contaminants thereby influencing the performance of radical based aops systems for example zhao et al 2020 reported that the presence of cl and so4 2 100 mg l had negligible effects on p arsanilic acid p asa degradation in fes2 h2o2 process fig 8d while po4 3 exerted remarkably inhibiting effect on p asa removal owing to the competition with oh likewise the presence of 2 mm po4 3 completely inhibited the degradation efficiency of roxarsone rox in mos2 modified schwertmannite mos2 sch mediated photo fenton process wang et al 2021 because the po4 3 existed as h3po4 and h2po4 forms atph 3 5 which enabled to induce the radical quenching reactions between ros and po4 3 moreover po4 3 couldcomplex withfe3 toretard catalytic activity of mos2 sch even if phosphate radical hpo4 was generated likewise it was found that the addition of hpo4 2 5 100 mm caused a sharp decrease in the k obs value of ciprofloxacin cip in cos2 pms system which may be ascribed to the loss of active cobaltsites caused by phosphate ions through the chelating action li et al 2020a in the visible light irradiated co mos2 pms system so4 2 exhibited negligible influence on ofx degradation while no3 slightly suppressed the ofx degradation due to its quenching effect to reactive radicals chen et al 2020a an obvious inhibited degradation of ofx was obtained once cl and hco3 20 mm were introduced into the degradation process which was caused by the strong scavenging of cl and hco3 to the generated ros besides previous studies have revealed that the hco3 co3 2 andhpo4 2 h2po4 possessstrong buffer capacity li et al 2019a zhou et al 2020a found that once 1 mm hco3 and hpo4 2 wereintroduced into the mos2 pms system the ph value of reaction solution was quickly elevated from 4 to 8 1 and 7 1 respectively as a result most of the h in solution would be neutralized which was unfavorable for the capture of edge s atoms and significantly hampered theinteraction between mo ⅳ and pms thus inhibiting the degradation of cbz a similar phenomenon has also been observed in fes biochar ps system and the degradation of tc was decreased by 25 in the presence of 10 mm co3 2 he et al 2021a the presence of cl played a dual role in target pollutants degradation which was found to be concentration dependent chen et al 2019 for example the introduction of cl has two sides to the degradation of cip in cos2 pms system li et al 2020a the lower concentration of cl caused a severe retarding effecton cip degradation kinetics the k obs value of cip degradation decreased from 0 1209 to 0 0067 min 1 as the concentration of cl elevated from 0 to 5 mm this was probably owing to the consumption of so4 bycl which led to the formation of cl and cl2 once the concentration of cl was higher than 5 mm the degradation of cip was slightly enhanced this phenomenon could be attributed to the generation of hypochlorite hocl in addition the direct reaction between pms andcl couldalsoleadto the generation of hocl chen et al 2019 despite the redox potential of hocl 1 63 v was lower than that of so4 hocl possessed a much longer lifetime compared to radicals which could be considered as the dominant oxidant at high cl conditions lee et al 2020 however the effect of cl on the degradation of target pollutants has been controversial in the study by peng et al 2020 enhanced bps degradation was noticed in presence of a high concentration of cl up to 50 mm in thenatural chalcopyrite pms system they pointed out the generation of cl and cl2 with a high redox potential was responsible for the promoted degradation of bps similarly the reason for the enhanced degradation of tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep in fes2 ps systemwas thought to be the generation of active chlorine cl clho and cl2 li et al 2020a nevertheless the adverse effect of inorganic anions on the target contaminants degradation in the nonradical dominated process is usually unremarkable for example the addition of cl hco3 and h2po4 exhibited an insignificant effect on the smx degradation since the 1o2 was verified to be the major ros in the feco2s4 cn pms system li et al 2020b 4 5 effect of natural organic matter natural organic matter nom is a ubiquitous complex mixture in aquatic environment and would either promote orsuppress the removal of organic contaminants relying on itsconcentration and type drosos et al 2015 as a major constituent of nom humicacid ha has been extensively chosen as model nom to verifyits effect on the performance of tmss based aops towards target contaminants degradation for instance the degradation efficiency of cip decreased from 88 to 81 7 when ha 1 mmol l 1 was added into the cus fe2o3 mn2o3 pms system huang et al 2020b a similar phenomenon has been observed in the cu2fesns4 ps system kong et al 2019 the removal efficiency of bpa was significantly hampered inthe presence of 1 mg l 1 ha while further increase ha concentration to 2 mg l 1 and 5 mg l 1 the inhibition effect on bpa degradation was insignificant fig 8e demonstrating that ha restrained the cu2fesns4 ps process via covering the active sites on cu2fesns4 surface and it would competewith bpa for so4 and oh in the nonradical dominated process adverse effect on target pollutants degradation caused by ha is usually negligible therefore when 2 10 and 25 mg l ha were introduced into the 1o2 dominated feco2s4 cn pms system fig 8f smx degradation were slightly depressed by 2 7 5 2 and 7 4 respectively li et al 2020b 5 reusability and stability the reusability and stability of tmss based catalysts are highly desired which is vital for their practical application to assess the reusability of the sample reuse tests are usually needed to be conducted under the same reaction conditions generally the tmss based catalysts could maintain satisfactory catalytic performance over multiple successive cycles for instance the degradation of bpa only slightly decreased with increasing cycle number maintaining above 80 within 45 min after three reuse cycles in cu2fesns4 pssystem kong et al 2019 in the cuco2s4 pms system bps removal still up to 100 i n 30 min even after five repeated runs xu et al 2018a likewise in the photocatalytic oxidation process no remarkable activity decline for the cus bi4ti3o12 catalyst towards 2 methyl 4 chlorophenoxyacetic acid degradation over three cycles suggesting its highst ability and reliable practical performance das et al 2019 in the fes2 c ef process a slight but progressive performance decrease was observed after 5 cycles only 61 of fluoxetine removal was obtained upto three cycles at 60 min ye et al 2020 fortunately the electrocatalytic activity of fes2 ccould be completely regenerated after cleaning with organic solvent ch2cl2 and water besides ultrasound treatment and acid washing are also commonly applied to recovery the catalytic activity of tmss based catalysts for example the degradation efficiency of p asa decreased from 100 1st run to 80 5th run by fes2 h2o2 process while after treatment with 1 m hcl significant enhancement in p asa degradation was noticed fig 9 a possibly due to the removal of iron oxy hydroxides zhao et al 2020 similarly the catalytic activity of natural chalcopyrite could be effectively recovered by treating with ultrasound for 10 min after each cycle and the bps removal efficiency after five cycles was similar to that of the firs trun 83 peng et al 2020 multiple characterizations e g x ray diffraction xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier trans form infrared spectroscopy ftir scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopic tem are usually applied to confirm the stability of tmss based catalysts as shown in fig 9b the xrd pattern of ws 2 mos2 wo3 x catalyst indicated that the crystal structure of the composite remained unchanged compared with the fresh one after four repeated cycles hinting the highst ability of as prepared photocatalyst guo et al 2019 in the study of nie et al 2019 the xps analysis of fresh and used cufes2 suggested that the active sites fe2 and cu were efficiently regenerated due to the existence of s2 s2 2 and sn 2 fig 9c d as a result the pms activation by cufes2 and the bpa degradation reaction could be continuously processed after the consecutive cycle tests the bet value of the reused cu2fesns4 34 47m2g 1 was significantly greater than the fresh cu2fesns4 25 75m2g 1 due to the formation of in soluble carbonate and sulfate contaminants on the cu2fesns4 surface thereby resulting in a slight decrease of bpa degradation in ps activation process kong et al 2019 additionally metal leaching is also usually a problem of concern which could reflect the stability of tmss based catalysts in pms activation fig 9e f the iron leaching tests of fes graphene based catalyst using the double network template showed it had considerable stability since the iron leaching concentration was lower than 0 2 mgl 1 over 5 reuse cycles zhuang et al 2020 likewise in the zn0 9fe0 1s ni foam induced photocatalytic process the dissolution amount of ni ions zn ions and fe ions was quite stable with in 120 min over seven cycle experiments which were approximately 0 012 0 218 and 0 041 of the total mass of applied photocatalyst respectively zhang et al 2019 although sometimes the high level of leached metal ions can cause secondary pollution this problem can be well solved for instance incu2fesns4 pssystem the concentrations of leached cu fe and sn ions were measured to be 16 70 1 36 and 0 057 mgl 1 respectively kong et al 2019 the concentration of leached cu can be well controlled 0 05 mgl 1 by using buffer solution or adding ha into in cu2fesns4 pssystem it was also reported that the concentration of mo ion leached from mos2 pms system up to 2 23 mgl 1 zhou et al 2020a in order to avoid secondary pollution flocculation process by adding fe2 so4 3 into the filtrate was employed to reduce the mo leaching consequently the leached mo concentration decreased to 0 41 mg l moreover the leached sulfur species also play a key role in the reusability and stability of tms s based catalysts to some extent for example the chain reactions of s2 sn 2 fe3 fe2 pds in fe3s4 pds system resulted in efficient generation of so4 for bpa degradation lin et al 2020 while the decrease of s2 and sn 2 species on the surface of fe3s4 would weaken the reactions between the fe species and pds consequently the removal of bpa decreased by 20 after three cycles in the fe3s4 fe7s8 electro fenton process the amount of leached s species increased with cyclenumber resulting in an enhancementintheratiosofsurfacefetos choe et al 2018 some of the leached s species s2 could bind with leached fe species to reconstruct the surface with fe sulfide character rather than homogeneously catalyze h2o2 to generate oh thus suppressing the degradation of phenol conversely zhao and co workers reported that the s ii rich condition was beneficial to the generation of fesn and the cycling of fe iii fe ii would be accelerated zhao et al 2017a it was also confirmed that the s ii could directly activate h2o2 to produce oh based on the epr test which contributed to 40 removal of chloramphenicol cap as a whole the aforementioned results indicated that tmss based catalysts possess satisfactory reusability and stability for water purification through aops 6 conclusion and perspective in this review the commonly used strategies for rational regulating the properties of tmss based catalysts including artificial size and shape control composition control doping and heterojunction construction are briefly summarized benefiting from their excellent optical electrical and catalytic properties the tmss based aops exhibited huge potential in water decontamination in the fenton like oxidation process tmss based catalysts can be used for chemical oxidants activation e g h2o2 o3 pds and pms to produce corresponding ros oh so4 1o2 o2 etc or act as the co catalysts to accelerate the rate limiting step of the fenton like process in the photocatalytic oxidation process tmss based catalysts enable to harvest visible light photons to produce electron hole pairs and further initiate a series of chain reactions to form diverse ros to participate in thephotocatalytic degradation of target contaminants as for the electrochemical oxidation processes tmss based catalysts are usually employed as the electro fenton catalysts or cathode materials in addition the effect of water chemistryon the performance of these tmss based aops implied their universal applicability to complex water matrix most of the tmss based catalysts exhibited high reusabilityand stability in these aops towards target contaminant degradation despite great progress have been achieved in the field of tmss based aops some important issues still need to be further considered and addressed are as follows 1 there is a need to enhance the stability and reusability of tmss based heterogeneous catalysts although current studies have reported that the tmss based catalysts possess high catalytic performance in water purification the active components of the catalyst will inevitably be lost or poisoned after multiple cycles tests therefore for future development more optimized synthetic methods should be developed to prepare tmss based catalysts for example synthesis of tmss based catalysts under nanoconfinement defect engineering and selection of ultra high performance materials as the supporter besides the introduction of specific reducing agents or complexing agents into the aops should also be effective for enhancing the stability and reusability of tmss based catalysts 2 the transformation mechanisms ofboth surface and liquid phase sulfur species need to be deeply investigated since most previous studies only focus on the transformation of sulfur species on the surface of catalysts there is almost no concern about sulfur species in the liquid phase in further work the emphasis should be placed on the effect of the conversion mechanism of liquid phase sulfur species on the performance of tmss based aops system 3 there are few studies on the eco toxicity and kinetic model analysis of tmss based aops system dft computations can provide more in depth insights into the transformation of target pollutants and help us to accurately elucidate the catalytic active centers meanwhile the analysis of eco toxicity is favorable for establishing more environmentally friendly tmss based aops 4 more economical and efficient tmss based eaops are encouraged to be exploited at present studies on eaops mainly focus on iron containing tmss there is a data gap of iron free tmss based catalysts thus tmss based electrocatalysts containing different elements such as co sn cu ni cu are highly desired meanwhile the design of high performance electrode materials by the decoration of noble metal single atoms or carbon matrix as well as establish 3d electrocatalytic systems are feasible strategies to improve the catalytic activity of eaops 5 to date the study on tmss based catalysts is still at an early stage it is far from the large scale practical application in this regard priority can be given to the development of tmss based co catalytic systems additionally the combination of tmss based aops with other mature wastewater treatment technologies is also expected to be beneficial for the enhancement of practical applicability declaration of competing interest theauthorsdeclarethattheyhavenoknowncompeting financial interests or

17184,with the ever growing water pollution issues advanced oxidation processes aops have received growing attention due to their high efficiency in the removal of refractory organic pollutants transition metal sulfides tmss with excellent optical electrical and catalytical performance are of great interest as heterogeneous catalysts these tmss based heterogeneous catalysts have been demonstrated to becapable and adaptable in water purification through advanced oxidation processes the aim of this review is to conduct an exhaustive analysis and summary of recent progress in the

et al 2020 babu et al 2018 ji et al 2020a aops based on tmss and their derivates have gained tremendous attentiondue to their unique physicochemical properties as mentioned above in these oxidation processes heterogeneous catalysis induced by tmss based catalysts for water decontamination can be fulfilled with ease to the best of our knowledge there are numbered previous reviews about tmss based catalysts while they are mainly focus on electrochemical energy storage and photocatalysis for environmental remediation with an emphasize on the catalyst synthesis methods characterization techniques morphology and structure control despite the progress in heterogeneouscatalysis for water purification the study on tmss based aops is still in its infancy and the application of tmss based heterogeneous catalysts to treat contaminated water through aops have never been reviewed till now hence the present work intends to provide a timely overview of recent advances in wastewater treatment through tmss based aops firstly the properties regulation strategies of tmss based catalysts are briefly summarized following that the latest progress ontmss based aops for waterpurification is reviewed such as fenton like oxidation photocatalytic oxidation and electrochemical oxidation processes meanwhile the key water chemistry parameters affecting the catalytic performance of tmss based aops are elucidated namely ph temperature dissolved oxygen inorganic species and natural organic matter furthermore the reusability and stability of tmss based catalysts in aops wastewater treatment arepresented ultimately the conclusions and perspectives forfuture aops associated with tmss are proposed 2 strategies for tuning properties of tmss based catalysts the physicochemical properties e g optical electrical catalytical performance of tmss based catalysts are strongly related to their morphology and structure characteristics properties tuningstrategies for tmss based catalysts mainly include artificial size and shape control composition control doping and heterostructure manufacturing in the following part the commonly used strategies for regulating the properties of tmss based catalysts are presented 2 1 shape size and composition control fine adjustment of the physicochemical properties of tmss based catalysts can be achieved by simply controlling their shape size and composition for instance different sizes of cds nanocrystals ncs can be easily obtained by controlling the concentration of cd2 in dodecanethiol solvent zhuang et al 2011 it was found that the emission peaks of photoluminescence pl spectra were blue shifted as the decrease in the size of the cds ncs in the ultrasmall ncs the intensity of pl was reduced obviously due to the increased number of defects previous study revealed that the edge sites of mos2 were the active centresfor catalysis alonso et al 2002 kibsgaard and co workers reported that the morphology tuning of double gyroid mos2 with high surface curvature and high surface area as well as nanoscaled pores at nanoscale preferentially to expose more edge sites kibsgaard et al 2012 the extended three dimensional mesoporous mos2 network structure with a radius of curvature of nanoscale dimensions could significantly change the thermodynamic stabilities of different surface characters by imposing geometric constraints besides the use of silica template during the synthesis process offered the distinct advantage of ready integration into a device architecture for electrochemical application as a result the minimal diffusion limitation was realized and the activity of as obtained catalyst for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction her was highly promoted the density of active sites per surface area would be enhanced 2 4 times relative to nanowires as depicted in fig 1a however the size and shape control sometimes may result in the disappearance of quantum confinement effects and the appearance of the instability of extremely small tmss based catalysts shen et al 2011 observed a sharp emission peak at 471 nm and a broad emission tail at 622 nm in the pl spectra of cds nanorods which were derived from band edge emission and the sulfur vacancies in cds ncs respectively the pl spectra of cds quantum dots qds and cds nanorods were similar in shape while both two center peaks were red shifted from 471 nm to 489 nm and from 622 nm to 650 nm respectively due to the typical quantum size effect since the diameter increased from 5 7 nm to 7 5 nm the stability of structural phase and morphologies of the as prepared tmss based catalysts was closely related to the precursor capping ligands and reaction temperature chakraborty et al 2019 pointed out the presence of different morphology and phase of obtained cu3bis3 nanospheres and nanoflowers could be attributed to the capping effect on the ncs surface induced by oleylamine and 1 dodecanethiol the current voltage i v measurements indicated that both films of different shapes possessed the potential as absorber layers in solar cells while the nanoflower shaped cu3bis3 thin film displayed higher dark current value in comparison with nanosphere shaped ones since its larger particle and crystallite size as well as the decreased grain boundary resistance could reduce electron scattering moreover a high thermoelectric figure of merit zt value of 0 21 was gained at 573 k by increasing the carrier concentration and reducing the lattice thermal conductivity through reducing s content of cufes2 x compound to 1 8 li et al 2013 during the process the phase would vary from tetragonal to cubic gradually accompanied by the refinement of crystal grains besides the exposed facets of the ncs are also important factors affecting the photocatalytic performance of the ncs liu et al 2019 found thevariation of surface ligands and gallium precursors could adjust the morphology of wurtzite cugas2 cgs nanoplates from one dimensional 1d to two dimensional 2d fig 1b c it was verified that the 001 plane facilitated the charge transport based on the theoretical calculation results among these samples the 2d cgs nanoplates exhibited the most satisfactory photocatalytic performance under simulated solar illumination since the higher percentage of exposed 001 facet provided more photo generated electrons as compared to 100 facet besides the 001 facet has some metal properties while the 100 facet remained the semiconductornature which was favorable for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution apart from the common one component tmss the multi nary tmss can be obtained by alloying different metal elements which are expected to display moredistinct structures with tunable optical electrical and catalytic properties balamurugan et al 2017 bhattacharyya and pandey 2016 xu et al 2019 among these alloyed tmss 2d cuco2s4 nanosheets nss band gap e g 2 24 ev induced the formation of highly opened 3d hierarchical architecture to expose most of the surface which endowed them potential abilities to absorb the entire visible light for water splitting reactions and the apparent quantum yield aqy reached to 2 48 chauhan et al 2019 the indirect band gap of cuco2s4 nss alleviated the fast charge recombination moreover cuco2s4 nss possessed a high surface area 62 9 m2 g 1 and donor concentration 7 22 1018 cm 3 as well as a highly populated density of states at the fermi level which were favorable for the adsorption of h on s sites to convert to h2 therefore cuco2s4 nss can be utilized as an efficient photocatalyst for water splitting reactions bhattacharyya and pandey 2016 found that cufes2 qds with tetragonal chalcopyrite structure displayed a tunable band gap in the range of 0 5 2 ev 600 2500 nm and the pl quantum yields qys exceeded 80 the precise control of the qds band gap and particle size could be achieved by slow injection of sulfur and adopted a lower reaction temperature 180 c ternary alloyed tmss consist of earth abundant and eco friendly elements that are also of great interest for energy harvesting and environmental remediation for example cu2znsns4 is an abundant and low toxicity semiconductor material with a direct band gap of 1 5 ev holding great promise for dye sensitized solar cells dsscs xin et al 2011 chen et al 2016 obtained a high power conversion efficiency pce of 7 09 by using leaf like czts plate arrays plar as the pt free counter electrode ce the outstanding performance of dsscs might benefit from their high catalyticsurface area fast photo generated electron transport remarkable catalytic ability towards the i3 electrolyte and the high diffusion coefficient of the i3 moreover the properties of multi nary tmss can be modulated by changing the stoichiometries of anion cation constituents in anion cation alloyed tmss yu et al 2012 reported the synthesis of single crystal like porous cdxzn1 xs nanosheets by a facile cation exchange strategy the pore size of cdxzn1 xs can be controlled by changing the solvent and the cd0 5zn0 5s was fabricated with the molar ratio of zns diethylenetriamine deta cd2 1 2 in water 10 50 nm the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra of porous cd0 5zn0 5s nanosheetsshifted to longer wavelengths and the absorption region was much steeper and higher in comparison with the cd0 5zn0 5s nanorods due to its narrower band gap and stronger absorption ability of photons the porous single crystal like structure was quite favorable for the photocatalytic h2 generation mi and co authors synthesized large scale 3d hierarchical nixco3 xs4 x 0 15 0 42 microflowers by adjusting the co ni atomic ratios and used them as electrode materials for supercapacitors fig 1d mi et al 2014 as shown in fig 1e f the ni0 42co2 5s4 microflowers exhibited optimal discharge capacitance value 321 4 f g 1 a current density of 0 5 a g 1 and a higher degree of reversibility 97 for 1000 cycles at 2 a g 1 the high surface area resulted from the hierarchical microsphere and the elevated level of nickel ratio afforded sufficient electrolyte electrode interface for fast diffusion and reaction thus leading to the enhanced electrochemical performance of nixco3 xs4 microflowers kato et al 2015 reported that the highly active cuga 1 xzn2xs2 e g 2 2 ev upon forming a solid solution between cugas2 and zns which could serve as a promising h2 evolving photocatalyst in the presence of sacrificial reagents s2 and so3 2 the aqy of h2 evolution over the optimized ru loaded cuga 0 8zn0 4s2 up to 3 0 under 420 nm of monochromatic light irradiation the higher activity of cuga 1 xzn2xs2 solid solution relative to cugas2 was attributed to the higher level conduction bands of zn in general the physicochemical properties of tmss based catalysts can be well controlled by tunning their shape size and composition the design of tmss based catalysts in special shape specific flower like hollow hierarchical microsphere and 3d hierarchical architecture etc usually tends to expose more active sites which may result in an enhancement in their optical electrical catalytical performance to some extent the tmss based catalysts with high surface area and abundant pores hold great promise for efficient photocatalysis electrocatalysis and fenton like catalysis besides the preferential exposure of highly active facets and preparation of multi nary tmss are also regarded as effective strategies to obtain desired materials besides the preferential exposure of highly active facets and preparation of multi nary tmss as well as alter the edge site populations also have been confirmed as effective strategies to obtain desired materials 2 2 doping the method of doping also opens up new possibilities for developing advanced materials with tunable properties zhang and co workers demonstrated that the monolayered fe doped ws2 with lateral sizes of 100 µm synthesized using different concentrations of precursor solutions fecl3 exhibited various morphologies such as triangular hexagons and irregular shapes zhang et al 2020c the raman spectra of highly doped fe doped ws2 presented a red shift of 1 cm 1 compared with pristine ws2 which were resulted from the lattice strain and charge doping effects of fe dopants the deep level defect states induced by fe dopant would result in non radiative recombination of photoexcited carriers and further lead to a uniform pl quenching phenomenon in the entire fe doped ws2 flake lai et al 2019 revealed that the fe doped nico2s4 nanosheets wrapped on n s doped ordered mesoporous carbon fe nico2s4 n s cmk 3 delivered reinforced specific capacitance of 197 8 f g 1 and higher stable cycling which were remarkably superior to those of the nico2s4 n s cmk 155 2 f g 1 and fenico2s4 cmk 3 135 9 f g 1 the doping of fe led to the formation of abundant electron enriched ni and coatoms which were potential high energyadsorption sites for ionic liquid ions the presence of abundant open pore volume among neighboring fe nico2s4 nanosheets and the stronger interaction between the fe nico2s4 nanosheets and the conductive carbon host n s cmk 3 were favorable for the capture of ionic liquid consequently theionic liquid polarization effect and transportation ability from fe nico2s4 surface and n s cmk 3 structure were remarkably enhanced xie et al 2017 studied the thermoelectric properties of zn doped cu1 xznxfes2 x 0 0 1 compounds and found that zn can function as an effective donor to increase the carrier concentration and enhance the thermoelectric properties of cufes2 zn doping and zns nanoparticles wereeffective in scattering acoustic phonons with the increase of zn content a fraction of zn atoms in situ generated znsnanoparticles in the matrix which induced an interface thermalresistance and decreased the lattice thermal conductivity on the contrary the carrier concentration and the electricalconductivity enhanced with increasing zn content the highest zt value was measured to be 0 26 at 630 k for cu0 92zn0 08fes2 which was about 80 higher than that of the pristine cufes2 the commonly used doping methods such as substitutional doping during growth ion implantation plasma treatment might inevitably lead to the deformation of tmss crystal structure and the introduction of ionized impurity scattering as well as the reduction of charge mobility conversely the adverse effect of ionized impurities could be eliminated and the mobility and carrier concentration could be well maintained by modulation doping people and bean 1984 xu et al 2017a reported the synthesis of n doped and p doped of mos2 by tio2 and moo3 respectively pl and electrical studies of layer dependent heterostructured composites suggested that the interlayer interaction between tio2 moo3 layers and mos2 surface was very weak thus the lattice strain to mos2 was ignorable the increase of negative trion x peak pl was caused by the increased electron density of mos2 khan and co authors demonstrated a route for significantly enhancing the thermoelectric properties of cucr2s4 by sb doping khan et al 2017 the band structure calculations of cucr2 xsbxs4 models verified that the introduction of sb shifted the material toward the semiconductor side and offered extra electrons to fill some of the holes in the valence bands thus resulting in an enhanced seebeck coefficient and a reduced magnetic moment the material was quite stable even the temperature was up to 650 c the highest zt value was found to be 0 43 with an sb content of x 0 3 at 650 c it was wang and co workers found that the h2 production performance of bi cd and ti doped cds cds composites was superior to undoped cds cds sample especially for bicds cds composite wang et al 2019 the bi cds cds showed the weakest pl peak than other metals doped cds cds samples and the h2 evolution rate of bi cds cds 1 77 mmol h g was verified to be 5 2 times and almost 2 times that of pure cds and undoped cds cds respectively since bi doping could endow efficient electron transfer from cds to bi cds as shown in fig 2a however controllable doping of aliovalent impurities in ncs is very challenging another available doping approach through vacancy formation is developed the vacancies in the doped ncs act as free holes and manifest p type doped material properties with a localized surface plasmon resonance lspr feature appearing in the near infrared nir doping by copper vacancy formation occurs readily because of the low chemical potential and high mobility of copper ions the cu2 xs ncs with tunable plasmonic properties were prepared via cu2s and i2 involved redox process by varying the ratios of iodine to copper inchloroform elimelech et al 2017 the plasma response peak intensity of cu2 xs ncs increased significantly with the elevation of the i cu ratio and accompanied by blue shift owing to the increase of the free hole concentration fig 2b c gao et al 2020 successfully prepared chalcopyrite derived naxmo2 m cu fe mn composites by modulating the impurities si and ca that came from chalcopyrite in the self doping process offering the p2 and o3 type products with improved cycling stability andbetter rate capability li and co authors demonstrated that the properly introduction of sulfur vacancies and elastic strain of monolayer 2h mos2 yield the optimal hydrogen adsorption free energy δgh 0 ev with a high turnover frequency per s vacancy site tofs vacancy 0 31 s 1 at 0 v versus rhe which endowed the molybdenum sulfide based catalyst with unprecedented intrinsic her activity li et al 2016b appropriately increase of s vacancies and the offer of tensile strain would lead the bands to move closer to the fermi level and increase the number of gap states thereby increasing the adsorption strength on the s vacancy site and the active site density the above method of combining vacancies with elastic strain was also suitable for other 2d materials to generate new active sites 2 3 heterostructure manufacturing heterostructured tmss are of considerable interest for applications in catalysis and photonics because of the improvement of the physicochemical properties and the synergistic interactions between different components for instance the quantum efficiency qe at 420 nm of optimized nis cds photocatalyst obtained by hydrothermally loaded nis 1 2 mol on cds surface was measured to be 51 3 zhang et al 2010a the h2 evolution rate was boosted approximately 10 times fairly high up to 0 66 mmol h 1 in contrast to the pure cds meanwhile the hierarchical co9s8 znin2s4 tubular heterostructures have been synthesized by growing 2d znin2s4 nanosheets on 1d hollow co9s8 nanotubes zhang et al 2020a compared with pure znin2s4 tubular heterostructured co9s8 znin2s4 possessed a larger surface and exposed abundant catalytical active sites more importantly the unique hollow structure of co9s8 znin2s4 could ensure multiple light reflection scattering in the cavity and effectively promote the interfacial separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons holes thereby offering an excellent h2 generation rate of 9039 µmol h 1g 1 in the absence of any co catalysts fig 2d almost 100 reduction of crvi was achieved in 45 min using 10 co9s8 znin2s4 asa photocatalyst and exhibited high stable reusabilityafter multiple photocatalytic cycles fig 2e f it was also uncovered that the photocatalytic activity of self assembled zns nixsy heterojunctions in eosin b removal and hydrogen generation was superior to those of single component zns and nixsy sovann khana 2020 the band position measurements and density functional theory dft simulations indicated that nixsy functioned as a co catalyst for zns besides nico2s4 rgo hybrid composite with reinforced rate capacity and high cycling stability of 95 capacitance retention 8000 cycles 5 a g 1 were synthesized by fan et al 2017 the superior electrochemical performance of hybrid electrode was benefited from the hierarchical and porous architectures and synergistic effect between nico2s4 and rgo however the poor interfacial contact between graphene and tmss may hamper their capacitance and stability of hybrid supercapacitors to overcome this drawback phytic acid pa was used as a chelating agent to assist the connection between rgo and nico2s4 nps which could not only influence the morphology and size of nico precursor prgo but also enhanced the interfacial contact between rgo and nico2s4 zheng et al 2018 cation incorporation and exchange processes are most commonly used in heterogeneous nanostructures construction liu et al 2018c reported that the incorporation of divalent cations generated heterogeneous nanoplatelet npls or entirely new binary npls through anisotropic cation exchange in the presence of dodecanethiol ddt and covellite cus npl templates such as cds cu2 xs zns cu2 xs cu0 4zn0 2in0 4s and cu2znsns4 czts npls the conflicts between valence and coordination number of divalent cations could result in the generation of heterogeneousnanostructures for example treatment of cu2 xs using zn2 and cd2 consistently produced cu2 xs zns cds heterostructures while the incorporation of trivalent cations in3 ga3 and fe3 or tetravalent cations sn4 and ge4 produced homogeneous ternary ncs by using cu2 xs as a template and their morphologies were consistent with cu2 xs liu et al 2018b liu et al 2018c macroporous rgo wrapped co9s8 qd was homogenously embedded within a mesoporous hollow carbon polyhedral hcp to obtain the sponge like composites co9s8 qd hcp rgo with superior reversible capacity and exceptional rate behavior chen et al 2017 the double confined nanospace induced by coupled rgo could effectively hamper co9s8 agglomeration and enlarge the lattice parameters of co9s8 crystals thereby promoting the electrochemical performance for sodium storage moreover the double helix structured carrageenan metal hydrogels derived from seaweed biomass were applied to fabricate 3d metal sulfide nanostructure carbon aerogels cas composite daohao li 2016 the unique aerogel structure of as synthesized fes ca endowed itself splendid sodium ion storage performance reversible capacity of 280 ma h g 1 after 200 cycles and rate performance of 222 ma h 1 at 5 a g 1 the presence of ca accelerated charge transfer reaction and promoted the mechanical performance of fes nps as well as buffered the volume changes during the discharge process 3 tmss based advanced oxidation processes the ever growing water pollutionintrigue people to seek efficient and environmentally friendly wastewater treatment technologies a variety of tmss based heterogeneous catalysts have beenfound to be effective for wastewater treatment by different available aops in this part of review the catalytic performance and mechanism of typical tms based aops comprisingfenton like oxidation photocatalytic oxidation and electrochemical oxidation processes are discussed in detail 3 1 fenton like oxidation studies on the chemical oxidants e g ozone o3 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and persulfate s2o8 2 activation by tmss based catalysts have shown that diverse ros can be well generated for efficient water purification in these aops the extensive application of tmss based catalysts in fenton like oxidation toremove organic pollutants is presented in table 1 some earth abundant sulfide minerals can serve asheterogeneous catalysts for efficient degradation of organic contaminants for instance pyrite fes2 exhibited great efficiency for pms activation to degrade and mineralize diethyl phthalate dep zhou et al 2018 in the pms fes2 system different sulfur species were generated from theoxidation of sulfides caused by fe iii and pms among them s2 2 played a vital role in fe ii regeneration and so3 2 was the mainsulfur species committed to pms activation to generate so4 in a recent study by he et al 2021b fes2 was also applied to activate peroxydisulfate pds for the efficient removal of cr vi and2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp simultaneously the disintegration of 2 4 dcp was mainly attributedto the activation of pds by fes2 while the reduction ability of pyrite principally contributed to the removal of cr vi so4 was identified as the predominant oxidative species responsible for the oxidation of 2 4 dcp based on the experiments and dft calculation results fe was verified to be the dominant catalytic site and the reductive sulfur species on the surface of pyrite acted as donors to mediate the cycle of fe2 fe3 meanwhile ferrous sulfide fes ore particles were also considered as an effective fenton like catalyst for the degradation of pchloroaniline pca yuan et al 2015 almost all pca was degraded and 99 of pca wasmineralized in fes ps system the excellent performance was ascribed tothe supply and maintenance of appropriatefe2 concentrations which avoided the excess fe3 accumulated to produce iron hydr oxides and was beneficial to the radical chain reactions apart from iron containing sulfide minerals the natural cus mineral was also proposed as an alternative electron donor to activate ps and 91 6 atrazine atz removal was achieved in 40 min under acidic ph peng et al 2018 pirgalıoğlu and özbelge 2009 investigated the cus o3 system for the treatment of different aqueous single dye solutions it was also found that the catalytic activity of copperions in the solution enhanced the toc removal efficiency and the decomposition of ozone into oh besides the mineral chalcopyrite cufes2 based pms activation process was established for bisphenol s bps degradation peng et al 2020 under the experimental conditions ca 83 0 of bps was removed and 30 5 of bps wasmineralized which was attributed to the promoted fe3 fe2 and cu2 cu redox cycles on the cufes2 surface induced by reductive sulfur species the activation of chemical oxidants by inexpensive and readily available sulfide minerals provided great benefitsfor the application of tmss based aops in remediation of contaminated water nevertheless sometimes natural sulfide minerals are large sized and low purity may constrain their catalytic activity to overcomethis drawback different artificially synthesized tmss based catalysts with highly desirable physicochemical properties were deemed as the alternative heterogeneous catalysts for water decontamination liu and co authors conducted a comparative study using hydrothermal synthesized fes2 syn fes2 and commercial pyrite com fes2 to catalyze h2o2 decomposition for alachlor degradation liu et al 2015 it was revealed that the alachlor degradation rate of syn fes2 h2o2 fenton system 99 was much higher than that of com fes2 h2o2 system 8 at initial ph of 6 2 due to its higher surface area and the improved molecular oxygen activation caused by more surface bound ferrous ions on the surface of syn fes2 fig 3a themechanism for the enhanced fenton oxidation in the syn fes2 system was shown in fig 3b first the fe ii released from fes2 would react with h2o2 to produce oh and fe iii thenalachlor may be directly oxidized and mineralized by the generated oh although the formation of fe hydroxocomplexes on the surface of fes2 was unfavorable for the further reaction themolecular oxygen could be activated by surface bound ferrous ions on the syn fes2 through a single electrontransfer pathway to generate o2 accompanied by the reduction of surface bound ferric ions consequently the efficient fe ii fe iii cycle in the syn fes2 h2o2 system could provide enough surface fe ii for the fenton reaction to generate more oh thus promoting the alachlor degradation the cos2 x obtained by ultrasonic treatment of commercial cos2 cos2 com can also be innovatively employed as a reagent for o2 activation to sustainably release1o2 ji et al 2020b the ultrasonic treatment induced the reduction of oxidesand the pairing of a great number of single electrons on cos2 x surface epr tests suggested that the cos2 com possesseda strong sulfur defect peak at g 2 004 while it disappeared after ultrasonic treatment the newly appeared weak defect peak at g 1 996 represented co defect thus enabled a certain degree of reducibility of cos2 x surface fig 3c 1o2 was verified to be the prominent ros generated bythe cos2 1 5 h fe2 system supplemented by a small quantityof o2 and oh as illustrated in fig 3d the presence of reductive electronpairs at the sdefects could reduce o2 to generate o2 h2o2 through a one two electron process on the surfaceof cos2 1 5 h eqs 1 2 then the o2 was then quickly oxidized to 1o2 with the assist of co4 co3 exposed on the surface of cos2 1 5 h eq 3 besides fe2 could also reduce oxygen to o2 eq 4 thus greatly increasing the concentration of o2 in thesolution meanwhile a large number of fe2 would transform into fe3 and become easier to adsorb and deposit onthe surface of cos2 1 5 h the electron rich surface of cos2 1 5 h promoted the circulation of fe3 fe2 leading to the decomposition of h2o2 eqs 5 6 moreover the capture of o2 also acceleratedthe conversion of fe2 to fe3 thus facilitating theadsorption and deposition of fe3 as well as the decomposition ofh2o2 consequently the generation of the strongestoxidizing oh would be accelerated 1o2 as the main ros was the keyfactor for potential long term effective degradation nearly 100 removal of rhodamine b rhb methyl orange mo phenol and sulfadiazine sd could be achieved in cos2 1 5 h fe2 system under optimal reaction conditions surprising after 30 days the recovery rate of cos2 1 5 h fe2 system was calculated to be 65 which was much higher than those in cos2 1 5 h fe3 52 cos2 1 5 h 39 andcupx 30 furthermore over 96 0 cod removal rate of the nitrobenzene containingactual wastewater by the cos2 1 5 h fe2 system was observed and the use of activated carbonblocked the ion content to a very lowconcentration fig 3e the above results demonstrated the huge potential of cos2 x for the selective long term degradationof organic pollutants in addition mos2 could act as a versatile activator for both pms and ps activation to generate so4 and oh towardscarbamazepine cbz degradation zhou et al 2020a the free diffusion so4 was verified to be the responsible ros in mos2 pms system while surface bound and free diffusion so4 coexisted in the mos2 ps system 1 o2 e defect o2 2 o2 2e defect h2o2 3 o2 co4 co3 1o2 co2 4 fe3 e defect fe2 5 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh 6 fe2 o2 fe3 o2 moreover the multicomponent tmss based catalysts are expected to show moreexcellent catalytic activities than one component ones due to the tandem synergistic effect among different metal ionsand the electron donating effect of reductive sulfur on the cycle of redox couples for example nie et al 2019 reported that the cufes2 pms system was efficient to degrade bpa in this case almost completely bpa removal and 75 toc mineralization were achieved in 20 min which was superior to those in cu2s pms and fes fes2 pms systems they pointed out the as prepared cufes2 nanoparticles possessed abundant surface bound cu and fe2 and the presence of sulfur species played a vital role in enhancing the cycling of cu2 cu and fe3 fe2 as demonstrated in fig 3f cu and fe2 on cufes2 surface activated hso5 to generate so4 and oh eqs 7 8 the regenerated fe2 active sites by the electron transfer from cu to fe3 andthereductive sulfur species induced the continuous formation of ros eqs 9 15 meanwhile the hydrothermal fabricated spinel sulfide carrollite cuco2s4 with high catalytic activity and stability was applied to the activation of pms for the degradation of bisphenol s bps xu et al 2018a it was verified that the neutral ph condition was most favorable for the degradation of bps and the synergistic surface redox couples of cu ii cu i and co iii co ii played a vital role in the catalytic activation of pms to produce so4 quenching experiments and epr studyindicated so4 was the dominant oxidant species for bps elimination apart from binary metal sulfides ternary alloyed cu2fesns4 cfts was also considered as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for pms inducedoxidation more recently kong and his colleagues innovatively synthesized a flower like ternary cu2fesns4 cfts nanomaterial and employed it as the activator of ps for the removal of bpa kong et al 2019 the developed oxidation system exhibited outstanding decontamination potential over a wide ph range of 3 10 in comparison with the monometallic cu fe sn sulfides systems in the czts ps system cu i was oxidized to cu ii accompaniedby the formation of so4 and oh the reduction of fe iii caused by cu i was thermodynamicallylikely to be realized which was more favorable for the redox cycle of fe iii fe ii therefore the synergetic effect between cu i and fe iii wasconductive to the interfacial electron transfer it was also revealed that the fe ii species generated by the complexation of fe ii by the sp3 hybridized s on the surface of cfts played an important role in the tandem synergistic effect among cu fe and sn in their quaternary chalcogenide systems upon ps activation eqs 16 19 the radical quenching tests and esr measurementssuggested that both oh and so4 contributed to the bpa degradation through a surface catalytic process oh produced by so4 oxidize h2o oh was the dominantradicals responsible for bpa removal 7 cu hso5 cu2 so4 oh 8 fe2 hso5 fe3 so4 oh 9 so4 oh so4 2 oh 10 so4 h2o so4 2 oh h 11 2s2 2cu2 fe3 2cu fe2 s2 2 12 2s2 2 2cu2 fe3 2cu fe2 sn

have been devoted to these tmss based heterogeneous catalysts there are still some deficiencies that need to be further improved typically poor dispersion and minimized surface active sites as well as massive metal ions leaching problemsquite impeded their widespread applications therefore the stability and reusability ofthe fenton like catalysts are highly desired for example li et al 2020b reported that the feco2s4 modified g c3n4 feco2s4 g c3n4 composite was promising for pms activation towards sulfamethoxazole smx degradation in the case of feco2s4 cn pms system 91 9 of smx removal was achieved which was higher than those of feco2s4 pms 60 1 g c3n4 pms 17 8 and pms alone 14 3 systems owing to the synergistic effects between feco2s4 and g c3n4 fig 4a under optimal experimental conditions the concentration of leached metal ions in feco2s4 cn pms systems 0 068 mg l co and 0 03 mg l fe was also lower than those in feco2s4 pms and co3s4 cn pms systems sincethe complexation of metal ions by g c3n4 and the synergistic effect between fe and co ions were conductive to inhibit the excessive metal ions leaching xu et al 2019 uncovered that the al2o3 supported cufes2 catalyst al2o3 cufes2 exhibited highcatalytic activity in activating peroxymonocarbonate pmc to degrade 2 4 dcp in the flowing experiment using fixed bed reactor almost completely removal of 2 4 dcp 99 was obtained over the first 10 h of running even after a long period of operation 216 h the removal efficiency of 2 4 dcp in the effluents was still up to 96 with a low and safe level of cu fe and s species leaching tong et al 2020 fabricated a magnetic fe3o4 deposited flower like mos2 mf composite for h2o2 activation to degrade diclofenac dcf due to the larger synergy effect between fe3o4 and mos2 the catalytic activity of mf composite was superior to fe3o4 mos2 and the physical mixture of fe3o4 and mos2 the presence of mos2 was verified to facilitate the conversion cycle of fe iii fe ii by exposed mo iv and the generated ooh thus improving the generation of oh moreover mf with a saturation magnetization of 40 6 emu g 1 could be easily recycled and exhibited excellent catalytic ability towards sanitary sewage additionally diao and co authors found that fes2 sio2 microsphere presented excellent ciprofloxacin cip decomposing ability in the presence of h2o2 even after seven reused cycles 75 7 diao et al 2017 both the increased adsorption ability resulted from more available active sites on the surfaces of sio2 microspheres and the smoothly continuous fenton reaction induced by controlling the release of aqueous fe2 from fes2 accounted for the promoted degradation of cip in fes2 sio2 h2o2 system ohads was proved to be the major ros responsible for cipelimination moreover tmss can act as excellent co catalysts to accelerate the rate limiting step of the fenton like process through exposed reductive metallic active sites diao and chu 2021 liu et al 2018a luo et al 2020 sheng et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 xing et al 2018 reported that the introduction of commercial 2h type mos2 significantly accelerated the cycleof fe3 fe2 and boosted the decomposition of h2o2 by 47 2 as well as greatly reduced the consumption of h2o2 0 4 mmol l and fe2 0 07 mmol l specifically the k obs value of rhodamine b degradation increased by 18 5 times as compared with the conventional fenton system the mechanism of the mos2 co catalytic fenton system was shown in fig 4b firstly the unsaturated s atoms on the surface of mos2 would capture protons from the solution to produce h2s subsequently theexposed mo4 enable to reduce fe3 to fe2 accompanied by the formation of mo6 eqs 20 21 after that mo6 was further reduced to mo4 with the assistance of h2o2 to ensure the catalytic cycling of mos2 eq 22 additionally in order to overcome the shortcomings of being difficult to recycle and reuse of the 2d mos2 a low cost sponge mos2 go smg 3d composite co catalytic aopsystem was further established by xing s group zhu et al 2020 as shownin fig 4c f thesponge was successfully loaded with mos2 and go and its original network skeleton was fully maintained simultaneously the raman spectra of smg manifested the presence of more surfacedefects which was expected to expose more metal active sites thus greatly enhanced the aops activity furthermore it was pointed out that the exposedmo4 active sites on 3d mos2 could greatly boost theconcentration and stability of fe2 in aops as well as maintain the circulation of iron ions ina stable dynamic cycle fig 4g thereby enhancing the activation ofh2o2 pms similarly a significant co catalytic effect of ws2 on thedecomposition of h2o2 in the photo assisted fenton system was also observed dong et al 2018c the rate limiting step of fe3 fe2 conversion could be significantly accelerated by the exposed reductive w4 active sites on the surface of ws2 which was beneficialto the reduction of cr vi 40 mg l the ws2 co catalytic fenton system could increase the correspondingdegradation rate of phenol and reduction rate of cr vi by 28 9 and 59 9 respectively 20 fe3 mo4 fe2 mo6 21 fe3 h2o2 fe3 o2h h 22 mo6 h2o2 mo4 h2o o2 in a word both natural sulfur containing ores and synthesized materials can be used as fenton like catalysts for chemical oxidants activation e g h2o2 o3 pds and pms towards target pollutants degradation due to the synergistic effect among different metal pairs the catalytic activity of multi nary tmss is generally superior to those of one component ones the stability and reusability of tmss based catalysts can be improved by preparing composite materials based on the above discussion the general catalytic mechanisms of tmss based fenton like systems are proposed scheme 1 metal ions released from tmss can effectively activate chemical oxidants to produce corresponding ros oh so4 1o2 o2 etc the reductive sulfur on their surface can function as an electron donor to promote the cycling of m n 1 mn thereby continuously inducing the fenton like reaction to generate ros for enhanced degradation of target contaminants 3 2 photocatalytic oxidation due to the capability of absorbing visible and or uv light narrow optical bandgaps and charge transport characteristics tmss and their derivatives are regarded as promising candidates for photocatalytic water decontamination the optical properties of tmss based photocatalysts and their applications in wastewater treatment are summarized in table 2 for instance cds sub microspheres with 0 5 µm size possessed a low band gap of 2 26 ev showing potential applications in photodegradation of acetaminophen and levofloxacin al balushi et al 2018 about 85 of acetaminophen and 70 of levofloxacin were removed by visible light irradiation for 4 h respectively fes2 photo fenton system was found to be highly active inphotodegradation of p nitrophenol pnp and completely pnp removal could be achieved within 4 min which was much faster than that of fes2 h2o2 system zeng et al 2019 the improved activity was owing to the accelerated cyclic conversion between fe2 and fe3 under visible light irradiation moreover the 3d hierarchical cu2fesns4 cfts microspheres were explored as an effective photocatalyst for the photodegradation of rhb and about 73 of the dye could be degraded after visible light irradiation for 180 min zhong et al 2015 additionally kush et al 2015 demonstrated the applications of surfactant free cu2znsns4 czts nanoparticles as a multifunctional heterogeneous catalyst for hydrogen oxygen evolution dye degradation and cr vi reduction reactions as depicted in fig 5 a the presence of quintessential oh at the surface of the hydrophilic czts was capable of extracting holes from the czts valence band leading to the rapid production of a great deal of oh and photocatalytic degradation of rhb fig 5b c as for the reduction of cr vi the photogenerated excitons and electrons were transferred to the conduction band of czts accompanied by the capture of excited electrons induced by the adsorbed cr vi complex on the surface of czts simultaneously eqs 23 25 consequently a notable reduction efficiency of cr vi up to 99 8 was observed in 15 minutes with a visible color change of the cr complex solution fig 5d f 23 czts hv ecb h vb 24 cr vi adsczts 3ecb cr iii adsczts 25 cr iii adsczts cr vi cr iii cr vi adsczts numerous studies have revealed that the optical properties and the recombination of charge carriers strongly depended on the shape and crystalline structure of the tmss based photocatalysts for example su et al 2016 compared the photocatalytic activity of znin2s4 samples prepared in different media water ethanol methanol and ethylene glycol among these samples znin2s4 synthesized in ethanol solvent was confirmed to exhibit the best photocatalytic activity which was mainly ascribed to the exposure level of 0001 special facets shenoy and co authors used different morphologies of cds as a probe to explore the influence of morphology 1d nanorods 2d nanosheets and 3d hierarchical on the photocatalytic activity towards erioglaucine eg degradation shenoy et al 2019 it was found that the photocatalytic performance of 3d cds was superior to those of 1d and 2d cds in the photodegradation of eg since its high crystallinity with single crystalline property prevented bulk electron hole pair from recombining moreover the numerousphotocatalytic active sites provided by hierarchical 3d structure promoted the mobility of photogenerated charge carriers quenching tests confirmed that e and o2 were the prevailing ros responsible for the photodegradation of eg chen et al 2012 studied the effect of surface facet on photocatalytic performance for dye degradation it was elucidated that the hexagonal znin2s4 microspheres presented a higher photocatalytic activity in cationic dyes degradation relative to cubic znin2s4 nanoparticles since the hexagonal znin2s4 microspheres consisted of nanolamella petals with 0001 negatively charged s plane which was not only beneficial to the adsorption of cationic dyes via n et 2 groups but also could accumulate the photogenerated holes thereby resulting in higher demethylation efficiency specifically almost 100 demethylation of mb was observed in 5 h over hexagonal znin2s4 microspheres while only ca 46 demethylation of mb was over cubic znin2s4nanoparticles table 3 however most single photocatalysts can only utilize one kind of useful charge carrier to overcome this shortcoming heterojunction photocatalysts were further developed to ensure a broad light absorption range and realize charge separation by separating the electrons and holes to different semiconductors the tmss based heterojunctions have been extensively studiedfor water decontamination to date the widelyinvestigated heterojunctions including type ii heterojunctions rai et al 2015 direct z scheme heterojunctions jiao et al 2019 p n heterojunctions zhou et al 2020b surface heterojunctions li et al 2019b and semiconductor graphene heterojunctions li et al 2011 which were verified to be efficient for improving the photocatalytic performance for instance the go g c3n4 mos2 gcm with ternary layered nanostructures was utilized as an effective photocatalyst for water purification wu et al 2018a it possessed more adsorption and response sites due to the dual effects of 1 methyl 2 pyrrolidinone nmp and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab thus showing great potential in photodegradation of mb rhb crystal violet cv and the photocatalytic reduction of cr vi specifically the sample gcm 7 contains ctab 0 07 g displayed the best photocatalytic performance for the removal of mb thedegradation efficiencies of those composites followed the order below gcm 7 cn mos2 go mos2 implying the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of the ternary gcm heterojunctions the schematic illustration of the photocatalytic process and charge transfer mechanisms in the go g c3n4 mos2 composites was shown in fig 5g the photo induced electrons can transport from the cb of g c3n4 to the cb of mos2 inducing the reduction of cr vi likewise the holes from the vb of mos2 were transferred to the vb of g c3n4 to reduce the compound charge and accumulate abundant electrons in the cb of g c3n4 the internal electron regions of gcm 7 played an irreplaceable role in charge migration between g c3n4 and mos2 leading to the improved photocatalytic performance by virtue of the shorter charge transfer path and superior electrical conductivity of go electron hole recombination was significantly limited the highly dispersed mos2 on the go g c3n4 substrate offered more photocatalytic active sites for the degradation of target contaminants therefore it was expected that the photocatalytic performance by go g c3n4 mos2 composites was significantly improved ren et al 2018 utilized 3d cofe2o4 mos2 heterojunctions as high efficiency photocatalyst for the removal of organic dyes the as obtained composites with 50 molar ratio of mos2 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity towards congo red cr degradation up to 94 9 with a rate constant 0 04413 min 1 which was much superior to pure mos2 the excellent photocatalytic activity of the cofe2o4 mos2 heterojunction was benefited from the synergistic effect of cofe2o4 nanorods and flower like mos2 nanosheets efficient light harvesting ability and the enhanced separation of photogenerated charge carriers at the heterojunctions interface in recent years tmss based type ii heterojunctions and z scheme heterojunctions are most widely used for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants for example cus bifeo3 cus bfo type ii heterojunction was exploited for photocatalytic oxidation of alachlor pesticide achieving 95 degradation and 92 mineralization of alachlor within 60 min with illumination bhoi and mishra 2018 the formation of heterojunctions resulted in a fermi level equilibrium and the band positions of both semiconductors were rearranged thus facilitating the transformation of electrons holes between cus and bfo as a result the as obtained heterojunctions possessed outstanding visible light absorption and charge carrier separation characteristics in comparison with the individual components the mechanistic investigation proved that the concerted effect of vb holes and oh contributed to the efficient oxidation of alachlor the activation of h2o2 at the cb of bifeo3 and the photocatalytic decomposition of h2o at vb lead to the generation of oh meanwhile the vb holes of cus also function as potential oxidizers consequently these transient substances unitedly contributed to the degradation of alachlor on the surface of cus bifeo3 heterojunctions besides the magnetic iron oxide io was introduced into cds qds to constructing type ii heterojunctions the combination of io and cds induced a red shift in absorption edge an enhancement of electron hole pairs lifetimes and a decreased optical band gap it was found that the hole and oh played a critical role in the enhanced photocatalytic degradation of xylenol blue similarly das et al 2019 demonstrated that the cus bi4ti3o12type ii p n heterojunctions could act as an effective photocatalyst for photodegradation of 2 methyl 4 chlorophenoxyacetic acid herbicide mcpa the cus bi4ti3o12 heterojunctions of 10 wt of cus was found to be highly efficient for mcpa degradation about 96 degradation of mcpa was observed in 3 h which was quite higher than that of pure bi4ti3o12 48 the enhanced activity was attributed to the efficient separation of the charge carriers induced by theinternal electric field and the closely microscopic contact between the two phases nevertheless the type ii heterojunctions photocatalysts are beneficial toseparate photogenerated electron hole pairs they still have certain deficiencies on the one hand the electrostatic repulsion between theholes cb electrons of different semiconductors is not conducive to the migration of electrons and holes in the dynamics on the other hand from the perspective of thermodynamics the formation of type ii heterojunctions lowers the redox capacity of charge carriers resulting in the insufficiency of driving force for a specific photocatalytic reaction di et al 2019 xu et al 2018b in contrast direct z scheme heterojunctions photocatalysts can maintain the strong redox ability for driving photocatalytic reactions and realize the spatial separation of reductive and oxidative active sites simultaneously low et al 2017 therefore the direct z scheme photocatalysts are highly desirable for water decontamination for instance z scheme 2d 1d mos2 nanosheet decorated ag2mo2o7 microrods were used as an efficient photocatalyst for the removal of levofloxacin under visible light illumination adhikari et al 2019 the photocatalytic degradation activity of the optimized mos2 ag2mo2o7 photocatalyst with 12 wt mos2 was 5 2 and 6 72 times those of the unitary ag2mo2o7 and mos2 photocatalyst respectively the enhancement in the photocatalytic activity of mos2 ag2mo2o7 mainly resulted from the efficient photogeneration of electron hole pairs and the favorable band positions as well as the massive photogenerated electrons at the interfacial contact of mos2 ag2mo2o7 moreover guo et al 2020 reported the photocatalytic oxidation of 2 4 dcp on hollow flower like polyhedral α fe2o3 defective mos2 ag z schemeheterojunctions specifically ag nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of α fe2o3 defective mos2 via a facile photo deposition process as shown in fig 6 a the relevant xrd patterns of α fe2o3 defective mos2 ag composite confirmed that the coexistence of α fe2o3 and mos2 hinting at their tight incorporation the sem and tem images of the ternary composite presented a hollow flower like structure which was able to provide abundant edge active sites and large specific surface area for efficient light harvesting fig 6b e the optical properties measurements found that the integration of mos2 nanosheets and ag nanoparticles enabled efficiently to prevent the recombination of photogenerated carriers as a result the photocatalytic activity of the ternary composites was significantly improved where 99 removal of 2 4 dcp could be achieved in 105 min of radiation under ph 5 fig 6f the k obs valueof the ternary composite induced photocatalytic system was measured to be 4 3 10 2 min 1 which was 2 20 times higher than those of the unitary and binary materials the epr experiments verified the generation of both oh and o2 fig 6g in this process the photogenerated electrons reacted with o2 to generate o2 and the holes aggregated in the vb of α fe2o3 gained adequate power to degrade contaminant or oxidize h2o to produce oh eqs 26 29 meanwhile the hot electrons generated by the surface plasmon resonance spr effect of ag particles could be injected into mos2 which was beneficial to the separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs moreover photogenerated charge carriers from the catalyst promoted the reduction of fe3 in α fe2o3 to fe2 and further generated ooh through the reaction between fe3 and h2o2 followed by the generation of oh in the fenton process eqs 30 31 besides the existence of electrons was also favorable for the generation of both oh and o2 towards the photodegradation of organic pollutants 26 photocatalyst hv photocatalyst e h 27 o2 e o2 28 o2 2h h2o2 29 h o2 oh pollutants degradedproducts 30 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 31 fe3 h2o2 fe2 ooh h besides the tmss based photocatalysts with desired optical properties by introducing different elements could also be constructed towards specific wastewater treatment applications for example ye et al 2018 prepared p doped znxcd1 xs with rich s vacancies znxcd1 xs p 0 x 1 and utilized it as the photocatalyst for both h2 evolution and photocatalytic oxidation of 5 hydroxymethylfurfural hmf it was uncovered that the impurity level of s vacancies in zn0 5cd0 5s p was closer to the fermi level relative to that in zn0 5cd0 5s which could function as an excellent electron trap center the interstitial p doping also resulted in an enhancement of photocurrent density of zn0 5cd0 5s from 0 85 to 2 85 µa cm2 thus promoting the generation and separation of photogenerated electrons holes the correspondingdiameter of the arc radius on the eis nyquist plot and slope of the m s plot was smaller than that of undoped zn0 5cd0 5s manifesting that zn0 5cd0 5s p possessed a smaller interface resistance and a higher carrier concentration since the solar energy conversion efficiency was low biomass derived compound hmf was desirable to introduce into the photocatalytic system to enhance the efficiency of overall water splitting during this process a notable h2 evolution rate was obtained up to 786 µmol h 1g 1 in the presence of 2 mg ml hmf which was much higher than that of zn0 5cd0 5s p 419 µmol h 1g 1 surprisingly under8 h irradiation about 40 of hmf conversed into the practically valuable oxidation product 2 5 diformylfuran dff an attempt has also been made to employ co ⅱ doped mos2 nano flowers co mos2 nfs as the heterogeneous catalyst to degrade ofloxacin ofx in photo pms system chen et al 2020a under visible irradiation co mos2 0 5 co doping amount was 0 5 nfs exhibitedthe optimal catalytic activity in ofx degradation and the k obs value of co mos2 0 5 nfs 0 085 min 1 was about 9 34 times that of pristine mos2 0 0091 min 1 the enhancement of ofx photodegradation could be ascribed to the superior photo response property and the efficient separation of photogenerated carriers resulted from co doping luo et al 2012 reported the degradation of rhb usingni doped cds hollowspheres as the photocatalyst the 1 2 mol of ni doped cds hollow sphere exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity towards the rhb removal achieving nearly 100 rhb degradation within 35 min the enhanced performance was attributed to the unique hollow spheres which was favorable for the harvest of exciting light the doped ni2 may function as transient trapping sites ofphotogenerated electrons devoting to narrowing the band gap and slowing downthe recombination rate of photogenerated carriers the general catalytic mechanisms of the tmss based photocatalytic oxidation system are displayed in scheme 1 under visible light irradiation tmss are capable of harvesting visible light photons to produce electron hole pairs the cb electrons of tmss based photocatalysts can reduce the molecular oxygen to o2 and further reacted with h species to produce h2o2 in presence of cbelectrons the oh was formed by the interaction of photoexcited electrons o2 and h2o2 the doping of tmss can narrow the band gap and reduce their recombination rate thus improving the photocatalytic performance the construction of heterojunctions can induce a favorable band alignment thus the photogeneratedelectrons can migrate from the cb of different semiconductors while the migration of holes takes place in a reverse direction inthe vb of different semiconductor components simultaneously the higher positive potential of the vb of heterojunctioncan facilitate the generation of oh by oxidation of h2o oh species as a result all the transient species formed participate in thephotocatalytic degradation of target contaminants 3 3 electrochemical oxidation electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have received growing attention owing to their environmental compatibility easy scale up inherent simplicity and safe conditions as well as high effectiveness for the degradation of refractory pollutants in comparison to conventional advanced oxidation processes anodic oxidation ao and electro fenton ef are the most popularized eaops ao is based on the generation of strong oxidizing species oh by means of water oxidation at the surface of o2 overpotentialanode m eq 32 homogeneous oh generated during the ef process from fenton s reaction eq 33 ganiyu et al 2016 h2o2 and fe2 are continuously generated via the electro reduction of o2 and fe3 at a suitable cathode by electro reduction of o2 eqs 34 35 respectively ammar et al 2015 wang et al 2015 in this process an external supply of oxygen is necessary through bubbling the solution or directly fed to a gas chamber similarly the addition of iron source at catalytic amount to the treated solution initially homogeneous ef or embed it onto suitable electrode materials is required heterogeneous ef el kateb et al 2019 thiam et al 2020 although the scientific fundamentals of eaops are now quite well understood the efficiency of h2o2 generation strongly relies on the solution ph and the type of cathode materials yuan et al 2011 to this end tremendous efforts have been made in seeking alternative cathode materials numerous innovative candidates such as metals selenides phosphides nitrides carbides and metal oxides as well as metal sulfides have been synthesized and investigated as both heterogeneous catalyst source and cathode materials to address these challenges 32 m h2o m oh h e 33 fe2 h2o2 h fe3 oh h2o 34 o2 g 2h 2e h2o2 35 fe3 e fe2 among these alternatives tmss based catalysts are quite attractive since they possess excellent electrical conductivity hybrid d orbitals and versatile redox nature which have displayed excellent catalytic performance for oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions as well as water treatment wu et al 2018b the tmss based eaops have recently experienced an impressive development for the treatment of refractory pollutants for example ammar et al 2015 employed pyrite powder as aheterogeneous source of fe2 catalyst for tyrosol ty degradation in the ef process by a boron doped diamond bdd carbon felt cell in the ef pyrite process 76 mineralization was achieved after 6 h at 50 ma which was 8 6 superior to that of ef process under comparable conditions due to the self regulation of ph and soluble fe2 by pyrite without external acidification likewise labiadh et al 2015 employed the pyrite ef system to generate h2o2 in situ and regenerate ferrous ions for the oxidation of azo dye 4 amino 3 hydroxy 2 p tolylazo naphthalene 1 sulfonic acid ahps more than 90 mineralization of ahps was achieved in pyrite ef within 300 min whereas mineralization of ahps in conventional ef process was only 70 under the same reaction time the improvement of pyrite ef system was ascribed to the abundant oh generated simultaneously on both the bdd surface and the pyrite induced fenton s reaction in bulk solution without acidification besides commercial mos2 was adopted as an efficient co catalyst to improve the conversion between fe2 and fe3 of the traditional fe0 ef process by mo4 on the mos2 surface and accompanied by the generation of mo6 eq 20 afterwards mo6 would restore to mo4 with the assist of h2o2 and lead to continuously recycling of iron ions hence generating more oh through fenton reaction eqs 22 and 36 38 the newly developed mos2 fe co catalytic ef process mos2 fe0 ef was confirmed to be effective towards sulfamethazine smt degradation tian et al 2021 completely elimination in 10 min and 42 2 toc removal of smt in 1 h were obtained manifesting an obvious improvement relative to the fe0 ef process 19 4 the electric energy consumption eec of mos2 fe0 ef was determined to be 11 8 kwh kg toc which was only 59 3 of that in fe0 ef process 19 9 kwh kg toc 36 o2 2h 2e h2o2 37 h2o2 fe2 fe3 oh oh 38 fe0 2h2o fe2 2oh h2 apart from the most frequently used pyrite ltaïef and co workers compared the effect of different sources of fe2 on the performances of ef process using homogeneous feso4 and natural heterogeneous catalysts ltaief et al 2018 it was found that all the iron based heterogeneous catalysts i e pyrite chalcopyrite fe2o3 and fe3o4 were able to drive the ef process with better performance in caffeic acid ca mineralization compared with those obtained in the absence of various kinds of iron catalysts toc removal efficiency was lower than 15 particularly chalcopyrite gave the highest abatement of the toc in comparison with pyrite due to the involvement of cu ii subsequently barhoumi et al 2017 developed a novel eaops using chalcopyrite mineral as a heterogeneous catalyst for the degradation and mineralization of tc the performance of ef chalcopyrite process was confirmed to be more superior to the conventional ef using 1 0 g lof chalcopyrite 300 ma current carbon felt cathode and bdd anode acquiring 98 mineralization of the tc solution after 8 h and detoxified the tc solution due to the self regulation of fe2 and cu2 content and solution ph to 3 in the reaction medium as well as their synergistic effect eqs 39 41 therefore oh could be formed in three ways namely electrochemically induced fenton s reaction fe2 and h2o2 fenton like reaction cu and h2o2 and the water oxidation at the bdd anode surface meanwhile it was noticed that oxamic and oxalic acids were more rapidly destroyed when using chalcopyrite since the carboxylate complexes of cu2 were more reactive towards oh resulting in an enhancement of their oxidation rate moreover a photoelectro fenton hpef process was assembled for cephalexin removal by using chalcopyrite as heterogeneous catalysts irradiated with uva light owing to the synergistic effect of photocatalysis and ef process the overall removal of cephalexin by hpef process was observed in 15 min which was partly attributed to the photocatalysis stimulated by chalcopyrite accounted for 38 6 droguett et al 2020 39 cufes2 s 4o2 cu2 fe2 2so4 2 40 cufes2 s 4h o2 cu2 fe2 2s0 s 2h2o 41 cufes2 s 16fe3 8h2o cu2 17fe2 2so4 2 16h nonetheless the pyrite chalcopyrite catalyzed ef processes were verified to be better than other heterogeneous ef processes it may still suffer from excessive metal ions leaching thus hampering the catalyst reusability and requiring sludge management in this context ye et al 2020 have published a study in which highly stable and recyclable mof engineered fes2 c has been utilized as a heterogeneous ef catalyst to promote the electro oxidation of the fluoxetine in an iro2 air diffusion cell 91 of fluoxetine removal was obtained at initial ph of 6 after 60 min at 50 ma with 0 5 g l 1 fes2 c nanocatalysts which outperformed electrochemical oxidation with electrogenerated h2o2 eo h2o2 at initial ph of 3 0 41 conventional ef process with 5 mg l 1 fe2 at initial ph of 3 0 47 and heterogeneous ef process with 0 5 g l 1 natural pyrite at initial ph of 6 0 19 as described in fig 7 a the final ph of fes2 c ef process was measured to be 3 0 with a quite low concentration of dissolved iron 1 4 mg l 1 fig 7b which was much lower than those previously reported ef processes ltaief et al 2018 tian et al 2021 besides the large mineralization of all wastewater components and the remarkable decrease of toxicity were obtained at 6 hsynchronously accordingly the mechanism of fes2 c catalyzed heterogeneous ef process at mild ph was proposed in fig 7c it mainly includes the homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton s reaction mechanisms on the one hand the fes2 core shell nanoparticles acted as fe2 shuttles for homogeneous fenton s reaction to yield oh on the other hand the as obtained catalyst enabled to offer plentiful active sites to minimize the mass transport limitations the accessible fe s bonds were involved in the h2o2 decomposition resulting in the generation of oh pre eminently at fe ii sites additionally the activation of molecular o2 could be stimulated by a higher content of surface bound fe ii on fes2 thereby accelerating the formation of o2 besides the employed bdd anode also contributed to the generation of physisorbed oh given the relatively low concentration of dissolved irons the role of homogeneous fenton s reaction mechanism was insignificant while the heterogeneous mechanism was expected to be dominant therefore the fes2 c nanocomposite was an excellent candidate for heterogeneous ef treatment since the high yield of h2o2 was vitally important for efficient ef process the utilization of novel cathode materials based on tmss is deemed to be an effective strategy to enhance the performance of ef processes very recently mi et al 2020 prepared 3d columnar rgo mos2 ce0 75zr0 25o2 rmc composite as an electro fenton cathode showing outstanding electrochemical performance in ciprofloxacin cip degradation completely removal of ciprofloxacin was achieved within 5 h with a high mineralization rate up to 77 1 in 3 h under optimal conditions which was higher than those in electro absorption process of 48 0 ea using rgo cathode with no addition of fe2 ea ec of 82 4 ec using the rmc cathode with no addition of fe2 the superior degradation performance of rmc cathode was mainly attributed to the improved electron transport properties induced by mos2 doping the reinforced reduction of o2 to h2o2 via the heterogeneous catalysis of ce3 ce4 the effective electro absorption of rgo besides the ceria zirconia solid solution also resulted in enhanced redox properties and oxygen storage capacity furthermore it was also revealed that oh was mainly responsible for the degradation of cip and rmc cathode was more active towards the activation of h2o2 thereby improving the performance of ef process likewise tian and co workers developed fe3o4 fesx doped carbon aerogel ca cathode at 900 c named fesca 900 for the effective elimination of both dimethyl phthalate dmp and 3 chlorophenol 3 cp tian et al 2020b as high as 99 removal of dmp and 3 cp were achieved in 240 min which was higher than those of fesca 850 93 for dmp and 96 for 3 cp feca 900 75 and 81 feca 850 71 and 75 respectively the fesca 900 also presented extremely high toc removal for both dmp 94 and 3 cp 88 fig 8 c d among these cathodes fesca 900 cathode possessed a more positive onset potential of orr at 0 152 v v vs sce and exhibited a higher selectivity of h2o2 generation via 2 e orr 57 in comparison with feca 900 21 as well as accelerated the regeneration of surface fe ii owing to the presence of fesx as a result oh could be continuously produced by decomposing electrogenerated h2o2 on the surface of fesca 900 leading to the outstanding ef degradation performance moreover the introduction of s suppressed the fe leaching and endowed it with exceptional stability and great recyclability since the fe leaching concentration was quite low 2 ppm and the decline of removal efficiency over six cycling tests was negligible the general reaction mechanisms of tmss based eaops are described in scheme 1 tmss based catalysts have a dual role self regulation of the ph without external acidification and act as a solid catalyst tostimulate the heterogeneous fenton s reaction to generate oh when they are employed as the cathode the regeneration kinetics of fe ii or other metal ions on catalysts and electrochemical generation of h2o2 can be promoted thus resulting in a great deal of oh production and avoiding excessive iron leaching simultaneously besides the introduction of light irradiation is beneficial to eaops because photocatalysis also contributes to pollutant degradation to some extent 3 4 comparison of different tmss based aops to date it is revealed that a great number of tmss based catalysts have huge potential in aops for water purification the great popularity and widespread applicability of tmss based aops fenton like oxidation photocatalytic oxidation and electrochemical oxidation may be attributed to many aspects as follows in brief diverse reactive oxygen species can be generated under relatively mild pressure and temperature conditions and the oxidation processes are easy operation without complicated reaction devices usually the reaction system is cost effective with relatively satisfactory mineralization efficiency of target contaminants these three oxidation systems are independent of each other enables easy implementation as an integrated treatment process moreover they can be well combined with biological treatment processes which is beneficial to decontamination of wastewater with complex composition although tmss based aops possess many advantages there are still some shortcomings that required to be further improved for example among the three oxidation systems the fenton like oxidation is the most sensitive one to water chemistry and the type of oxidant will also affect the performance of the established oxidation systems to some extent the mineralization efficiency of target pollutants is relatively lower as compared to the other two systems sometimes the residual oxidant may also lead to high biological toxicity besides the leaching of poisonous metal ions may lead to secondary pollution thus the post treatment of effluent will increase operating costs while electrochemical oxidation using clean electricity as the driving force it can often obtain a higher mineralization efficiency if necessary the external supply of oxidant or fe resource may result in an enhancement in catalytic performance the oxidation system is less dependent on ph and it can also largely avoid the secondary pollution caused by the leaching of metal ions however electrochemical oxidation is mostly limited to fe bearing tmss and the preparation of electrodes based on tmss is relatively complicated tmss based catalysts have been extensively studied for photocatalysis the photocatalysis systems do not require additional energy input except for light source and there is almost no risk of secondary pollution however the initiate of photocatalysis reaction requires a specific device and the penetration of solar light is limited which greatly hampered the practical application and increased the capital expenses unlike the other two oxidation systems pristine tmss or natural sulfur containing minerals without any modification will be inactive for light irradiation in some cases the optical properties of tmss need to be further adjusted to achieve high photocatalytic efficiency and more attentions should pay to the photocorrosion of tmss based catalysts and guaranteeadequatepotential energy of charges sometimes it will be a judicious choice to reasonably integrate different water treatment processes 4 effect of water chemistry on degradation efficiency water chemistry has a significant effect on the performance of tmss based aops assuch some important factors e g ph temperature contaminant concentration dissolved oxygen natural organic matters and inorganics pecies affecting these processes are discussed in the following sections 4 1 effect of ph the solution ph is one of the most important aspects of aops wastewater treatment as it not only plays an important role in the decomposition of oxidants but also influences the surface charge of the tmss based catalysts and the speciation of the substrate to be transformed ao et al 2020 wang et al 2020b generally when the solution ph is greater than the ph value at point of zero charge phpzc the surface of tmss based catalysts is negatively charged otherwise positively charged for instance the phpzc of feco2s4 cn was measured to be 5 9 li et al 2020b therefore the surface of feco2s4 cn was positively charged under the investigated ph of 3 5 and 5 0 while it was negatively charged at the initial ph of 6 5 8 0 and 9 5 the smx mainly existed as anionic species under the ph range of 3 5 9 5 thus the initial ph of3 5 and 5 0 was more favorable for the smx degradation due to the enhancement of interaction between feco2s4 cnand smx as compared to that at alkaline conditions about 87 5 90 6 60 and 51 5 of smx were degraded at ph of 3 5 5 0 8 0 and 9 5 under buffer controlled experiment conditions respectively furthermore the species distribution and decomposition of oxidants are also significantly influenced by the solution ph the proportion of so5 2 would increase with the increase of ph value pms pka1 0 and pka2 9 4 resulting in enhancedelectrostatic repulsion between pms and the negatively charged surface ofcuco2s4 particles xu et al 2018a in addition the decomposition of pms under alkaline ph was hampered and so4 would convert to oh consequently the degradation of bps was inhibited under alkaline ph meanwhile it was also reported that partial decomposition of o3 into oh was accelerated at high ph which was beneficial to the degradation of target pollutants pirgalıoğlu and özbelge 2009 despite the decomposition of h2o2 to o2 and h2o would weaken the oxidation ability of h2o2 the negative effect was negligible for the tmss based aops systems yang et al 2020 qian et al 2014 found that the methylene blue mb degradation efficiency under acidic conditions was unsatisfactory ph 3 0 and only 43 5 of mb was removed while the performance under alkaline conditions was much better than those of acidic conditions even at strong alkaline conditions in cus ncs rgo h2o2 system 93 1 at ph of 11 0 in the study of zhang et al 2020b over the investigated ph range of 4 0 9 0 the degradation efficiency of sulfadiazine sdz was barely changed hinting that the activity of the cu2znsns4 h2o2 system was not influenced by the variation of solution ph fig 8a likewise a slight enhancement of sdz degradation efficiency under alkaline conditions was also observed with the increase of solution ph since a higher ph could provide a higher oh concentration to produce oh 4 2 effect of temperature the temperature of the reaction medium is another important parameter commonly addressed in dealing with water pollution by the tms based aops systems generally higher temperature enhances the mass transfer of reactants and kinetic constants moreira et al 2017 for instance wu et al 2020 studied the degradationefficiencies of tc withrespect to various reaction temperatures it was confirmed that the tc degradationefficiencies increased from 89 to 100 with the reaction temperature raised from 15 c to 45 c which was ascribed to the endothermic reaction of the pms activation process similarly the enhanced mb degradation in cus ncs rgo h2o2 system with the rising temperature was observed qian et al 2014 the degradation efficiency of mb reached 95 2 only in 10 min at 45 c while 93 0 degradation efficiency of mb needed 18 min at 35 c and even90 min at 25 c the results suggested that a higher temperaturemay not significantly accelerate the degradation efficiency but significantly influence the degradation kinetic constants in thecuco2s4 pms system the k obs value of bps degradation increased from 0 086 min 1 to 0 444 min 1 as the temperature waselevated from 15 c to 45 c fig 8b xu et al 2018a accordingly the activation energy ea for this process was determined to be 40 67 kj mol 1 manifesting that cuco2s4 was a potentially useful catalyst for water purification underambient temperature 4 3 effect of dissolved oxygen dissolved oxygen do is also acritical parameter of water chemistry when tmss based catalysts are exposed to the air do could be reduced to o2 or h2o2 via single electron ortwo electron transfer routes thereby affecting the degradation performance of these aops systems indirectly liu and co workers investigated the effect of molecular oxygen on alachlor degradation in thesyn fes2 h2o2 system under different atmospheric conditions liu et al 2015 as shown in fig 8c thealachlor degradation efficiency under argon was obviously lower than that under air when theinitial alachlor concentration was 0 033 mmol l correspondingly the k obs value of alachlordegradation under argon 0 0130 was only 59 of that under air 0 0221 these results suggested that the molecular oxygen activation process was involved in thesyn fes2 h2o2 system and the surface reactionsbetween ros and iron species organic molecules would be restrained under argon condition furthermore the degradation efficiency of smx in the n2 saturated feco2s4 cn pms system was reduced by 30 4 as compared with air conditions indicating the existence of o2 and 1o2 was partially derived from the do in reaction solution li et al 2020b conversely the bubbling of o2 into fes sulfite process would slightly hamper thedegradation of propranolol chen et al 2020b the result was probably attributed to the fast transformation of structural fe ii to fe iii at oxic conditions since the excessive do was enabled to alter the dissolution of fes moreover the generated bubbles might retard electron transportamong active substances nevertheless there is a limited amount of studies about the effect of do on the performance of tmss based aops which should be highly addressed in further researches 4 4 effect of inorganic species the ubiquitous inorganic anions e g cl po4 3 hco3 no3 andso4 2 in natural watersusually act as radical scavengers in the catalytic oxidation of water borne contaminants thereby influencing the performance of radical based aops systems for example zhao et al 2020 reported that the presence of cl and so4 2 100 mg l had negligible effects on p arsanilic acid p asa degradation in fes2 h2o2 process fig 8d while po4 3 exerted remarkably inhibiting effect on p asa removal owing to the competition with oh likewise the presence of 2 mm po4 3 completely inhibited the degradation efficiency of roxarsone rox in mos2 modified schwertmannite mos2 sch mediated photo fenton process wang et al 2021 because the po4 3 existed as h3po4 and h2po4 forms atph 3 5 which enabled to induce the radical quenching reactions between ros and po4 3 moreover po4 3 couldcomplex withfe3 toretard catalytic activity of mos2 sch even if phosphate radical hpo4 was generated likewise it was found that the addition of hpo4 2 5 100 mm caused a sharp decrease in the k obs value of ciprofloxacin cip in cos2 pms system which may be ascribed to the loss of active cobaltsites caused by phosphate ions through the chelating action li et al 2020a in the visible light irradiated co mos2 pms system so4 2 exhibited negligible influence on ofx degradation while no3 slightly suppressed the ofx degradation due to its quenching effect to reactive radicals chen et al 2020a an obvious inhibited degradation of ofx was obtained once cl and hco3 20 mm were introduced into the degradation process which was caused by the strong scavenging of cl and hco3 to the generated ros besides previous studies have revealed that the hco3 co3 2 andhpo4 2 h2po4 possessstrong buffer capacity li et al 2019a zhou et al 2020a found that once 1 mm hco3 and hpo4 2 wereintroduced into the mos2 pms system the ph value of reaction solution was quickly elevated from 4 to 8 1 and 7 1 respectively as a result most of the h in solution would be neutralized which was unfavorable for the capture of edge s atoms and significantly hampered theinteraction between mo ⅳ and pms thus inhibiting the degradation of cbz a similar phenomenon has also been observed in fes biochar ps system and the degradation of tc was decreased by 25 in the presence of 10 mm co3 2 he et al 2021a the presence of cl played a dual role in target pollutants degradation which was found to be concentration dependent chen et al 2019 for example the introduction of cl has two sides to the degradation of cip in cos2 pms system li et al 2020a the lower concentration of cl caused a severe retarding effecton cip degradation kinetics the k obs value of cip degradation decreased from 0 1209 to 0 0067 min 1 as the concentration of cl elevated from 0 to 5 mm this was probably owing to the consumption of so4 bycl which led to the formation of cl and cl2 once the concentration of cl was higher than 5 mm the degradation of cip was slightly enhanced this phenomenon could be attributed to the generation of hypochlorite hocl in addition the direct reaction between pms andcl couldalsoleadto the generation of hocl chen et al 2019 despite the redox potential of hocl 1 63 v was lower than that of so4 hocl possessed a much longer lifetime compared to radicals which could be considered as the dominant oxidant at high cl conditions lee et al 2020 however the effect of cl on the degradation of target pollutants has been controversial in the study by peng et al 2020 enhanced bps degradation was noticed in presence of a high concentration of cl up to 50 mm in thenatural chalcopyrite pms system they pointed out the generation of cl and cl2 with a high redox potential was responsible for the promoted degradation of bps similarly the reason for the enhanced degradation of tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep in fes2 ps systemwas thought to be the generation of active chlorine cl clho and cl2 li et al 2020a nevertheless the adverse effect of inorganic anions on the target contaminants degradation in the nonradical dominated process is usually unremarkable for example the addition of cl hco3 and h2po4 exhibited an insignificant effect on the smx degradation since the 1o2 was verified to be the major ros in the feco2s4 cn pms system li et al 2020b 4 5 effect of natural organic matter natural organic matter nom is a ubiquitous complex mixture in aquatic environment and would either promote orsuppress the removal of organic contaminants relying on itsconcentration and type drosos et al 2015 as a major constituent of nom humicacid ha has been extensively chosen as model nom to verifyits effect on the performance of tmss based aops towards target contaminants degradation for instance the degradation efficiency of cip decreased from 88 to 81 7 when ha 1 mmol l 1 was added into the cus fe2o3 mn2o3 pms system huang et al 2020b a similar phenomenon has been observed in the cu2fesns4 ps system kong et al 2019 the removal efficiency of bpa was significantly hampered inthe presence of 1 mg l 1 ha while further increase ha concentration to 2 mg l 1 and 5 mg l 1 the inhibition effect on bpa degradation was insignificant fig 8e demonstrating that ha restrained the cu2fesns4 ps process via covering the active sites on cu2fesns4 surface and it would competewith bpa for so4 and oh in the nonradical dominated process adverse effect on target pollutants degradation caused by ha is usually negligible therefore when 2 10 and 25 mg l ha were introduced into the 1o2 dominated feco2s4 cn pms system fig 8f smx degradation were slightly depressed by 2 7 5 2 and 7 4 respectively li et al 2020b 5 reusability and stability the reusability and stability of tmss based catalysts are highly desired which is vital for their practical application to assess the reusability of the sample reuse tests are usually needed to be conducted under the same reaction conditions generally the tmss based catalysts could maintain satisfactory catalytic performance over multiple successive cycles for instance the degradation of bpa only slightly decreased with increasing cycle number maintaining above 80 within 45 min after three reuse cycles in cu2fesns4 pssystem kong et al 2019 in the cuco2s4 pms system bps removal still up to 100 i n 30 min even after five repeated runs xu et al 2018a likewise in the photocatalytic oxidation process no remarkable activity decline for the cus bi4ti3o12 catalyst towards 2 methyl 4 chlorophenoxyacetic acid degradation over three cycles suggesting its highst ability and reliable practical performance das et al 2019 in the fes2 c ef process a slight but progressive performance decrease was observed after 5 cycles only 61 of fluoxetine removal was obtained upto three cycles at 60 min ye et al 2020 fortunately the electrocatalytic activity of fes2 ccould be completely regenerated after cleaning with organic solvent ch2cl2 and water besides ultrasound treatment and acid washing are also commonly applied to recovery the catalytic activity of tmss based catalysts for example the degradation efficiency of p asa decreased from 100 1st run to 80 5th run by fes2 h2o2 process while after treatment with 1 m hcl significant enhancement in p asa degradation was noticed fig 9 a possibly due to the removal of iron oxy hydroxides zhao et al 2020 similarly the catalytic activity of natural chalcopyrite could be effectively recovered by treating with ultrasound for 10 min after each cycle and the bps removal efficiency after five cycles was similar to that of the firs trun 83 peng et al 2020 multiple characterizations e g x ray diffraction xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier trans form infrared spectroscopy ftir scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopic tem are usually applied to confirm the stability of tmss based catalysts as shown in fig 9b the xrd pattern of ws 2 mos2 wo3 x catalyst indicated that the crystal structure of the composite remained unchanged compared with the fresh one after four repeated cycles hinting the highst ability of as prepared photocatalyst guo et al 2019 in the study of nie et al 2019 the xps analysis of fresh and used cufes2 suggested that the active sites fe2 and cu were efficiently regenerated due to the existence of s2 s2 2 and sn 2 fig 9c d as a result the pms activation by cufes2 and the bpa degradation reaction could be continuously processed after the consecutive cycle tests the bet value of the reused cu2fesns4 34 47m2g 1 was significantly greater than the fresh cu2fesns4 25 75m2g 1 due to the formation of in soluble carbonate and sulfate contaminants on the cu2fesns4 surface thereby resulting in a slight decrease of bpa degradation in ps activation process kong et al 2019 additionally metal leaching is also usually a problem of concern which could reflect the stability of tmss based catalysts in pms activation fig 9e f the iron leaching tests of fes graphene based catalyst using the double network template showed it had considerable stability since the iron leaching concentration was lower than 0 2 mgl 1 over 5 reuse cycles zhuang et al 2020 likewise in the zn0 9fe0 1s ni foam induced photocatalytic process the dissolution amount of ni ions zn ions and fe ions was quite stable with in 120 min over seven cycle experiments which were approximately 0 012 0 218 and 0 041 of the total mass of applied photocatalyst respectively zhang et al 2019 although sometimes the high level of leached metal ions can cause secondary pollution this problem can be well solved for instance incu2fesns4 pssystem the concentrations of leached cu fe and sn ions were measured to be 16 70 1 36 and 0 057 mgl 1 respectively kong et al 2019 the concentration of leached cu can be well controlled 0 05 mgl 1 by using buffer solution or adding ha into in cu2fesns4 pssystem it was also reported that the concentration of mo ion leached from mos2 pms system up to 2 23 mgl 1 zhou et al 2020a in order to avoid secondary pollution flocculation process by adding fe2 so4 3 into the filtrate was employed to reduce the mo leaching consequently the leached mo concentration decreased to 0 41 mg l moreover the leached sulfur species also play a key role in the reusability and stability of tms s based catalysts to some extent for example the chain reactions of s2 sn 2 fe3 fe2 pds in fe3s4 pds system resulted in efficient generation of so4 for bpa degradation lin et al 2020 while the decrease of s2 and sn 2 species on the surface of fe3s4 would weaken the reactions between the fe species and pds consequently the removal of bpa decreased by 20 after three cycles in the fe3s4 fe7s8 electro fenton process the amount of leached s species increased with cyclenumber resulting in an enhancementintheratiosofsurfacefetos choe et al 2018 some of the leached s species s2 could bind with leached fe species to reconstruct the surface with fe sulfide character rather than homogeneously catalyze h2o2 to generate oh thus suppressing the degradation of phenol conversely zhao and co workers reported that the s ii rich condition was beneficial to the generation of fesn and the cycling of fe iii fe ii would be accelerated zhao et al 2017a it was also confirmed that the s ii could directly activate h2o2 to produce oh based on the epr test which contributed to 40 removal of chloramphenicol cap as a whole the aforementioned results indicated that tmss based catalysts possess satisfactory reusability and stability for water purification through aops 6 conclusion and perspective in this review the commonly used strategies for rational regulating the properties of tmss based catalysts including artificial size and shape control composition control doping and heterojunction construction are briefly summarized benefiting from their excellent optical electrical and catalytic properties the tmss based aops exhibited huge potential in water decontamination in the fenton like oxidation process tmss based catalysts can be used for chemical oxidants activation e g h2o2 o3 pds and pms to produce corresponding ros oh so4 1o2 o2 etc or act as the co catalysts to accelerate the rate limiting step of the fenton like process in the photocatalytic oxidation process tmss based catalysts enable to harvest visible light photons to produce electron hole pairs and further initiate a series of chain reactions to form diverse ros to participate in thephotocatalytic degradation of target contaminants as for the electrochemical oxidation processes tmss based catalysts are usually employed as the electro fenton catalysts or cathode materials in addition the effect of water chemistryon the performance of these tmss based aops implied their universal applicability to complex water matrix most of the tmss based catalysts exhibited high reusabilityand stability in these aops towards target contaminant degradation despite great progress have been achieved in the field of tmss based aops some important issues still need to be further considered and addressed are as follows 1 there is a need to enhance the stability and reusability of tmss based heterogeneous catalysts although current studies have reported that the tmss based catalysts possess high catalytic performance in water purification the active components of the catalyst will inevitably be lost or poisoned after multiple cycles tests therefore for future development more optimized synthetic methods should be developed to prepare tmss based catalysts for example synthesis of tmss based catalysts under nanoconfinement defect engineering and selection of ultra high performance materials as the supporter besides the introduction of specific reducing agents or complexing agents into the aops should also be effective for enhancing the stability and reusability of tmss based catalysts 2 the transformation mechanisms ofboth surface and liquid phase sulfur species need to be deeply investigated since most previous studies only focus on the transformation of sulfur species on the surface of catalysts there is almost no concern about sulfur species in the liquid phase in further work the emphasis should be placed on the effect of the conversion mechanism of liquid phase sulfur species on the performance of tmss based aops system 3 there are few studies on the eco toxicity and kinetic model analysis of tmss based aops system dft computations can provide more in depth insights into the transformation of target pollutants and help us to accurately elucidate the catalytic active centers meanwhile the analysis of eco toxicity is favorable for establishing more environmentally friendly tmss based aops 4 more economical and efficient tmss based eaops are encouraged to be exploited at present studies on eaops mainly focus on iron containing tmss there is a data gap of iron free tmss based catalysts thus tmss based electrocatalysts containing different elements such as co sn cu ni cu are highly desired meanwhile the design of high performance electrode materials by the decoration of noble metal single atoms or carbon matrix as well as establish 3d electrocatalytic systems are feasible strategies to improve the catalytic activity of eaops 5 to date the study on tmss based catalysts is still at an early stage it is far from the large scale practical application in this regard priority can be given to the development of tmss based co catalytic systems additionally the combination of tmss based aops with other mature wastewater treatment technologies is also expected to be beneficial for the enhancement of practical applicability declaration of competing interest theauthorsdeclarethattheyhavenoknowncompeting financial interests or
