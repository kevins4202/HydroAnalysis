21975,solitary waves can evolve into breakers in the nearshore area generating strong destructive forces especially for plunging breakers in the present study experiments are conducted to investigate plunging solitary waves propagating over a trapezoidal bar and to quantify their subsequent hydrodynamic forces on a cylinder to do so solitary waves are designed to break at varying phases and to strike the cylinder differently in space to examine their hydrodynamic forces furthermore consideration of structural responses influencing measured forces for non rigid structures provides the basis of an equation of motion that facilitates the extraction of hydrodynamic forces from measured forces additionally the relation of cylinder s properties to surface elevations are evaluated and subsequently used to extract the hydrodynamic forces the results show that the measured forces extracted hydrodynamic forces and dynamic amplification factors daf ratio between the measured force and hydrodynamic force achieve their highest values approximately at the same breaking phase that is when the plunging jet has curled down but prior to its impingement on the water surface and this remains valid for different incident wave heights lastly with an assumed asymmetrical triangular pulse force theoretical daf is calculated and presents less than a 20 difference to the experimental daf keywords solitary waves plunging breaker phases vertical slender cylinder hydrodynamic forces structural responses 1 introduction tsunamis which are mainly caused by volcanic eruptions landslides or earthquakes may propagate from the deep sea to nearshore areas causing strong destructive forces on coastal structures e g tohoku earthquake tsunami in 2011 mori et al 2011 on the other hand due to refraction and shoaling gravity waves can evolve into steep waves or breakers and thus exert large hydrodynamic loads on support structures notably for plunging breakers to model tsunamis propagating over slopes experimentally and numerically although not strictly correct for earthquake generated waves the solitary wave theory has been employed frequently due to its stable form and its similar properties to tsunami crests goring 1979 xuan et al 2013 yao et al 2018 yeh et al 1994 mo et al 2013 simulated numerically plunging solitary waves impacting a slender cylinder on a constant slope via filtered navier stokes equations combined with a large eddy simulations les model the simulated surface elevations and velocity fields were found to fit well with the experimental results that were measured through particle image velocimetry piv subsequently the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations together with a k ε model was used to examine the same case while the volume of fluid vof method and the level set method lsm were used to process the free surface by xiao and huang 2015 and chella et al 2017 respectively however plunging breakers evolve with rapid spatial temporal variations in both wave geometry and wave kinematics fine meshes and short time steps are needed in numerical simulations which consume huge computation time especially for 3 d cases such as breakers impacting a cylinder to improve computational efficiency xie et al 2017 employed an adaptive unstructured mesh to model the 3 d plunging solitary wave striking a cylinder however assumptions for simplifying calculations such as eddy viscosity models and incompressible flow were adopted which provided a preliminary understanding of the plunging wave forces and laboratory physical models still play a pivotal role providing reliable results as regards these complex hydrodynamic problems however relevant experiments remain limited for example the experiments of mo et al 2013 focused on the flow field but did not consider the wave forces thus in this study experiments are conducted to investigate plunging solitary waves and their attendant hydrodynamic forces on a cylinder as aforementioned plunging breakers evolve both in space and time the wave height increases until the wave front aligns vertically then a plunging jet develops and impinges on the water surface causing a splash up of the water these different breaking phases excite varying forces on structures chan et al 1995 tai et al 2019 chan et al 1995 found significant variability of the pressure characteristics for different breaking phases of a plunging breaker on a vertical cylinder wienke and oumeraci 2005 considered that the measured forces of different breaking phases could be superposed linearly by quasi static forces and dynamic forces with only quasi static forces remaining once the waves broke downstream of the cylinder tai et al 2019 found that variations in measured forces for different breaking phase were contributed mostly by the dynamic forces and that the quasi static forces were approximately the same until the wave tongue impinges on the water surface however these plunging waves were generated by dispersive focusing wave groups for plunging solitary waves as far as the authors are aware to date only numerical studies have contributed to the literature hence this is another objective of this study it is important to realize that the hydrodynamic force can be sufficiently large i e above a threshold value to induce structural responses also this has been called the hydroelastic effect faltinsen 2005 actually this is a very common phenomenon in coastal and offshore engineering and occurs for monopile wind turbines and other elevated coastal offshore structures for example de ridder et al 2011 found that even moderately steep waves can excite a significant vibration of the monopile wind turbine in shallow water in the experiments presented here the forces of plunging solitary waves did excite the cylinder s response although the structural response of elastic components is expected it contaminates the forces recorded e g by load cells and thus hampers isolating the true hydrodynamic forces on the test model or the prototype wienke and oumeraci 2005 considered the dynamic force as a convolution integral between the response function of a cylinder and the impact force and then used deconvolution to eliminate the cylinder s response however the impact force in their study was calculated by a theoretical equation by directly processing the measured forces and using the equation of motion paulsen et al 2019 determined a relation between the measured forces and the hydrodynamic forces for a monopile wind turbine the use of the equation of motion was crucial in filtering the monopile s response however it is noted that both wienke and oumeraci 2005 and paulsen et al 2019 ignored the influence of surface elevations on the cylinder s response it is well known that surface elevations can influence the response functions of a structure through so called added mass especially in shallow water and with large wave height as there are large variations in added mass chopra 2012 lugni et al 2014 considered the effects of surface elevation on the response of a deformable vertical plate based on the equation of motion during shallow liquid sloshing the added mass was calculated using an incompressible potential flow numerical model nevertheless their study was focused on a flat structure and more investigation of the influence of surface elevations that generate cylinder s response are needed therefore in this study for the first time a method that considers the surface elevations based on the equation of motion is proposed and utilized to obtain the attendant hydrodynamic forces of plunging solitary waves on a cylinder unlike the previous study of tai et al 2019 plunging solitary waves are generated using shoaling instead of dispersive focusing to create breaking wave groups additionally wave forces are analyzed further based on the properties of the test cylinder rather than data analysis methods such as the fourier transform and the wavelet transform the paper is divided into five sections following the introduction described in section 1 experiments are discussed carefully and in detail in section 2 subsequently the method to separate the hydrodynamic forces from the combined forces is presented in section 3 then results are given in section 4 finally some conclusions are presented in section 5 2 experiments 2 1 experimental setup experiments are performed in a wave flume at the dalian university of technology the wave flume used is 22 m long 0 45 m wide and filled with tap water to a depth of 0 20 m at one end of the flume a motor driver piston type wave maker is positioned to generate wave trains at the downstream end a beach made with plastic horsehair is placed to help mitigate wave reflection to cause a solitary wave to morph into a plunging breaker a spanwise uniform longitudinally asymmetric trapezoidal plexiglass bar is placed in the middle of the flume the use of a trapezoidal bar rather than a simple slope is so that the flat portion of the bar reduces the influence of the slope and reflected waves thus allowing the cylinder to be placed longitudinally in various positions along the bar to alter the phase of the wave forcing as no solitary wave breaks for plane slopes larger than 12 slope 1 4 7 grilli et al 1997 and considering the size limitation of the wave flume a slope of 1 5 is used for the upstream slope of the trapezoidal bar this then causes the plunging solitary waves to break in the observation window as can be seen in fig 1 the size of the flat portion of the bar was tested prior to the experiments insuring that it was sufficiently long for the plunging solitary waves to break there this includes the breaking phases of the incipient break point the curling jet the jet impinging the free water surface and the spray of air water mixture the x coordinate is set positive in the wave propagation direction with the origin located at the mean paddle position the test cylinder made of a plexiglass pipe is 0 56 m high 0 06 m in diameter d and 0 005 m in wall thickness and it is placed 0 005 m above the flat portion of the bar the top of the cylinder is fixed to the load cell through a plastic connector a and screws this load cell is mounted beneath a track slide through another plastic connector b the slide allows the cylinder to be fixed along the flume through the slide rail which is mounted on a square steel box beam once positioned via connector b i e fixed to the slide it is clamped onto the square steel box beam with screws the square steel box beam is fixed rigidly to the wave flume a sketch of the details of the connections among the rigid frame the slide the load cell and the test cylinder is depicted in fig 2 in the present experiments only integral inline forces and wave surface elevations are measured a load cell manufactured by the yangzhou institute of electronic technology co ltd type kd43030 and can measure forces to 150 n with an accuracy of 0 01 n is used for the force measurement the fundamental resonant frequency of the load cell is 1000 hz the sample rate is 500 hz temporal surface elevations at desired locations along the flume are collected using 10 capacitive wave gauges g1 g2 g10 manufactured by techno service co ltd type twg 600s as shown in fig 1 a all wave gauges had an accuracy of 0 01 cm and are sampled at 50 hz the load cell and wave gauges are calibrated carefully prior to and during the experiments moreover prior to and during the wave breaking surface profiles are captured by a high speed camera manufactured by pco imaging technology co ltd type pco dimax s4 this camera is seated on one side of the flume perpendicular to the glass walls focused on the wet inside surface of the glass wall closest to it it recorded images 2016 pixels 1252 pixels at 1000 frames per second a scale factor of 0 353 mm pixel is found to convert pixel coordinates in the image to physical coordinates opposite to the camera three halogen lamps with a maximum total power of 3000 w illuminate a translucent soft film thus providing backlighting as shown in fig 1 b additionally the cylinder was painted black to contrast the cylinder and the breaking wave surface 2 2 solitary wave generation and breaking over a trapezoidal bar the adopted methodology for solitary waves generation is that proposed by malek mohammadi and testik 2010 which considers surges at the paddle during the generation process and can generate more accurate solitary waves with less attenuation compared to the goring methodology goring 1979 following the former s results the theoretical speed of the paddle for generating solitary waves is described by 1 d x p d t g η t x p h h η t x p 2 η t x p h η t x p where x p is the position of the paddle t is the time h is the water depth and η is the surface elevation calculated by a third order solitary wave theory grimshaw 1971 as can be seen in eq 2 2 η t x h sh 2 1 3 4 h h th 2 h h 2 5 8 th 2 101 80 sh 2 th 2 where 3 sh sech k c t x th tanh k c t x and h is the incident wave height g is the gravitational acceleration and k and c are the wave number and wave celerity calculated by eq 4 and eq 5 respectively 4 k 1 h 3 4 h h 1 5 8 h h 71 128 h h 2 5 c g h 1 1 2 h h 3 20 h h 2 3 56 h h 3 in our experiments the surface elevations measured by the wave gauge g1 x 5 m are regarded as the incident wave and the incident wave height is limited to within a small range to restrict the breaking region to be in the observation window and above the flat portion of the bar therefore the incident wave height h is set to 0 11 m 0 12 m and 0 13 m for the constant water depth h 0 20 m respectively fig 3 shows the measured incident waves and their theoretical values calculated by eq 2 the good agreement confirms that the laboratory waves are accurate approximations to the theoretical ones in addition the maximum standard deviations of the surface elevations recorded by wave gauge g1 for five repeat experiments with h 0 13 m 0 12 m and 0 11 m are 0 0030 m 0 0046 m and 0 0029 m respectively and crests of these measured surface elevations are shifted to the same time to remove the time differences between signals these small standard deviations of surface elevations indicate the excellent repeatability of the wave generation system 2 3 surface elevations across the breaking region as the solitary wave propagates across the bar it evolves into a plunging wave due to shoaling causing variations of surface elevations in space in view of the influence of surface elevations on the cylinder s properties surface elevations at the position of the cylinder s front face should be measured in detail however only a limited number of wave gauges g4 g8 are used to capture surface elevations across the breaker region compared with the wave gauges images recorded by the high speed camera greatly simplify the capture of surface elevations for any position hernández et al 2018 hence images are adopted to provide surface elevations for all cases the position of the high speed camera and the attendant illumination are presented in fig 1 a procedure to analyze the image to extract surface elevations is depicted in fig 4 and is described as follows a obtain raw images recorded by the high speed camera b use the open source software opencv opencv 2019 with python and call the function cv2 threshold to transform the gray scale stack of images into the binary stack of images with the threshold slicing algorithm howse and minichino 2015 kaehler and bradski 2016 c extract contours of the images using opencv with python using the function cv2 findcontours howse and minichino 2015 kaehler and bradski 2016 and convert pixel coordinates in the image to physical coordinates d collect surface elevations of images in time sequence at desired x positions transform surface elevations from the space domain into th0065 time domain note that only the upper surface elevation of the curling tongue is extracted to construct surface elevations in the time domain fig 5 a presents mean surface elevations obtained from the wave gauges in the breaking region for the case with h 0 13 m the wave gauges g4 g8 are placed along the flat portion of the bar and exhibit a steep forward wave front due to shoaling but show a rough similarity overall for the image analysis raw images are captured after the wave gauges are removed from the wave flume in order to remove their influence on the free surface with excellent repeatability of the wave generation process the images captured by the high speed camera are recorded once without the wave gauges fig 5 b shows the surface elevations obtained from the image analysis red dashed lines and their comparisons with the wave gauge measurements black solid lines as the sensors were not synchronized with the high speed camera the surface elevations are shifted in time so that the wave crests align very small discrepancies of the measured surface elevations are seen between the two techniques the meniscus at the glass wall due to surface tension effects and the binarization error in the step of fig 4 d cause small errors in the image analysis which contributes to these discrepancies the maximum difference is found at the highest surface elevations where fortitously there is a very small influence on the cylinder s properties seen in fig 10 therefore the image analysis is employed to provide surface elevations at the break region that are used to determine the cylinder s properties in subsection 3 2 two distinct points in the space domain are adopted to non dimensionalize the positions of the cylinder as captured by the high speed camera one is the incipient break point which is identified when most of the forward wave front becomes vertical bonmarin 1989 the other point is the impingement point which is defined as the location where the curling tongue pitches down and touches the water surface fig 6 shows the images of the incipient break point x b and the impinging point x i for the case with h 0 13 m and table 1 presents these two points for the different incident wave heights according to the definitions the break points and the impingement points in the experiment are determined approximately using the captured images thus with an excellent repeatability of the wave generation system the results for each wave height in table 1 are obtained from one test with the absence of the wave gauges and the test cylinder 2 4 experimental cases chan et al 1995 achieved different breaking phases of a plunging wave impacting a cylinder by shifting the cylinder to different spatial locations within the breaking region in the experiments pre determined solitary waves h 0 13 m 0 12 m and 0 11 m described in subsection 2 2 are generated repeatedly the test cylinder is shifted to desired positions above the flat portion of the bar for each case thus causing different breaking phases of the plunging solitary wave impacting the cylinder the position of the cylinder s front face in the x direction is set for different cases in total 13 cases corresponding to 13 positions of the cylinder are selected for each wave height each case is repeated five times cases with h 0 13 m are listed in table 2 and described presently cases 8 95 m through 9 05 m correspond to the wave front continuing to increase without wave breaking while passing the cylinder case 9 10 m is the wave front impacting the front face of the cylinder at the incipient break point additionally a wave tongue is forming and moving downward for cases 9 15 m through 9 40 m until it impinges on the water surface case 9 45 m experiments 9 50 m and 9 55 m are the breaking phases in which the wave breaks creates a strong spray of an air water mixture ahead of the plunged jet and subsequently impacts the cylinder fig 7 shows the images recorded by the high speed camera for some of these cases with h 0 13 m 3 analysis method faltinsen 2005 found not surprisingly that a large hydrodynamic force can excite structural reaction while the structural response can induce a fluid flow through a pressure field adversely affecting the hydrodynamic loading generally this mutual interaction i e fluid structure interaction between the loading and the response is classified by a strong or weak coupling lugni et al 2014 in strong coupling the kinematics and dynamics of the wave are affected significantly by the structural response however in weak coupling the hydrodynamic force is approximately equal to the wave force on the immobile structure in the experiments herein the largest displacement at the end of the cylinder under the wave force is approximately 1 8 mm which is obtained through image analysis seen in fig 8 therefore a weak coupling assumption is chosen for that small displacement of the cylinder hence a method is needed to eliminate the structural reaction s influence and extract the hydrodynamic forces from the measured forces the method used in this study is described as the following subsections 3 1 dynamics of the structure 3 1 1 viscously damped free vibration in the present study the actual structure including a cylinder connector between the cylinder and a load cell etc is considered as an idealized one story cantilever and single degree of freedom structure its properties are thus a result of three separate components at the top of the cylinder lumped mass m equivalent stiffness coefficient κ and equivalent damping coefficient c and for a linear elastic and single degree of freedom structure its displacement x t subjected to an external excitation p t in the direction of x t chopra 2012 is 6 m x t c x t κ x t p t where overdots denote differentiation with respect to time this equation is often called the equation of motion and these coefficients m κ and c are related closely to the properties and distribution of mass which are difficult to calculate in general especially for the damping term it is difficult to identify all the mechanisms that dissipate energy chopra 2012 free vibration tests or hammer tests on the actual structure are the most practical method to evaluate these terms in our experiments therefore the load cell with a linear stress strain transfer function was connected at the top of the cylinder recording forces in hammer tests or pluck tests and these hammer impacts were applied approximately at the half length of the cylinder the measured force f meas is k times the strains x t k is the stiffness of the load cell and f meas k x t hence the equation of motion expressed in terms of f meas is paulsen et al 2019 7 m f m e a s t k c f m e a s t k κ f m e a s t k κ f h y d r o t k where f hydro is the wave excitation and is zero for a viscously damped free vibration that gives 8 f m e a s t 2 ξ ω n f m e a s t ω n 2 f m e a s t 0 where the structure s properties including natural radian frequency ω n natural frequency f n and the damping ratio ξ are expressed as 9 ω n 2 π f n κ m ξ c 2 m ω n 3 1 2 the influence of surface elevation theoretically the natural frequency and damping ratio are determined by the stiffness the mass and their distribution along the height of the structure however for an idealized structure the natural frequency and damping ratio are regarded as constants this is the assumption used in most previous studies however when surface elevations are included the mass and its distribution change with respect to time thus affecting the natural frequency and damping ratio especially in shallow water and with large wave height large variations occur in the added mass compared to the total mass for a structure with distributed mass the natural frequency is given by chopra 2012 10 f n 1 2 π 0 l e i ψ z 2 d z 0 l m z ψ z 2 d z where ψ z is the shape function that describes the structure s deflection ei is the flexural rigidity m z is the mass per unit length and l is the height of the structure in view of surface elevations η the mass is written as m z η where z is the vertical coordinate with its origin at the bottom of the cylinder next the mass is divided into two parts m 1 z z 0 where the cylinder is at the still water level with the immersed depth z z0 and the mass is contributed both by the still water and the cylinder thus from z 0 to l and m 2 z η which includes only the surface elevation above swl z z 0 to z 0 η therefore the natural frequency f n z 0 η may be written as 11 f n z 0 η 1 2 π 0 l e i ψ z 2 d z 0 l m 1 z z 0 ψ z 2 d z z 0 z 0 η m 2 z η ψ z 2 d z furthermore it may also be written as 12 f n z 0 η f n 1 z 0 1 z 0 z 0 η m 2 z η ψ z 2 d z 0 l m 1 z z 0 ψ z 2 d z f n 1 z 0 1 χ z 0 η where f n1 z 0 is the natural frequency for a still water level z 0 defined by eq 13 χ z 0 η is the surface elevation dependent function χ η once the z 0 is known and when surface elevation is zero χ z 0 0 should be zero 13 f n 1 z 0 1 2 π 0 l e i ψ z 2 d z 0 l m 1 z ψ z 2 d z however the shape function ψ z is not available and the analytic expression of the surface elevation dependent function χ η is unknown thus a cubic polynomial function is assumed to represent the surface elevation dependent function eq 14 and hammer tests with the cylinder at different immersed depths are conducted to provide the data to determine the constants c 1 c 2 and c 3 through the least squares fit method note that in the experiments of plunging waves impacting the cylinder the immersed depth of the cylinder in still water is 9 5 cm z 0 9 5 cm and at z 0 9 5 cm the immersed depths 0 cm 4 5 cm 9 5 cm 13 5 cm 17 5 cm 21 5 cm and 25 5 cm in the hammer tests correspond to surface elevations η 10 cm 5 cm 0 cm 4 cm 8 cm 12 cm and 16 cm this correspondence is used throughout the entire study additionally η l indicates the ratio of the varying wet length induced by surface elevations to the length of the cylinder 14 χ z 0 η c 1 η l c 2 η l 2 c 3 η l 3 z 0 9 5 cm the entire hammer test for each immersed depth is repeated twice the first of which is presented in fig 9 the red dashed line in fig 9 presents the calculated forces that are determined with eq 8 and the evaluated natural frequency f n and damping ratio ξ to fit the measured forces the central difference method is applied to calculate the first and second order temporal derivatives of eq 8 the results show that the correlation coefficient for each immersed depth is larger than 0 9950 indicating that the evaluated f n and ξ are an approximate representation for the properties of the actual structure the second repeat hammer tests produce similar results and are not presented the evaluated f n and ξ of the two repeated experiments are averaged and adopted as the data to build the relation between the properties of the structure and the surface elevations fig 10 presents the experimental natural frequencies black hollow rectangles at different immersed depth surface elevations while the calculated natural frequencies red solid line is calculated based on eq 12 with the assumed surface elevation dependent function χ η of eq 14 constants in eq 14 are determined through the least square fit the surface elevation is non dimentionalized by the length of the cylinder the results show that the correlation coefficient between the experimental and the calculated data is 0 9996 indicating an appropriate choice of the assumed function to represent the surface elevation dependent function hence the relation between the natural frequency and surface elevation in eq 12 is written as 15 f n η t z 0 9 5 cm 19 44 1 2 86 η t l 0 28 η t l 2 12 16 η t l 3 for the damping ratio ξ both the structural damping and the hydrodynamic damping due to the boundary layer flow contribute to the response damping lugni et al 2014 and these two factors both are affected by the change of surface elevation due to the changed mass and wetted area of the cylinder it is very difficult to obtain an analytic expression for them lugni et al 2014 used a cubic polynomial function to fit the relationship between the measured damping ratio and the surface elevations for a vertical plate therefore a cubic polynomial function similar to eq 15 is used also in an attempt to approximate the relation between the damping ratio and the surface elevation in this study the values of ξ for the cylinder at different immersed water depth from the hammer tests are adopted to determine the constants the results are shown in fig 11 the surface elevation is non dimentionalized by the length of the cylinder when the surface elevations increase the damping ratio increases but exhibit additional scatter when the surface elevation ranges from 0 to 16 cm this might be due to an increasing water level which causes the natural frequency to decrease and hence there is more damping due to the additional water along the cylinder and as the natural frequency is the denominator in the definition of the damping ratio in eq 9 the decreased natural frequency has an increased damping ratio the red solid curve has a correlation coefficient of 0 9736 compared with the measured damping ratio that is calculated according to eq 16 although this equation represents a crude description of the relation between the damping ratio and surface elevation small variations of damping ratio exhibit less sensitivity on the measured forces and thus this equation is adopted 16 ξ η t z 0 9 5 cm 0 0272 1 1 12 η t l 18 71 η t l 2 55 38 η t l 3 3 2 removing the structural response to remove the structural response and extract the actual hydrodynamic force f hydro on the cylinder the relation between f meas and f hydro derived from eq 7 is rewritten as 17 1 ω n 2 f m e a s t 2 ξ ω n f m e a s t f m e a s t f h y d r o t and applied generally properties of the structure including the natural frequency and damping ratio are assumed to be constants ignoring the influence of surface elevation however the properties of most realistic structures are related to surface elevation therefore a crucial step to extend the method of extracting hydrodynamic forces based on eq 17 is to establish surface elevation dependent functions f n η and ξ η this is achieved in subsection 3 1 eq 15 and eq 16 and the surface elevations for desired positions of the cylinder are provided by the image analysis described in subsection 2 3 subsequently the temporal derivatives in eq 17 are obtained by the central difference method finally the actual hydrodynamic force f hydro is obtained and is shown in the next section section 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 measured and hydrodynamic forces in the time domain fig 12 presents the measured forces and the corresponding hydrodynamic forces for different breaking phases with h 0 13 m and the cylinder placed at 8 95 m 9 10 m and 9 55 m where these locations subjected the cylinder to the phases before the break point at the break point and after the wave tongue impinges the water surface respectively an additional figure is included the cylinder placed at 9 35 m shown in fig 12 c exhibits the maximum measured force as the load cell is not synchronized with the wave gauge the maximum measured forces are shifted to t 4 0 s for presentation the results in fig 12 a d show that the measured forces experience dramatic oscillations after reaching their peak values while the corresponding hydrodynamic forces show essentially no oscillations throughout the measurements indicating that the likely influence of the structural response is removed successfully even for cases with different breaking phases furthermore in fig 12 it can be seen that the temporal hydrodynamic forces have a rapid growth from zero to its peak value but a slow decrease to no load similar to the surface elevations presented in fig 5 and sharp triangular peaks with a short time duration are found in the hydrodynamic forces e g fig 12 c which belong to characteristics of slamming forces note further that two peaks are found in fig 12 d after the wave tongue impinges the water surface the first peak might be due to the strong spray of an air water mixture ahead of the plunged jet while the second peak might be caused by the water following the plunged jet note that after the plunging jet impinges the water surface the mixture of water and air influences the properties of the cylinder but the upper surface elevations are still used in determining the natural frequency and damping ratio which cause error in extracting the hydrodynamic forces 4 2 maximum measured and hydrodynamic forces with respect to different breaking phases and incident wave heights in the experiments all cases are divided by the cylinder s positions and the incident wave heights each case is repeated five times the standard deviations of the repeated measured forces to the maximum measured forces are less than 3 5 hence experimental data of the first repeat experiments are utilized in the following analysis as mentioned the forces f and the locations of the cylinder x coordinates are non dimensionalized as 18 f f ρ g d h 2 19 x x x b x i x b where x b is the incipient break point and x i is the impingement point fig 13 shows the maximum measured forces for the different breaking phases and the three incident wave heights each wave height includes 13 study cases as the propagation of the plunging solitary waves progresses the maximum force increases until it reaches its highest value when the wave tongue is curling downward but prior to its impingement on the water surface it is then followed by decay this trend is followed for the different incident wave heights except for case 9 55 m h 0 13 m the rightmost black rectangle in fig 13 this is due to the structural response which can amplify or diminish the measured forces actually during wave breaking the wave forces decrease due to the continuous dissipation of energy which should be strictly reflected in the hydrodynamic forces as for the hydrodynamic force fig 14 shows the maximum hydrodynamic forces for different breaking phases and the three incident wave heights each wave height includes 13 study cases a similar but more gentle increase is exhibited by the hydrodynamic forces compared with the measured forces the largest hydrodynamic force occurs when the plunging jet is curling down but prior to impinging on the water surface consistent with the highest measured forces 4 3 dynamic amplification factor daf in the experiments the measured forces are higher than the hydrodynamic forces subsequently the ratio between the maximum measured force and the maximum hydrodynamic force which is called the dynamic amplification factor daf is calculated as seen in fig 15 each wave height includes 13 study cases the daf can be viewed as an assessment of the effect of the structural interaction and a high daf indicates a drastic structural response that is harmful to structural safety actually whether the daf is larger than 1 0 or smaller than 1 0 it is a function of the impact rise time the impact duration and the natural period of the structure when the process of a force is so fast it is over well before the structure reaches its maximum deflection the daf is smaller than 1 0 the force is called an impulsive force a slow process of force ensures the structure has sufficient time to reach its maximum deflection and the daf equals almost 1 0 the force is called a quasi static force when the duration time of the force approximates the natural period of the structure the daf is above 1 0 the force is called a dynamic force chen et al 2019 in our experiments the daf provides some useful information first the daf of each case exceeds 1 0 even when the measurement is far before the break point indicating that dynamic forces can be induced by the waves even before wave breaking second the daf exhibits a similar relation to the maximum measured force and hydrodynamic force shown in figs 13 and 14 respectively this indicates that the strongest hydrodynamic force not only induces the strongest measured force but has the maximum daf as well the maximum daf is 1 44 as mentioned the daf is related to the impact rise time t r the impact duration t d and the natural period t n t n 1 f n additionally the shape of the pulse force e g rectangular pulse force triangular pulse force half cycle sine pulse force also influences the daf usually in impulsive pressure analyses a triangular pulse pressure is used to represent the measured pressure chen et al 2019 used a symmetrical triangular pulse force to approximate the hydrodynamic force on a vertical structure with an overhang in the experiments the hydrodynamic forces are also simplified as asymmetrical triangular pulse forces and definitions of the impact rise time and impact duration are adopted from the impulsive pressure analyses see fig 16 the impact rise time is defined as twice the time that the force takes to rise from its half maximal to maximal value the impact duration is defined as twice the interval of the first half maximal value to the second half maximal value lobovský et al 2014 shown in fig 16 for an asymmetrical triangular pulse force f t can be expressed as the linear superposition of three ramp increasing decreasing forces f 1 t f 2 t and f 3 t shown in fig 17 chopra 2012 f 0 is the peak value of the pulse force therefore the maximum daf of the asymmetrical triangular pulse force is expressed as 20 daf max f t f 0 max f 1 t f 2 t f 3 t f 0 t 0 to calculate the daf of the first ramp forces f 1 t f 0 the equation of motion is solved by duhamel s integral with the ramp force set as the external excitation seen in eq 21 note that the damping is set to zero due to its small influence on the maximum daf for a single pulse chopra 2012 21 f 1 t f 0 1 t r t sin 2 π t t n 2 π t n t 0 the main difference among the first the second and the third ramp forces is the initial point in time hence eq 21 can be used also for the expressions for f 2 t f 0 and f 3 t f 0 with time shifts and the results are 22 f 2 t f 0 1 t r 1 t d t r t t r sin 2 π t t r t n 2 π t n t t r 23 f 3 t f 0 1 t d t r t t d sin 2 π t t d t n 2 π t n t t d it is obvious that the daf of the asymmetrical triangular pulse force is a function of the impact rise time the impact duration and the period of the natural frequency the natural frequency represents the structural properties and hence could be used as a reference of time and the ratio of the impact rise time to the impact duration t r t d can reflect the characteristic of the asymmetrical triangular pulse force thus the ratio t d t n or t r t n is the only left parameter needed to be confirmed when calculating the daf fig 18 presents the daf of the asymmetrical triangular pulse force with respect to t r t d and t n the ratio t r t d is plotted on the ordinate against the ratios t d t n and t r t n on the abscissa respectively shown in fig 18 a and b the abscissa is set to a logarithmic coordinate the color bars next to the figures indicate the value of the daf the results show that when t d t n is smaller than 0 50 the daf is almost exclusively a function of the parameter t d t n which is a very convenient way to distinguish the impulsive force daf 1 0 from the dynamic force daf 1 0 and the quasi static force daf 1 0 impulsive forces are induced easily by the forces with very small time duration however when t r t n is larger than 0 70 the daf is more appropriately expressed by t r t n than t d t n subsequently with the definitions of the impact rise time and duration shown in fig 16 the t r and t d of the experiments are substituted into eqs 20 23 to calculate the daf for each case table 3 lists the impact rise time the impact duration the experimental daf and the calculated daf for the case with h 0 13 m the ratio t r t n ranges from 1 01 to 2 72 corresponding to the area in fig 18 b where the daf is linked more with t r than t d and the difference of the daf obtained from experiments and the calculated values are less than 20 of the calculated values this error might be due to the assumed triangular pulse force being inaccurate so as to evaluate the impact rise time causing a bias in the value of the daf 5 conclusions experiments of plunging solitary waves impacting a cylinder have been conducted a trapezoidal bar was integrated into the wave flume to cause the solitary wave to become a plunging solitary wave above the flat portion of the bar a vertical cylinder was placed and shifted to different positions along the flume to experience different breaking phases of the plunging solitary waves considering the structural response under high hydrodynamic forces a method is proposed to remove the influence of the cylinder s response on measured forces and thus isolate the hydrodynamic forces this method is implemented based on the equation of motion and the properties of the cylinder to determine the natural frequency and the damping ratio of the cylinder hammer pluck tests with the cylinder immersed in varying depths are conducted the natural frequency and damping ratio at different immersed depths are calculated through the least squares fit method then based on the solution of the natural frequency for a distributed mass the total mass is divided into two parts one of which is related to the still water condition the other of which is related to variations of the surface elevations evaluated by an assumed function finally the natural frequency and damping ratio under the influence of changing surface elevations are given and then utilized to remove the cylinder s response the results of the hydrodynamic forces exhibit essentially no oscillations indicating that the likely influence of the structural response is removed successfully subsequently the maximum measured forces the maximum hydrodynamic forces and the dynamic amplification factor daf are calculated for different breaking phases of the three plunging solitary waves the results show that for different breaking phases of the solitary plunging waves a similar trend is found among the measured forces hydrodynamic forces and the daf increasing initially until reaching their maximum values at the breaking phase when the wave tongue has curled down but has not yet impinged on the water surface and then decreasing this trend is realized for all three incident wave heights additionally the daf of all the cases exceeds 1 0 even far before the break point indicating that a non breaking wave can excite structural response the highest amplification factor reaches 1 44 which is helpful in structural design finally an asymmetrical triangular pulse force is assumed to approximate the hydrodynamic force and then is used to calculate the daf the daf with respect to different impact rise time and impact duration are derived and analyzed then the impact rise time and impact duration from experiments are used to calculate the daf which is compared with the experimental daf the results exhibit than a 20 difference between the experimental daf and the calculated daf although in our experiments the test cylinder is not strictly a model of a prototype structure two main findings are obtained and can be utilized in other engineering and research studies firstly the apparent success of extracting the hydrodynamic forces enables one to analyze not only the hydrodynamic force but also the impulse the former can provide data for numerical simulations the latter is a relevant physical variable when analyzing the impact of a wave on a structure with different physical scales führböter 1986 secondly the dynamic amplification factor could be estimated approximately based on eqs 20 23 once the properties of the real structure and

21975,solitary waves can evolve into breakers in the nearshore area generating strong destructive forces especially for plunging breakers in the present study experiments are conducted to investigate plunging solitary waves propagating over a trapezoidal bar and to quantify their subsequent hydrodynamic forces on a cylinder to do so solitary waves are designed to break at varying phases and to strike the cylinder differently in space to examine their hydrodynamic forces furthermore consideration of structural responses influencing measured forces for non rigid structures provides the basis of an equation of motion that facilitates the extraction of hydrodynamic forces from measured forces additionally the relation of cylinder s properties to surface elevations are evaluated and subsequently used to extract the hydrodynamic forces the results show that the measured forces extracted hydrodynamic forces and dynamic amplification factors daf ratio between the measured force and hydrodynamic force achieve their highest values approximately at the same breaking phase that is when the plunging jet has curled down but prior to its impingement on the water surface and this remains valid for different incident wave heights lastly with an assumed asymmetrical triangular pulse force theoretical daf is calculated and presents less than a 20 difference to the experimental daf keywords solitary waves plunging breaker phases vertical slender cylinder hydrodynamic forces structural responses 1 introduction tsunamis which are mainly caused by volcanic eruptions landslides or earthquakes may propagate from the deep sea to nearshore areas causing strong destructive forces on coastal structures e g tohoku earthquake tsunami in 2011 mori et al 2011 on the other hand due to refraction and shoaling gravity waves can evolve into steep waves or breakers and thus exert large hydrodynamic loads on support structures notably for plunging breakers to model tsunamis propagating over slopes experimentally and numerically although not strictly correct for earthquake generated waves the solitary wave theory has been employed frequently due to its stable form and its similar properties to tsunami crests goring 1979 xuan et al 2013 yao et al 2018 yeh et al 1994 mo et al 2013 simulated numerically plunging solitary waves impacting a slender cylinder on a constant slope via filtered navier stokes equations combined with a large eddy simulations les model the simulated surface elevations and velocity fields were found to fit well with the experimental results that were measured through particle image velocimetry piv subsequently the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations together with a k ε model was used to examine the same case while the volume of fluid vof method and the level set method lsm were used to process the free surface by xiao and huang 2015 and chella et al 2017 respectively however plunging breakers evolve with rapid spatial temporal variations in both wave geometry and wave kinematics fine meshes and short time steps are needed in numerical simulations which consume huge computation time especially for 3 d cases such as breakers impacting a cylinder to improve computational efficiency xie et al 2017 employed an adaptive unstructured mesh to model the 3 d plunging solitary wave striking a cylinder however assumptions for simplifying calculations such as eddy viscosity models and incompressible flow were adopted which provided a preliminary understanding of the plunging wave forces and laboratory physical models still play a pivotal role providing reliable results as regards these complex hydrodynamic problems however relevant experiments remain limited for example the experiments of mo et al 2013 focused on the flow field but did not consider the wave forces thus in this study experiments are conducted to investigate plunging solitary waves and their attendant hydrodynamic forces on a cylinder as aforementioned plunging breakers evolve both in space and time the wave height increases until the wave front aligns vertically then a plunging jet develops and impinges on the water surface causing a splash up of the water these different breaking phases excite varying forces on structures chan et al 1995 tai et al 2019 chan et al 1995 found significant variability of the pressure characteristics for different breaking phases of a plunging breaker on a vertical cylinder wienke and oumeraci 2005 considered that the measured forces of different breaking phases could be superposed linearly by quasi static forces and dynamic forces with only quasi static forces remaining once the waves broke downstream of the cylinder tai et al 2019 found that variations in measured forces for different breaking phase were contributed mostly by the dynamic forces and that the quasi static forces were approximately the same until the wave tongue impinges on the water surface however these plunging waves were generated by dispersive focusing wave groups for plunging solitary waves as far as the authors are aware to date only numerical studies have contributed to the literature hence this is another objective of this study it is important to realize that the hydrodynamic force can be sufficiently large i e above a threshold value to induce structural responses also this has been called the hydroelastic effect faltinsen 2005 actually this is a very common phenomenon in coastal and offshore engineering and occurs for monopile wind turbines and other elevated coastal offshore structures for example de ridder et al 2011 found that even moderately steep waves can excite a significant vibration of the monopile wind turbine in shallow water in the experiments presented here the forces of plunging solitary waves did excite the cylinder s response although the structural response of elastic components is expected it contaminates the forces recorded e g by load cells and thus hampers isolating the true hydrodynamic forces on the test model or the prototype wienke and oumeraci 2005 considered the dynamic force as a convolution integral between the response function of a cylinder and the impact force and then used deconvolution to eliminate the cylinder s response however the impact force in their study was calculated by a theoretical equation by directly processing the measured forces and using the equation of motion paulsen et al 2019 determined a relation between the measured forces and the hydrodynamic forces for a monopile wind turbine the use of the equation of motion was crucial in filtering the monopile s response however it is noted that both wienke and oumeraci 2005 and paulsen et al 2019 ignored the influence of surface elevations on the cylinder s response it is well known that surface elevations can influence the response functions of a structure through so called added mass especially in shallow water and with large wave height as there are large variations in added mass chopra 2012 lugni et al 2014 considered the effects of surface elevation on the response of a deformable vertical plate based on the equation of motion during shallow liquid sloshing the added mass was calculated using an incompressible potential flow numerical model nevertheless their study was focused on a flat structure and more investigation of the influence of surface elevations that generate cylinder s response are needed therefore in this study for the first time a method that considers the surface elevations based on the equation of motion is proposed and utilized to obtain the attendant hydrodynamic forces of plunging solitary waves on a cylinder unlike the previous study of tai et al 2019 plunging solitary waves are generated using shoaling instead of dispersive focusing to create breaking wave groups additionally wave forces are analyzed further based on the properties of the test cylinder rather than data analysis methods such as the fourier transform and the wavelet transform the paper is divided into five sections following the introduction described in section 1 experiments are discussed carefully and in detail in section 2 subsequently the method to separate the hydrodynamic forces from the combined forces is presented in section 3 then results are given in section 4 finally some conclusions are presented in section 5 2 experiments 2 1 experimental setup experiments are performed in a wave flume at the dalian university of technology the wave flume used is 22 m long 0 45 m wide and filled with tap water to a depth of 0 20 m at one end of the flume a motor driver piston type wave maker is positioned to generate wave trains at the downstream end a beach made with plastic horsehair is placed to help mitigate wave reflection to cause a solitary wave to morph into a plunging breaker a spanwise uniform longitudinally asymmetric trapezoidal plexiglass bar is placed in the middle of the flume the use of a trapezoidal bar rather than a simple slope is so that the flat portion of the bar reduces the influence of the slope and reflected waves thus allowing the cylinder to be placed longitudinally in various positions along the bar to alter the phase of the wave forcing as no solitary wave breaks for plane slopes larger than 12 slope 1 4 7 grilli et al 1997 and considering the size limitation of the wave flume a slope of 1 5 is used for the upstream slope of the trapezoidal bar this then causes the plunging solitary waves to break in the observation window as can be seen in fig 1 the size of the flat portion of the bar was tested prior to the experiments insuring that it was sufficiently long for the plunging solitary waves to break there this includes the breaking phases of the incipient break point the curling jet the jet impinging the free water surface and the spray of air water mixture the x coordinate is set positive in the wave propagation direction with the origin located at the mean paddle position the test cylinder made of a plexiglass pipe is 0 56 m high 0 06 m in diameter d and 0 005 m in wall thickness and it is placed 0 005 m above the flat portion of the bar the top of the cylinder is fixed to the load cell through a plastic connector a and screws this load cell is mounted beneath a track slide through another plastic connector b the slide allows the cylinder to be fixed along the flume through the slide rail which is mounted on a square steel box beam once positioned via connector b i e fixed to the slide it is clamped onto the square steel box beam with screws the square steel box beam is fixed rigidly to the wave flume a sketch of the details of the connections among the rigid frame the slide the load cell and the test cylinder is depicted in fig 2 in the present experiments only integral inline forces and wave surface elevations are measured a load cell manufactured by the yangzhou institute of electronic technology co ltd type kd43030 and can measure forces to 150 n with an accuracy of 0 01 n is used for the force measurement the fundamental resonant frequency of the load cell is 1000 hz the sample rate is 500 hz temporal surface elevations at desired locations along the flume are collected using 10 capacitive wave gauges g1 g2 g10 manufactured by techno service co ltd type twg 600s as shown in fig 1 a all wave gauges had an accuracy of 0 01 cm and are sampled at 50 hz the load cell and wave gauges are calibrated carefully prior to and during the experiments moreover prior to and during the wave breaking surface profiles are captured by a high speed camera manufactured by pco imaging technology co ltd type pco dimax s4 this camera is seated on one side of the flume perpendicular to the glass walls focused on the wet inside surface of the glass wall closest to it it recorded images 2016 pixels 1252 pixels at 1000 frames per second a scale factor of 0 353 mm pixel is found to convert pixel coordinates in the image to physical coordinates opposite to the camera three halogen lamps with a maximum total power of 3000 w illuminate a translucent soft film thus providing backlighting as shown in fig 1 b additionally the cylinder was painted black to contrast the cylinder and the breaking wave surface 2 2 solitary wave generation and breaking over a trapezoidal bar the adopted methodology for solitary waves generation is that proposed by malek mohammadi and testik 2010 which considers surges at the paddle during the generation process and can generate more accurate solitary waves with less attenuation compared to the goring methodology goring 1979 following the former s results the theoretical speed of the paddle for generating solitary waves is described by 1 d x p d t g η t x p h h η t x p 2 η t x p h η t x p where x p is the position of the paddle t is the time h is the water depth and η is the surface elevation calculated by a third order solitary wave theory grimshaw 1971 as can be seen in eq 2 2 η t x h sh 2 1 3 4 h h th 2 h h 2 5 8 th 2 101 80 sh 2 th 2 where 3 sh sech k c t x th tanh k c t x and h is the incident wave height g is the gravitational acceleration and k and c are the wave number and wave celerity calculated by eq 4 and eq 5 respectively 4 k 1 h 3 4 h h 1 5 8 h h 71 128 h h 2 5 c g h 1 1 2 h h 3 20 h h 2 3 56 h h 3 in our experiments the surface elevations measured by the wave gauge g1 x 5 m are regarded as the incident wave and the incident wave height is limited to within a small range to restrict the breaking region to be in the observation window and above the flat portion of the bar therefore the incident wave height h is set to 0 11 m 0 12 m and 0 13 m for the constant water depth h 0 20 m respectively fig 3 shows the measured incident waves and their theoretical values calculated by eq 2 the good agreement confirms that the laboratory waves are accurate approximations to the theoretical ones in addition the maximum standard deviations of the surface elevations recorded by wave gauge g1 for five repeat experiments with h 0 13 m 0 12 m and 0 11 m are 0 0030 m 0 0046 m and 0 0029 m respectively and crests of these measured surface elevations are shifted to the same time to remove the time differences between signals these small standard deviations of surface elevations indicate the excellent repeatability of the wave generation system 2 3 surface elevations across the breaking region as the solitary wave propagates across the bar it evolves into a plunging wave due to shoaling causing variations of surface elevations in space in view of the influence of surface elevations on the cylinder s properties surface elevations at the position of the cylinder s front face should be measured in detail however only a limited number of wave gauges g4 g8 are used to capture surface elevations across the breaker region compared with the wave gauges images recorded by the high speed camera greatly simplify the capture of surface elevations for any position hernández et al 2018 hence images are adopted to provide surface elevations for all cases the position of the high speed camera and the attendant illumination are presented in fig 1 a procedure to analyze the image to extract surface elevations is depicted in fig 4 and is described as follows a obtain raw images recorded by the high speed camera b use the open source software opencv opencv 2019 with python and call the function cv2 threshold to transform the gray scale stack of images into the binary stack of images with the threshold slicing algorithm howse and minichino 2015 kaehler and bradski 2016 c extract contours of the images using opencv with python using the function cv2 findcontours howse and minichino 2015 kaehler and bradski 2016 and convert pixel coordinates in the image to physical coordinates d collect surface elevations of images in time sequence at desired x positions transform surface elevations from the space domain into th0065 time domain note that only the upper surface elevation of the curling tongue is extracted to construct surface elevations in the time domain fig 5 a presents mean surface elevations obtained from the wave gauges in the breaking region for the case with h 0 13 m the wave gauges g4 g8 are placed along the flat portion of the bar and exhibit a steep forward wave front due to shoaling but show a rough similarity overall for the image analysis raw images are captured after the wave gauges are removed from the wave flume in order to remove their influence on the free surface with excellent repeatability of the wave generation process the images captured by the high speed camera are recorded once without the wave gauges fig 5 b shows the surface elevations obtained from the image analysis red dashed lines and their comparisons with the wave gauge measurements black solid lines as the sensors were not synchronized with the high speed camera the surface elevations are shifted in time so that the wave crests align very small discrepancies of the measured surface elevations are seen between the two techniques the meniscus at the glass wall due to surface tension effects and the binarization error in the step of fig 4 d cause small errors in the image analysis which contributes to these discrepancies the maximum difference is found at the highest surface elevations where fortitously there is a very small influence on the cylinder s properties seen in fig 10 therefore the image analysis is employed to provide surface elevations at the break region that are used to determine the cylinder s properties in subsection 3 2 two distinct points in the space domain are adopted to non dimensionalize the positions of the cylinder as captured by the high speed camera one is the incipient break point which is identified when most of the forward wave front becomes vertical bonmarin 1989 the other point is the impingement point which is defined as the location where the curling tongue pitches down and touches the water surface fig 6 shows the images of the incipient break point x b and the impinging point x i for the case with h 0 13 m and table 1 presents these two points for the different incident wave heights according to the definitions the break points and the impingement points in the experiment are determined approximately using the captured images thus with an excellent repeatability of the wave generation system the results for each wave height in table 1 are obtained from one test with the absence of the wave gauges and the test cylinder 2 4 experimental cases chan et al 1995 achieved different breaking phases of a plunging wave impacting a cylinder by shifting the cylinder to different spatial locations within the breaking region in the experiments pre determined solitary waves h 0 13 m 0 12 m and 0 11 m described in subsection 2 2 are generated repeatedly the test cylinder is shifted to desired positions above the flat portion of the bar for each case thus causing different breaking phases of the plunging solitary wave impacting the cylinder the position of the cylinder s front face in the x direction is set for different cases in total 13 cases corresponding to 13 positions of the cylinder are selected for each wave height each case is repeated five times cases with h 0 13 m are listed in table 2 and described presently cases 8 95 m through 9 05 m correspond to the wave front continuing to increase without wave breaking while passing the cylinder case 9 10 m is the wave front impacting the front face of the cylinder at the incipient break point additionally a wave tongue is forming and moving downward for cases 9 15 m through 9 40 m until it impinges on the water surface case 9 45 m experiments 9 50 m and 9 55 m are the breaking phases in which the wave breaks creates a strong spray of an air water mixture ahead of the plunged jet and subsequently impacts the cylinder fig 7 shows the images recorded by the high speed camera for some of these cases with h 0 13 m 3 analysis method faltinsen 2005 found not surprisingly that a large hydrodynamic force can excite structural reaction while the structural response can induce a fluid flow through a pressure field adversely affecting the hydrodynamic loading generally this mutual interaction i e fluid structure interaction between the loading and the response is classified by a strong or weak coupling lugni et al 2014 in strong coupling the kinematics and dynamics of the wave are affected significantly by the structural response however in weak coupling the hydrodynamic force is approximately equal to the wave force on the immobile structure in the experiments herein the largest displacement at the end of the cylinder under the wave force is approximately 1 8 mm which is obtained through image analysis seen in fig 8 therefore a weak coupling assumption is chosen for that small displacement of the cylinder hence a method is needed to eliminate the structural reaction s influence and extract the hydrodynamic forces from the measured forces the method used in this study is described as the following subsections 3 1 dynamics of the structure 3 1 1 viscously damped free vibration in the present study the actual structure including a cylinder connector between the cylinder and a load cell etc is considered as an idealized one story cantilever and single degree of freedom structure its properties are thus a result of three separate components at the top of the cylinder lumped mass m equivalent stiffness coefficient κ and equivalent damping coefficient c and for a linear elastic and single degree of freedom structure its displacement x t subjected to an external excitation p t in the direction of x t chopra 2012 is 6 m x t c x t κ x t p t where overdots denote differentiation with respect to time this equation is often called the equation of motion and these coefficients m κ and c are related closely to the properties and distribution of mass which are difficult to calculate in general especially for the damping term it is difficult to identify all the mechanisms that dissipate energy chopra 2012 free vibration tests or hammer tests on the actual structure are the most practical method to evaluate these terms in our experiments therefore the load cell with a linear stress strain transfer function was connected at the top of the cylinder recording forces in hammer tests or pluck tests and these hammer impacts were applied approximately at the half length of the cylinder the measured force f meas is k times the strains x t k is the stiffness of the load cell and f meas k x t hence the equation of motion expressed in terms of f meas is paulsen et al 2019 7 m f m e a s t k c f m e a s t k κ f m e a s t k κ f h y d r o t k where f hydro is the wave excitation and is zero for a viscously damped free vibration that gives 8 f m e a s t 2 ξ ω n f m e a s t ω n 2 f m e a s t 0 where the structure s properties including natural radian frequency ω n natural frequency f n and the damping ratio ξ are expressed as 9 ω n 2 π f n κ m ξ c 2 m ω n 3 1 2 the influence of surface elevation theoretically the natural frequency and damping ratio are determined by the stiffness the mass and their distribution along the height of the structure however for an idealized structure the natural frequency and damping ratio are regarded as constants this is the assumption used in most previous studies however when surface elevations are included the mass and its distribution change with respect to time thus affecting the natural frequency and damping ratio especially in shallow water and with large wave height large variations occur in the added mass compared to the total mass for a structure with distributed mass the natural frequency is given by chopra 2012 10 f n 1 2 π 0 l e i ψ z 2 d z 0 l m z ψ z 2 d z where ψ z is the shape function that describes the structure s deflection ei is the flexural rigidity m z is the mass per unit length and l is the height of the structure in view of surface elevations η the mass is written as m z η where z is the vertical coordinate with its origin at the bottom of the cylinder next the mass is divided into two parts m 1 z z 0 where the cylinder is at the still water level with the immersed depth z z0 and the mass is contributed both by the still water and the cylinder thus from z 0 to l and m 2 z η which includes only the surface elevation above swl z z 0 to z 0 η therefore the natural frequency f n z 0 η may be written as 11 f n z 0 η 1 2 π 0 l e i ψ z 2 d z 0 l m 1 z z 0 ψ z 2 d z z 0 z 0 η m 2 z η ψ z 2 d z furthermore it may also be written as 12 f n z 0 η f n 1 z 0 1 z 0 z 0 η m 2 z η ψ z 2 d z 0 l m 1 z z 0 ψ z 2 d z f n 1 z 0 1 χ z 0 η where f n1 z 0 is the natural frequency for a still water level z 0 defined by eq 13 χ z 0 η is the surface elevation dependent function χ η once the z 0 is known and when surface elevation is zero χ z 0 0 should be zero 13 f n 1 z 0 1 2 π 0 l e i ψ z 2 d z 0 l m 1 z ψ z 2 d z however the shape function ψ z is not available and the analytic expression of the surface elevation dependent function χ η is unknown thus a cubic polynomial function is assumed to represent the surface elevation dependent function eq 14 and hammer tests with the cylinder at different immersed depths are conducted to provide the data to determine the constants c 1 c 2 and c 3 through the least squares fit method note that in the experiments of plunging waves impacting the cylinder the immersed depth of the cylinder in still water is 9 5 cm z 0 9 5 cm and at z 0 9 5 cm the immersed depths 0 cm 4 5 cm 9 5 cm 13 5 cm 17 5 cm 21 5 cm and 25 5 cm in the hammer tests correspond to surface elevations η 10 cm 5 cm 0 cm 4 cm 8 cm 12 cm and 16 cm this correspondence is used throughout the entire study additionally η l indicates the ratio of the varying wet length induced by surface elevations to the length of the cylinder 14 χ z 0 η c 1 η l c 2 η l 2 c 3 η l 3 z 0 9 5 cm the entire hammer test for each immersed depth is repeated twice the first of which is presented in fig 9 the red dashed line in fig 9 presents the calculated forces that are determined with eq 8 and the evaluated natural frequency f n and damping ratio ξ to fit the measured forces the central difference method is applied to calculate the first and second order temporal derivatives of eq 8 the results show that the correlation coefficient for each immersed depth is larger than 0 9950 indicating that the evaluated f n and ξ are an approximate representation for the properties of the actual structure the second repeat hammer tests produce similar results and are not presented the evaluated f n and ξ of the two repeated experiments are averaged and adopted as the data to build the relation between the properties of the structure and the surface elevations fig 10 presents the experimental natural frequencies black hollow rectangles at different immersed depth surface elevations while the calculated natural frequencies red solid line is calculated based on eq 12 with the assumed surface elevation dependent function χ η of eq 14 constants in eq 14 are determined through the least square fit the surface elevation is non dimentionalized by the length of the cylinder the results show that the correlation coefficient between the experimental and the calculated data is 0 9996 indicating an appropriate choice of the assumed function to represent the surface elevation dependent function hence the relation between the natural frequency and surface elevation in eq 12 is written as 15 f n η t z 0 9 5 cm 19 44 1 2 86 η t l 0 28 η t l 2 12 16 η t l 3 for the damping ratio ξ both the structural damping and the hydrodynamic damping due to the boundary layer flow contribute to the response damping lugni et al 2014 and these two factors both are affected by the change of surface elevation due to the changed mass and wetted area of the cylinder it is very difficult to obtain an analytic expression for them lugni et al 2014 used a cubic polynomial function to fit the relationship between the measured damping ratio and the surface elevations for a vertical plate therefore a cubic polynomial function similar to eq 15 is used also in an attempt to approximate the relation between the damping ratio and the surface elevation in this study the values of ξ for the cylinder at different immersed water depth from the hammer tests are adopted to determine the constants the results are shown in fig 11 the surface elevation is non dimentionalized by the length of the cylinder when the surface elevations increase the damping ratio increases but exhibit additional scatter when the surface elevation ranges from 0 to 16 cm this might be due to an increasing water level which causes the natural frequency to decrease and hence there is more damping due to the additional water along the cylinder and as the natural frequency is the denominator in the definition of the damping ratio in eq 9 the decreased natural frequency has an increased damping ratio the red solid curve has a correlation coefficient of 0 9736 compared with the measured damping ratio that is calculated according to eq 16 although this equation represents a crude description of the relation between the damping ratio and surface elevation small variations of damping ratio exhibit less sensitivity on the measured forces and thus this equation is adopted 16 ξ η t z 0 9 5 cm 0 0272 1 1 12 η t l 18 71 η t l 2 55 38 η t l 3 3 2 removing the structural response to remove the structural response and extract the actual hydrodynamic force f hydro on the cylinder the relation between f meas and f hydro derived from eq 7 is rewritten as 17 1 ω n 2 f m e a s t 2 ξ ω n f m e a s t f m e a s t f h y d r o t and applied generally properties of the structure including the natural frequency and damping ratio are assumed to be constants ignoring the influence of surface elevation however the properties of most realistic structures are related to surface elevation therefore a crucial step to extend the method of extracting hydrodynamic forces based on eq 17 is to establish surface elevation dependent functions f n η and ξ η this is achieved in subsection 3 1 eq 15 and eq 16 and the surface elevations for desired positions of the cylinder are provided by the image analysis described in subsection 2 3 subsequently the temporal derivatives in eq 17 are obtained by the central difference method finally the actual hydrodynamic force f hydro is obtained and is shown in the next section section 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 measured and hydrodynamic forces in the time domain fig 12 presents the measured forces and the corresponding hydrodynamic forces for different breaking phases with h 0 13 m and the cylinder placed at 8 95 m 9 10 m and 9 55 m where these locations subjected the cylinder to the phases before the break point at the break point and after the wave tongue impinges the water surface respectively an additional figure is included the cylinder placed at 9 35 m shown in fig 12 c exhibits the maximum measured force as the load cell is not synchronized with the wave gauge the maximum measured forces are shifted to t 4 0 s for presentation the results in fig 12 a d show that the measured forces experience dramatic oscillations after reaching their peak values while the corresponding hydrodynamic forces show essentially no oscillations throughout the measurements indicating that the likely influence of the structural response is removed successfully even for cases with different breaking phases furthermore in fig 12 it can be seen that the temporal hydrodynamic forces have a rapid growth from zero to its peak value but a slow decrease to no load similar to the surface elevations presented in fig 5 and sharp triangular peaks with a short time duration are found in the hydrodynamic forces e g fig 12 c which belong to characteristics of slamming forces note further that two peaks are found in fig 12 d after the wave tongue impinges the water surface the first peak might be due to the strong spray of an air water mixture ahead of the plunged jet while the second peak might be caused by the water following the plunged jet note that after the plunging jet impinges the water surface the mixture of water and air influences the properties of the cylinder but the upper surface elevations are still used in determining the natural frequency and damping ratio which cause error in extracting the hydrodynamic forces 4 2 maximum measured and hydrodynamic forces with respect to different breaking phases and incident wave heights in the experiments all cases are divided by the cylinder s positions and the incident wave heights each case is repeated five times the standard deviations of the repeated measured forces to the maximum measured forces are less than 3 5 hence experimental data of the first repeat experiments are utilized in the following analysis as mentioned the forces f and the locations of the cylinder x coordinates are non dimensionalized as 18 f f ρ g d h 2 19 x x x b x i x b where x b is the incipient break point and x i is the impingement point fig 13 shows the maximum measured forces for the different breaking phases and the three incident wave heights each wave height includes 13 study cases as the propagation of the plunging solitary waves progresses the maximum force increases until it reaches its highest value when the wave tongue is curling downward but prior to its impingement on the water surface it is then followed by decay this trend is followed for the different incident wave heights except for case 9 55 m h 0 13 m the rightmost black rectangle in fig 13 this is due to the structural response which can amplify or diminish the measured forces actually during wave breaking the wave forces decrease due to the continuous dissipation of energy which should be strictly reflected in the hydrodynamic forces as for the hydrodynamic force fig 14 shows the maximum hydrodynamic forces for different breaking phases and the three incident wave heights each wave height includes 13 study cases a similar but more gentle increase is exhibited by the hydrodynamic forces compared with the measured forces the largest hydrodynamic force occurs when the plunging jet is curling down but prior to impinging on the water surface consistent with the highest measured forces 4 3 dynamic amplification factor daf in the experiments the measured forces are higher than the hydrodynamic forces subsequently the ratio between the maximum measured force and the maximum hydrodynamic force which is called the dynamic amplification factor daf is calculated as seen in fig 15 each wave height includes 13 study cases the daf can be viewed as an assessment of the effect of the structural interaction and a high daf indicates a drastic structural response that is harmful to structural safety actually whether the daf is larger than 1 0 or smaller than 1 0 it is a function of the impact rise time the impact duration and the natural period of the structure when the process of a force is so fast it is over well before the structure reaches its maximum deflection the daf is smaller than 1 0 the force is called an impulsive force a slow process of force ensures the structure has sufficient time to reach its maximum deflection and the daf equals almost 1 0 the force is called a quasi static force when the duration time of the force approximates the natural period of the structure the daf is above 1 0 the force is called a dynamic force chen et al 2019 in our experiments the daf provides some useful information first the daf of each case exceeds 1 0 even when the measurement is far before the break point indicating that dynamic forces can be induced by the waves even before wave breaking second the daf exhibits a similar relation to the maximum measured force and hydrodynamic force shown in figs 13 and 14 respectively this indicates that the strongest hydrodynamic force not only induces the strongest measured force but has the maximum daf as well the maximum daf is 1 44 as mentioned the daf is related to the impact rise time t r the impact duration t d and the natural period t n t n 1 f n additionally the shape of the pulse force e g rectangular pulse force triangular pulse force half cycle sine pulse force also influences the daf usually in impulsive pressure analyses a triangular pulse pressure is used to represent the measured pressure chen et al 2019 used a symmetrical triangular pulse force to approximate the hydrodynamic force on a vertical structure with an overhang in the experiments the hydrodynamic forces are also simplified as asymmetrical triangular pulse forces and definitions of the impact rise time and impact duration are adopted from the impulsive pressure analyses see fig 16 the impact rise time is defined as twice the time that the force takes to rise from its half maximal to maximal value the impact duration is defined as twice the interval of the first half maximal value to the second half maximal value lobovský et al 2014 shown in fig 16 for an asymmetrical triangular pulse force f t can be expressed as the linear superposition of three ramp increasing decreasing forces f 1 t f 2 t and f 3 t shown in fig 17 chopra 2012 f 0 is the peak value of the pulse force therefore the maximum daf of the asymmetrical triangular pulse force is expressed as 20 daf max f t f 0 max f 1 t f 2 t f 3 t f 0 t 0 to calculate the daf of the first ramp forces f 1 t f 0 the equation of motion is solved by duhamel s integral with the ramp force set as the external excitation seen in eq 21 note that the damping is set to zero due to its small influence on the maximum daf for a single pulse chopra 2012 21 f 1 t f 0 1 t r t sin 2 π t t n 2 π t n t 0 the main difference among the first the second and the third ramp forces is the initial point in time hence eq 21 can be used also for the expressions for f 2 t f 0 and f 3 t f 0 with time shifts and the results are 22 f 2 t f 0 1 t r 1 t d t r t t r sin 2 π t t r t n 2 π t n t t r 23 f 3 t f 0 1 t d t r t t d sin 2 π t t d t n 2 π t n t t d it is obvious that the daf of the asymmetrical triangular pulse force is a function of the impact rise time the impact duration and the period of the natural frequency the natural frequency represents the structural properties and hence could be used as a reference of time and the ratio of the impact rise time to the impact duration t r t d can reflect the characteristic of the asymmetrical triangular pulse force thus the ratio t d t n or t r t n is the only left parameter needed to be confirmed when calculating the daf fig 18 presents the daf of the asymmetrical triangular pulse force with respect to t r t d and t n the ratio t r t d is plotted on the ordinate against the ratios t d t n and t r t n on the abscissa respectively shown in fig 18 a and b the abscissa is set to a logarithmic coordinate the color bars next to the figures indicate the value of the daf the results show that when t d t n is smaller than 0 50 the daf is almost exclusively a function of the parameter t d t n which is a very convenient way to distinguish the impulsive force daf 1 0 from the dynamic force daf 1 0 and the quasi static force daf 1 0 impulsive forces are induced easily by the forces with very small time duration however when t r t n is larger than 0 70 the daf is more appropriately expressed by t r t n than t d t n subsequently with the definitions of the impact rise time and duration shown in fig 16 the t r and t d of the experiments are substituted into eqs 20 23 to calculate the daf for each case table 3 lists the impact rise time the impact duration the experimental daf and the calculated daf for the case with h 0 13 m the ratio t r t n ranges from 1 01 to 2 72 corresponding to the area in fig 18 b where the daf is linked more with t r than t d and the difference of the daf obtained from experiments and the calculated values are less than 20 of the calculated values this error might be due to the assumed triangular pulse force being inaccurate so as to evaluate the impact rise time causing a bias in the value of the daf 5 conclusions experiments of plunging solitary waves impacting a cylinder have been conducted a trapezoidal bar was integrated into the wave flume to cause the solitary wave to become a plunging solitary wave above the flat portion of the bar a vertical cylinder was placed and shifted to different positions along the flume to experience different breaking phases of the plunging solitary waves considering the structural response under high hydrodynamic forces a method is proposed to remove the influence of the cylinder s response on measured forces and thus isolate the hydrodynamic forces this method is implemented based on the equation of motion and the properties of the cylinder to determine the natural frequency and the damping ratio of the cylinder hammer pluck tests with the cylinder immersed in varying depths are conducted the natural frequency and damping ratio at different immersed depths are calculated through the least squares fit method then based on the solution of the natural frequency for a distributed mass the total mass is divided into two parts one of which is related to the still water condition the other of which is related to variations of the surface elevations evaluated by an assumed function finally the natural frequency and damping ratio under the influence of changing surface elevations are given and then utilized to remove the cylinder s response the results of the hydrodynamic forces exhibit essentially no oscillations indicating that the likely influence of the structural response is removed successfully subsequently the maximum measured forces the maximum hydrodynamic forces and the dynamic amplification factor daf are calculated for different breaking phases of the three plunging solitary waves the results show that for different breaking phases of the solitary plunging waves a similar trend is found among the measured forces hydrodynamic forces and the daf increasing initially until reaching their maximum values at the breaking phase when the wave tongue has curled down but has not yet impinged on the water surface and then decreasing this trend is realized for all three incident wave heights additionally the daf of all the cases exceeds 1 0 even far before the break point indicating that a non breaking wave can excite structural response the highest amplification factor reaches 1 44 which is helpful in structural design finally an asymmetrical triangular pulse force is assumed to approximate the hydrodynamic force and then is used to calculate the daf the daf with respect to different impact rise time and impact duration are derived and analyzed then the impact rise time and impact duration from experiments are used to calculate the daf which is compared with the experimental daf the results exhibit than a 20 difference between the experimental daf and the calculated daf although in our experiments the test cylinder is not strictly a model of a prototype structure two main findings are obtained and can be utilized in other engineering and research studies firstly the apparent success of extracting the hydrodynamic forces enables one to analyze not only the hydrodynamic force but also the impulse the former can provide data for numerical simulations the latter is a relevant physical variable when analyzing the impact of a wave on a structure with different physical scales führböter 1986 secondly the dynamic amplification factor could be estimated approximately based on eqs 20 23 once the properties of the real structure and the assumed asymmetrical triangular pulse force load are given credit authorship contribution statement yuxiang ma conceptualization methodology writing original draft bing tai data curation formal

21976,ship collision is one of the important causes of maritime accidents collision risk assessment is necessary for navigator or automatic navigating system to recognize the risk when facing a specific encounter situation and make the proper decision for the following collision avoidance this paper proposes a quantitative ship collision risk assessment algorithm that is based on support vector machine svm technology the algorithm reconsiders the margin between ship domains of own ship os and the target ship ts that is used to model the probability of collision moreover the consequence of the assumed collision is also considered in the algorithm which is modeled by the interaction force thus the continuous and quantitative collision risk can be obtained by using the states of ships so that some weaknesses of the conventional risk assessment methods such as the ship domain sd methods and the closest point of approach cpa based methods can be overcome the effectiveness of this approach is examined by simulation studies which show the advantages of the new risk assessment algorithm keywords collision risk assessment collision avoidance ship domain svm 1 introduction recently many ship collision accidents warn us to rethink our ship collision avoidance system since many collisions are caused by human error as shown in hanzu pazara et al 2008 about 89 96 of collisions are caused at least in part by some form of human error in order to enhance the quality and effectiveness of maritime safety computer aided systems which can apply advanced algorithms to help navigator evaluate collision risk are designed to prevent human errors with the development of ship automation risk assessment algorithm plays a more and more important role in the whole ship safety system in the literature plenty of researches have been proposed to assess ship collision risk in theory and practice of marine engineering distance between ships is a natural measurement of collision risk since collision occurs if and only if the distance is less than a certain level kristiansen 2013 in order to take the relative velocity into consideration the cpa based methods such as distance at closest point of approach dcpa and time to the closest point of approach tcpa are accepted by most of navigator to assess collision risk cpa based methods can provide a quantitative estimation of the probability of collision to occur these algorithms can be easily implemented in radar systems and electric nautical navigational chart enc systems that are required to be equipped on commercial ships imo 2013 szlapczynski and szlapczynska points out that cpa based methods may not be sufficient for estimating ship collision risk and for planning evasive maneuvers in some situations szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 actually dcpa doesn t reflect the real distance of ships so that the same dcpa can be obtained at different location even if the ships don t change their routes and velocities particularly for the situation that os and ts are sailing in the same path dcpa is always zero moreover tcpa is not a direct time measurement of the encounter situation as the ship sails in a circular motion around a stationary object the tcpa is always zero but they will never collide with each other actually dcpa and tcpa are usually considered together to give a balanced risk measurement such as jin hyeong ahn et al 2012 li and pang 2013 kang et al 2019 one useful two dimensional assessment method is based on the concept of sd szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 wang et al 2009 which is first proposed by fujii fujii and tanaka 1971 and goodwin 1975 sd based methods use a region around os to extend its operation range and measure the risk of collision once a ts enters the sd of os sd based devices can warn the navigator numerous subsequent studies davis et al 1980 smierzchalski and michalewicz 2000 szlapczynski 2006 pietrzykowski 2008 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 wang 2010 wang 2013 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 szlapczynski et al 2018 focus on how to set up sd models through different methodologies fuzzy logic or artificial neural networks are also applied to modify the boundary of the safety region the interested reader is referred to the research works in szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 wang et al 2009 li et al 2012 goerlandt and montewka 2015 for details compared to cpa based methods which usually provide a quantitative risk estimation most sd based methods usually provide a qualitative risk measurement so that the information for the navigator to perform collision avoidance is limited and may be static for some situations additionally either cpa based methods or sd based methods mainly focus on the probability of collision and the consequences related to the collision are usually ignored according to li et al 2012 pedersen 2010 wang et al 2002 the consequence is also a very important factor for collision risk assessment such incomplete information may lead to a wrong decision to avoid collision since the risk between two ships is time varying which is not only related to the dynamic motion of two ships but also related to their shape and weight actually the relative position between ships is always an important factor to assess the risk similarly the relative position of sds can be applied to risk assessment so that the risk can be quantitatively evaluated by the ships which are involved in the encounter situations however there is no general measurement to define the relative position between two domains since ship domains may be separated or have intersections the algorithm by means of svm method is introduced to measure the relative position of sds such that the collision probability can be estimated quantitatively and continuously svm is a state of the art supervised classification method first proposed by vapnik in 1992 vapnik 1995 svm classifiers are based on structural risk minimization principle and can achieve the global solution by transforming the classification problem into a quadratic programming qp problem such that the trained classifier can obtain better performance than conventional neural networks in the last decade svm based algorithms have been developed very rapidly and have been applied to many areas smola and schölkopf 1998 such as classification herbrich 2002 regression smola and schölkopf 2004 and recognition burges 1998 schuldt et al 2004 according to the mechanisms of svm the trained decision function can always find the maximal margin between the two class training data which can be either linearly separable or non separable vapnik 1995 smola and schölkopf 1998 this property allows us to give a precise description of the relative position between ship domains if we compare sds to two class training data thus it can be applied to obtain a quantitative risk assessment collision risk assessment usually involves the probability of the possible collision and the consequences related to the collision in this work our primary motivation is to develop a quantitative ship collision risk assessment algorithm that can overcome the above weaknesses of the conventional sd based risk assessment methods the new assessment algorithm also takes both the collision probability and the consequences into consideration the collision risk will not be evaluated by the sd of os directly but be measured according to the states of os and ts such as the relative position and velocity in other words the ship collision risk is modeled based on the geometric probability along the collision course and the consequences which is assessed by the relative velocity moreover the margin between sds obtained by solving linear svm classifier is considered as the geometric probability of the collision since sd is defined by a set of points in the two dimensional space which always has a convex closed boundary the points on the domain boundary are used as the training data to train a linear svm classifier and obtain the margin simultaneously for the separable case that no intersection exists between ship domains the margin is considered as the maximal space between two sds which naturally reflects collision probability for the non separable case which usually happens when the ship domains have intersections the soft margin is used to illustrate their relative position which also reflects the size of their overlapped area on the other hand the consequence that the assumed ship collision may cause is estimated by using the relative speed which represents the collision energy of two ships in order to generate a continuous assessment algorithm a nonlinear algorithm is developed to combine the risk of the different cases since the relative position is changing with the motion of ships finally simulation studies are carried out on two teaching training ships yupeng and yukun three typical encounter situations which covers head on crossing and overtaking situations are considered in the simulations compared to the conventional sd based methods and dcpa method the proposed quantitative risk assessment method can provide a risk assessment varying with the states of ships and overcome the weakness of the conventional methods the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 addresses the problem of quantitative collision risk assessment and the requirements on risk assessment is also given section 3 provides some fundamentals of svm and develops the collision risk assessment algorithm based on svm simulations are conducted in section 4 finally section 5 presents conclusion 2 problem formulation of quantitative collision risk assessment risk assessment aims to obtain a description of collision risk that can provide the explicit value in other words the risk can be evaluated by an evaluation function f r 1 r own f r x where r own r denotes the risk of os x is a vector that includes all the factors related to the risk for an example f r of the conversional sd based risk assessment methods usually has the following form 2 r o k f r x f r p t k 1 p t k d o w n 0 p t k d o w n where r o k denotes the risk of os with respect to the k th ts p t k is the position of the k th ts and d o w n denotes the ship domain of os according to the general definition of sd a two dimensional area surrounding a ship which other ships must avoid it may be considered as the area of evasion fujii and tanaka 1971 although sd for an individual ship either own or target ship may be determined by the circumstance and the navigator who always plays the critical role the domain must be a closed region in 2 dimensional plane thus the ship domain of os can be defined by its boundary points i e 3 d o w n x o y o x o i y o i i 1 n o and for the k th ts its ship domain d t k can be defined as 4 d t k x t k y t k x t i k y t i k i 1 n t k where denotes the boundary of a region x o y o and x t k y t k are the reference coordinates of the os and the k th ts respectively they are usually the coordinates of the center of mass x o i y o i 1 n o and x t i k y t i k 1 n k are the coordinates of the points on their boundaries respectively 2 is a discontinuous function with respect to the position of the k th ts which also implies that the conversional sd based risk assessment algorithms only take p t k and d o w n into consideration actually more information can be obtained from today s navigation devices when assessing the collision risk ais which is also required to be an essential equipment of commercial ship by internal marine organization imo can provide some important parameters of the ts such as the ship length velocity and etc in its operation range imo 2013 although there are many relevant factors of a ship collision it s reasonable to assess the risk based on the relative motion between ships which can be obtained from ais data from tses this work assumes that sds of os and tses can be obtained before making risk assessments i e d o w n and d t k k 1 n are known and can be online updated since many sd models are based on ais data moreover risk assessment usually means to estimate the potential risk of the involved members if they don t change their current states ship collision risk can be also estimated according to the current states of os and ts and varies with their states obviously a continuous model is not only beneficial to figure out the current collision risk but also useful to know the trend thus the risk assessment problem considered in this article focuses on the risk estimation by finding a continuous evaluation function f r which needs to satisfy the following requirements r 1 f r only depends on the current states and parameters of os and ts r 2 f r is continuous 3 svm based ship collision risk assessment 3 1 from qualitative sd based method to quantitative sd based method if the conversional sd based risk assessment methods can be expressed in 2 the risk only changes at the moment when a ts is entering into the sd of os or sailing away from the inside such qualitative assessment methods are not sensitive to changes in collision risk since no variation can be found either inside and outside the sd in order to overcome such a weakness a spatial collision risk scr model is proposed to provide a quantitative estimation based on fuzzy quaternion ship domain wang 2010 this model actually considers the probability of collision and is based on the assumption that the probability from the longitudinal side and the lateral side follows the asymmetrical gaussian distribution actually os and ts are not treated equally when using sd based methods to assess collision risk since there is no consideration of ts fig 1 illustrates the crossing encounter situation of the os and the ts that frequently happens either at open sea or narrow channels fujii s sd model which is the elliptical domain with the semi major axis of 4 times the length of the ship and the semi minor axis of 1 6 times the length of the ship is applied to both ships fujii and tanaka 1971 the size of the os is much larger than the ts and so is the size of their sd once the ts enters the sd of the os the os can detect the risk based on the sd theory but the ts may not recognize the risk since there is no ship in its ship domain area it may result in delayed collision avoidance of the ts however if the collision happens the loss of the ts may be more than the os due to the large difference between their scales it means that the ts may face greater risk than the os and needs to avoid the collision first obviously most conventional sd based methods fail to comply with the fact that collision risk involves both sides either for the ship with a larger sd or the ship with a smaller one the reason may be that most conventional sd based methods only consider the sd of own ship and some sd models are so complicated that their parameters can t be obtained from ts according to szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 the conventional sd based safety criteria usually prohibit overlapping of sds although such situations frequently happen in narrow channels quantitative method seems to be a good way solve this problem qu et al 2011 applied the quantitative collision assessment method proposed by wang 2010 and a new criterion of domain overlaps to estimate collision risk in the singapore strait which is such a narrow channel that the overlaps of ship domains happens frequently since the existing sd based methods only consider the ship domain of os and most of them are not suitable to solve the case with overlapping ship domains it s necessary to take the sd of ts into consideration and introduce the common consequence measurement simultaneously compared to the qualitative assessment methods quantitative assessment methods can usually provide more detailed analysis according to the states of sd and ts so that a svm based quantitative assessment method will be developed to estimate the collision risk in the following sections 3 2 classical linear svm classifier some fundamentals of support vector machines are first reviewed for further details about svms for classification and nonlinear function estimation we refer to vapnik 1995 herbrich 2002 and liang et al 2006 without loss of generality the classification problem can be restricted to consideration of the two class problem which aims to separate the two classes by a function induced from some available training data as shown in fig 2 the points with different marks illustrate the two different classes and there are many possible linear classifiers that can separate the data certainly only one linear classifier is the optimal separating hyperplane that can maximize the distance between it and the nearest data point of each class let t x k y k k 1 n denote the training data set with input data x k r n and corresponding binary class labels y k 1 1 a linear svm classifier formulation starts from the following assumption 5 ω t x k b 1 if y k 1 ω t x k b 1 if y k 1 k 1 n which is equivalent to 6 y k ω t x k b 1 k 1 n where ω and b are the parameters of the classifier 7 ω t x k b 0 7 can be considered as a hyperplane in the feature space the distance d ω b x k of a point x k from the hyperplane ω b is 8 d ω b x k ω t x k b ω 2 where ω 2 denotes the l 2 norm of ω r n and is given by ω 2 ω t ω to determine the classifier 7 for the dataset t vapnik proposed the principle of maximum margin i e the distance between the supporting hyperplanes ω t x k b 1 and ω t x k b 1 is maximum vapnik 1995 a directed calculation yields that the margin equals 9 d ω b x k 2 ω 2 therefore the maximum margin svm is obtained by solving the following optimization problem 10 max ω b 2 ω 2 s t y k ω t x k b 1 k 1 n since ω 2 is non negative the objective function can be replaced by its square i e 11 min ω b 1 2 ω 2 s t y k ω t x k b 1 k 1 n this is a convex quadratic programming problem cqpp since in practice n could be very large it makes sense to write the wolfe dual of problem 11 vapnik 1995 which comes out to be 12 max α 1 2 i 1 n j 1 n y i y j x i t x j α i α j j 1 n α j s t i 1 n y i α i 0 α i 0 i 1 n let α α 1 α 2 α m be an optimal solution of 12 then by using karush kuhn tucker kkt conditions vapnik 1995 it can be shown that the solution of ω and b is 13 ω i 1 n α i y i x i b y j i 1 n α i y i x i t x j where x j is that pattern for which α j 0 all patterns x j for which α j 0 are called as support vectors in view of kkt condition for problem 11 x j lies on one of the bounding hyperplanes ω t x b 1 and ω t x b 1 as shown in fig 3 for the case that the training date with different tags have overlaps it is not linearly separable there is often a tradeoff between having a large margin and a small classification error when seeking a classifying hyperplane such that some training samples may be allowed to be misclassified the slack variables are introduced to set up a soft margin around the overlaps then the optimization problem is rewritten as 14 min ω b ξ 1 2 ω 2 c k 1 n ξ k s t y k ω t x k b ξ k 1 k 1 n ξ k 0 k 1 n where the term k 1 n ξ k measures the misclassification error c is a positive real constant and defines the importance of the misclassification term similar to the problem 11 the problem of 14 is also a qp problem many fast algorithms for training linear svm in other words solving the qp problems in 11 and 14 are proposed in platt 1998 and liang et al 2006 such that the computational cost is acceptable in practice the above algorithms show that the linear svm classifier can provide a good separation for either separable or non separable cases at the same time the distance between two supporting hyperplanes can be also obtained it can be considered as a measurement of the closeness between the training data 3 3 margin of ship domains fig 4 shows two situations when we use sd to measure collision risk similar to the linearly separable case of the two class problem the case of the os and the ts1 that there is no overlapped domain area i e d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k is the most common case before two ships move too close the overlapped area between the sds of the os and the ts2 illustrates another situation corresponding to the linearly non separable case of the two class problem since sd also represents ship s feature they can be separated by linear svm classifier from the viewpoint of risk assessment the margin between sds that is an important factor to measure the risk can be also obtained by solving linear svm classifier before we use svm method to measure the margin between sds the training data should be discussed at first since it s also important to solve the classifier let t o d o w n x o y o 1 denote the data set of os and t k d t k x t k y t k 1 denote the data set of the k th ts since almost all ship domain models use a 2 demensional convex closed region to describe the safe region d o w n x o y o and d t k x t k y t k are both convex sets thus the support vector must be on their boundaries for both cases shown in fig 4 it implies that the classifier trained by using the training sets t o d o w n x o y o 1 and t k d t k x t k y t k 1 will be equal to the one trained by using the data of the domain boundaries in other words we don t need to use all the points of two ship domains but to use the data of their boundaries i e t o d o w n x o y o 1 and t k d t k x t k y t k 1 to train the classifier such that the computing time and resources are saved as implementing the algorithm for a real time application to solve the optimization problem of 11 and 14 the margin between os and ts can be also obtained let d o k denote the margin between the sds of os and the k th ts it can be defined as 15 d o k d o k if d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k d o k if d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k k 1 n where d o k denotes the margin between the sds of os and the k th ts as there is no overlapped domain area i e d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k and d o k denotes the margin for the remained case i e d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k d o k and d o k can be obtained by solving the svm problem of 11 and 14 respectively obviously both d o k and d o k are positive d o k decreases as two ships approaching and increases as they separating and d o k changes in the opposite direction they also satisfy the following properties property 1 d o k m o t k min l o l t k where l o and l t are the diameters of d o w n and d t k respectively property 2 d o k is continuous property 1 agrees with the definition of the soft margin the equation holds for the situation that one sd completely enters the other one and their boundaries are in contact at the largest side it s one of the worst situations since there exists the situation of d o k m o t k when one sd completely enters the other one obviously the worst situation happens and both ships face a huge risk of collision in order to prove property 2 we first show the continuity of d o k and d o k for two specific ships they both are functions of the states of the ships since their sds also depend on the states because all states are continuous as ship moving d o k and d o k are also continuous moreover according to the principle of svm d o k and d o k satisfy 16 lim dist d o w n d t k 0 d o k 0 and 17 lim d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k d o k 0 where dist d o w n d t k is the distance between d o w n x o y o and d t k x t k y t k and is defined as dist d o w n d t k inf x y x d o w n x o y o y d t k x t k y t k dist d o w n d t k 0 if and only if d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k 16 and 17 imply that d o k is a continuous function with respect to the ships states even when d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k fig 5 illustrates the margin between the sds of the os and the ts which are in crossing encounter situation as shown in fig 5 a the os sails along the path from 2000 5000 to 2000 3000 at a constant speed 10knots and the ts which is much larger sails along the path from 5000 0 to 5000 0 at a constant speed 12 knots their sds are both modeled by fujii s sd model and intersect around the center area fig 5 b gives the margin between the sds of both ships in the first 1800 s d o k varies linearly since d o k is only related to the distance between both sds and the speeds of both ships are also constant however d o k varies nonlinearly as the two sds have intersection compared to d o k d o k is not only related to the distance but also the shape of the sd model remark 1 actually distance between ships naturally reflects collision risk which is similar to d o k it usually refers to the distance between the center of masses or the distance between two position measurement points of ships ship attitude which is an important factor for collision risk assessment is ignored when using distance between ships to measure collision risk d o k contains some information of ship attitude since ship attitude has been considered in the modeling of its sd it can be shown in the case of fig 5 as the two sds overlap 3 4 ship collision risk assessment algorithm ship collision risk can be considered as a function of the possible collision related to the probabilities and its consequences pedersen 2010 wang et al 2002 the distance and the size of the overlapped area between two sds both reflects the geometric collision probability two sds moving closer and having more overlapped area imply higher probability for ship collision actually d o k is not proportional to the collision probability as d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k thus the collision probability p o k between os and the k th ts can be modeled as 18 p o k d o k 1 λ d o k m o t k if d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k 1 λ 1 1 λ d o k m o t k if d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k k 1 n where λ is a positive number and λ 1 the following results provide the properties of p o k property 3 p o k d o k is continuous property 4 p o k d o k 1 similar to property 2 property 3 can be also proved by the continuity of d o k and d o k according to 16 and 17 p o k d o k satisfies 19 lim dist d o w n d t k 0 p o k d o k lim d o k 0 1 λ d o k m o t k 1 λ and 20 lim d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k p o k d o k lim d o k 0 1 λ 1 1 λ d o k m o t k 1 λ thus p o k d o k 1 λ when two sds just touch each other property 3 holds for property 4 since d o k m o t k 0 p o k d o k 1 λ 1 if d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k moreover according to property 1 p o k d o k 1 if d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k property 4 also holds remark 2 p o k d o k reflects the connection between the margin and the collision risk between os and the k th ts it is derived from the geometric relationship between ships and also meets some properties of geometric probability p o k d o k is small as the distance between the sds is far away while the situation when p o k d o k is close to 1 implies the worst situation that the collision almost happens as one sd entirely enters the other one apparently p o k d o k is not the exact model of the collision probability since it ignores the some factors that also affect the collision probability such as the velocity the environment and etc although the loss of a collision depends on many factors such as the severity of the physical collision the value of goods the following rescue operations and etc the impact force at the moment of the collision causes the damage and it s reasonable to consider the consequence to be proportional to the strength of the force in this article we only use the impact force to measure the loss of a collision in order to show the collision risk to the navigator if he don t make any avoidance operations we assume that the ships in the encounter situation are assumed to collide at the current velocity according to the impulse momentum theorem the impact force is highly related to the change in momentum with the assumption that all ships will stop after collision the impact force can be obtained from the following equations 21 f x 1 t δ m o v x o m t k v x k f y 1 t δ m o v y o m t k v y k where the subscripts x and y represent the decompositions along the x axis and y axis of the global position coordinate system in two dimensional space respectively the superscripts o and k represent os and the k th ts respectively m denotes the mass v denotes the speed and t δ is the time interval during the force acts if we only consider the strength of the force then we have 22 f f x 2 f y 2 1 t δ m o v x o m t k v x k 2 m o v y o m t k v y k 2 thus the consequence of the collision is proportional to 23 c o k β o k m o v x o m t k v x k 2 m o v y o m t k v y k 2 where β o k is a positive weight factor that reflects the level of the consequence related to the collision between os and the k th ts although c o k can t provide the exact value of the consequence c o k reflects its scale and can be considered as the model of the consequence moreover it is a continuous function due to the continuity of the velocity remark 3 β o k in 23 can be considered as a parameter which is used to represent the other factors that are related to the consequence at the collision moment such as the ships relative orientation the collision position of the ship the size of the ship and etc moreover from different perspectives β o k could be different β o k is obviously different for different tses so that it can be also considered as a parameter to indicate the risk from the different ts it s important to note that β o k may not be equal to β k o since the same impact force may not cause the same consequence for the different ships a reasonable β o k can be the ship displacement ratio of the k th ts and os which reflects the difference in scale between the two ships then the collision risk r o k of os and the k th ts can be assessed by using the following formula 24 r o k p o k c o k r o k is also continuous since p o k and c o k are both continuous both p o k and c o k depend on the states of os and the ts the states of os are provided by its navigation devices while the states of the ts can be obtained from the ais device equipped on os usually ais information includes the position speed and yaw angle of the ts as while as its length and width thus the risk assessment algorithm can be written as follows image 1 the above algorithm shows the computing procedure to access the collision risk with respect to all the tses actually for every ts who sent its ais information to os the same algorithm can be applied 4 simulation studies in order to demonstrate the new risk assessment method comprehensive simulation studies will be conducted on the two teaching training ships yupeng and yukun owned by dalian maritime university the principal dimensions of both teaching training ships are shown in table 1 the parameters in algorithm 1 are shown in the following list 25 λ 10 9 β k p m p m k 10 6 β p k m k m p 10 6 three encounter situations i e head on crossing and overtaking encounter situations which are the most common encounter situations at open sea are considered in the following simulation studies the initial conditions of the following simulations are provided in table 2 yukun is considered as the os in the simulations fujii s sd model which is the most popular sd model in the field of marine engineering is applied in all simulations as the model of d o w n and d t k yukun and yupeng don t collide in all simulations but the distance between them may be very small the simulation results include d k p p k p and the collision risk assessment of yukun and yupeng p k p is compared to the result based on scr assessment method wang 2010 where the parameter k 2 r k p and r p k are illustrated in the same figure and are also compared to the collision risk assessed by using dcpa method 4 1 head on situation in the situation shown in fig 6 a yukun meets a head on encounter situation with yupeng from the front such that they are meeting on nearly reciprocal courses based on algorithm 1 the risk is evaluated as yupeng and yukun approaching closer fig 6 b illustrates the margin between the sds of yupeng and yukun the curve in fig 6 c shows the evaluation of the collision probability between the two ships which is inversely proportional to d o k and proportional to d o k and high gradient can be found around λ compared to the probability given by scr method it seems that p k p based on svm method can predict the risk earlier since the probability based on scr method is not sensitive when two ships are far apart although it may be caused by the selection of the parameters it also implies that this method can detect the collision risk in a larger region fig 6 d compares 4 curves r k p and r k p are significantly different due to the parameter β it implies that the risk of yupeng to yukun is much greater than the risk of yukun to yupeng in the same encounter situation the dash dotted curve in fig 6 d provides the time that yupeng enters and exits the sd of yukun it can be figured out that this time is shorter than the time of their sds overlapping dcpa between yupeng and yukun is shown by the dotted curve in fig 6 d which is a line with constant value the variation in risk can be only found by the curves of r k p and r k p but it cannot be obtained from the other curves of fig 6 d 4 2 crossing situation fig 7 a illustrates the crossing encounter situation that yukun has vessel yupeng on his own starboard side curves in fig 7 b d are similar to curves in fig 4 b d p k p in fig 7 c is larger than in fig 6 c which means that the two ships are more likely to collide in this situation the reason is the overlapped region between two sds is much larger than the head on encounter situation though dcpa in fig 7 d is greater than in fig 6 d and the probability given by scr method is also smaller obviously the size of the margin between two sds is highly related to the encounter situation since the different relative orientation between ships will cause the different overlapped region it also means that the svm based method can cover different situations with overlapped sds the final collision risk of this situation is smaller than the previous simulation because the velocities of both ships are much smaller speed reduction also reduces the slopes of the p k p r k p and r k p curves 4 3 overtaking situation fig 8 a illustrates the overtaking encounter situation that yukun has vessel yupeng on his own starboard side it takes more time for this simulation since yukun is even slower than the case of the crossing encounter situation fig 8 b d only show the simulation data of the first 30 min although dcpa in fig 8 d is similar to fig 6 d the peak values of p k p are different and more sensitive to the encounter situation similar to the previous simulation the slopes of the p k p r k p and r k p curves become more gentle obviously it seems much safer than the previous cases moreover the maximum values of r k p and r k p are also smaller than the first case however the values of dcpa in figs 8 d and fig 6 d are approximately equal so that it s not conducive to distinguishing the risks from the different situations all simulations above shows the risk assessment method proposed in this paper provides a quantitative and continuous risk evaluation varying with the states of os and the tses it not only assesses the ongoing risk but also can predict the risk in the future by using changing trends from this perspective the collision avoidance can be considered to maintain the risk value on a certain level it is helpful for making collision avoidance decisions and operations automatically 5 conclusions this paper presents a new quantitative algorithm to assess ship collision risk this algorithm takes advantage of svm method to model the collision probability the consequence related to the assumed collision is also taken into consideration it s noticeable that the risk continuously depends on the states of ships which is usually ignored by the conventional methods although this algorithm is also based on the sd method it does not depend on the specific sd model actually any sd model can be applied in this algorithm so that the algorithm can be easily implemented in modern ship navigation systems credit authorship contribution statement kai zheng

21976,ship collision is one of the important causes of maritime accidents collision risk assessment is necessary for navigator or automatic navigating system to recognize the risk when facing a specific encounter situation and make the proper decision for the following collision avoidance this paper proposes a quantitative ship collision risk assessment algorithm that is based on support vector machine svm technology the algorithm reconsiders the margin between ship domains of own ship os and the target ship ts that is used to model the probability of collision moreover the consequence of the assumed collision is also considered in the algorithm which is modeled by the interaction force thus the continuous and quantitative collision risk can be obtained by using the states of ships so that some weaknesses of the conventional risk assessment methods such as the ship domain sd methods and the closest point of approach cpa based methods can be overcome the effectiveness of this approach is examined by simulation studies which show the advantages of the new risk assessment algorithm keywords collision risk assessment collision avoidance ship domain svm 1 introduction recently many ship collision accidents warn us to rethink our ship collision avoidance system since many collisions are caused by human error as shown in hanzu pazara et al 2008 about 89 96 of collisions are caused at least in part by some form of human error in order to enhance the quality and effectiveness of maritime safety computer aided systems which can apply advanced algorithms to help navigator evaluate collision risk are designed to prevent human errors with the development of ship automation risk assessment algorithm plays a more and more important role in the whole ship safety system in the literature plenty of researches have been proposed to assess ship collision risk in theory and practice of marine engineering distance between ships is a natural measurement of collision risk since collision occurs if and only if the distance is less than a certain level kristiansen 2013 in order to take the relative velocity into consideration the cpa based methods such as distance at closest point of approach dcpa and time to the closest point of approach tcpa are accepted by most of navigator to assess collision risk cpa based methods can provide a quantitative estimation of the probability of collision to occur these algorithms can be easily implemented in radar systems and electric nautical navigational chart enc systems that are required to be equipped on commercial ships imo 2013 szlapczynski and szlapczynska points out that cpa based methods may not be sufficient for estimating ship collision risk and for planning evasive maneuvers in some situations szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 actually dcpa doesn t reflect the real distance of ships so that the same dcpa can be obtained at different location even if the ships don t change their routes and velocities particularly for the situation that os and ts are sailing in the same path dcpa is always zero moreover tcpa is not a direct time measurement of the encounter situation as the ship sails in a circular motion around a stationary object the tcpa is always zero but they will never collide with each other actually dcpa and tcpa are usually considered together to give a balanced risk measurement such as jin hyeong ahn et al 2012 li and pang 2013 kang et al 2019 one useful two dimensional assessment method is based on the concept of sd szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 wang et al 2009 which is first proposed by fujii fujii and tanaka 1971 and goodwin 1975 sd based methods use a region around os to extend its operation range and measure the risk of collision once a ts enters the sd of os sd based devices can warn the navigator numerous subsequent studies davis et al 1980 smierzchalski and michalewicz 2000 szlapczynski 2006 pietrzykowski 2008 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 wang 2010 wang 2013 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 szlapczynski et al 2018 focus on how to set up sd models through different methodologies fuzzy logic or artificial neural networks are also applied to modify the boundary of the safety region the interested reader is referred to the research works in szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 wang et al 2009 li et al 2012 goerlandt and montewka 2015 for details compared to cpa based methods which usually provide a quantitative risk estimation most sd based methods usually provide a qualitative risk measurement so that the information for the navigator to perform collision avoidance is limited and may be static for some situations additionally either cpa based methods or sd based methods mainly focus on the probability of collision and the consequences related to the collision are usually ignored according to li et al 2012 pedersen 2010 wang et al 2002 the consequence is also a very important factor for collision risk assessment such incomplete information may lead to a wrong decision to avoid collision since the risk between two ships is time varying which is not only related to the dynamic motion of two ships but also related to their shape and weight actually the relative position between ships is always an important factor to assess the risk similarly the relative position of sds can be applied to risk assessment so that the risk can be quantitatively evaluated by the ships which are involved in the encounter situations however there is no general measurement to define the relative position between two domains since ship domains may be separated or have intersections the algorithm by means of svm method is introduced to measure the relative position of sds such that the collision probability can be estimated quantitatively and continuously svm is a state of the art supervised classification method first proposed by vapnik in 1992 vapnik 1995 svm classifiers are based on structural risk minimization principle and can achieve the global solution by transforming the classification problem into a quadratic programming qp problem such that the trained classifier can obtain better performance than conventional neural networks in the last decade svm based algorithms have been developed very rapidly and have been applied to many areas smola and schölkopf 1998 such as classification herbrich 2002 regression smola and schölkopf 2004 and recognition burges 1998 schuldt et al 2004 according to the mechanisms of svm the trained decision function can always find the maximal margin between the two class training data which can be either linearly separable or non separable vapnik 1995 smola and schölkopf 1998 this property allows us to give a precise description of the relative position between ship domains if we compare sds to two class training data thus it can be applied to obtain a quantitative risk assessment collision risk assessment usually involves the probability of the possible collision and the consequences related to the collision in this work our primary motivation is to develop a quantitative ship collision risk assessment algorithm that can overcome the above weaknesses of the conventional sd based risk assessment methods the new assessment algorithm also takes both the collision probability and the consequences into consideration the collision risk will not be evaluated by the sd of os directly but be measured according to the states of os and ts such as the relative position and velocity in other words the ship collision risk is modeled based on the geometric probability along the collision course and the consequences which is assessed by the relative velocity moreover the margin between sds obtained by solving linear svm classifier is considered as the geometric probability of the collision since sd is defined by a set of points in the two dimensional space which always has a convex closed boundary the points on the domain boundary are used as the training data to train a linear svm classifier and obtain the margin simultaneously for the separable case that no intersection exists between ship domains the margin is considered as the maximal space between two sds which naturally reflects collision probability for the non separable case which usually happens when the ship domains have intersections the soft margin is used to illustrate their relative position which also reflects the size of their overlapped area on the other hand the consequence that the assumed ship collision may cause is estimated by using the relative speed which represents the collision energy of two ships in order to generate a continuous assessment algorithm a nonlinear algorithm is developed to combine the risk of the different cases since the relative position is changing with the motion of ships finally simulation studies are carried out on two teaching training ships yupeng and yukun three typical encounter situations which covers head on crossing and overtaking situations are considered in the simulations compared to the conventional sd based methods and dcpa method the proposed quantitative risk assessment method can provide a risk assessment varying with the states of ships and overcome the weakness of the conventional methods the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 addresses the problem of quantitative collision risk assessment and the requirements on risk assessment is also given section 3 provides some fundamentals of svm and develops the collision risk assessment algorithm based on svm simulations are conducted in section 4 finally section 5 presents conclusion 2 problem formulation of quantitative collision risk assessment risk assessment aims to obtain a description of collision risk that can provide the explicit value in other words the risk can be evaluated by an evaluation function f r 1 r own f r x where r own r denotes the risk of os x is a vector that includes all the factors related to the risk for an example f r of the conversional sd based risk assessment methods usually has the following form 2 r o k f r x f r p t k 1 p t k d o w n 0 p t k d o w n where r o k denotes the risk of os with respect to the k th ts p t k is the position of the k th ts and d o w n denotes the ship domain of os according to the general definition of sd a two dimensional area surrounding a ship which other ships must avoid it may be considered as the area of evasion fujii and tanaka 1971 although sd for an individual ship either own or target ship may be determined by the circumstance and the navigator who always plays the critical role the domain must be a closed region in 2 dimensional plane thus the ship domain of os can be defined by its boundary points i e 3 d o w n x o y o x o i y o i i 1 n o and for the k th ts its ship domain d t k can be defined as 4 d t k x t k y t k x t i k y t i k i 1 n t k where denotes the boundary of a region x o y o and x t k y t k are the reference coordinates of the os and the k th ts respectively they are usually the coordinates of the center of mass x o i y o i 1 n o and x t i k y t i k 1 n k are the coordinates of the points on their boundaries respectively 2 is a discontinuous function with respect to the position of the k th ts which also implies that the conversional sd based risk assessment algorithms only take p t k and d o w n into consideration actually more information can be obtained from today s navigation devices when assessing the collision risk ais which is also required to be an essential equipment of commercial ship by internal marine organization imo can provide some important parameters of the ts such as the ship length velocity and etc in its operation range imo 2013 although there are many relevant factors of a ship collision it s reasonable to assess the risk based on the relative motion between ships which can be obtained from ais data from tses this work assumes that sds of os and tses can be obtained before making risk assessments i e d o w n and d t k k 1 n are known and can be online updated since many sd models are based on ais data moreover risk assessment usually means to estimate the potential risk of the involved members if they don t change their current states ship collision risk can be also estimated according to the current states of os and ts and varies with their states obviously a continuous model is not only beneficial to figure out the current collision risk but also useful to know the trend thus the risk assessment problem considered in this article focuses on the risk estimation by finding a continuous evaluation function f r which needs to satisfy the following requirements r 1 f r only depends on the current states and parameters of os and ts r 2 f r is continuous 3 svm based ship collision risk assessment 3 1 from qualitative sd based method to quantitative sd based method if the conversional sd based risk assessment methods can be expressed in 2 the risk only changes at the moment when a ts is entering into the sd of os or sailing away from the inside such qualitative assessment methods are not sensitive to changes in collision risk since no variation can be found either inside and outside the sd in order to overcome such a weakness a spatial collision risk scr model is proposed to provide a quantitative estimation based on fuzzy quaternion ship domain wang 2010 this model actually considers the probability of collision and is based on the assumption that the probability from the longitudinal side and the lateral side follows the asymmetrical gaussian distribution actually os and ts are not treated equally when using sd based methods to assess collision risk since there is no consideration of ts fig 1 illustrates the crossing encounter situation of the os and the ts that frequently happens either at open sea or narrow channels fujii s sd model which is the elliptical domain with the semi major axis of 4 times the length of the ship and the semi minor axis of 1 6 times the length of the ship is applied to both ships fujii and tanaka 1971 the size of the os is much larger than the ts and so is the size of their sd once the ts enters the sd of the os the os can detect the risk based on the sd theory but the ts may not recognize the risk since there is no ship in its ship domain area it may result in delayed collision avoidance of the ts however if the collision happens the loss of the ts may be more than the os due to the large difference between their scales it means that the ts may face greater risk than the os and needs to avoid the collision first obviously most conventional sd based methods fail to comply with the fact that collision risk involves both sides either for the ship with a larger sd or the ship with a smaller one the reason may be that most conventional sd based methods only consider the sd of own ship and some sd models are so complicated that their parameters can t be obtained from ts according to szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 the conventional sd based safety criteria usually prohibit overlapping of sds although such situations frequently happen in narrow channels quantitative method seems to be a good way solve this problem qu et al 2011 applied the quantitative collision assessment method proposed by wang 2010 and a new criterion of domain overlaps to estimate collision risk in the singapore strait which is such a narrow channel that the overlaps of ship domains happens frequently since the existing sd based methods only consider the ship domain of os and most of them are not suitable to solve the case with overlapping ship domains it s necessary to take the sd of ts into consideration and introduce the common consequence measurement simultaneously compared to the qualitative assessment methods quantitative assessment methods can usually provide more detailed analysis according to the states of sd and ts so that a svm based quantitative assessment method will be developed to estimate the collision risk in the following sections 3 2 classical linear svm classifier some fundamentals of support vector machines are first reviewed for further details about svms for classification and nonlinear function estimation we refer to vapnik 1995 herbrich 2002 and liang et al 2006 without loss of generality the classification problem can be restricted to consideration of the two class problem which aims to separate the two classes by a function induced from some available training data as shown in fig 2 the points with different marks illustrate the two different classes and there are many possible linear classifiers that can separate the data certainly only one linear classifier is the optimal separating hyperplane that can maximize the distance between it and the nearest data point of each class let t x k y k k 1 n denote the training data set with input data x k r n and corresponding binary class labels y k 1 1 a linear svm classifier formulation starts from the following assumption 5 ω t x k b 1 if y k 1 ω t x k b 1 if y k 1 k 1 n which is equivalent to 6 y k ω t x k b 1 k 1 n where ω and b are the parameters of the classifier 7 ω t x k b 0 7 can be considered as a hyperplane in the feature space the distance d ω b x k of a point x k from the hyperplane ω b is 8 d ω b x k ω t x k b ω 2 where ω 2 denotes the l 2 norm of ω r n and is given by ω 2 ω t ω to determine the classifier 7 for the dataset t vapnik proposed the principle of maximum margin i e the distance between the supporting hyperplanes ω t x k b 1 and ω t x k b 1 is maximum vapnik 1995 a directed calculation yields that the margin equals 9 d ω b x k 2 ω 2 therefore the maximum margin svm is obtained by solving the following optimization problem 10 max ω b 2 ω 2 s t y k ω t x k b 1 k 1 n since ω 2 is non negative the objective function can be replaced by its square i e 11 min ω b 1 2 ω 2 s t y k ω t x k b 1 k 1 n this is a convex quadratic programming problem cqpp since in practice n could be very large it makes sense to write the wolfe dual of problem 11 vapnik 1995 which comes out to be 12 max α 1 2 i 1 n j 1 n y i y j x i t x j α i α j j 1 n α j s t i 1 n y i α i 0 α i 0 i 1 n let α α 1 α 2 α m be an optimal solution of 12 then by using karush kuhn tucker kkt conditions vapnik 1995 it can be shown that the solution of ω and b is 13 ω i 1 n α i y i x i b y j i 1 n α i y i x i t x j where x j is that pattern for which α j 0 all patterns x j for which α j 0 are called as support vectors in view of kkt condition for problem 11 x j lies on one of the bounding hyperplanes ω t x b 1 and ω t x b 1 as shown in fig 3 for the case that the training date with different tags have overlaps it is not linearly separable there is often a tradeoff between having a large margin and a small classification error when seeking a classifying hyperplane such that some training samples may be allowed to be misclassified the slack variables are introduced to set up a soft margin around the overlaps then the optimization problem is rewritten as 14 min ω b ξ 1 2 ω 2 c k 1 n ξ k s t y k ω t x k b ξ k 1 k 1 n ξ k 0 k 1 n where the term k 1 n ξ k measures the misclassification error c is a positive real constant and defines the importance of the misclassification term similar to the problem 11 the problem of 14 is also a qp problem many fast algorithms for training linear svm in other words solving the qp problems in 11 and 14 are proposed in platt 1998 and liang et al 2006 such that the computational cost is acceptable in practice the above algorithms show that the linear svm classifier can provide a good separation for either separable or non separable cases at the same time the distance between two supporting hyperplanes can be also obtained it can be considered as a measurement of the closeness between the training data 3 3 margin of ship domains fig 4 shows two situations when we use sd to measure collision risk similar to the linearly separable case of the two class problem the case of the os and the ts1 that there is no overlapped domain area i e d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k is the most common case before two ships move too close the overlapped area between the sds of the os and the ts2 illustrates another situation corresponding to the linearly non separable case of the two class problem since sd also represents ship s feature they can be separated by linear svm classifier from the viewpoint of risk assessment the margin between sds that is an important factor to measure the risk can be also obtained by solving linear svm classifier before we use svm method to measure the margin between sds the training data should be discussed at first since it s also important to solve the classifier let t o d o w n x o y o 1 denote the data set of os and t k d t k x t k y t k 1 denote the data set of the k th ts since almost all ship domain models use a 2 demensional convex closed region to describe the safe region d o w n x o y o and d t k x t k y t k are both convex sets thus the support vector must be on their boundaries for both cases shown in fig 4 it implies that the classifier trained by using the training sets t o d o w n x o y o 1 and t k d t k x t k y t k 1 will be equal to the one trained by using the data of the domain boundaries in other words we don t need to use all the points of two ship domains but to use the data of their boundaries i e t o d o w n x o y o 1 and t k d t k x t k y t k 1 to train the classifier such that the computing time and resources are saved as implementing the algorithm for a real time application to solve the optimization problem of 11 and 14 the margin between os and ts can be also obtained let d o k denote the margin between the sds of os and the k th ts it can be defined as 15 d o k d o k if d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k d o k if d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k k 1 n where d o k denotes the margin between the sds of os and the k th ts as there is no overlapped domain area i e d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k and d o k denotes the margin for the remained case i e d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k d o k and d o k can be obtained by solving the svm problem of 11 and 14 respectively obviously both d o k and d o k are positive d o k decreases as two ships approaching and increases as they separating and d o k changes in the opposite direction they also satisfy the following properties property 1 d o k m o t k min l o l t k where l o and l t are the diameters of d o w n and d t k respectively property 2 d o k is continuous property 1 agrees with the definition of the soft margin the equation holds for the situation that one sd completely enters the other one and their boundaries are in contact at the largest side it s one of the worst situations since there exists the situation of d o k m o t k when one sd completely enters the other one obviously the worst situation happens and both ships face a huge risk of collision in order to prove property 2 we first show the continuity of d o k and d o k for two specific ships they both are functions of the states of the ships since their sds also depend on the states because all states are continuous as ship moving d o k and d o k are also continuous moreover according to the principle of svm d o k and d o k satisfy 16 lim dist d o w n d t k 0 d o k 0 and 17 lim d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k d o k 0 where dist d o w n d t k is the distance between d o w n x o y o and d t k x t k y t k and is defined as dist d o w n d t k inf x y x d o w n x o y o y d t k x t k y t k dist d o w n d t k 0 if and only if d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k 16 and 17 imply that d o k is a continuous function with respect to the ships states even when d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k fig 5 illustrates the margin between the sds of the os and the ts which are in crossing encounter situation as shown in fig 5 a the os sails along the path from 2000 5000 to 2000 3000 at a constant speed 10knots and the ts which is much larger sails along the path from 5000 0 to 5000 0 at a constant speed 12 knots their sds are both modeled by fujii s sd model and intersect around the center area fig 5 b gives the margin between the sds of both ships in the first 1800 s d o k varies linearly since d o k is only related to the distance between both sds and the speeds of both ships are also constant however d o k varies nonlinearly as the two sds have intersection compared to d o k d o k is not only related to the distance but also the shape of the sd model remark 1 actually distance between ships naturally reflects collision risk which is similar to d o k it usually refers to the distance between the center of masses or the distance between two position measurement points of ships ship attitude which is an important factor for collision risk assessment is ignored when using distance between ships to measure collision risk d o k contains some information of ship attitude since ship attitude has been considered in the modeling of its sd it can be shown in the case of fig 5 as the two sds overlap 3 4 ship collision risk assessment algorithm ship collision risk can be considered as a function of the possible collision related to the probabilities and its consequences pedersen 2010 wang et al 2002 the distance and the size of the overlapped area between two sds both reflects the geometric collision probability two sds moving closer and having more overlapped area imply higher probability for ship collision actually d o k is not proportional to the collision probability as d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k thus the collision probability p o k between os and the k th ts can be modeled as 18 p o k d o k 1 λ d o k m o t k if d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k 1 λ 1 1 λ d o k m o t k if d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k k 1 n where λ is a positive number and λ 1 the following results provide the properties of p o k property 3 p o k d o k is continuous property 4 p o k d o k 1 similar to property 2 property 3 can be also proved by the continuity of d o k and d o k according to 16 and 17 p o k d o k satisfies 19 lim dist d o w n d t k 0 p o k d o k lim d o k 0 1 λ d o k m o t k 1 λ and 20 lim d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k p o k d o k lim d o k 0 1 λ 1 1 λ d o k m o t k 1 λ thus p o k d o k 1 λ when two sds just touch each other property 3 holds for property 4 since d o k m o t k 0 p o k d o k 1 λ 1 if d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k moreover according to property 1 p o k d o k 1 if d o w n x o y o d t k x t k y t k property 4 also holds remark 2 p o k d o k reflects the connection between the margin and the collision risk between os and the k th ts it is derived from the geometric relationship between ships and also meets some properties of geometric probability p o k d o k is small as the distance between the sds is far away while the situation when p o k d o k is close to 1 implies the worst situation that the collision almost happens as one sd entirely enters the other one apparently p o k d o k is not the exact model of the collision probability since it ignores the some factors that also affect the collision probability such as the velocity the environment and etc although the loss of a collision depends on many factors such as the severity of the physical collision the value of goods the following rescue operations and etc the impact force at the moment of the collision causes the damage and it s reasonable to consider the consequence to be proportional to the strength of the force in this article we only use the impact force to measure the loss of a collision in order to show the collision risk to the navigator if he don t make any avoidance operations we assume that the ships in the encounter situation are assumed to collide at the current velocity according to the impulse momentum theorem the impact force is highly related to the change in momentum with the assumption that all ships will stop after collision the impact force can be obtained from the following equations 21 f x 1 t δ m o v x o m t k v x k f y 1 t δ m o v y o m t k v y k where the subscripts x and y represent the decompositions along the x axis and y axis of the global position coordinate system in two dimensional space respectively the superscripts o and k represent os and the k th ts respectively m denotes the mass v denotes the speed and t δ is the time interval during the force acts if we only consider the strength of the force then we have 22 f f x 2 f y 2 1 t δ m o v x o m t k v x k 2 m o v y o m t k v y k 2 thus the consequence of the collision is proportional to 23 c o k β o k m o v x o m t k v x k 2 m o v y o m t k v y k 2 where β o k is a positive weight factor that reflects the level of the consequence related to the collision between os and the k th ts although c o k can t provide the exact value of the consequence c o k reflects its scale and can be considered as the model of the consequence moreover it is a continuous function due to the continuity of the velocity remark 3 β o k in 23 can be considered as a parameter which is used to represent the other factors that are related to the consequence at the collision moment such as the ships relative orientation the collision position of the ship the size of the ship and etc moreover from different perspectives β o k could be different β o k is obviously different for different tses so that it can be also considered as a parameter to indicate the risk from the different ts it s important to note that β o k may not be equal to β k o since the same impact force may not cause the same consequence for the different ships a reasonable β o k can be the ship displacement ratio of the k th ts and os which reflects the difference in scale between the two ships then the collision risk r o k of os and the k th ts can be assessed by using the following formula 24 r o k p o k c o k r o k is also continuous since p o k and c o k are both continuous both p o k and c o k depend on the states of os and the ts the states of os are provided by its navigation devices while the states of the ts can be obtained from the ais device equipped on os usually ais information includes the position speed and yaw angle of the ts as while as its length and width thus the risk assessment algorithm can be written as follows image 1 the above algorithm shows the computing procedure to access the collision risk with respect to all the tses actually for every ts who sent its ais information to os the same algorithm can be applied 4 simulation studies in order to demonstrate the new risk assessment method comprehensive simulation studies will be conducted on the two teaching training ships yupeng and yukun owned by dalian maritime university the principal dimensions of both teaching training ships are shown in table 1 the parameters in algorithm 1 are shown in the following list 25 λ 10 9 β k p m p m k 10 6 β p k m k m p 10 6 three encounter situations i e head on crossing and overtaking encounter situations which are the most common encounter situations at open sea are considered in the following simulation studies the initial conditions of the following simulations are provided in table 2 yukun is considered as the os in the simulations fujii s sd model which is the most popular sd model in the field of marine engineering is applied in all simulations as the model of d o w n and d t k yukun and yupeng don t collide in all simulations but the distance between them may be very small the simulation results include d k p p k p and the collision risk assessment of yukun and yupeng p k p is compared to the result based on scr assessment method wang 2010 where the parameter k 2 r k p and r p k are illustrated in the same figure and are also compared to the collision risk assessed by using dcpa method 4 1 head on situation in the situation shown in fig 6 a yukun meets a head on encounter situation with yupeng from the front such that they are meeting on nearly reciprocal courses based on algorithm 1 the risk is evaluated as yupeng and yukun approaching closer fig 6 b illustrates the margin between the sds of yupeng and yukun the curve in fig 6 c shows the evaluation of the collision probability between the two ships which is inversely proportional to d o k and proportional to d o k and high gradient can be found around λ compared to the probability given by scr method it seems that p k p based on svm method can predict the risk earlier since the probability based on scr method is not sensitive when two ships are far apart although it may be caused by the selection of the parameters it also implies that this method can detect the collision risk in a larger region fig 6 d compares 4 curves r k p and r k p are significantly different due to the parameter β it implies that the risk of yupeng to yukun is much greater than the risk of yukun to yupeng in the same encounter situation the dash dotted curve in fig 6 d provides the time that yupeng enters and exits the sd of yukun it can be figured out that this time is shorter than the time of their sds overlapping dcpa between yupeng and yukun is shown by the dotted curve in fig 6 d which is a line with constant value the variation in risk can be only found by the curves of r k p and r k p but it cannot be obtained from the other curves of fig 6 d 4 2 crossing situation fig 7 a illustrates the crossing encounter situation that yukun has vessel yupeng on his own starboard side curves in fig 7 b d are similar to curves in fig 4 b d p k p in fig 7 c is larger than in fig 6 c which means that the two ships are more likely to collide in this situation the reason is the overlapped region between two sds is much larger than the head on encounter situation though dcpa in fig 7 d is greater than in fig 6 d and the probability given by scr method is also smaller obviously the size of the margin between two sds is highly related to the encounter situation since the different relative orientation between ships will cause the different overlapped region it also means that the svm based method can cover different situations with overlapped sds the final collision risk of this situation is smaller than the previous simulation because the velocities of both ships are much smaller speed reduction also reduces the slopes of the p k p r k p and r k p curves 4 3 overtaking situation fig 8 a illustrates the overtaking encounter situation that yukun has vessel yupeng on his own starboard side it takes more time for this simulation since yukun is even slower than the case of the crossing encounter situation fig 8 b d only show the simulation data of the first 30 min although dcpa in fig 8 d is similar to fig 6 d the peak values of p k p are different and more sensitive to the encounter situation similar to the previous simulation the slopes of the p k p r k p and r k p curves become more gentle obviously it seems much safer than the previous cases moreover the maximum values of r k p and r k p are also smaller than the first case however the values of dcpa in figs 8 d and fig 6 d are approximately equal so that it s not conducive to distinguishing the risks from the different situations all simulations above shows the risk assessment method proposed in this paper provides a quantitative and continuous risk evaluation varying with the states of os and the tses it not only assesses the ongoing risk but also can predict the risk in the future by using changing trends from this perspective the collision avoidance can be considered to maintain the risk value on a certain level it is helpful for making collision avoidance decisions and operations automatically 5 conclusions this paper presents a new quantitative algorithm to assess ship collision risk this algorithm takes advantage of svm method to model the collision probability the consequence related to the assumed collision is also taken into consideration it s noticeable that the risk continuously depends on the states of ships which is usually ignored by the conventional methods although this algorithm is also based on the sd method it does not depend on the specific sd model actually any sd model can be applied in this algorithm so that the algorithm can be easily implemented in modern ship navigation systems credit authorship contribution statement kai zheng

wuhan hubei 430063 pr china maritime autonomous surface ships mass have recently drawn significant attention throughout academia governments and industry one of the requirements for mass is that they should at least be as safe as conventional ships often to measure their level of safety the concept of risk is adopted and risk influencing factors are determined this paper proposes a framework for the identification of factors that influence the navigational risk of remotely controlled mass without crews on board therein four operational phases are considered voyage planning berthing and unberthing port approaching and departing as well as open sea navigation for each phase four types of factors are assigned related to human ship environment and technology to populate the framework a thorough literature review is conducted which is further supported by the elicitation of expert knowledge as a result 23 human related factors 12 ship related factors 8 environment related factors and 12 technology related factors were defined the proposed framework can be employed for any risk and safety analysis related to remote controlled mass this in turn may assist the processes of design and operational planning of maritime transportation systems accommodating mass and its remote control center e g the shore control center keywords transport safety maritime autonomous surface ship risk influencing factor 4p4f 1 introduction autonomous transportation systems have been first developed several decades ago but have only recently become reality wahlström et al 2015 in the maritime field until now three autonomous merchant ships have been tested schuler 2018a schuler 2018b nyk line 2019 the development of autonomous ships has gained momentum over recent years which is mainly due to advancements of technology and the experience gained from other domains such as computer science or automation technology moreover several reasons support the development of the concept of autonomous merchant ships the aspiration for increased safety requirements in shipping the pressure to decrease freight rates the global need to decrease emissions and the shortage of seafarers in the nearest future due to the unattractiveness of the onboard work environment porathe et al 2014 porathe 2016 ics bimco 2016 kretschmann et al 2017 ramos et al 2018a numerous research and industrial projects claimed that autonomous ships will become an inevitable reality at sea in the near future laurinen 2016 jalonen et al 2017 safety4sea 2017 brittius 2018 condliffe 2018 eason 2018 li 2018 marex 2018 vincent 2018 different schemes are in use to define the level of automation for maritime surface vessels e g waterborne 2011 porathe et al 2014 bertram 2016 danish maritime authority 2017 rødseth 2017 porathe 2019 to unify these schemes the international maritime organization imo has recently defined the following four degrees of autonomy doa related to maritime autonomous surface ships mass imo 2018 1 doa1 ship with automated processes and decision support where the seafarers are on board for the operation and control of shipboard systems and functions 2 doa2 remotely controlled ship with seafarers on board 3 doa3 remotely controlled ship without seafarers on board 4 doa4 fully autonomous ship the postulated shift toward autonomous shipping will most likely follow a gradual transition from lower toward higher levels of autonomy rather than an instant change from manned ships to unmanned ships see for example laurinen 2016 utne et al 2017 recently the world s first mass trial has been performed in accordance with the imo s interim guidelines for mass trials this trial was conducted by the nyk line with the aim to utilize advanced technologies and remote support from the office to facilitate ship operation and enhance safety nyk line 2019 it has been recommended that the type of autonomy for fully unmanned ships will be constrained autonomy either under supervision or under control from a shore control center scc e g rødseth and nordahl 2017 porathe et al 2018 ringbom 2019 the safety aspect should become the backbone for the further development of autonomous navigation wróbel et al 2018b berge et al 2019 a minimum requirement for mass is that they should be at least as safe as conventional ships thieme et al 2018 hogg and ghosh 2016 examined the factors that impact the effective implementation of autonomous merchant vessels into service from regulatory legal safety human technology interface and societal perspectives since humans will not be completely removed from the system but will rather be reallocated from ships to shore based control centers the factors that influence the decisions and actions of shore based operators need to be determined as presented and discussed by ramos et al 2018b wahlström et al 2015 further expanded this topic by listing the challenges involved e g information overload mishaps during changeovers and handoffs and delays in control and monitoring related to reallocation wahlström et al 2015 did so by reviewing the literature of autonomous and remote operations in other fields e g aviation forestry automotive subway systems space operations military and cranes utne et al 2017 proposed a set of risk influencing factors rif that govern the collision risk of autonomous ships with regard to three aspects mission operation environment and system a process for the development of safety indicators for the operation of autonomous marine systems ams was presented by thieme and utne 2017b who further applied this process to the operation of an autonomous underwater vehicle auv however only few papers have addressed rif for mass operating at a given level of automation rif have been defined as an aspect an event or a condition that affects the navigational risk level with respect to mass doa3 øien 2001 therefore this paper focuses on an ocean going mass doa3 which is controlled from a remote center and has no seafarers on board to identify rif related to the operation of mass doa3 a framework was established to identify the operational phase s a mass doa3 may experience and the type s of rif a mass doa3 may face therefore the operation phases of projects related to mass were studied as well as the types of rif in literature thence relevant literature was reviewed and specific literature was selected that focused on discussing the safety risk security and human factors of mass then based on this proposed framework rif were identified under expert elicitation following a 3 step procedure as detailed in section 2 2 1 the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the proposed framework and the procedure of this study section 3 describes both the reviewed literature and the use of an expert panel section 4 presents the results these results are discussed in section 5 and section 6 concludes this paper 2 the framework and methods 2 1 the 4p4f framework to identify rif related to the operational phases of an ocean going mass doa3 two main questions need to be addressed firstly what are the main operational phases that a mass doa3 may experience during a voyage secondly with regard to an operational phase what are the main types of rif that a mass doa3 may encounter along the passage from point a to b to answer these questions reports in the relevant research literature and development r d projects were analyzed while integrating expert judgement as a result a 4p4f framework has been established as shown in fig 1 this framework is explained in the following sections 2 1 1 operational phases of mass since rif depend on a specific operational phase imo 2012 their proper definition is of high importance especially for non existing systems such as ocean going mass for an ocean going mass doa3 the following 4 stage division of operations was adopted 1 voyage planning v 2 berthing and unberthing b 3 port approaching and departing p 4 open sea navigation o these four phases form the 4p component of the proposed framework 2 1 2 rif for mass for the navigation of conventional merchant ships rif are normally defined via accident reports bye and aalberg 2018 baalisampang et al 2018 karahalios 2018 furthermore a plethora of rif have been identified in the literature e g lu et al 2012 knapp and heij 2017 puisa et al 2018 moreover several frameworks have been specifically proposed to identify rif in the maritime domain chen 1998 1999 luo and shin 2016 thieme and utne 2017a these usually account for the following factors human related ship related environment related and management related factors sometimes two more are added e g traffic related and market related factors for the navigation of conventional ships the above divisions related to rif seem appropriate however they do not consider factors of technology as mentioned by pyne and koester 2005 and koester 2007 which may be outstanding factors due to the innovativeness of autonomous shipping new technology typically implies that new types of accidents emerge and new causes for existing accident types are introduced hence it is of the utmost importance to provide a proactive and systemic framework that enables the safety assessment and or quantification of innovative solutions thus rif related to the technology need to be accounted for therefore this study accounts for the following set of rif for a mass 1 human related h 2 ship related s 3 environment related e 4 technology related t these four types form the 4f component of the framework 2 1 3 validation of the 4p4f framework validation efforts uncovered evidence supporting that the proposed framework can reflect rifs a mass doa3 may face in real live processes many methods exist to validate safety related quantitative risk analyses see for example goerlandt et al 2017 in general the methods for validation can be divided into two main categories expert based validation and data driven validation since data driven validation is impossible expert based validation proposed by pitchforth and mengersen 2013 was chosen for this study this approach incorporates the following three tests face validity assess the proposed framework in comparison to the predictions of the literature or experts content validity assess if the proposed framework covers all aspects convergent and discriminant validity assess if the proposed framework is similar to or sufficiently different from others with similar aims for different systems based on three tests the proposed 4p4f framework is compared to existing models the proposed 4 phases are compared to those defined in the r d projects related to mass e g the maritime unmanned navigation through intelligence in networks munin and the advanced autonomous waterborne applications aawa and showed good agreement see table 1 note that both yara birkeland and revolt are not considering navigation on the high sea because they focus on short sea shipping or coastal voyages however the proposed four types of factors are compared to those in the literature that are related to conventional ships the results of comparing these factor types are shown in table 2 which also showed good agreement nevertheless several types of factors have not been included in this framework e g management chen 1998 1999 regulation thieme and utne 2017a shipping market factors luo and shin 2016 and organization pyne and koester 2005 koester 2007 from the results of this comparison as shown in tables 1 and 2 face validity content validity and discriminant validity of the proposed framework are assumed while convergence was not 2 2 method 2 2 1 the procedure of the study based on the 4p4f framework a flowchart of this study is shown in fig 1 which includes three steps two methods literature selection and establishment of the expert panel are adopted and illustrated in section 2 2 2 and section 2 2 3 respectively step 1 literature selection literature was retrieved from four main sources by setting search criteria related to safety risk security and human factors with regard to mass here publications that are highly related to the criteria of searching were selected for in depth analysis step 2 identification of four types of rif by analyzing the literature obtained in step 1 primary rif related to mass doa3 are identified then these results are classified into 4f actors i e human ship environment and technology as final rif are identified here experts assist in merging similar rif or deleting trivial or non related rif moreover each type of rif is further grouped by experts step 3 assign rif to four operational phases the classification results in step 2 are assigned to 4p hases i e voyage planning berthing and unberthing port approaching and departing and open sea navigation here experts judgement is integrated to determine the operational phase a rif may be associated with 2 2 2 literature selection to select the appropriate literature in step 1 the following literature sources have been utilized engineering village google scholar official websites of r d projects and proceedings of international conferences related to maritime safety the criterion for paper selection from these resources is that a report or an article is selected if it is written in english and its topic is relevant to mass safety risk security and human factors however other relevant papers or reports that may exist but may yet be unavailable should not be excluded the reason why these documents may not be accessible is that they could be published in inaccessible sources or that have been written in other languages 2 2 3 expert panel establishment step 2 and step 3 rely on experts judgement to distinguish the relevant rif for mass doa3 within the 4p4f framework from a number of rif derived from the selected literature to this end an expert panel was assembled the panel consisted of nine persons encompassing active captains of merchant ships marine technology researchers and maritime transport researchers with nautical background and experience each group had an equal number of representing experts three each thus the panel was well balanced for the purpose of this study 3 background knowledge 3 1 selected literature following the method in section 2 2 2 a total of more than 100 papers were identified in step 1 even though a similar search strategy was used when searching in different sources many articles related to other subjects and the same articles were identified through different sources then examining these articles individually became necessary finally 40 papers comprising conference articles ca journal articles ja and reports r published in english from 2014 to february 2020 were selected as highly relevant for the purpose of this study the distribution of the articles is presented in fig 2 and discussed in section 3 in light of these 40 reviewed articles it is evident that safety is one of the most challenging and important aspects of the development of mass see ahvenjärvi 2016 however the ways to achieve the desired safety level remain unknown especially at the stage of concept development this is mainly due to a shortage of knowledge and understanding of the prospective system to systematize the existing background knowledge on the analyzed subject such knowledge and understanding are required therefore an extensive literature review is performed which is enhanced with the experts knowledge elicitation 3 2 key points of the selected literature table 3 groups the reviewed literature by their key points i e objectives adopted methodology or utilized data sources if available however not all identified papers clearly present the utilized method or applied theory or even the used data source in this case the appropriate field is left blank 4 results in step 2 based on the selected literature in section 3 and on experts judgement 23 human related factors 12 ship related factors 8 environment related factors and 12 technology related factors were identified a total of 55 rif in step 3 based on experts knowledge these identified rif were assigned to different operational phases these are described in detail in the following subsections 4 1 human related factors table 4 shows 23 human related rif which are further grouped by experts into six groups 1 cognitive aspect 2 psychological aspect 3 errors 4 situational awareness sa 5 experience and training as well as 6 cooperation fig 3 assigns these human related rif to the four phases of an ocean going voyage based on expert assessment sa is an important factor for navigators on board however it may be difficult for a remote operator to retain adequate sa when simultaneously monitoring multiple vessels with inadequate sa a remote operator s psychological distance to the real sea conditions may be increased which may easily become out of the loop and the operator might fail to grasp ship sense or retain harmony prison et al 2013 these issues in turn deteriorate the performance of the remote operator however lack of sufficient sa may be partly compensated by feedback from the ship or by good seamanship which is related to operator experience knowledge skills and training 4 2 ship related factors table 5 presents 12 ship related rif grouped into four groups related to the ship 1 software and procedure 2 hardware 3 software and hardware and 4 cargo management in fig 4 these ship related rif are allocated to the four phases of an ocean going voyage based on expert assessment failure of onboard hardware may result in either degradation or failure of functions related to navigation or propulsion this will affect the ability of the ship to perform intended operations and may also result in safety deterioration or even in the loss of the ship during normal ship operation such failures can be inspected by routine patrols of the deck watch or will be noticed after an alarm has been raised by the system similarly such failures may inform a remote operator using a central onshore alarm system or can be identified by the operator s information check transferred from mass several hardware failures with unacceptable criticality can be quickly addressed by crewmembers e g carry water overflow and water in fuel rødseth and mo 2014 but cannot immediately be addressed by a remote operator to resolve such critical failures redundancy or fail to safe mechanisms may be pre designed solutions notwithstanding these failures need to be thoroughly addressed after mass mooring at a seaport inspection and maintenance should be conducted by a maintenance team 4 3 environment related factors table 6 lists eight environment related rif which are further grouped into the following five groups related to the environment 1 work environment 2 law 3 traffic 4 weather and 5 security in fig 5 these environment related rif are distributed to the four phases in an ocean going voyage based on expert assessment in general mass security may be threatened by three main sources hackers piracy or terrorism vinnem and utne 2018 discussed solutions to retain mass security via two means with and without manning torkildson et al 2018 argued that security should be co analyzed when safety is analyzed moreover the social environment and the legislative environment either international or local may become an obstacle however in the long term maritime law will appear to be relatively well prepared for mass hooydonk 2014 all impediments caused by regulatory and legal issues may be overcome based on the other performance of mass such as their economic efficiency karlis 2018 moreover the weather situation is critical for voyage adjustment and onshore weather forecasts provide reliable information about wind wave current and tide within a temporal and spatial scope onboard weather sensors can provide these data around the ship walther et al 2014 4 4 technology related factors table 7 describes 12 technology related rif which are further grouped into three groups related to technology 1 design 2 communication and 3 data in fig 6 these technology related rif are attributed to the four phases in an ocean going voyage based on expert assessment mass are expected to rely heavily on the development of high technology in numerous areas such as object detection pattern recognition intelligence information technology i e the internet of things iot cloud computing big data mobile and security icbms artificial intelligence ai im et al 2018 the measured sensor data is a central input that ensures safe operation walther et al 2014 autonomous lookouts replace crew lookouts with the help of advanced sensor technologies e g light detection and ranging cameras for normal lookout near infrared cameras or thermal longwave infrared cameras for night time monitoring laurinen 2016 and a short range radar for lookout under difficult weather conditions e g heavy rain or snow therefore measures or redundancies should be considered in advance to address specific types of sensor failure e g failure to react timely to an undesirable event failure to trigger associated alarms or loss of or poor visual perception of the environment after sensing the ambient conditions a mass doa3 has two options one option is to make decisions independently however utne et al 2017 pointed out that advanced control systems with autonomic functions may suffer from complexity and interlocks that are difficult to identify and analyze moreover new types of failure modes may be introduced due to unforeseen interdependencies in system design operation complexity and environmental challenges rødseth and tjora 2015 argued that for reliability and deterministic behavior the designers need to reduce the complexity in all parts of the system and its environment to a manageable level the other option is that a mass doa3 may transfer such information to scc using satellite or bandwidth transmission and the scc also responds to the mass via satellite or bandwidth transmission for the latter option a reliable and timely communication link between mass and scc is critical however satellite communication is not widely available worldwide nor always highly reliable the use of satellites is also costly which would further weaken the economic advantage of mass rødseth and tjora 2014 however with their increased demand in the future competitive options may emerge hogg and ghosh 2016 therefore it is essential to evaluate techniques that decrease the probability of human error acanfora et al 2017a 2017b ramos et al 2018b 4 5 aggregation of factors finally all identified rif are aggregated and the results of this study for mass doa3 are depicted in figs 7 and 8 the results indicate that the majority of rif are attributed to o see fig 7 with all ship related and environment related rif 95 6 of human related rif and 85 7 of technology related rif being assigned to this phase the results also illustrate that the largest numbers of rif are related to h see fig 8 with 23 h rifs accounting for 41 8 of all identified rif 5 discussion limitation and future work 5 1 contribution of this study this study contributes to the research on risk or safety of mass in the following three aspects firstly the results of the analysis may be generalized for the maritime domain as an exploration of the outstanding rif regarding monitoring or control of unmanned vessels in a shore based environment furthermore the identified rif during different operational phases can be beneficial for the design of the input for both system and operational procedures by initiating considerations regarding how to overcome or mitigate the disadvantages of these factors during the design or operational phases secondly the results show that most rif appear during the phase of open sea navigation on one hand during this phase there is no crew on board for a mass doa3 under normal condition in this context no quick direct human interventions on board can help to deal with an emergency on the other hand during the berthing and unberthing phases as well as the port approaching and departing phases even if navigational conditions are more difficult than during phase of open sea navigation advantages in retaining these two phases still exist e g available shore ship communication systems or sufficient rescue resources nevertheless this does not prevent the distribution of rif in different phrases that may be changed in the future to overcome the disadvantage of these rif during the phase of open sea navigation a concrete policy is specifically proposed for the high sea operation new international rules should be implemented for the guidance of an operator handling a mass on high seas alternatively the current codes for navigation safety on high sea may be modified by coordinating the actions performed by an operator in scc and the behavior of the crew on board of conventional ship s thirdly the results also indicate that the number of human factors is maximal among the four types of factors which may sound counterintuitive for an unmanned ship at first glance however it must be kept in mind that the human factor is not expected to be fully removed from the system during the operation of mass doa3 rather a human is expected to be reallocated to shore based centers which may create additional challenges for example the operator may be expected to monitor several ships at the same time thus operating in various geographical locations and numerous environmental conditions therefore such detachment from real sea conditions may cause the operator to fail to fully grasp the situation thus the operator s performance may be expected to deteriorate prison et al 2013 another issue is information overload which may be caused by the volume of information produced all of which are simultaneously delivered and processed the data can be related not only to ship navigation but also to machinery and other critical systems this is true for all ships that are monitored by a single operator jalonen et al 2017 to compensate for the lack of full situational awareness and the massive information flow another concrete policy was proposed here the operator is expected to possess specific skills and professional knowledge similar to that of crews of traditional ships while the design of scc should be user centered man et al 2014 2015 5 2 limitations and future work three main limitations in the proposed framework procedure and identified results are highlighted in the following firstly even though section 2 1 3 illustrates the validation of the proposed framework a number of factors outside of the 4p4f framework might be omitted for example indirect or direct organizational rif yang et al 2017 may be significant for an ocean going mass with assisted scc operation several rif e g poor shift change h22 inappropriately structured organizational hierarchy e1 inappropriate safety culture e2 inadequate shore services e3 and inadequate design of scc e4 may be related to organizational issues however in this study organizational rif are not completely considered the main reasons are as follows on the one hand how to remotely control a mass doa3 still remains an open issue while on the other hand little work focuses on topics related to scc in the future the 4p4f framework may be extended or revised to include more types of factors for example organizational rif related to the anticipated scc may be developed in the future when more efforts from research or industry are gradually directed to scc secondly the uncertainty of results cannot be avoided because of subjectivity in the procedure of this study as with any literature review in step 1 the subjectivity in the selection and analysis of the materials is not completely prevented in step 2 and step 3 a 9 expert panel is invited to merge or delete primary rif to further group rif in each type and to determine whether a rif appears in a given operational phase however expert elicitation suffers from a number of limitations e g a relatively small number of experts may not be considered representative and the elicitation procedure may fail to faithfully capture the true views of experts hänninen et al 2014a 2014b to reduce such uncertainty the quantity of related literature should be expanded as further research results are released or by integrating the experience obtained in the future rather than relying on expert elicitation learning from objective data would be required e g analyzing statistical accidents incidents or near miss accident data if available finally the relationships among these identified rif have not been explored several of the identified rif may cause other rif an omission error h13 i e automation induced complacency may be caused by a lack of vigilance h5 but could be eliminated by the integrated display sheridan and parasuraman 2005 in the future the relationships of these rif need to be explored to enhance the understanding of the influence of a specific rif on the safety of mass operation 6 conclusions this paper identifies rif that affect the navigational safety of mass doa3 to this end a framework 4p4f is introduced consisting of four operational phases v b p and o and four types of factors h s e and t based on this framework a 3 step procedure is developed following these steps 55 rif and their distribution throughout the above mentioned four operational phases are presented the results show that open sea navigation is the phase with the highest numbers of rif containing all ship related and environment related rif as well as most human related and environment related rif however most rif are related to human factors which supply almost 42 of all identified rif from the perspective of the practical application the results may assist designers and operators to overcome or reduce the drawbacks of these rif which in turn may facilitate the operation safety of mass doa3 since the identification of rif is an iterative process during the life cycle of mass in the future the obtained rif can be updated as new objective data becomes available declaration of competing interestcoi

wuhan hubei 430063 pr china maritime autonomous surface ships mass have recently drawn significant attention throughout academia governments and industry one of the requirements for mass is that they should at least be as safe as conventional ships often to measure their level of safety the concept of risk is adopted and risk influencing factors are determined this paper proposes a framework for the identification of factors that influence the navigational risk of remotely controlled mass without crews on board therein four operational phases are considered voyage planning berthing and unberthing port approaching and departing as well as open sea navigation for each phase four types of factors are assigned related to human ship environment and technology to populate the framework a thorough literature review is conducted which is further supported by the elicitation of expert knowledge as a result 23 human related factors 12 ship related factors 8 environment related factors and 12 technology related factors were defined the proposed framework can be employed for any risk and safety analysis related to remote controlled mass this in turn may assist the processes of design and operational planning of maritime transportation systems accommodating mass and its remote control center e g the shore control center keywords transport safety maritime autonomous surface ship risk influencing factor 4p4f 1 introduction autonomous transportation systems have been first developed several decades ago but have only recently become reality wahlström et al 2015 in the maritime field until now three autonomous merchant ships have been tested schuler 2018a schuler 2018b nyk line 2019 the development of autonomous ships has gained momentum over recent years which is mainly due to advancements of technology and the experience gained from other domains such as computer science or automation technology moreover several reasons support the development of the concept of autonomous merchant ships the aspiration for increased safety requirements in shipping the pressure to decrease freight rates the global need to decrease emissions and the shortage of seafarers in the nearest future due to the unattractiveness of the onboard work environment porathe et al 2014 porathe 2016 ics bimco 2016 kretschmann et al 2017 ramos et al 2018a numerous research and industrial projects claimed that autonomous ships will become an inevitable reality at sea in the near future laurinen 2016 jalonen et al 2017 safety4sea 2017 brittius 2018 condliffe 2018 eason 2018 li 2018 marex 2018 vincent 2018 different schemes are in use to define the level of automation for maritime surface vessels e g waterborne 2011 porathe et al 2014 bertram 2016 danish maritime authority 2017 rødseth 2017 porathe 2019 to unify these schemes the international maritime organization imo has recently defined the following four degrees of autonomy doa related to maritime autonomous surface ships mass imo 2018 1 doa1 ship with automated processes and decision support where the seafarers are on board for the operation and control of shipboard systems and functions 2 doa2 remotely controlled ship with seafarers on board 3 doa3 remotely controlled ship without seafarers on board 4 doa4 fully autonomous ship the postulated shift toward autonomous shipping will most likely follow a gradual transition from lower toward higher levels of autonomy rather than an instant change from manned ships to unmanned ships see for example laurinen 2016 utne et al 2017 recently the world s first mass trial has been performed in accordance with the imo s interim guidelines for mass trials this trial was conducted by the nyk line with the aim to utilize advanced technologies and remote support from the office to facilitate ship operation and enhance safety nyk line 2019 it has been recommended that the type of autonomy for fully unmanned ships will be constrained autonomy either under supervision or under control from a shore control center scc e g rødseth and nordahl 2017 porathe et al 2018 ringbom 2019 the safety aspect should become the backbone for the further development of autonomous navigation wróbel et al 2018b berge et al 2019 a minimum requirement for mass is that they should be at least as safe as conventional ships thieme et al 2018 hogg and ghosh 2016 examined the factors that impact the effective implementation of autonomous merchant vessels into service from regulatory legal safety human technology interface and societal perspectives since humans will not be completely removed from the system but will rather be reallocated from ships to shore based control centers the factors that influence the decisions and actions of shore based operators need to be determined as presented and discussed by ramos et al 2018b wahlström et al 2015 further expanded this topic by listing the challenges involved e g information overload mishaps during changeovers and handoffs and delays in control and monitoring related to reallocation wahlström et al 2015 did so by reviewing the literature of autonomous and remote operations in other fields e g aviation forestry automotive subway systems space operations military and cranes utne et al 2017 proposed a set of risk influencing factors rif that govern the collision risk of autonomous ships with regard to three aspects mission operation environment and system a process for the development of safety indicators for the operation of autonomous marine systems ams was presented by thieme and utne 2017b who further applied this process to the operation of an autonomous underwater vehicle auv however only few papers have addressed rif for mass operating at a given level of automation rif have been defined as an aspect an event or a condition that affects the navigational risk level with respect to mass doa3 øien 2001 therefore this paper focuses on an ocean going mass doa3 which is controlled from a remote center and has no seafarers on board to identify rif related to the operation of mass doa3 a framework was established to identify the operational phase s a mass doa3 may experience and the type s of rif a mass doa3 may face therefore the operation phases of projects related to mass were studied as well as the types of rif in literature thence relevant literature was reviewed and specific literature was selected that focused on discussing the safety risk security and human factors of mass then based on this proposed framework rif were identified under expert elicitation following a 3 step procedure as detailed in section 2 2 1 the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the proposed framework and the procedure of this study section 3 describes both the reviewed literature and the use of an expert panel section 4 presents the results these results are discussed in section 5 and section 6 concludes this paper 2 the framework and methods 2 1 the 4p4f framework to identify rif related to the operational phases of an ocean going mass doa3 two main questions need to be addressed firstly what are the main operational phases that a mass doa3 may experience during a voyage secondly with regard to an operational phase what are the main types of rif that a mass doa3 may encounter along the passage from point a to b to answer these questions reports in the relevant research literature and development r d projects were analyzed while integrating expert judgement as a result a 4p4f framework has been established as shown in fig 1 this framework is explained in the following sections 2 1 1 operational phases of mass since rif depend on a specific operational phase imo 2012 their proper definition is of high importance especially for non existing systems such as ocean going mass for an ocean going mass doa3 the following 4 stage division of operations was adopted 1 voyage planning v 2 berthing and unberthing b 3 port approaching and departing p 4 open sea navigation o these four phases form the 4p component of the proposed framework 2 1 2 rif for mass for the navigation of conventional merchant ships rif are normally defined via accident reports bye and aalberg 2018 baalisampang et al 2018 karahalios 2018 furthermore a plethora of rif have been identified in the literature e g lu et al 2012 knapp and heij 2017 puisa et al 2018 moreover several frameworks have been specifically proposed to identify rif in the maritime domain chen 1998 1999 luo and shin 2016 thieme and utne 2017a these usually account for the following factors human related ship related environment related and management related factors sometimes two more are added e g traffic related and market related factors for the navigation of conventional ships the above divisions related to rif seem appropriate however they do not consider factors of technology as mentioned by pyne and koester 2005 and koester 2007 which may be outstanding factors due to the innovativeness of autonomous shipping new technology typically implies that new types of accidents emerge and new causes for existing accident types are introduced hence it is of the utmost importance to provide a proactive and systemic framework that enables the safety assessment and or quantification of innovative solutions thus rif related to the technology need to be accounted for therefore this study accounts for the following set of rif for a mass 1 human related h 2 ship related s 3 environment related e 4 technology related t these four types form the 4f component of the framework 2 1 3 validation of the 4p4f framework validation efforts uncovered evidence supporting that the proposed framework can reflect rifs a mass doa3 may face in real live processes many methods exist to validate safety related quantitative risk analyses see for example goerlandt et al 2017 in general the methods for validation can be divided into two main categories expert based validation and data driven validation since data driven validation is impossible expert based validation proposed by pitchforth and mengersen 2013 was chosen for this study this approach incorporates the following three tests face validity assess the proposed framework in comparison to the predictions of the literature or experts content validity assess if the proposed framework covers all aspects convergent and discriminant validity assess if the proposed framework is similar to or sufficiently different from others with similar aims for different systems based on three tests the proposed 4p4f framework is compared to existing models the proposed 4 phases are compared to those defined in the r d projects related to mass e g the maritime unmanned navigation through intelligence in networks munin and the advanced autonomous waterborne applications aawa and showed good agreement see table 1 note that both yara birkeland and revolt are not considering navigation on the high sea because they focus on short sea shipping or coastal voyages however the proposed four types of factors are compared to those in the literature that are related to conventional ships the results of comparing these factor types are shown in table 2 which also showed good agreement nevertheless several types of factors have not been included in this framework e g management chen 1998 1999 regulation thieme and utne 2017a shipping market factors luo and shin 2016 and organization pyne and koester 2005 koester 2007 from the results of this comparison as shown in tables 1 and 2 face validity content validity and discriminant validity of the proposed framework are assumed while convergence was not 2 2 method 2 2 1 the procedure of the study based on the 4p4f framework a flowchart of this study is shown in fig 1 which includes three steps two methods literature selection and establishment of the expert panel are adopted and illustrated in section 2 2 2 and section 2 2 3 respectively step 1 literature selection literature was retrieved from four main sources by setting search criteria related to safety risk security and human factors with regard to mass here publications that are highly related to the criteria of searching were selected for in depth analysis step 2 identification of four types of rif by analyzing the literature obtained in step 1 primary rif related to mass doa3 are identified then these results are classified into 4f actors i e human ship environment and technology as final rif are identified here experts assist in merging similar rif or deleting trivial or non related rif moreover each type of rif is further grouped by experts step 3 assign rif to four operational phases the classification results in step 2 are assigned to 4p hases i e voyage planning berthing and unberthing port approaching and departing and open sea navigation here experts judgement is integrated to determine the operational phase a rif may be associated with 2 2 2 literature selection to select the appropriate literature in step 1 the following literature sources have been utilized engineering village google scholar official websites of r d projects and proceedings of international conferences related to maritime safety the criterion for paper selection from these resources is that a report or an article is selected if it is written in english and its topic is relevant to mass safety risk security and human factors however other relevant papers or reports that may exist but may yet be unavailable should not be excluded the reason why these documents may not be accessible is that they could be published in inaccessible sources or that have been written in other languages 2 2 3 expert panel establishment step 2 and step 3 rely on experts judgement to distinguish the relevant rif for mass doa3 within the 4p4f framework from a number of rif derived from the selected literature to this end an expert panel was assembled the panel consisted of nine persons encompassing active captains of merchant ships marine technology researchers and maritime transport researchers with nautical background and experience each group had an equal number of representing experts three each thus the panel was well balanced for the purpose of this study 3 background knowledge 3 1 selected literature following the method in section 2 2 2 a total of more than 100 papers were identified in step 1 even though a similar search strategy was used when searching in different sources many articles related to other subjects and the same articles were identified through different sources then examining these articles individually became necessary finally 40 papers comprising conference articles ca journal articles ja and reports r published in english from 2014 to february 2020 were selected as highly relevant for the purpose of this study the distribution of the articles is presented in fig 2 and discussed in section 3 in light of these 40 reviewed articles it is evident that safety is one of the most challenging and important aspects of the development of mass see ahvenjärvi 2016 however the ways to achieve the desired safety level remain unknown especially at the stage of concept development this is mainly due to a shortage of knowledge and understanding of the prospective system to systematize the existing background knowledge on the analyzed subject such knowledge and understanding are required therefore an extensive literature review is performed which is enhanced with the experts knowledge elicitation 3 2 key points of the selected literature table 3 groups the reviewed literature by their key points i e objectives adopted methodology or utilized data sources if available however not all identified papers clearly present the utilized method or applied theory or even the used data source in this case the appropriate field is left blank 4 results in step 2 based on the selected literature in section 3 and on experts judgement 23 human related factors 12 ship related factors 8 environment related factors and 12 technology related factors were identified a total of 55 rif in step 3 based on experts knowledge these identified rif were assigned to different operational phases these are described in detail in the following subsections 4 1 human related factors table 4 shows 23 human related rif which are further grouped by experts into six groups 1 cognitive aspect 2 psychological aspect 3 errors 4 situational awareness sa 5 experience and training as well as 6 cooperation fig 3 assigns these human related rif to the four phases of an ocean going voyage based on expert assessment sa is an important factor for navigators on board however it may be difficult for a remote operator to retain adequate sa when simultaneously monitoring multiple vessels with inadequate sa a remote operator s psychological distance to the real sea conditions may be increased which may easily become out of the loop and the operator might fail to grasp ship sense or retain harmony prison et al 2013 these issues in turn deteriorate the performance of the remote operator however lack of sufficient sa may be partly compensated by feedback from the ship or by good seamanship which is related to operator experience knowledge skills and training 4 2 ship related factors table 5 presents 12 ship related rif grouped into four groups related to the ship 1 software and procedure 2 hardware 3 software and hardware and 4 cargo management in fig 4 these ship related rif are allocated to the four phases of an ocean going voyage based on expert assessment failure of onboard hardware may result in either degradation or failure of functions related to navigation or propulsion this will affect the ability of the ship to perform intended operations and may also result in safety deterioration or even in the loss of the ship during normal ship operation such failures can be inspected by routine patrols of the deck watch or will be noticed after an alarm has been raised by the system similarly such failures may inform a remote operator using a central onshore alarm system or can be identified by the operator s information check transferred from mass several hardware failures with unacceptable criticality can be quickly addressed by crewmembers e g carry water overflow and water in fuel rødseth and mo 2014 but cannot immediately be addressed by a remote operator to resolve such critical failures redundancy or fail to safe mechanisms may be pre designed solutions notwithstanding these failures need to be thoroughly addressed after mass mooring at a seaport inspection and maintenance should be conducted by a maintenance team 4 3 environment related factors table 6 lists eight environment related rif which are further grouped into the following five groups related to the environment 1 work environment 2 law 3 traffic 4 weather and 5 security in fig 5 these environment related rif are distributed to the four phases in an ocean going voyage based on expert assessment in general mass security may be threatened by three main sources hackers piracy or terrorism vinnem and utne 2018 discussed solutions to retain mass security via two means with and without manning torkildson et al 2018 argued that security should be co analyzed when safety is analyzed moreover the social environment and the legislative environment either international or local may become an obstacle however in the long term maritime law will appear to be relatively well prepared for mass hooydonk 2014 all impediments caused by regulatory and legal issues may be overcome based on the other performance of mass such as their economic efficiency karlis 2018 moreover the weather situation is critical for voyage adjustment and onshore weather forecasts provide reliable information about wind wave current and tide within a temporal and spatial scope onboard weather sensors can provide these data around the ship walther et al 2014 4 4 technology related factors table 7 describes 12 technology related rif which are further grouped into three groups related to technology 1 design 2 communication and 3 data in fig 6 these technology related rif are attributed to the four phases in an ocean going voyage based on expert assessment mass are expected to rely heavily on the development of high technology in numerous areas such as object detection pattern recognition intelligence information technology i e the internet of things iot cloud computing big data mobile and security icbms artificial intelligence ai im et al 2018 the measured sensor data is a central input that ensures safe operation walther et al 2014 autonomous lookouts replace crew lookouts with the help of advanced sensor technologies e g light detection and ranging cameras for normal lookout near infrared cameras or thermal longwave infrared cameras for night time monitoring laurinen 2016 and a short range radar for lookout under difficult weather conditions e g heavy rain or snow therefore measures or redundancies should be considered in advance to address specific types of sensor failure e g failure to react timely to an undesirable event failure to trigger associated alarms or loss of or poor visual perception of the environment after sensing the ambient conditions a mass doa3 has two options one option is to make decisions independently however utne et al 2017 pointed out that advanced control systems with autonomic functions may suffer from complexity and interlocks that are difficult to identify and analyze moreover new types of failure modes may be introduced due to unforeseen interdependencies in system design operation complexity and environmental challenges rødseth and tjora 2015 argued that for reliability and deterministic behavior the designers need to reduce the complexity in all parts of the system and its environment to a manageable level the other option is that a mass doa3 may transfer such information to scc using satellite or bandwidth transmission and the scc also responds to the mass via satellite or bandwidth transmission for the latter option a reliable and timely communication link between mass and scc is critical however satellite communication is not widely available worldwide nor always highly reliable the use of satellites is also costly which would further weaken the economic advantage of mass rødseth and tjora 2014 however with their increased demand in the future competitive options may emerge hogg and ghosh 2016 therefore it is essential to evaluate techniques that decrease the probability of human error acanfora et al 2017a 2017b ramos et al 2018b 4 5 aggregation of factors finally all identified rif are aggregated and the results of this study for mass doa3 are depicted in figs 7 and 8 the results indicate that the majority of rif are attributed to o see fig 7 with all ship related and environment related rif 95 6 of human related rif and 85 7 of technology related rif being assigned to this phase the results also illustrate that the largest numbers of rif are related to h see fig 8 with 23 h rifs accounting for 41 8 of all identified rif 5 discussion limitation and future work 5 1 contribution of this study this study contributes to the research on risk or safety of mass in the following three aspects firstly the results of the analysis may be generalized for the maritime domain as an exploration of the outstanding rif regarding monitoring or control of unmanned vessels in a shore based environment furthermore the identified rif during different operational phases can be beneficial for the design of the input for both system and operational procedures by initiating considerations regarding how to overcome or mitigate the disadvantages of these factors during the design or operational phases secondly the results show that most rif appear during the phase of open sea navigation on one hand during this phase there is no crew on board for a mass doa3 under normal condition in this context no quick direct human interventions on board can help to deal with an emergency on the other hand during the berthing and unberthing phases as well as the port approaching and departing phases even if navigational conditions are more difficult than during phase of open sea navigation advantages in retaining these two phases still exist e g available shore ship communication systems or sufficient rescue resources nevertheless this does not prevent the distribution of rif in different phrases that may be changed in the future to overcome the disadvantage of these rif during the phase of open sea navigation a concrete policy is specifically proposed for the high sea operation new international rules should be implemented for the guidance of an operator handling a mass on high seas alternatively the current codes for navigation safety on high sea may be modified by coordinating the actions performed by an operator in scc and the behavior of the crew on board of conventional ship s thirdly the results also indicate that the number of human factors is maximal among the four types of factors which may sound counterintuitive for an unmanned ship at first glance however it must be kept in mind that the human factor is not expected to be fully removed from the system during the operation of mass doa3 rather a human is expected to be reallocated to shore based centers which may create additional challenges for example the operator may be expected to monitor several ships at the same time thus operating in various geographical locations and numerous environmental conditions therefore such detachment from real sea conditions may cause the operator to fail to fully grasp the situation thus the operator s performance may be expected to deteriorate prison et al 2013 another issue is information overload which may be caused by the volume of information produced all of which are simultaneously delivered and processed the data can be related not only to ship navigation but also to machinery and other critical systems this is true for all ships that are monitored by a single operator jalonen et al 2017 to compensate for the lack of full situational awareness and the massive information flow another concrete policy was proposed here the operator is expected to possess specific skills and professional knowledge similar to that of crews of traditional ships while the design of scc should be user centered man et al 2014 2015 5 2 limitations and future work three main limitations in the proposed framework procedure and identified results are highlighted in the following firstly even though section 2 1 3 illustrates the validation of the proposed framework a number of factors outside of the 4p4f framework might be omitted for example indirect or direct organizational rif yang et al 2017 may be significant for an ocean going mass with assisted scc operation several rif e g poor shift change h22 inappropriately structured organizational hierarchy e1 inappropriate safety culture e2 inadequate shore services e3 and inadequate design of scc e4 may be related to organizational issues however in this study organizational rif are not completely considered the main reasons are as follows on the one hand how to remotely control a mass doa3 still remains an open issue while on the other hand little work focuses on topics related to scc in the future the 4p4f framework may be extended or revised to include more types of factors for example organizational rif related to the anticipated scc may be developed in the future when more efforts from research or industry are gradually directed to scc secondly the uncertainty of results cannot be avoided because of subjectivity in the procedure of this study as with any literature review in step 1 the subjectivity in the selection and analysis of the materials is not completely prevented in step 2 and step 3 a 9 expert panel is invited to merge or delete primary rif to further group rif in each type and to determine whether a rif appears in a given operational phase however expert elicitation suffers from a number of limitations e g a relatively small number of experts may not be considered representative and the elicitation procedure may fail to faithfully capture the true views of experts hänninen et al 2014a 2014b to reduce such uncertainty the quantity of related literature should be expanded as further research results are released or by integrating the experience obtained in the future rather than relying on expert elicitation learning from objective data would be required e g analyzing statistical accidents incidents or near miss accident data if available finally the relationships among these identified rif have not been explored several of the identified rif may cause other rif an omission error h13 i e automation induced complacency may be caused by a lack of vigilance h5 but could be eliminated by the integrated display sheridan and parasuraman 2005 in the future the relationships of these rif need to be explored to enhance the understanding of the influence of a specific rif on the safety of mass operation 6 conclusions this paper identifies rif that affect the navigational safety of mass doa3 to this end a framework 4p4f is introduced consisting of four operational phases v b p and o and four types of factors h s e and t based on this framework a 3 step procedure is developed following these steps 55 rif and their distribution throughout the above mentioned four operational phases are presented the results show that open sea navigation is the phase with the highest numbers of rif containing all ship related and environment related rif as well as most human related and environment related rif however most rif are related to human factors which supply almost 42 of all identified rif from the perspective of the practical application the results may assist designers and operators to overcome or reduce the drawbacks of these rif which in turn may facilitate the operation safety of mass doa3 since the identification of rif is an iterative process during the life cycle of mass in the future the obtained rif can be updated as new objective data becomes available declaration of competing interestcoi

21978,noise radiated from an autonomous underwater vehicle auv is one of the major sources of interference that impact the acoustic performance of its towed array sensor especially during passive detection under low ambient noise conditions in this paper an adaptive noise canceller anc based on the partitioned fast block least mean square adaptive algorithm is designed and applied to mitigate the auv radiated noise to improve the detection performance of a linear array towed by an auv platform the gain defined as the ratio of the output signal to noise ratio snr to the input snr is taken as the metric for our anc results obtained from processing the experimental data indicate that the gain of the anc is up to 20 db keywords adaptive noise canceller autonomous underwater vehicle towed linear array underwater sensing system for auvs 1 introduction the mobility and autonomy of autonomous underwater vehicles auvs allow them to operate without intervention and over larger areas making them very attractive for underwater applications holmes et al 2006 newhall et al 2017 glegg et al 2001 ferri et al 2018 munafὸ et al 2017 chotiros and pallayil 2013 an array of hydrophones towed by auvs is able to provide a larger aperture for directional sensing underwater than a single hydrophone or an array of hydrophones mounted on auvs especially at low frequencies auvs fitted with towed arrays hence provide a useful tool for underwater detection and surveillance applications holmes et al 2005 pallayil et al 2007 2009 maguer et al 2008 the radiated noise from an auv is a major concern for towed arrays and needs to be addressed to improve the detection performance fig 1 shows the spectrogram of data collected by using an auv towed array system during one of our experiments with and without the auv in motion it can be found that there is significant auv noise could potentially mask detection of some of the underwater objects of interest there are other studies conducted on the characteristics of noise radiated from auvs leading to similar conclusions that it could reduce the passive detection capabilities of towed arrays especially under low ambient noise conditions munafὸ et al 2017 cheng and pallayil 2017 holmes et al 2010 zimmerman et al 2005 griffiths et al 2001 it is therefore necessary to mitigate the effect of auv noise on the array to improve its detection performance many researchers have investigated the effect of ship radiated noise on conventional large towed arrays and how to reduce their impact on array performance candy and sullivan 2005 sullivan and candy 2005 most studies provide only a theoretical framework and are based on reference signals they have also not discussed how to choose the reference signals for their proposed methods in reference cederholm and jönsson 2008 results from processing of real data are given but their methods require prior knowledge of ship noise which may be difficult to obtain in many cases the characteristic of auv radiated noise is however different from that of ship radiated noise as auvs employ electrical motors for their propulsion system the speed of an auv is generally low which means that cavitation noise is not very significant when compared with ship noise arveson and vendittis 2000 hodges 2011 from references munafὸ et al 2017 holmes et al 2010 zimmerman et al 2005 and griffiths et al 2001 it can be found that the noise sources of auv under study are dominated by the acoustic noise due to auv vibration the noise spectrum of auv mainly consists of a few strong narrowband components and the frequency range is higher than that of ship radiated noise arveson and vendittis 2000 holmes et al 2010 zimmerman et al 2005 hodges 2011 therefore suppressing auv radiated noise at the towed array sensors may require a modified approach different from the existing techniques applied to ship based towed arrays there is limited information available in open literature on how to design an adaptive noise canceller anc for auv towed array systems we address the gap by proposing an anc and evaluate its performance by applying to the data collected using an auv towed array system the anc is realized by employing an adaptive filter widrow et al 1975 harrison et al 1986 farhang boroujeny 2013 haykin 2002 to design the anc we need to determine a reference signal filter length and an adaptive algorithm the filter length is the number of taps used in the adaptive filter due to the complexity of the noise propagation from auvs to towed arrays the required filter length tends to be large as will be explained in the next section considering both the auv noise spectral characteristics and the large filter length needed the partitioned fast block least mean square pfblms algorithm farhang boroujeny 2013 is employed in the designed anc the gain of the anc defined as the ratio of the output signal to noise ratio snr to input snr of the anc is used to evaluate the performance widrow et al 1975 the noise in the definition of the gain refers to the auv noise received the results of processing data from the array show that the gain of the anc designed is up to 20 db we also evaluate the performance of the anc through beamforming the array output and by injecting a source which is embedded below the interfering signal the results show that a source 20 db below the interfering signal could be successfully detected by using the anc the contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows extending the technique of adaptive noise cancellation into a new application mitigating auv noise on its towed array system designing a special and promising anc with considering the characteristics of the auv noise received at the array this paper is organized as follows section 2 discusses the characteristics of auv noise received at towed arrays the anc design is presented in section 3 section 4 evaluates the performance and computational complexity of the designed anc the outcomes of the study are concluded in section 5 2 characteristics of the auv radiated noise before designing an anc it is necessary to figure out the characteristics of the auv noise received at our towed linear array we analyze the characteristics of the noise spectrum its propagation and autocorrelation time in this section 2 1 spectrum of the received noise the spectral characteristic of the auv noise is an important consideration when choosing or designing an adaptive algorithm for the anc fig 1 shows that the spectrum of the auv noise consists of several strong narrowband components for comparison the spectrogram of the data received by the array when the auv propulsion is switched off is also provided in the same figure from fig 1 it can be observed that the noise level received at the array drops substantially when the auv propulsion is switched off indicating that the dominant noise contribution is from the auv propulsion system a schematic of the experimental arrangement used for our data collection is shown in fig 2 the platform employed in the experiment was a mid sized auv of 2 50 m long 0 32 m in diameter and weighing 150 kg the auv was moving at a speed of approximately 3 knots the array has 12 acoustic channels uniformly distributed with a channel spacing of 0 51 m 2 2 noise propagation from the auv to the array it is reasonable to assume that the majority of the auv noise sources are nearly omni directional holmes et al 2010 the noise propagation from auvs to towed arrays can be thought of as a complex near field problem limited by the bottom and surface of the ocean kuperman et al 1985 the characteristics of the bottom and surface will influence noise propagation the simple multipath model cannot describe noise propagation accurately the complexity must be considered when determining the filter length of the anc 2 3 autocorrelation time the autocorrelation function of one segment of the auv noise from 500 hz to 3000 hz is shown in fig 3 the reason we choose the frequency band from 500 hz to 3000 hz is that most of the power from the auv generated noise in our experiment is distributed in this band it is also the band of interest in the passive detection using the auv towed array when the correlation coefficient between two samples namely the autocorrelation function value is low enough the two samples are thought as uncorrelated from fig 3 it can be found that the correlation coefficient decreases from 1 to 0 1 it is hence thought as in this paper that the two samples which have the correlation coefficient of 0 1 are uncorrelated the autocorrelation time of the auv noise received is referred to as the minimum delay between the two uncorrelated samples from the autocorrelation function of the auv noise in fig 3 we obtain that the minimum delay is 0 20 s thus the autocorrelation time of the auv noise received is 0 20 s the autocorrelation time of the auv noise received at the towed array can be taken as a reference to determine the adaptive filter length for a sampling frequency of 10 khz based on the autocorrelation time 0 20 s the adaptive filter length in our anc should be larger than or equal to 0 20 10 000 2000 this large adaptive filter length poses a computational load problem in real time noise cancellation when using the time domain adaptive algorithms this problem is resolved by employing the frequency domain adaptive algorithm based on the fast fourier transform fft 3 design of anc the schematic of the designed anc is shown in fig 4 as stated previously to design an anc for auv based towed array systems we need to determine the reference signal the adaptive filter length and the corresponding adaptive algorithm 3 1 reference signal usually an additional sensor is placed next to the auv for generating the reference signal however the additional sensor does not only increase the hardware complexity but also potentially introduces its own noise sources which are uncorrelated to the auv noise received by the sensors of the array thereby impacting the performance of the anc besides the additional sensor increases the power consumption and hardware cost in our approach we choose the array beamformer output along the auv direction as the reference it is reasonable to assume that the auv and the towed array are lying in a straight line this assumption has been further verified by comparing the depth and heading of the array and auv using engineering sensors available inside the array and also on the auv for a uniformly weighted line array with 12 elements the width 3 db of the end fire beam is around 25 from 65 to 90 when using the angle definition in fig 6 if we steer the array beam to the auv and weak signals which interest the auv towed array are not from the direction of the end fire beam the conventional beamforming output will amplify the auv noise by approximately n times van trees 2004 compared to the auv noise received at each sensor of the array because they are not from the direction of the auv noise the weak signals will not be amplified the above analysis reveals that when using the end fire beamformer output as the reference of the proposed anc if the weak signals are from the direction of the end fire beam the proposed anc may not work the blind directions of the proposed anc will be analyzed in detail in section 4 every sensor of the array has a designed noise canceller after cancelling the auv noise received by all the sensors the performance of the array will be improved significantly 3 2 adaptive filter length although the noise propagation from the auv to the towed array is complex the propagation delays calculated based on the geometry of the surface and bottom can still be taken as a reference for estimating the adaptive filter length when calculating the delay the simple multipath model is assumed we only considered the paths reflected by the bottom or surface as shown in fig 5 d is the distance between the auv and first sensor of the array l is the length of the array h 1 is the ocean depth and h 2 is the operating depth of the array when h 2 h 1 2 the delay for determining the adaptive filter length can be determined by the propagation delay corresponding to the path reflected via the bottom similarly when h 2 h 1 2 the delay for determining the adaptive filter length is determined by the propagation delay related to the path reflected via the surface the propagation delay due to the bottom reflected path can be calculated by the following formula 1 τ 0 2 l d 2 2 h 1 h 2 2 c where c is the sound speed let f s denote the sampling frequency if we use the delay to estimate the adaptive filter length required it can be expressed as 2 n f s τ 0 where represents the operation of obtaining the minimum integer larger than or equal to f s τ 0 the anc is designed to be robust to the shallow water environment as one would expect large delays due to multiple reflections at the ocean boundaries for illustration we choose a typical shallow water environment with parameters are as follows h 1 80 m h 2 10 m d 15 m l 6 m c 1500 m s and f s 10 khz according to eqs 1 and 2 n 944 in a more practical case more paths reflected by the bottom and surface may arrive at the towed array further the propagation of the auv noise from the auv to the array is a near field problem which is more complex than the multipath model therefore when designing the anc which is robust to the shallow water environment the adaptive filter length should be much larger than 944 the above multipath analysis of using the propagation delays shows that the adaptive filter length should be larger than 944 based on the analysis of the autocorrelation time in section 2 3 to make sure that all the correlated samples can be canceled the adaptive filter duration should longer than the autocorrelation time of 0 20 s which means the adaptive filter length required should be larger than 2000 0 20 10 000 with the sampling frequency of 10 000 hz in our adaptive algorithm shown in the following section fft is used which requires the adaptive filter length to be a power of two hence we have chosen an adaptive filter length of 2048 in our design 3 3 adaptive algorithm having determined the reference signal and adaptive filter length we need to choose what kind of adaptive algorithms to be used based on the noise characteristics and the filter length two factors that we have considered in the choice of adaptive algorithm are fast convergence behavior and efficient implementation the large adaptive filter length increases the computational load leading to slow convergence when using the time domain least mean square lms adaptive algorithm the fast block realization of the frequency domain adaptive algorithm farhang boroujeny 2013 will reduce the computational load and is therefore used in this study the convergence behavior of the time domain lms adaptive algorithms is generally determined by the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix r the correlation matrix is defined as 3 r e x n x h n where e denotes statistical expectation the superscript h denotes hermitian transpose and x n is an observation vector of a wide sense stationary stochastic process x n of an adaptive filter input r can be estimated by using time average the eigenvalues of r are directly related to the power spectral density psd of the adaptive filter input process farhang boroujeny 2013 the psd reflects the spectral content of the underlying process as a function of frequency the psd can be estimated by using the discrete fourier transform of the obtained correlation function of x n the convergence behavior of the time domain lms algorithm is frequency dependent assume the transfer function of an adaptive filter is w e j ω the rate of convergence of w e j ω towards its optimum value w o e j ω at a frequency ω ω 0 is determined by the relative value of the psd of the input signal at ω ω 0 a large value of the psd relative to the values in other frequencies means that the adaptive filter is well excited at ω ω 0 this results in fast convergence around ω ω 0 the time domain lms adaptive algorithm converges slowly over those frequencies in which the values of the psd are low as mentioned in section 2 the psd of auv radiated noise consists of several narrowband components if the time domain lms adaptive algorithm is used to cancel the auv noise the relatively small values in most of the frequencies of the auv noise will result in slow convergence of the algorithm when the adaptive algorithm is realized in the frequency domain the step normalization adaptation operation can be employed to normalize the input psd at all frequencies which means the corresponding psd values after normalization will become consistent then we use the normalized frequency domain signal for the adaptation of the filter tap weights in this situation the convergence speed of adaptive algorithm will increase greatly according to the analysis of the previous paragraph therefore considering that the psd of auv radiated noise consists of several narrowband components mainly the frequency domain step normalization adaptation will be a good choice the fast block least mean square fblms algorithm realizes the step adaptation in the frequency domain and includes the operation of the step normalization adaptation farhang boroujeny 2013 haykin 2002 hence for our application the fblms algorithm is a good choice in terms of convergence speed in fact we choose the partitioned fblms algorithm namely the pfblms algorithm as it is highly efficient and well suited for implementing large adaptive filters farhang boroujeny 2013 the fblms algorithm makes use of the fft and inverse fft ifft to improve the efficiency of the adaptive filter farhang boroujeny 2013 the efficiency of the fblms algorithm is high when the block length is comparable to the adaptive filter length however in our application the adaptive filter length is large and selecting an equivalent block length translates to high delay which cannot satisfy real time requirements the block adaptation in the fblms algorithm incorporates the estimate of the correlation matrix related to the gradient vector of the adaptive filter haykin 2002 in practice auv radiated noise received by the array is non stationary thus if the block is too long estimation of the correlation matrix will not be accurate leading to poor performance of the fblms algorithm therefore for our application block length should be much shorter than the adaptive filter length and this is where the pfblms algorithm demonstrates its efficiency over the fblms algorithm in our design the adaptive filter length is 2048 and the block length is 128 if the block length becomes longer we find that the performance of the adaptive algorithm will start to deteriorate for these reasons we employed the pfblms algorithm farhang boroujeny 2013 a brief description of the pfblms algorithm farhang boroujeny 2013 is given here let s n denote a signal received at the towed array the strong auv noise received at one of the sensors of the array is denoted by v 0 n where n is the sample number then the received signal x n can be expressed as 4 x n s n v 0 n the adaptive filter length is denoted by n for the pfblms algorithm n is expressed as 5 n p m where p is the number of partitions and m is the partition length let l denote the block length in the pfblms algorithm m is expressed as 6 m p l where p is an integer letter k denotes block index the input vector of the adaptive filter farhang boroujeny 2013 is 7 x 0 k x k l m x k l m 1 x k l l 1 k 1 2 p 1 p the frequency domain vector of x 0 k is 8 x f 0 k fft x 0 k where fft means the fast fourier transform operation the output vector of the adaptive filter is 9 y k the last l elements of ifft l 0 p 1 w f l k x f l k p l where ifft means the operation of the inverse fast fourier transform denotes element by element multiplication of vectors w f l k is the tap weight vector the update of the tap weight vector is given as 10 w f l k 1 w f l k 2 μ k x f l k p l e f k where μ k is the step size vector obtained by the step normalization and e f k is the frequency domain error estimate given as 11 e f k fft 0 e k where e k is the time domain error given as 12 e k d k y k where d k is the desired output vector μ k is expressed as 13 μ k μ 0 k μ 1 k μ m 1 k t where m m l the step normalization of the pfblms algorithm is given as 14 μ i k μ 0 σ ˆ f 0 i 2 k i 0 m 1 where μ 0 is a common unnormalized σ ˆ f 0 i 2 k s are the power estimates of the samples of the filter frequency domain input x f 0 k expressed as 15 σ ˆ f 0 i 2 k β σ ˆ f 0 i 2 k 1 1 β x f 0 i k 2 where β is a constant close to but smaller than 1 the frequency domain step normalization is the key to the proposed anc the detailed steps of the pfblms algorithm are shown in the appendix 4 performance evaluation the performance of our designed anc in cancelling the auv noise and its computational complexity are given in this section 4 1 auv noise cancellation performance the designed anc was applied to the data collected from a sea trial fig 6 shows the operational scenario during the auv noise data collection and the injected signal the ocean depth was 20 m the depth of auv was 5 m the auv speed was approximately 3 knots the distance between the auv and first sensor of the array was 15 m the 12 hydrophone channels of the array were uniformly distributed with a channel spacing of 0 5 m corresponding to halfwavelength at 1 5 khz to test the functionality of the algorithm in detecting the object signal under the auv nosie a weak signal was numerically added into the collected noise data the power ratio of the weak signal to the auv noise received by the first sensor of the array was set to 20 db two frequencies of the weak signals with the same amplitude 1300 hz and 1405 hz were used in our evaluation the frequency of 1405 hz was in one of the prominent auv noise bands the frequency of 1300 hz was not overlapped with the auv noise bands using the geometry definition in fig 6 the direction of the weak signal varied from 0 to 90 to evaluate the anc performance for signals from different directions the adaptive technique inverse beamforming has been successfully applied to cancel ship noise for towed line arrays li 2012 robert and beerens 2002 even though the inverse beamforming method has not been applied to cancel noise for auv based towed array systems we chose it as the reference method to verify our anc the reference method assumes that interferences or noise received at each sensor are the same except for the differences of propagation delays the steps of the reference method are briefly given as follows 1 do conventional beamforming in all the directions and find the beam with the maximum magnitude 2 attenuate the maximum beam output by n times for the array with n sensors and delay the attenuated beam output with different delays for different sensors 3 substract the signal received at each sensor by the corresponding delayed and attenuated beam output 4 repeat steps 1 3 until that the weak signal is found the gain of a noise canceller was used as a parameter for evaluating the performance of the anc widrow et al 1975 this parameter is explained in fig 7 and written as 16 g s n r o u t s n r i n where s n r i n is the input signal to noise ratio snr of the noise canceller and s n r o u t is the output snr here it should emphasized that the signal is from the far field weak target and the noise is the auv radiated noise received at the sensors of the array which dominates the received noise and hence is required to be cancelled first we evaluate the performance of the proposed anc at different frequencies 1300 hz and 1405 hz where the direction of the weak signal is 50 fig 8 a and b show the psds of data without and with the anc for the two frequencies used ideally the weak signal should not be influenced by use of the anc to cancel the auv noise from fig 8 a it can be found that when the frequency of the weak signal is not overlapped with the auv noise band the anc has no observable influence on the weak signal while fig 8 b shows that when frequency of the weak signal is overlapped with the auv noise band the component of the weak signal is slightly decreased this means the situation that the signal frequency is in the frequency band of the auv noise is more challenging for the proposed anc to better verify the anc the frequency of 1405 hz of the weak signal is used in the following evaluation data from the sea trial showed that the amplitudes of the auv noise received at different sensors are different because the anc should be robust to the sensor location it is necessary to illustrate the processing results of different sensors we picked up two sensor locations where the expected levels of auv noise is maximum sensor 1 and sensor 12 fig 9 a shows the psds of data from the first sensor of the array without and with the designed anc fig 10 a shows similar psds curves for the 12th sensor of the array for comparison the results from the reference method the inverse beamforming li 2012 robert and beerens 2002 are also provided in figs 9 c and fig 10 c it can be seen that with the anc the auv noise is cancelled well and the weak signal is well identified the performance of the reference method is not as good as that of the anc the reference method is based on the assumption that the auv noise received at different sensors is the same except for the different propagation delays the anc in this paper has no such an assumption the received auv noise differs for different sensors which is the main reason that the reference method cannot perform as good as the proposed anc the comparison between figs 9 and 10 demonstrates that the designed anc performs well for different sensors and is robust to the noise levels at different sensors the gain of the anc in the frequency band around 1400 hz is 20 db next we evaluate the performance of the anc for different signal directions fig 11 shows the gain of the anc from the broadside 0 to the endfire 90 it can be found that the performance of the anc deteriorates for the signal direction of 60 onwards when using the proposed anc this shortcoming should be noted finally the beamformed outputs of the array before and after noise cancellation are given in fig 12 the conventional delay and sum method in the time domain was used to do beamforming from fig 12 it can be seen that because the auv noise is strong the beamformed output is not able to resolve the signal added at the relevant look direction after using the anc the signal is recovered reasonably well at the expected look angle of 50 the arrival at broadside can be found from fig 12 it is caused by the electronic noise component in each sensor coupled from the same circuit because there is no delay among the electronic noise components of all the sensors with beamforming the electronic noise component is enhanced at broadside and the broadside arrival appears in fig 12 the problem of the electronic noise can be solved by designing a better circuit and is not the focus of our research this does not influence the performance evaluation of the anc 4 2 computational complexity the per sample computational complexity of the pfblms algorithm used in our anc can be evaluated using eq 8 99 of reference farhang boroujeny 2013 given as 17 c p 1 l p 3 4 p 1 log 2 p 1 l 2 the per sample computational complexity of the adaptive algorithm means the number of operations including multiplication and addition required for processing one sample according to eq 17 the per sample computational complexity of the pfblms algorithm used in the anc is 50 as for the time domain lms based algorithm with the filter length of 2048 2048 multiplications are performed to compute the output haykin 2002 per sample and a further 2048 multiplications are required to update the tap weights the per sample computational complexity of the time domain lms based algorithms should be equal to or higher than 4096 therefore it can be concluded that the designed anc is of much higher efficiency 5 conclusion the design of an anc to mitigate the impact of noise of an auv on its towed array system is explored in detail in this paper the experimental data used in this study showed that noise generated by an auv can significantly interfere and thus limit the detection performance of its towed array system the auv noise spectrum mainly consisted of tonal components the designed anc employed the pbflms algorithm to obtain fast convergence speed and high efficiency and took the beam output steered towards the auv as the reference the results indicated that the proposed anc was able to recover a source signal embedded in a noise which is 20 db higher than the source signal in terms of beamforming performance it was observed that the reference method did not perform as good as the proposed anc the proposed anc also has a shortcoming that its performance deteriorates for the signal direction of 60 onwards in our study we injected a target signal numerically to test the performance of the anc in recovering it in the presence of auv noise in the future we plan to test the designed anc with sources in water another area of interest

21978,noise radiated from an autonomous underwater vehicle auv is one of the major sources of interference that impact the acoustic performance of its towed array sensor especially during passive detection under low ambient noise conditions in this paper an adaptive noise canceller anc based on the partitioned fast block least mean square adaptive algorithm is designed and applied to mitigate the auv radiated noise to improve the detection performance of a linear array towed by an auv platform the gain defined as the ratio of the output signal to noise ratio snr to the input snr is taken as the metric for our anc results obtained from processing the experimental data indicate that the gain of the anc is up to 20 db keywords adaptive noise canceller autonomous underwater vehicle towed linear array underwater sensing system for auvs 1 introduction the mobility and autonomy of autonomous underwater vehicles auvs allow them to operate without intervention and over larger areas making them very attractive for underwater applications holmes et al 2006 newhall et al 2017 glegg et al 2001 ferri et al 2018 munafὸ et al 2017 chotiros and pallayil 2013 an array of hydrophones towed by auvs is able to provide a larger aperture for directional sensing underwater than a single hydrophone or an array of hydrophones mounted on auvs especially at low frequencies auvs fitted with towed arrays hence provide a useful tool for underwater detection and surveillance applications holmes et al 2005 pallayil et al 2007 2009 maguer et al 2008 the radiated noise from an auv is a major concern for towed arrays and needs to be addressed to improve the detection performance fig 1 shows the spectrogram of data collected by using an auv towed array system during one of our experiments with and without the auv in motion it can be found that there is significant auv noise could potentially mask detection of some of the underwater objects of interest there are other studies conducted on the characteristics of noise radiated from auvs leading to similar conclusions that it could reduce the passive detection capabilities of towed arrays especially under low ambient noise conditions munafὸ et al 2017 cheng and pallayil 2017 holmes et al 2010 zimmerman et al 2005 griffiths et al 2001 it is therefore necessary to mitigate the effect of auv noise on the array to improve its detection performance many researchers have investigated the effect of ship radiated noise on conventional large towed arrays and how to reduce their impact on array performance candy and sullivan 2005 sullivan and candy 2005 most studies provide only a theoretical framework and are based on reference signals they have also not discussed how to choose the reference signals for their proposed methods in reference cederholm and jönsson 2008 results from processing of real data are given but their methods require prior knowledge of ship noise which may be difficult to obtain in many cases the characteristic of auv radiated noise is however different from that of ship radiated noise as auvs employ electrical motors for their propulsion system the speed of an auv is generally low which means that cavitation noise is not very significant when compared with ship noise arveson and vendittis 2000 hodges 2011 from references munafὸ et al 2017 holmes et al 2010 zimmerman et al 2005 and griffiths et al 2001 it can be found that the noise sources of auv under study are dominated by the acoustic noise due to auv vibration the noise spectrum of auv mainly consists of a few strong narrowband components and the frequency range is higher than that of ship radiated noise arveson and vendittis 2000 holmes et al 2010 zimmerman et al 2005 hodges 2011 therefore suppressing auv radiated noise at the towed array sensors may require a modified approach different from the existing techniques applied to ship based towed arrays there is limited information available in open literature on how to design an adaptive noise canceller anc for auv towed array systems we address the gap by proposing an anc and evaluate its performance by applying to the data collected using an auv towed array system the anc is realized by employing an adaptive filter widrow et al 1975 harrison et al 1986 farhang boroujeny 2013 haykin 2002 to design the anc we need to determine a reference signal filter length and an adaptive algorithm the filter length is the number of taps used in the adaptive filter due to the complexity of the noise propagation from auvs to towed arrays the required filter length tends to be large as will be explained in the next section considering both the auv noise spectral characteristics and the large filter length needed the partitioned fast block least mean square pfblms algorithm farhang boroujeny 2013 is employed in the designed anc the gain of the anc defined as the ratio of the output signal to noise ratio snr to input snr of the anc is used to evaluate the performance widrow et al 1975 the noise in the definition of the gain refers to the auv noise received the results of processing data from the array show that the gain of the anc designed is up to 20 db we also evaluate the performance of the anc through beamforming the array output and by injecting a source which is embedded below the interfering signal the results show that a source 20 db below the interfering signal could be successfully detected by using the anc the contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows extending the technique of adaptive noise cancellation into a new application mitigating auv noise on its towed array system designing a special and promising anc with considering the characteristics of the auv noise received at the array this paper is organized as follows section 2 discusses the characteristics of auv noise received at towed arrays the anc design is presented in section 3 section 4 evaluates the performance and computational complexity of the designed anc the outcomes of the study are concluded in section 5 2 characteristics of the auv radiated noise before designing an anc it is necessary to figure out the characteristics of the auv noise received at our towed linear array we analyze the characteristics of the noise spectrum its propagation and autocorrelation time in this section 2 1 spectrum of the received noise the spectral characteristic of the auv noise is an important consideration when choosing or designing an adaptive algorithm for the anc fig 1 shows that the spectrum of the auv noise consists of several strong narrowband components for comparison the spectrogram of the data received by the array when the auv propulsion is switched off is also provided in the same figure from fig 1 it can be observed that the noise level received at the array drops substantially when the auv propulsion is switched off indicating that the dominant noise contribution is from the auv propulsion system a schematic of the experimental arrangement used for our data collection is shown in fig 2 the platform employed in the experiment was a mid sized auv of 2 50 m long 0 32 m in diameter and weighing 150 kg the auv was moving at a speed of approximately 3 knots the array has 12 acoustic channels uniformly distributed with a channel spacing of 0 51 m 2 2 noise propagation from the auv to the array it is reasonable to assume that the majority of the auv noise sources are nearly omni directional holmes et al 2010 the noise propagation from auvs to towed arrays can be thought of as a complex near field problem limited by the bottom and surface of the ocean kuperman et al 1985 the characteristics of the bottom and surface will influence noise propagation the simple multipath model cannot describe noise propagation accurately the complexity must be considered when determining the filter length of the anc 2 3 autocorrelation time the autocorrelation function of one segment of the auv noise from 500 hz to 3000 hz is shown in fig 3 the reason we choose the frequency band from 500 hz to 3000 hz is that most of the power from the auv generated noise in our experiment is distributed in this band it is also the band of interest in the passive detection using the auv towed array when the correlation coefficient between two samples namely the autocorrelation function value is low enough the two samples are thought as uncorrelated from fig 3 it can be found that the correlation coefficient decreases from 1 to 0 1 it is hence thought as in this paper that the two samples which have the correlation coefficient of 0 1 are uncorrelated the autocorrelation time of the auv noise received is referred to as the minimum delay between the two uncorrelated samples from the autocorrelation function of the auv noise in fig 3 we obtain that the minimum delay is 0 20 s thus the autocorrelation time of the auv noise received is 0 20 s the autocorrelation time of the auv noise received at the towed array can be taken as a reference to determine the adaptive filter length for a sampling frequency of 10 khz based on the autocorrelation time 0 20 s the adaptive filter length in our anc should be larger than or equal to 0 20 10 000 2000 this large adaptive filter length poses a computational load problem in real time noise cancellation when using the time domain adaptive algorithms this problem is resolved by employing the frequency domain adaptive algorithm based on the fast fourier transform fft 3 design of anc the schematic of the designed anc is shown in fig 4 as stated previously to design an anc for auv based towed array systems we need to determine the reference signal the adaptive filter length and the corresponding adaptive algorithm 3 1 reference signal usually an additional sensor is placed next to the auv for generating the reference signal however the additional sensor does not only increase the hardware complexity but also potentially introduces its own noise sources which are uncorrelated to the auv noise received by the sensors of the array thereby impacting the performance of the anc besides the additional sensor increases the power consumption and hardware cost in our approach we choose the array beamformer output along the auv direction as the reference it is reasonable to assume that the auv and the towed array are lying in a straight line this assumption has been further verified by comparing the depth and heading of the array and auv using engineering sensors available inside the array and also on the auv for a uniformly weighted line array with 12 elements the width 3 db of the end fire beam is around 25 from 65 to 90 when using the angle definition in fig 6 if we steer the array beam to the auv and weak signals which interest the auv towed array are not from the direction of the end fire beam the conventional beamforming output will amplify the auv noise by approximately n times van trees 2004 compared to the auv noise received at each sensor of the array because they are not from the direction of the auv noise the weak signals will not be amplified the above analysis reveals that when using the end fire beamformer output as the reference of the proposed anc if the weak signals are from the direction of the end fire beam the proposed anc may not work the blind directions of the proposed anc will be analyzed in detail in section 4 every sensor of the array has a designed noise canceller after cancelling the auv noise received by all the sensors the performance of the array will be improved significantly 3 2 adaptive filter length although the noise propagation from the auv to the towed array is complex the propagation delays calculated based on the geometry of the surface and bottom can still be taken as a reference for estimating the adaptive filter length when calculating the delay the simple multipath model is assumed we only considered the paths reflected by the bottom or surface as shown in fig 5 d is the distance between the auv and first sensor of the array l is the length of the array h 1 is the ocean depth and h 2 is the operating depth of the array when h 2 h 1 2 the delay for determining the adaptive filter length can be determined by the propagation delay corresponding to the path reflected via the bottom similarly when h 2 h 1 2 the delay for determining the adaptive filter length is determined by the propagation delay related to the path reflected via the surface the propagation delay due to the bottom reflected path can be calculated by the following formula 1 τ 0 2 l d 2 2 h 1 h 2 2 c where c is the sound speed let f s denote the sampling frequency if we use the delay to estimate the adaptive filter length required it can be expressed as 2 n f s τ 0 where represents the operation of obtaining the minimum integer larger than or equal to f s τ 0 the anc is designed to be robust to the shallow water environment as one would expect large delays due to multiple reflections at the ocean boundaries for illustration we choose a typical shallow water environment with parameters are as follows h 1 80 m h 2 10 m d 15 m l 6 m c 1500 m s and f s 10 khz according to eqs 1 and 2 n 944 in a more practical case more paths reflected by the bottom and surface may arrive at the towed array further the propagation of the auv noise from the auv to the array is a near field problem which is more complex than the multipath model therefore when designing the anc which is robust to the shallow water environment the adaptive filter length should be much larger than 944 the above multipath analysis of using the propagation delays shows that the adaptive filter length should be larger than 944 based on the analysis of the autocorrelation time in section 2 3 to make sure that all the correlated samples can be canceled the adaptive filter duration should longer than the autocorrelation time of 0 20 s which means the adaptive filter length required should be larger than 2000 0 20 10 000 with the sampling frequency of 10 000 hz in our adaptive algorithm shown in the following section fft is used which requires the adaptive filter length to be a power of two hence we have chosen an adaptive filter length of 2048 in our design 3 3 adaptive algorithm having determined the reference signal and adaptive filter length we need to choose what kind of adaptive algorithms to be used based on the noise characteristics and the filter length two factors that we have considered in the choice of adaptive algorithm are fast convergence behavior and efficient implementation the large adaptive filter length increases the computational load leading to slow convergence when using the time domain least mean square lms adaptive algorithm the fast block realization of the frequency domain adaptive algorithm farhang boroujeny 2013 will reduce the computational load and is therefore used in this study the convergence behavior of the time domain lms adaptive algorithms is generally determined by the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix r the correlation matrix is defined as 3 r e x n x h n where e denotes statistical expectation the superscript h denotes hermitian transpose and x n is an observation vector of a wide sense stationary stochastic process x n of an adaptive filter input r can be estimated by using time average the eigenvalues of r are directly related to the power spectral density psd of the adaptive filter input process farhang boroujeny 2013 the psd reflects the spectral content of the underlying process as a function of frequency the psd can be estimated by using the discrete fourier transform of the obtained correlation function of x n the convergence behavior of the time domain lms algorithm is frequency dependent assume the transfer function of an adaptive filter is w e j ω the rate of convergence of w e j ω towards its optimum value w o e j ω at a frequency ω ω 0 is determined by the relative value of the psd of the input signal at ω ω 0 a large value of the psd relative to the values in other frequencies means that the adaptive filter is well excited at ω ω 0 this results in fast convergence around ω ω 0 the time domain lms adaptive algorithm converges slowly over those frequencies in which the values of the psd are low as mentioned in section 2 the psd of auv radiated noise consists of several narrowband components if the time domain lms adaptive algorithm is used to cancel the auv noise the relatively small values in most of the frequencies of the auv noise will result in slow convergence of the algorithm when the adaptive algorithm is realized in the frequency domain the step normalization adaptation operation can be employed to normalize the input psd at all frequencies which means the corresponding psd values after normalization will become consistent then we use the normalized frequency domain signal for the adaptation of the filter tap weights in this situation the convergence speed of adaptive algorithm will increase greatly according to the analysis of the previous paragraph therefore considering that the psd of auv radiated noise consists of several narrowband components mainly the frequency domain step normalization adaptation will be a good choice the fast block least mean square fblms algorithm realizes the step adaptation in the frequency domain and includes the operation of the step normalization adaptation farhang boroujeny 2013 haykin 2002 hence for our application the fblms algorithm is a good choice in terms of convergence speed in fact we choose the partitioned fblms algorithm namely the pfblms algorithm as it is highly efficient and well suited for implementing large adaptive filters farhang boroujeny 2013 the fblms algorithm makes use of the fft and inverse fft ifft to improve the efficiency of the adaptive filter farhang boroujeny 2013 the efficiency of the fblms algorithm is high when the block length is comparable to the adaptive filter length however in our application the adaptive filter length is large and selecting an equivalent block length translates to high delay which cannot satisfy real time requirements the block adaptation in the fblms algorithm incorporates the estimate of the correlation matrix related to the gradient vector of the adaptive filter haykin 2002 in practice auv radiated noise received by the array is non stationary thus if the block is too long estimation of the correlation matrix will not be accurate leading to poor performance of the fblms algorithm therefore for our application block length should be much shorter than the adaptive filter length and this is where the pfblms algorithm demonstrates its efficiency over the fblms algorithm in our design the adaptive filter length is 2048 and the block length is 128 if the block length becomes longer we find that the performance of the adaptive algorithm will start to deteriorate for these reasons we employed the pfblms algorithm farhang boroujeny 2013 a brief description of the pfblms algorithm farhang boroujeny 2013 is given here let s n denote a signal received at the towed array the strong auv noise received at one of the sensors of the array is denoted by v 0 n where n is the sample number then the received signal x n can be expressed as 4 x n s n v 0 n the adaptive filter length is denoted by n for the pfblms algorithm n is expressed as 5 n p m where p is the number of partitions and m is the partition length let l denote the block length in the pfblms algorithm m is expressed as 6 m p l where p is an integer letter k denotes block index the input vector of the adaptive filter farhang boroujeny 2013 is 7 x 0 k x k l m x k l m 1 x k l l 1 k 1 2 p 1 p the frequency domain vector of x 0 k is 8 x f 0 k fft x 0 k where fft means the fast fourier transform operation the output vector of the adaptive filter is 9 y k the last l elements of ifft l 0 p 1 w f l k x f l k p l where ifft means the operation of the inverse fast fourier transform denotes element by element multiplication of vectors w f l k is the tap weight vector the update of the tap weight vector is given as 10 w f l k 1 w f l k 2 μ k x f l k p l e f k where μ k is the step size vector obtained by the step normalization and e f k is the frequency domain error estimate given as 11 e f k fft 0 e k where e k is the time domain error given as 12 e k d k y k where d k is the desired output vector μ k is expressed as 13 μ k μ 0 k μ 1 k μ m 1 k t where m m l the step normalization of the pfblms algorithm is given as 14 μ i k μ 0 σ ˆ f 0 i 2 k i 0 m 1 where μ 0 is a common unnormalized σ ˆ f 0 i 2 k s are the power estimates of the samples of the filter frequency domain input x f 0 k expressed as 15 σ ˆ f 0 i 2 k β σ ˆ f 0 i 2 k 1 1 β x f 0 i k 2 where β is a constant close to but smaller than 1 the frequency domain step normalization is the key to the proposed anc the detailed steps of the pfblms algorithm are shown in the appendix 4 performance evaluation the performance of our designed anc in cancelling the auv noise and its computational complexity are given in this section 4 1 auv noise cancellation performance the designed anc was applied to the data collected from a sea trial fig 6 shows the operational scenario during the auv noise data collection and the injected signal the ocean depth was 20 m the depth of auv was 5 m the auv speed was approximately 3 knots the distance between the auv and first sensor of the array was 15 m the 12 hydrophone channels of the array were uniformly distributed with a channel spacing of 0 5 m corresponding to halfwavelength at 1 5 khz to test the functionality of the algorithm in detecting the object signal under the auv nosie a weak signal was numerically added into the collected noise data the power ratio of the weak signal to the auv noise received by the first sensor of the array was set to 20 db two frequencies of the weak signals with the same amplitude 1300 hz and 1405 hz were used in our evaluation the frequency of 1405 hz was in one of the prominent auv noise bands the frequency of 1300 hz was not overlapped with the auv noise bands using the geometry definition in fig 6 the direction of the weak signal varied from 0 to 90 to evaluate the anc performance for signals from different directions the adaptive technique inverse beamforming has been successfully applied to cancel ship noise for towed line arrays li 2012 robert and beerens 2002 even though the inverse beamforming method has not been applied to cancel noise for auv based towed array systems we chose it as the reference method to verify our anc the reference method assumes that interferences or noise received at each sensor are the same except for the differences of propagation delays the steps of the reference method are briefly given as follows 1 do conventional beamforming in all the directions and find the beam with the maximum magnitude 2 attenuate the maximum beam output by n times for the array with n sensors and delay the attenuated beam output with different delays for different sensors 3 substract the signal received at each sensor by the corresponding delayed and attenuated beam output 4 repeat steps 1 3 until that the weak signal is found the gain of a noise canceller was used as a parameter for evaluating the performance of the anc widrow et al 1975 this parameter is explained in fig 7 and written as 16 g s n r o u t s n r i n where s n r i n is the input signal to noise ratio snr of the noise canceller and s n r o u t is the output snr here it should emphasized that the signal is from the far field weak target and the noise is the auv radiated noise received at the sensors of the array which dominates the received noise and hence is required to be cancelled first we evaluate the performance of the proposed anc at different frequencies 1300 hz and 1405 hz where the direction of the weak signal is 50 fig 8 a and b show the psds of data without and with the anc for the two frequencies used ideally the weak signal should not be influenced by use of the anc to cancel the auv noise from fig 8 a it can be found that when the frequency of the weak signal is not overlapped with the auv noise band the anc has no observable influence on the weak signal while fig 8 b shows that when frequency of the weak signal is overlapped with the auv noise band the component of the weak signal is slightly decreased this means the situation that the signal frequency is in the frequency band of the auv noise is more challenging for the proposed anc to better verify the anc the frequency of 1405 hz of the weak signal is used in the following evaluation data from the sea trial showed that the amplitudes of the auv noise received at different sensors are different because the anc should be robust to the sensor location it is necessary to illustrate the processing results of different sensors we picked up two sensor locations where the expected levels of auv noise is maximum sensor 1 and sensor 12 fig 9 a shows the psds of data from the first sensor of the array without and with the designed anc fig 10 a shows similar psds curves for the 12th sensor of the array for comparison the results from the reference method the inverse beamforming li 2012 robert and beerens 2002 are also provided in figs 9 c and fig 10 c it can be seen that with the anc the auv noise is cancelled well and the weak signal is well identified the performance of the reference method is not as good as that of the anc the reference method is based on the assumption that the auv noise received at different sensors is the same except for the different propagation delays the anc in this paper has no such an assumption the received auv noise differs for different sensors which is the main reason that the reference method cannot perform as good as the proposed anc the comparison between figs 9 and 10 demonstrates that the designed anc performs well for different sensors and is robust to the noise levels at different sensors the gain of the anc in the frequency band around 1400 hz is 20 db next we evaluate the performance of the anc for different signal directions fig 11 shows the gain of the anc from the broadside 0 to the endfire 90 it can be found that the performance of the anc deteriorates for the signal direction of 60 onwards when using the proposed anc this shortcoming should be noted finally the beamformed outputs of the array before and after noise cancellation are given in fig 12 the conventional delay and sum method in the time domain was used to do beamforming from fig 12 it can be seen that because the auv noise is strong the beamformed output is not able to resolve the signal added at the relevant look direction after using the anc the signal is recovered reasonably well at the expected look angle of 50 the arrival at broadside can be found from fig 12 it is caused by the electronic noise component in each sensor coupled from the same circuit because there is no delay among the electronic noise components of all the sensors with beamforming the electronic noise component is enhanced at broadside and the broadside arrival appears in fig 12 the problem of the electronic noise can be solved by designing a better circuit and is not the focus of our research this does not influence the performance evaluation of the anc 4 2 computational complexity the per sample computational complexity of the pfblms algorithm used in our anc can be evaluated using eq 8 99 of reference farhang boroujeny 2013 given as 17 c p 1 l p 3 4 p 1 log 2 p 1 l 2 the per sample computational complexity of the adaptive algorithm means the number of operations including multiplication and addition required for processing one sample according to eq 17 the per sample computational complexity of the pfblms algorithm used in the anc is 50 as for the time domain lms based algorithm with the filter length of 2048 2048 multiplications are performed to compute the output haykin 2002 per sample and a further 2048 multiplications are required to update the tap weights the per sample computational complexity of the time domain lms based algorithms should be equal to or higher than 4096 therefore it can be concluded that the designed anc is of much higher efficiency 5 conclusion the design of an anc to mitigate the impact of noise of an auv on its towed array system is explored in detail in this paper the experimental data used in this study showed that noise generated by an auv can significantly interfere and thus limit the detection performance of its towed array system the auv noise spectrum mainly consisted of

indicated that the proposed anc was able to recover a source signal embedded in a noise which is 20 db higher than the source signal in terms of beamforming performance it was observed that the reference method did not perform as good as the proposed anc the proposed anc also has a shortcoming that its performance deteriorates for the signal direction of 60 onwards in our study we injected a target signal numerically to test the performance of the anc in recovering it in the presence of auv noise in the future we plan to test the designed anc with sources in water another area of interest

to analyse the acceleration signal composition subsequently a numerical simulation model based on the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method to describe the water entering process of the vehicle is established and the accuracy and capability of the numerical algorithm is verified by comparison with the experimental data finally the frequency domain characteristics of the impact load are analysed through the shock response spectrum srs method the result shows that the maximum acceleration shock spectrum of the impact load is related to the peak pulse width of the impact load and independent of the peak value the smaller the pulse width is the larger the inflection point frequency and magnification of the shock response spectrum are the inflection point frequency of the shock response spectrum usually corresponds to the second order bending natural frequency of the vehicle the conclusions in this paper will be useful for the design and analysis of the water entry impact structure of auvs keywords water entry impact characteristics ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd modal analysis shock response spectrum srs 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are one kind of underwater robot that can perform various complicated tasks autonomously due to the limited fuel and energy capacity the working range and duration of an auv is limited to solve this problem several kinds of new launching methods such as launching by fixed wing aircraft helicopters and even rocket assisted aircraft have been developed in these methods the auvs are deployed in air and undergo a great fluid impact load during entering the water which may cause damage to the hull structure and the onboard electronic components in severe cases and can also change the trajectory of the vehicle therefore calculating the trajectory and water impact forces especially during the early stages of entry where the impact force is maximum is of paramount importance for the structural design of auvs the characteristics of the impact load include two aspects time domain characteristics and frequency domain characteristics the time domain characteristics are described mainly by indicators such as the peak value pulse width and waveform the frequency domain characteristics include the amplification of the system response amplitude relative to the peak value of the input signal and the inflection frequency of the spectrum research on the impact load of vehicles focuses mainly on these two aspects a considerable amount of research has been conducted on the water entry of auvs by analytical experimental and numerical methods the first theoretical study that determined the water entry impact loads was performed by von karman von karman 1929 on the landing of seaplane floats on water based on the potential flow theory basic principles were employed such as conservation of momentum and the concept of added mass and represented the first physical picture of the water entry problem trilling 1950 analysed hemisphere and ellipsoid entry into water at any angle while ignoring the influence of splashing the results obtained for the vertical component are in good agreement with the experimental results considering the real surface condition zhao and faltinsen zhao et al 1996 used the nonlinear bernoulli equations to derive the asymptotic solution of an object with a small inclination by linearizing the free surface condition korobkin and iafrati 2005 used a combination of the asymptotic expansion method and boundary element method to characterize the water entry problem of a two dimensional approximate ship shaped structure these studies have obtained time domain information on impact loads but theoretical research on the impact load of water entry is slow and reasonable assumptions and simplifications are needed for different problems therefore the applicable scope of the obtained calculation formula is limited and it is difficult to meet the engineering requirements with the development of numerical calculations and computer technology an increasing number of researchers have preferred numerical methods to study the water entry impact of different structures some studies have focused on wedge models e g shams and porfiri 2015 sun and wang 2018 luo et al 2012 xie et al 2018 jingbo wang et al 2015 used the boundary element method to study the vertical water entry problem of wedge shaped objects obtained the pressure change at the inter surface with time and the development of a gas liquid interface and verified the simulation results through experiments guo xin yan yan et al 2018 used the fem sph coupling method to study the influence of the initial velocity and angle on the impact load during the water entry of a rotating body it was concluded that the water entry impact acceleration is related to the second order of the water entry velocity and is proportional to the square of the water entry angle shan wang wang and soares 2014 studied the variation in impact pressure when three dimensional elastic hemispheres and cones entered water at a speed of approximately 4 m s and studied the influence of the grid size contact stiffness and time step on the calculation results erfanian et al 2015 studied the low speed water entry process of hemisphere head projectiles with a diameter of 26 mm by using the ale method and the numerical calculation results were in good agreement with the experimental results alaoui et al 2015 studied the changes in impact load pressure and acceleration of a cone entering water at three different speeds 10 m s 13 m s and 15 m s the results showed that the maximum impact pressure coefficient under the conditions studied in this paper had nothing to do with the impact velocity these methods have well studied the effects of various factors on the impact load of the vehicle during water entry but have not studied the frequency domain characteristics of the impact load and the corresponding structure of the vehicle caused by it therefore hao wang wang et al 2012 studied the impact pressure distribution and structural dynamic response of low speed water entry of an elastic pyramid structure with the ale method and analysed the air cushion effect during the water entry process of the structure hanbing luo et al 2012 and r panciroli et al panciroli 2013 panciroli and porfiri 2014 studied the water entry process of wedge elastomers and analysed the fluid structure interaction phenomenon of elastic structures in the water entry process they investigated the dynamic response of the structure and found that the large deformation of the structure had an important impact on the fluid flow previous research has focused mainly on the low speed water entry problem of simple structures such as cones this paper studied the water entry process of a rotary vehicle with a higher speed and innovatively adopted the method of combining modal analysis and impact response spectrum to analyse the dynamic structural response of the vehicle under the impact load of water entry the effects of the impact load peak value pulse width and natural frequency on the impact response spectrum magnification and the inflection point frequency are analysed the numerical method can study many water entry problems but cannot fully consider the influence of various practical factors and its accuracy still needs to be verified by experiments since worthington filmed the droplet splash phenomenon in 1900 many scholars have carried out relevant experimental research on water entry some experiments focus on spheres and revolving bodies korkmaz and guzel korkmaz and güzel 2017 hurd et al 2017 jalalisendi and porifi jalalisendi and porfiri 2018 there have also been some water entry experiments on the hull structure allen 2013 simonluca russo russo et al 2018 et al studied the water entry of the wedge under the condition of incline and asymmetry through experiments and the results showed that the inclination angle and velocity angle of the wedge had an effect on the dynamic performance and velocity distribution of the object while the water entry angle had an important influence on the impact load distribution on the object lionel vincent vincent et al 2018 et al conducted wedge water entry experiments and the results showed that a wedge with a sharp tip bears a very large instantaneous peak force during water entry tadd t truscott truscott et al 2012 et al conducted an experimental study on the water entry of the sphere and the results showed that the impact force into the water was quite unstable mahdi yettou yettou et al 2006 carried out an experiment on the impact of five models on water in the form of free fall obtained the important factors affecting the pressure coefficient and analysed the influence of each factor on the impact load change the experiments carried out above are only for simple structural models such as cones and wedges and are not applicable to the shape of real vehicles hang xie xie et al 2019 carried out a water entry impact test of the hull the wavelet transform was used to process the experimental data and the hydroelastic effect of the hull structure was quantitatively analysed guo xin yan yan et al 2018 carried out an experimental study on the different water entry velocities and water entry angles of the vehicle and processed the experimental data by low pass filtering in fact many factors can cause impact signals such as the water entry impact of the vehicle the vibration of the vehicle shell and the vibration of the sensor itself how to accurately reveal the composition of the signal and extract the required characteristic signal from the acceleration signal is one of the key parts of water entry experiments it is still a difficult problem to analyse the experimental data to obtain the frequency response of the vehicle structure the combination of the fast fourier transform method and modal analysis can reveal the source of the impact signal but this approach fails when the impact signal with the same frequency is caused by two parts of the structure and the low pass filter also faces the problem of selecting the appropriate cut off frequency therefore this paper proposes a method of combining ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd and modal analysis to analyse the experimental data of the water entry impact revealing the composition of the impact acceleration signal and its energy concentration frequency and verifying the numerical calculation results the structure of this article is as follows the second section introduces the experimental equipment and experimental model of the water entry the experimental data are processed by eemd and modal analysis in the third section a numerical simulation model of vehicle water entry impact is established by the ale method and its accuracy is verified by comparison with experimental data in section four the frequency domain characteristics of the impact load are obtained through the impact response spectrum and the dynamic response of the vehicle structure in the process of water entry is obtained by combination with the modal analysis the final section introduces the main conclusions of this paper 2 experimental tests 2 1 model specification in this work five kinds of three dimensional auv models a b c d and e with different nose shapes are studied as shown in fig 1 we have defined model parameters such as length diameter and hemisphere angle in our research shi et al 2019a all five models are of the same size the length is 1722 mm and the diameter is 200 mm the only difference among the five models is the hemisphere angle of the nose configuration which is smaller than the hemisphere angle and sharper than the nose configuration the hemisphere angles of models a b c d and e are 0 57 70 90 and 180 respectively to describe the initial water entry conditions of the auv the ground coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 local coordinate system o x y z and velocity coordinate system o x 1 y 1 z 1 are introduced as shown in fig 2 these three coordinate systems satisfy the right hand rule and the detailed definitions can be seen in ref yan et al 2018 there are three important attitude angles that need to be described the water entry angle θ the angle of attack aoa α and the angle of sideslip β the water entry angle is the angle between the horizontal direction and o x while the angle of attack and the sideslip angle are defined by the spatial relationship between the local coordinate and the velocity coordinate the line o p is the projection of the velocity axis o x 1 on the o x y z plane of the local coordinate system the angle between o p and vehicle longitudinal axis o x is called the angle of attack angle from the rear of the vehicle the attack angle is positive when o p is below the o x axis the angle between o p and the o x 1 axis is called the sideslip angle and when the o x 1 axis is on the right side of the symmetry plane the sideslip angle is positive 2 2 experimental setup all experiments were carried out in the water tank of the key laboratory of unmanned underwater vehicles at northwestern polytechnical university which has horizontal dimensions of 70 m by 44 m and a depth of 15 m the complete experimental setup is shown in fig 3 the experimental test system is mainly composed of three parts a launching system data record system and high speed camera system the launching system consists of an air compressor an air gun a launching tube an angle controller and a guide rail the maximum pressure produced by the air compressor is 0 8 mpa the volume of the air gun is 100 l and the available pressure ranges from 0 4 mpa to 0 8 mpa the length of the launching tube is 2500 mm and the inner diameter is 205 mm the angle controller allows the launching mechanism to rotate up to 90 therefore different entry angles from tangential up to normal to the water surface may be chosen the auv model is initially motionless and fixed in the launching tube and accelerated by the pressure air stored in the air gun the data recording system consists of a measurement specialties 4630a accelerometer a data acquisition circuit module and data processing software the accelerometer was sampled at a rate of 60 khz with a measurement range of 500 g 1 nonlinearity and a 3 cross axis sensitivity the accelerometer and the circuit module are integrated in a container and the circuit module is encapsulated to improve the high impact resistance capacity during water entry four high speed cameras are used in the experiment test two cameras are installed at the side of the tank and used to capture the posture and instantaneous speed of the auv before entering water the other two high speed cameras are located underwater orthogonally to each other to record the underwater trajectory and cavity shape the frame rate of four cameras is set to 1000 frames per second fps with a resolution of 1380 h 960 v pixels a fixed field of view is applied to cases with the same impact angles and a synchronizing device is used to synchronously trigger the high speed cameras and compressed air driven accelerator the experimental model is shown in fig 4 and the characteristic parameters of the model are listed in table 1 the data acquisition unit is embedded into the head and these three parts are connected through screws the material employed in this paper is 6061 t6 aluminium alloy and the corresponding material properties are shown in table 2 experimental tests were conducted for model e three impact angles and seven impact velocities as shown in table 3 the experimental data are used as the initial condition for simulation and the velocities water entry angles and angles of attack in table 3 refer to the values at the instant that the model touched the free surface which were obtained by processing the high speed camera data 2 3 data processing the original data obtained by the data record system in the water entry experiments are analysed transformed identified and integrated to extract useful information this paper first verifies the accuracy of the experimental impact acceleration signal and analyses the composition of the acceleration then the impact acceleration signal is analysed based on the eemd method 2 3 1 validation of test data validation of the accuracy and credibility of the experimental data is required before the analysis of the data in the experiment the acceleration signal contains the components of a trend term due to various interference factors the trend term affects the correctness of the signal directly and should be removed from the original data therefore pre processing of experimental data is required to eliminate the interference of trend items on the data before the data processing in this paper the least square method is used to remove the trend term in the experimental data yan et al 2018 and then the pre processed data are integrated once to obtain the velocity curve of the vehicle over time in addition the water entry velocity of the vehicle can also be obtained by postprocessing the high speed camera results due to the high precision of the high speed camera results we use this velocity as a benchmark to verify the velocity obtained through the integration method table 4 shows the comparison between the water entry velocity obtained by single integration of the acceleration signal and the water entry velocity measured by the high speed camera under seven operating conditions the results show that the maximum error of these two water entry velocities under different working conditions is 5 38 this indicates that the water entry impact acceleration measured by the three axis accelerometer has good credibility and consistency and the impact experiment results can be used for further analysis 2 3 2 eemd methodology the negative acceleration of the vehicle in the process of water entry is called the impact acceleration of water entry and its value is far greater than the overload of the vehicle during its normal movement underwater the composition of the water entry impact acceleration signal is very complex after analysing the experimental data it is found that the water impact acceleration signal is mainly composed of the following three parts shi 2010 1 the rigid body acceleration which is caused by the resistance of the vehicle entering the water under the assumption of a rigid body also called the rigid body overload this part of the overload is independent of the structural performance of the vehicle and its numerical value follows the law of newton 2 the structural response acceleration this acceleration signal is formed by the vibration of the vehicle shell during water entry including the axial vibration and lateral vibration of the shell 3 the acceleration caused by other interference factors such as the acceleration due to the vibration of the accelerometer itself the accelerometers vibrate when the vehicle hits the water surface under normal circumstances the frequency of the deceleration generated by the vibration is far greater than the vehicle shell vibration frequency this paper focuses mainly on the characteristics of rigid body acceleration which requires us to extract the rigid body acceleration signal from the complex measured impact acceleration signal the eemd method is an adaptive and efficient method applied to decompose nonlinear and nonstationary signals and is suitable for dealing with water entry problems battista et al 2007 2009 this method is proposed to solve the mode mixing problem in the empirical mode decomposition emd method and has been widely used in signal analysis and has achieved good results wu and huang 2009 in this paper the eemd method was used to analyse the measured acceleration signal li and liu 2010 and then to extract the rigid body overload from the measured water entry impact acceleration signal in addition to eemd method fft method is also a commonly used analysis method in frequency domain the impact load on the vehicle during water entry is a typical non stationary signal fft may only give the overall characteristics but may not reflect the characteristics of the signal at a certain time after fft processing the signals of various frequencies are superimposed together and the cut off frequency needs to be artificially selected however eemd method is a time frequency processing method of adaptive signal according to the characteristics of the signal itself the signal is decomposed into the sum of the components of a finite number of natural mode functions adaptively without artificial selection of cut off frequency different eigenmode functions contain different components of frequency segments therefore the eemd method is adopted instead of the fft method first we introduce the relevant principle of emd method which adaptively decomposes the signal into a finite number of intrinsic mode function imf components according to the characteristics of the signal itself according to the sequence of decomposition the central frequency of each imf ranges from high to low and each imf has to satisfy the following two conditions huang et al 1998 1 the number of extreme points including maximum and minimum and the number of zero points of the decomposed imf components must either be equal or differ by at most 1 2 at any time the mean value of the upper envelope determined by the local maximum and the lower envelope determined by the local minimum is zero that is the components are locally symmetric with respect to the time axis the essence of the emd method is to obtain the natural vibration mode of the signal through the local characteristic time scale of the signal and then decompose the signal by the natural vibration mode step by step the basic processing steps are as follows 1 identify the local maximum and minimum points of the original signal data x t and then obtain the upper and lower envelopes by using cubic spline interpolation obtain the mean value of the corresponding data point m 1 t and calculate the difference between x t and m 1 t 1 h 1 t x t m 1 t 2 determine whether 1 satisfies the conditions of the imf if not use the original signal and repeat step 1 to obtain 2 h 1 1 t h 1 t m 1 1 t repeat k screenings until h 1 k t satisfies the imf conditions and define c 1 t h 1 k t then c 1 t is the first order imf extracted from the original signal x t which is the highest frequency component of the original signal 3 the first order imf component c 1 t is extracted from the original signal x t to obtain a margin r 1 t which is 3 r 1 t x t c 1 t using r 1 t as the new original signal repeat steps 1 and 2 and extract the second order imf c 2 t the third order imf c 3 t the nth order imf c n t then 4 r 2 t r 1 t c 2 t r 3 t r 2 t c 3 t r n t r n 1 t c n t according to equations 3 and 4 the final decomposition result of the original signal x t is 5 x t i 1 n c i t r n t where r n t is the residual amount which is a monotonic function representing the final trend of the signal the principle of eemd is to add white noise to the signal being analysed so that the signal and noise are unified during the decomposition of emd signals of different scales are adaptively mapped to the appropriate frequency range established by the white noise according to huang and wu wu and huang 2009 eemd contains the following steps 1 add a white noise series ω t to the analysed signal x t to obtain a total signal x t 6 x t x t ω t 2 decompose the signal with added white noise into imfs using the emd method 7 x t i 1 n c i t r t 3 add a different white noise series ω j t to the analysed signal x t to obtain another total signal x j t and decompose the total signal x j t into imfs 8 x j t i 1 n c j i t r j t 4 adopt the means of the ensemble corresponding to the imf as the final imf result 9 c j t 1 n i 1 n c j i t 10 ε n ε n where n is the number of times the white noise is added that is the total signal number ε is the amplitude of the white noise added with ε 0 15 used in this paper and ε n is the error of the original signal and the signal obtained by the sum of the final imfs when the amplitude of the noise is constant the more times white noise is added the closer the final result is to the true value based on many trials this paper takes n 200 in the analysis considering the principle of eemd the acceleration signal of the water entry impact is processed and the components and characteristics of the signal can be obtained by analysing the decomposed imf components taking condition 6 as an example the eemd decomposition result of axial water entry impact acceleration is shown in fig 5 fig 5 shows that the axial water entry impact acceleration signal under this test condition generates 9 imf components and the residual r through eemd decomposition in the figure the first line is the original signal the 2 10 lines are imf1 imf2 imf9 and the last line is the residual the first third order imf components have a high frequency and short wavelength which represent the noise or high frequency components in the original signal its amplitude is large which indicates that the energy occupied by the first 3 order components is also large as the decomposition progresses the frequency of the obtained component gradually decreases and the wavelength becomes longer until the last component with a very low frequency is decomposed this indicates that both the high frequency component and the low frequency component are included in the water entry impact acceleration signal as seen from table 9 and fig 13 below the low frequency component may be the natural frequency of the vehicle vibration excited by the impact load and the high frequency component may be caused by the shock wave propagating inside the vehicle each imf component contains different time feature scales and is displayed at different adaptive frequency resolutions the residual is a monotonically varying component with a small amplitude which represents the overall trend of the original signal the above decomposition results show that the essence of the eemd method is a bandpass filter with an adaptive bandwidth transformation which decomposes the original decomposed signal into imf1 imf2 imf9 and residual r to recognize the sources and components of the water entry impact acceleration signal from the imfs the eemd method combining the modal analysis described in section 4 1 is adopted in this paper the processing steps of this method are as follows first the original signal is decomposed based on the eemd method and a burg power spectrum analysis of imf components is carried out to obtain the power spectrum of each imf component then the modal analysis is performed on the vehicle and the high frequency imf component is filtered from the original signal with the natural frequency of the second order bending mode as the cut off frequency thus the filtered signal is obtained by reconstructing the remaining imf components starting from the essential characteristics of the signal this method does not need to set any parameters but needs only to select different imf components for reconstruction to obtain different filtering results the reason why this paper adopts the burg method to analyse the power spectrum is that it has some obvious advantages with the increase of order the resolution of burg method is improved in addition some implicit extrapolation of data and autocorrelation functions makes it possible to exceed a given length not affected by window functions as classical spectral estimates therefore the resolution of burg spectrum is higher and the corresponding spectrum line is much smoother at present in addition to burg method commonly used methods for the analysis of power spectrum mainly include bartlett welch and so on compared with burg method bartlett method has the advantage of high resolution and the disadvantage of large dispersion rough curve and large variance welch method is greatly improved based on the bartlett method however after weighting each sequence with window functions the main lobe of the power spectrum becomes wider and the resolution decreases although the smooth estimation results are obtained in view of the above considerations the burg method is used for power spectrum analysis combined with the data processing method proposed in this paper fig 6 shows the filtering results obtained after selecting different imf components for the water entry acceleration signal in the axial direction of working condition 6 the burg power spectrum results of the original signal indicate that its energy is concentrated mainly at approximately 5 khz fig 6 a the burg power spectrum of the signal filtered after subtracting the first order imf component has a peak at approximately 1 khz and 2 khz indicating that the original signal still has high frequency components fig 6 b the power spectrum of the signal which is filtered after subtracting the first three orders of the imf shows a peak at approximately 908 hz fig 6 d which is nearly the natural frequency 942 04 hz table 9 of the second order bending mode of model e this low frequency component is the natural frequency of the vehicle caused by the impact load this means that the signal after subtracting the first three orders of the imf is the rigid body water entry load of the vehicle and the peak load is 155 2 g here g is the acceleration of gravity 3 numerical simulations 3 1 numerical models the analysis is carried out by the explicit finite element method based on a multi material eulerian formulation and penalty coupling method the fluids water and air are solved in the eulerian formulation whereas the motion of the structure auv and the free surface are tracked using the lagrangian formulation the fluid structure interaction fsi is calculated based on the penalty method souli and benson 2010 the fluids and structure are modelled with solid 164 three dimensional elements in the numerical simulation and the gravitational effect is considered while the surface tension effect is neglected in the analysis the water and the air are treated as compressible fluids and the corresponding properties are described by the equations of state eoss the gruneisen eos is used in the water domain and the linear polynomial eos is applied to the air domain the gruneisen eos is given by the following formulation 11 p ρ c 2 μ 1 1 γ 0 2 μ a 2 μ 2 1 s 1 1 μ s 2 μ 2 μ 1 s 3 μ 3 μ 1 3 2 γ 0 a μ e the linear polynomial eos is defined by the following formulation 12 p c 0 c 1 μ c 2 μ 2 c 3 μ 3 c 4 c 5 μ c 6 μ 2 e where e is the initial internal energy per unit volume ρ is the density c is the bulk speed of sound s 1 s 2 and s 3 are unitless coefficients γ 0 is the gruneisen constant a is the first order volume correction to γ 0 and c 0 c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 c 5 and c 6 are the polynomial equation coefficients note that the air was considered compressible by setting c 0 c 2 c 3 c 4 c 5 c 6 0 the compression μ is defined in terms of the relative volume v as follows 13 μ 1 v v the parameters used in the simulation for the water and air are shown in table 5 the size of the air domain is 3000 mm 500 mm 2400 mm and the size of the water domain is 3000 mm 1500 mm 2400 mm the boundaries of the domain are defined as non reflecting and the inner nodes are free the convergence study results show that when the mesh size of the eulerian element is 4 times that of the lagrangian element both the accuracy and the computational efficiency are considerable shi et al 2019b the final vehicle is divided into 35840 elements and the fluid domain is divided into 1800000 elements as shown in fig 7 3 2 numerical experimental correlation and discussion simulations of the water entry impact load of the experimental model were carried out based on the established finite element model to verify the accuracy of the numerical method the test conditions in table 3 such as water entry velocities water entry angles and angles of attack were used in the simulations for the initial conditions and the total simulation time was 20 ms the following are the comparisons of the cavity water entry impact acceleration velocity and displacement with the test results under different working conditions 3 2 1 comparison of the cavity fig 8 shows a comparison between the numerical results for the cavity formation and position of the auv and the experimental photographs under case 6 the time interval between two adjacent pictures is 0 5 ms because of the viewing field of the underwater high speed cameras we cannot see the head or tail of the vehicle in a picture completely a cavity forms when the model touches the water and expands dramatically as the model enters the water as the depth of water entry increases a large number of cavitation bubbles are generated on the in flight surface of the model the tail of the model first comes into contact with the cavitation wall and a large amount of splashing occurs at the interface this is because the model has a small positive attack angle at the moment it enters the water under the influence of gravity the pitching moment encountered when entering the water is also a factor producing a tendency for the head to rise for the convenience of observation we draw the outline of the cavity with a red line and a blue dotted line in the experimental and numerical results respectively as seen from the results the experimental and numerical results agree well 3 2 2 comparison of the acceleration fig 9 shows a comparison curve between the simulation and test results of water entry impact acceleration in working condition 6 the simulation results of the axial and normal water entry impact accelerations are basically identical to the trend of the test results the model suffers from a large load at the moment of water entry and then the oscillation trend of the acceleration is moderated table 6 shows the comparison between the test results and the simulation results of the impact load of water entry under seven different working conditions the relative error of the axial load peak value is less than 5 except for condition 2 5 3 while for the relative error of the normal load peak the maximum relative error of working condition 6 is 9 3 and the relative error of the other six working conditions is less than 10 this indicates that the simulation results are generally consistent with the test results 3 2 3 comparison of the impact velocity the time history curve of the water entry velocity of the vehicle can be obtained by integrating the test acceleration signal once fig 10 shows the comparison curve between the simulation result and the test result of the water entry velocity in working condition 6 the axial and normal water entry velocities are in good agreement before the water entry load reaches the peak value after which the relative error between the simulation result and the experimental value gradually increases the time history curve of axial velocity shows that the velocity attenuation rate of the test value is less than that of the numerical simulation after the peak load is reached the normal velocity time history curve shows that the velocity decay rate of the test value is essentially identical to that of the simulation result after the peak load is reached the difference between experimental results and numerical results includes two aspects absolute difference and trend difference firstly the absolute difference is analysed it may be seen from fig 9 that 1 the numerical results of the acceleration are in good agreement with the experimental results before about 3 ms 2 after 3 ms the difference between the numerical result of acceleration and the experimental result is large which leads to the gradual increase of the difference between numerical and experimental results of velocity in fig 10 next the trend difference is analysed it may be seen from fig 9 that 1 after stabilization the experimental curve of axial acceleration is horizontal while the numerical curve of axial acceleration is tilted so the velocity attenuation rate of test value is less than that of numerical simulation after the peak load is reached 2 after stabilization both the experimental curves and numerical curves of axial acceleration are horizontal so the normal velocity time history curve shows that the velocity decay rate of the test value is basically identical with that of the simulation result after the peak load is reached table 7 shows a comparison between test values and simulation results under seven working conditions of the water entry velocity changing with time the relative error of the axial velocity is approximately 6 and the relative error of the normal velocity is approximately 9 in general the numerical simulation results agree well with the experimental data 3 2 4 comparison of the displacement the time history curve of the water entry displacement of the vehicle can be obtained by quadratic integration of the water entry impact acceleration signal fig 11 shows a comparison curve between the simulation results and the test results of the water entry displacement with time in working condition 6 the simulation results are essentially consistent with the trend of the test results table 8 compares the test values and the simulation results of the water entry displacement with time under 7 working conditions the relative errors between the test values and simulation results of the axial displacement and radial displacement are both small approximately 5 according to the above analysis results the relative error between the test values and the simulation results of the impact peak during water entry is approximately 5 while the relative error of the water entry velocity is approximately 9 and the relative error of the water entry displacement is approximately 5 the results of these three aspects show that the simulation values agree well with the experimental values which verifies the accuracy and reliability of the established numerical simulation mathematical model 4 frequency domain characteristics of the impact load this paper focuses mainly on the impact force of the vehicle at the initial stage of water entry this force refers to the force when the head touches and enters the water when it enters the water and the force that acts on the vehicle a short time later at this stage the impact force subjected on the vehicle is greatest and the structure of the vehicle is most vulnerable to damage fig 12 shows the axial load curve of model d when it enters water vertically at 50 m s the axial load of the vehicle increases from 0 to the first peak within a short time approximately 1 ms after entering the water and then decreases rapidly the oscillation attenuation gradually tends to a stable value according to the water entry process of the vehicle the first waveform corresponds to the impact load during the water entry process the waveform is a typical semi sinusoidal impulse signal and the characteristic parameters describing the signal are the peak and peak pulse width the peak pulse width refers to the fraction value of the peak value of the shock pulse rising to a certain setting 0 1 of the peak value is usually taken as the set value and the time interval of this value falling wu et al 2010 through the above two characteristic parameters combined with the quality of the vehicle and related mechanical parameters the maximum impact force impact energy and impact velocity and the frequency range and distribution of the signal can be known although the impact characteristics of the time domain are quantized through the experimental and numerical methods in section 2 3 and section 3 2 the mechanics of the structural response are still not clear under the effect of water entry impact e g which vibration frequency plays a major role and which structural components cause this frequency and what is the relationship between these factors and the structural response therefore this paper mostly focuses on the issue previous studies have shown that the time domain characteristics of the impact load of the vehicle into water have the characteristics of large peak value and small pulse width to study the structural dynamic response of the vehicle under such impact load modal analysis combined with the shock response spectrum srs method was used to study the frequency domain characteristics of the structural response of the vehicle during water entry with the aim to reveal the frequency characteristics of the structural response acceleration of the vehicle 4 1 modal analysis the main purpose of modal analysis is to solve the modal parameters such as the natural frequency mode shape and modal stiffness of the system once the fluid force is transformed the structural response can be calculated by integrating the equations of motion in the time domain in the structural domain the general equations of motion of a system can be written as guan 1996 14 m x c x k x f t where m is the mass matrix c is the damping matrix k is the stiffness matrix x is the acceleration vector x is the velocity vector x is the displacement vector and f t is the excitation force vector if there is no external force then f t 0 and the free vibration equation of the system can be obtained when the natural frequency and natural mode of the vehicle are calculated since damping has little influence on the result the damping term c x can be omitted and the motion equation of undamped free vibration can be obtained as follows 15 m x k x f t 0 the characteristic equation of equation 14 is 16 k ω i 2 m x i 0 in equation 16 x i 0 corresponds to a generalized eigenvalue problem where ω i 2 is the eigenvalue and x i is the eigenvector this equation is also an nth order algebraic homogeneous equation system with the elements in x i acting as variables and k ω i 2 m as the coefficient matrix the necessary and sufficient condition for the equation to have a non zero solution is that its coefficient matrix determinant is 0 17 k ω i 2 m 0 equation 17 is called the characteristic equation of the characteristic eigenproblem form corresponding to an nth order algebraic equation containing ω i 2 this equation is solved to obtain n mutually different positive roots ω i i 1 2 n of ω and ω i is the natural frequency of the i th order mode to reveal the mechanics causing the frequency oscillations in the structural response of the auv during water entry a dry modal analysis was carried out in the commercial code ls dyna since the water impact on auv lasts for a short time and no water flows through the main part of the shell surface fixed supports are applied based on the contact relationship e g the nose of five models are fixed according to the contact between the structure and the water surface the modal analysis results show that most of the vibration mode shapes of the vehicles appear in pairs the mode shapes and the corresponding natural frequencies are almost the same but the spatial directions of the vibration are different the wave nodes of the mode shape such as bending wrinkling and vibration increase with increasing order the typical modal shapes of models b and d are shown in fig 13 the first order and second order bending mode shapes and modal frequencies of the five models are shown in table 9 the differences in the modal frequencies in different directions x y plane and y z plane are slight 4 2 description of the srs method the water entry impact load of vehicles has typical shock characteristics and the spectral decomposition method is widely used in shock signal analysis in this study the srs method is used for shock signal analysis the srs is a description of the maximum response displacement velocity or acceleration of a series of single degree of freedom systems subjected to mechanical impact as a function of the natural frequency of each system an actual physical system can be decomposed into several different single degree of freedom systems we perform an impulse response analysis on each single degree of freedom system take the maximum value of the system response and then identify a data point with its natural frequency in this way the number of data points can be obtained by decomposition into multiple single degree of freedom systems the srs of the whole system can be obtained by connecting these points with smooth curves the srs can be divided into the following three types according to different peak response methods 1 initial response spectrum referred to as the main spectrum this spectrum refers to the srs obtained by taking the peak value of the response in the impact action time the initial response spectrum has positive and negative points the positive direction refers to the response peak in the same direction as the excitation while the negative direction is the response peak value in the opposite direction to the excitation 2 residual response spectrum referred to as residual spectrum this spectrum refers to the relationship between the maximum response peak that occurs after the end of the impact and the natural frequency of the system it also has positive and negative points and the definition of positive and negative is the same as the positive and negative definition of the initial response spectrum 3 maximum response spectrum this spectrum refers to the relationship between the maximum response peak and the natural frequency of the system in all response processes that is the envelope spectrum formed by main spectrum and residual spectrum the improved recursive digital filtering algorithm is used to analyse the impact response spectrum of the water entry impact load in this study and this algorithm was proposed by smallwood in 1981 smallwood 1981 this was based on the slope invariant digital filtering model instead of the pulse invariant model namely the generalized ramp function to replace the pulse invariant model u t δ t the generalized ramp function is 18 u t a t k δ t u t k δ t where u t k δ t is the unit step function and a is the slope of the ramp at t k δ t applying the superposition principle we can obtain a model that approximates the impact input with a trapezoidal function this method is more accurate than the recursive digital filtering model with rectangular approximation suppose the sampling value of the input signal u t is u i i 1 2 n and the single degree of freedom system response x i t i 1 2 n then the recursive formula of the ramp invariant model is 19 x i p 0 u i p 1 u i 1 p 2 u i 2 q 1 x i 1 q 2 x x 2 where q 1 2 e ω n δ t ξ cos ω n δ t 1 ξ 2 q 2 e 2 ω n δ t ξ p 0 1 e ω n δ t ξ sin ω n δ t 1 ξ 2 ω n δ t 1 ξ 2 p 1 2 e ω n δ t ξ sin ω n δ t 1 ξ 2 ω n δ t 1 ξ 2 cos ω n δ t 1 ξ 2 p 2 e ω n δ t ξ e ω n δ t ξ sin ω n δ t 1 ξ 2 ω n δ t 1 ξ 2 ω n 2 π f n here ω n is the natural circular frequency of the system f n is the natural frequency ξ is the critical damping ratio and δ t is the sampling time interval there are two important parameters in the srs analysis quality factor and octave the meanings of these two parameters are as follows 1 the quality factor is defined as where ξ represents the critical damping ratio the quality factor reflects the intensity of the system damping and the steepness of the resonance peak that is the larger q is the steeper the peak the value of ξ directly affects the peak value of the impulse response spectrum for metal material structures ξ is generally taken as 0 05 2 the octave is the logarithmic scale frequency which is twice the frequency expressed as a mathematical formula 2 1 f 1 f 2 here octave refers to the ratio of the next calculated frequency to the previous calculated frequency when calculating the srs the smaller the octave the more points are analysed and the smoother the response spectrum curve however it is not good that the octave is as small as possible when the octave is too fine and the low frequency is too dense computing time is wasted and the solution has little significance in this calculation a 1 12 octave is used 4 3 results and discussion our studies show that the water entry impact loads of vehicles with different initial conditions are all typical semi sinusoidal waveforms and only the peak value and width are different the effect of the peak value and its width on the structural response are studied in this section based on the srs method 4 3 1 effect of the impact pulse width since the peak values of the axial impact load coefficients of model e are essentially equal when entering the water vertically at different velocities 30 m s 70 m s the impact pulse width decreases with increasing velocity 2 5 ms 2 3 ms 2 1 ms 2 0 ms and 1 9 ms this result can be used to analyse the effect of the pulse width on the frequency domain of the impact loads fig 14 is the srs of the impact load of model e vertically entering the water at different velocities the abscissa is the frequency and the ordinate is the nondimensional amplification factor with respect to the peak of the impact load both coordinate axes are shown in logarithmic form the results indicate that the srs is related to the pulse width of the impact load as the pulse width decreases the amplification factor of the srs increases as does the frequency of the inflection point 4 3 2 effect of the peak value the peak values of the impact loads of models c and d entering water at a velocity of 50 m s with different angles 50 60 70 80 and 90 have a significant difference while the peak widths are essentially equal the difference is less than 0 01 ms these results can be used to analyse the effect of the pulse width on the frequency domain of the impact loads figs 15 and 16 show the shock response spectra of the axial and normal impact loads of models c and d respectively the srs analysis results show that the frequencies of the inflection point under these conditions are essentially the same this phenomenon indicates that the shape and tendency of the impact waveform generated by the excitation with the different peak values are the same furthermore the inflection point frequencies and amplification factors of the srs are also the same figs 14 16 also show that if the frequency is large enough the final amplification factor remains at 1 under different waveforms and then the amplification factor no longer changes with the frequency the impact loads with smaller pulse widths have an influence on the high frequency part of the srs while the impact load with larger pulse widths has a greater influence on the low frequency part 4 3 3 effect of natural frequency the relationship between the natural frequency of the vehicle and the srs is studied below since the boundary conditions affects the natural frequency and mode shape of the vehicles to reduce the influence of boundary conditions on the results this section analyses only vertical water entry fig 17 shows the srs of the axial impact load and the second bending mode shape of models a b c d and e entering the water vertically at 50 m s the results show that the five models generate one peak frequency under this impact load the inflection point frequencies of the five models are approximately 920 hz 920 hz 920 hz 920 hz and 950 hz the corresponding second order bending natural frequencies table 9 are 923 96 hz 917 96 hz 919 8 hz 917 83 hz and 942 04 hz the results show that the second order bending mode is excited under this condition and the mode shapes are shown in fig 17 in addition the inflection point frequency of the srs is a certain order natural frequency of the vehicle but there is no obvious law for the specific frequency which is related to the position of the impact load waveform parameters and vibration mode of the vehicle the inflection point frequency is affected by the pulse widths 5 conclusions in this paper five kinds of models with different nose shapes are tested under different water entry velocities and angles the impact acceleration signals are obtained by the sensors first the composition of the impact acceleration signal was analysed then a data processing based eemd method was shown in the analysis the ale method was used for numerical simulation and the results are compared with the experimental test results from the three perspectives of acceleration velocity and displacement the simulation results are in good agreement with the test results which verifies the numerical calculation model and theoretical analysis method adopted in this paper the combination of modal analysis and srs analysis was used to study the frequency characteristics of the water entry impact load we found that the maximum acceleration shock spectrum of the impact load is related to the peak pulse width and is independent of the peak value the smaller the pulse width is the larger the inflection point frequency and magnification of the srs are the inflection point frequency of the shock response spectrum is a certain order natural frequency of the vehicle but there is no obvious law for the specific frequency which is related to the position of the impact load waveform parameters and vibration mode of the vehicle credit authorship contribution statement yao shi

21979,autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are subjected to a very large impact load during the water entry process which may damage the structure of the vehicle and affect its motion trajectory in this paper five kinds of models with different nose shapes are tested under different water entry velocities and angles and the impact acceleration signals are obtained by a sensor first the accuracy of the experimental data is verified by comparison with the velocity obtained by the high speed camera then the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd method combined with modal analysis is used to analyse the acceleration signal composition subsequently a numerical simulation model based on the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method to describe the water entering process of the vehicle is established and the accuracy and capability of the numerical algorithm is verified by comparison with the experimental data finally the frequency domain characteristics of the impact load are analysed through the shock response spectrum srs method the result shows that the maximum acceleration shock spectrum of the impact load is related to the peak pulse width of the impact load and independent of the peak value the smaller the pulse width is the larger the inflection point frequency and magnification of the shock response spectrum are the inflection point frequency of the shock response spectrum usually corresponds to the second order bending natural frequency of the vehicle the conclusions in this paper will be useful for the design and analysis of the water entry impact structure of auvs keywords water entry impact characteristics ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd modal analysis shock response spectrum srs 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are one kind of underwater robot that can perform various complicated tasks autonomously due to the limited fuel and energy capacity the working range and duration of an auv is limited to solve this problem several kinds of new launching methods such as launching by fixed wing aircraft helicopters and even rocket assisted aircraft have been developed in these methods the auvs are deployed in air and undergo a great fluid impact load during entering the water which may cause damage to the hull structure and the onboard electronic components in severe cases and can also change the trajectory of the vehicle therefore calculating the trajectory and water impact forces especially during the early stages of entry where the impact force is maximum is of paramount importance for the structural design of auvs the characteristics of the impact load include two aspects time domain characteristics and frequency domain characteristics the time domain characteristics are described mainly by indicators such as the peak value pulse width and waveform the frequency domain characteristics include the amplification of the system response amplitude relative to the peak value of the input signal and the inflection frequency of the spectrum research on the impact load of vehicles focuses mainly on these two aspects a considerable amount of research has been conducted on the water entry of auvs by analytical experimental and numerical methods the first theoretical study that determined the water entry impact loads was performed by von karman von karman 1929 on the landing of seaplane floats on water based on the potential flow theory basic principles were employed such as conservation of momentum and the concept of added mass and represented the first physical picture of the water entry problem trilling 1950 analysed hemisphere and ellipsoid entry into water at any angle while ignoring the influence of splashing the results obtained for the vertical component are in good agreement with the experimental results considering the real surface condition zhao and faltinsen zhao et al 1996 used the nonlinear bernoulli equations to derive the asymptotic solution of an object with a small inclination by linearizing the free surface condition korobkin and iafrati 2005 used a combination of the asymptotic expansion method and boundary element method to characterize the water entry problem of a two dimensional approximate ship shaped structure these studies have obtained time domain information on impact loads but theoretical research on the impact load of water entry is slow and reasonable assumptions and simplifications are needed for different problems therefore the applicable scope of the obtained calculation formula is limited and it is difficult to meet the engineering requirements with the development of numerical calculations and computer technology an increasing number of researchers have preferred numerical methods to study the water entry impact of different structures some studies have focused on wedge models e g shams and porfiri 2015 sun and wang 2018 luo et al 2012 xie et al 2018 jingbo wang et al 2015 used the boundary element method to study the vertical water entry problem of wedge shaped objects obtained the pressure change at the inter surface with time and the development of a gas liquid interface and verified the simulation results through experiments guo xin yan yan et al 2018 used the fem sph coupling method to study the influence of the initial velocity and angle on the impact load during the water entry of a rotating body it was concluded that the water entry impact acceleration is related to the second order of the water entry velocity and is proportional to the square of the water entry angle shan wang wang and soares 2014 studied the variation in impact pressure when three dimensional elastic hemispheres and cones entered water at a speed of approximately 4 m s and studied the influence of the grid size contact stiffness and time step on the calculation results erfanian et al 2015 studied the low speed water entry process of hemisphere head projectiles with a diameter of 26 mm by using the ale method and the numerical calculation results were in good agreement with the experimental results alaoui et al 2015 studied the changes in impact load pressure and acceleration of a cone entering water at three different speeds 10 m s 13 m s and 15 m s the results showed that the maximum impact pressure coefficient under the conditions studied in this paper had nothing to do with the impact velocity these methods have well studied the effects of various factors on the impact load of the vehicle during water entry but have not studied the frequency domain characteristics of the impact load and the corresponding structure of the vehicle caused by it therefore hao wang wang et al 2012 studied the impact pressure distribution and structural dynamic response of low speed water entry of an elastic pyramid structure with the ale method and analysed the air cushion effect during the water entry process of the structure hanbing luo et al 2012 and r panciroli et al panciroli 2013 panciroli and porfiri 2014 studied the water entry process of wedge elastomers and analysed the fluid structure interaction phenomenon of elastic structures in the water entry process they investigated the dynamic response of the structure and found that the large deformation of the structure had an important impact on the fluid flow previous research has focused mainly on the low speed water entry problem of simple structures such as cones this paper studied the water entry process of a rotary vehicle with a higher speed and innovatively adopted the method of combining modal analysis and impact response spectrum to analyse the dynamic structural response of the vehicle under the impact load of water entry the effects of the impact load peak value pulse width and natural frequency on the impact response spectrum magnification and the inflection point frequency are analysed the numerical method can study many water entry problems but cannot fully consider the influence of various practical factors and its accuracy still needs to be verified by experiments since worthington filmed the droplet splash phenomenon in 1900 many scholars have carried out relevant experimental research on water entry some experiments focus on spheres and revolving bodies korkmaz and guzel korkmaz and güzel 2017 hurd et al 2017 jalalisendi and porifi jalalisendi and porfiri 2018 there have also been some water entry experiments on the hull structure allen 2013 simonluca russo russo et al 2018 et al studied the water entry of the wedge under the condition of incline and asymmetry through experiments and the results showed that the inclination angle and velocity angle of the wedge had an effect on the dynamic performance and velocity distribution of the object while the water entry angle had an important influence on the impact load distribution on the object lionel vincent vincent et al 2018 et al conducted wedge water entry experiments and the results showed that a wedge with a sharp tip bears a very large instantaneous peak force during water entry tadd t truscott truscott et al 2012 et al conducted an experimental study on the water entry of the sphere and the results showed that the impact force into the water was quite unstable mahdi yettou yettou et al 2006 carried out an experiment on the impact of five models on water in the form of free fall obtained the important factors affecting the pressure coefficient and analysed the influence of each factor on the impact load change the experiments carried out above are only for simple structural models such as cones and wedges and are not applicable to the shape of real vehicles hang xie xie et al 2019 carried out a water entry impact test of the hull the wavelet transform was used to process the experimental data and the hydroelastic effect of the hull structure was quantitatively analysed guo xin yan yan et al 2018 carried out an experimental study on the different water entry velocities and water entry angles of the vehicle and processed the experimental data by low pass filtering in fact many factors can cause impact signals such as the water entry impact of the vehicle the vibration of the vehicle shell and the vibration of the sensor itself how to accurately reveal the composition of the signal and extract the required characteristic signal from the acceleration signal is one of the key parts of water entry experiments it is still a difficult problem to analyse the experimental data to obtain the frequency response of the vehicle structure the combination of the fast fourier transform method and modal analysis can reveal the source of the impact signal but this approach fails when the impact signal with the same frequency is caused by two parts of the structure and the low pass filter also faces the problem of selecting the appropriate cut off frequency therefore this paper proposes a method of combining ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd and modal analysis to analyse the experimental data of the water entry impact revealing the composition of the impact acceleration signal and its energy concentration frequency and verifying the numerical calculation results the structure of this article is as follows the second section introduces the experimental equipment and experimental model of the water entry the experimental data are processed by eemd and modal analysis in the third section a numerical simulation model of vehicle water entry impact is established by the ale method and its accuracy is verified by comparison with experimental data in section four the frequency domain characteristics of the impact load are obtained through the impact response spectrum and the dynamic response of the vehicle structure in the process of water entry is obtained by combination with the modal analysis the final section introduces the main conclusions of this paper 2 experimental tests 2 1 model specification in this work five kinds of three dimensional auv models a b c d and e with different nose shapes are studied as shown in fig 1 we have defined model parameters such as length diameter and hemisphere angle in our research shi et al 2019a all five models are of the same size the length is 1722 mm and the diameter is 200 mm the only difference among the five models is the hemisphere angle of the nose configuration which is smaller than the hemisphere angle and sharper than the nose configuration the hemisphere angles of models a b c d and e are 0 57 70 90 and 180 respectively to describe the initial water entry conditions of the auv the ground coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 local coordinate system o x y z and velocity coordinate system o x 1 y 1 z 1 are introduced as shown in fig 2 these three coordinate systems satisfy the right hand rule and the detailed definitions can be seen in ref yan et al 2018 there are three important attitude angles that need to be described the water entry angle θ the angle of attack aoa α and the angle of sideslip β the water entry angle is the angle between the horizontal direction and o x while the angle of attack and the sideslip angle are defined by the spatial relationship between the local coordinate and the velocity coordinate the line o p is the projection of the velocity axis o x 1 on the o x y z plane of the local coordinate system the angle between o p and vehicle longitudinal axis o x is called the angle of attack angle from the rear of the vehicle the attack angle is positive when o p is below the o x axis the angle between o p and the o x 1 axis is called the sideslip angle and when the o x 1 axis is on the right side of the symmetry plane the sideslip angle is positive 2 2 experimental setup all experiments were carried out in the water tank of the key laboratory of unmanned underwater vehicles at northwestern polytechnical university which has horizontal dimensions of 70 m by 44 m and a depth of 15 m the complete experimental setup is shown in fig 3 the experimental test system is mainly composed of three parts a launching system data record system and high speed camera system the launching system consists of an air compressor an air gun a launching tube an angle controller and a guide rail the maximum pressure produced by the air compressor is 0 8 mpa the volume of the air gun is 100 l and the available pressure ranges from 0 4 mpa to 0 8 mpa the length of the launching tube is 2500 mm and the inner diameter is 205 mm the angle controller allows the launching mechanism to rotate up to 90 therefore different entry angles from tangential up to normal to the water surface may be chosen the auv model is initially motionless and fixed in the launching tube and accelerated by the pressure air stored in the air gun the data recording system consists of a measurement specialties 4630a accelerometer a data acquisition circuit module and data processing software the accelerometer was sampled at a rate of 60 khz with a measurement range of 500 g 1 nonlinearity and a 3 cross axis sensitivity the accelerometer and the circuit module are integrated in a container and the circuit module is encapsulated to improve the high impact resistance capacity during water entry four high speed cameras are used in the experiment test two cameras are installed at the side of the tank and used to capture the posture and instantaneous speed of the auv before entering water the other two high speed cameras are located underwater orthogonally to each other to record the underwater trajectory and cavity shape the frame rate of four cameras is set to 1000 frames per second fps with a resolution of 1380 h 960 v pixels a fixed field of view is applied to cases with the same impact angles and a synchronizing device is used to synchronously trigger the high speed cameras and compressed air driven accelerator the experimental model is shown in fig 4 and the characteristic parameters of the model are listed in table 1 the data acquisition unit is embedded into the head and these three parts are connected through screws the material employed in this paper is 6061 t6 aluminium alloy and the corresponding material properties are shown in table 2 experimental tests were conducted for model e three impact angles and seven impact velocities as shown in table 3 the experimental data are used as the initial condition for simulation and the velocities water entry angles and angles of attack in table 3 refer to the values at the instant that the model touched the free surface which were obtained by processing the high speed camera data 2 3 data processing the original data obtained by the data record system in the water entry experiments are analysed transformed identified and integrated to extract useful information this paper first verifies the accuracy of the experimental impact acceleration signal and analyses the composition of the acceleration then the impact acceleration signal is analysed based on the eemd method 2 3 1 validation of test data validation of the accuracy and credibility of the experimental data is required before the analysis of the data in the experiment the acceleration signal contains the components of a trend term due to various interference factors the trend term affects the correctness of the signal directly and should be removed from the original data therefore pre processing of experimental data is required to eliminate the interference of trend items on the data before the data processing in this paper the least square method is used to remove the trend term in the experimental data yan et al 2018 and then the pre processed data are integrated once to obtain the velocity curve of the vehicle over time in addition the water entry velocity of the vehicle can also be obtained by postprocessing the high speed camera results due to the high precision of the high speed camera results we use this velocity as a benchmark to verify the velocity obtained through the integration method table 4 shows the comparison between the water entry velocity obtained by single integration of the acceleration signal and the water entry velocity measured by the high speed camera under seven operating conditions the results show that the maximum error of these two water entry velocities under different working conditions is 5 38 this indicates that the water entry impact acceleration measured by the three axis accelerometer has good credibility and consistency and the impact experiment results can be used for further analysis 2 3 2 eemd methodology the negative acceleration of the vehicle in the process of water entry is called the impact acceleration of water entry and its value is far greater than the overload of the vehicle during its normal movement underwater the composition of the water entry impact acceleration signal is very complex after analysing the experimental data it is found that the water impact acceleration signal is mainly composed of the following three parts shi 2010 1 the rigid body acceleration which is caused by the resistance of the vehicle entering the water under the assumption of a rigid body also called the rigid body overload this part of the overload is independent of the structural performance of the vehicle and its numerical value follows the law of newton 2 the structural response acceleration this acceleration signal is formed by the vibration of the vehicle shell during water entry including the axial vibration and lateral vibration of the shell 3 the acceleration caused by other interference factors such as the acceleration due to the vibration of the accelerometer itself the accelerometers vibrate when the vehicle hits the water surface under normal circumstances the frequency of the deceleration generated by the vibration is far greater than the vehicle shell vibration frequency this paper focuses mainly on the characteristics of rigid body acceleration which requires us to extract the rigid body acceleration signal from the complex measured impact acceleration signal the eemd method is an adaptive and efficient method applied to decompose nonlinear and nonstationary signals and is suitable for dealing with water entry problems battista et al 2007 2009 this method is proposed to solve the mode mixing problem in the empirical mode decomposition emd method and has been widely used in signal analysis and has achieved good results wu and huang 2009 in this paper the eemd method was used to analyse the measured acceleration signal li and liu 2010 and then to extract the rigid body overload from the measured water entry impact acceleration signal in addition to eemd method fft method is also a commonly used analysis method in frequency domain the impact load on the vehicle during water entry is a typical non stationary signal fft may only give the overall characteristics but may not reflect the characteristics of the signal at a certain time after fft processing the signals of various frequencies are superimposed together and the cut off frequency needs to be artificially selected however eemd method is a time frequency processing method of adaptive signal according to the characteristics of the signal itself the signal is decomposed into the sum of the components of a finite number of natural mode functions adaptively without artificial selection of cut off frequency different eigenmode functions contain different components of frequency segments therefore the eemd method is adopted instead of the fft method first we introduce the relevant principle of emd method which adaptively decomposes the signal into a finite number of intrinsic mode function imf components according to the characteristics of the signal itself according to the sequence of decomposition the central frequency of each imf ranges from high to low and each imf has to satisfy the following two conditions huang et al 1998 1 the number of extreme points including maximum and minimum and the number of zero points of the decomposed imf components must either be equal or differ by at most 1 2 at any time the mean value of the upper envelope determined by the local maximum and the lower envelope determined by the local minimum is zero that is the components are locally symmetric with respect to the time axis the essence of the emd method is to obtain the natural vibration mode of the signal through the local characteristic time scale of the signal and then decompose the signal by the natural vibration mode step by step the basic processing steps are as follows 1 identify the local maximum and minimum points of the original signal data x t and then obtain the upper and lower envelopes by using cubic spline interpolation obtain the mean value of the corresponding data point m 1 t and calculate the difference between x t and m 1 t 1 h 1 t x t m 1 t 2 determine whether 1 satisfies the conditions of the imf if not use the original signal and repeat step 1 to obtain 2 h 1 1 t h 1 t m 1 1 t repeat k screenings until h 1 k t satisfies the imf conditions and define c 1 t h 1 k t then c 1 t is the first order imf extracted from the original signal x t which is the highest frequency component of the original signal 3 the first order imf component c 1 t is extracted from the original signal x t to obtain a margin r 1 t which is 3 r 1 t x t c 1 t using r 1 t as the new original signal repeat steps 1 and 2 and extract the second order imf c 2 t the third order imf c 3 t the nth order imf c n t then 4 r 2 t r 1 t c 2 t r 3 t r 2 t c 3 t r n t r n 1 t c n t according to equations 3 and 4 the final decomposition result of the original signal x t is 5 x t i 1 n c i t r n t where r n t is the residual amount which is a monotonic function representing the final trend of the signal the principle of eemd is to add white noise to the signal being analysed so that the signal and noise are unified during the decomposition of emd signals of different scales are adaptively mapped to the appropriate frequency range established by the white noise according to huang and wu wu and huang 2009 eemd contains the following steps 1 add a white noise series ω t to the analysed signal x t to obtain a total signal x t 6 x t x t ω t 2 decompose the signal with added white noise into imfs using the emd method 7 x t i 1 n c i t r t 3 add a different white noise series ω j t to the analysed signal x t to obtain another total signal x j t and decompose the total signal x j t into imfs 8 x j t i 1 n c j i t r j t 4 adopt the means of the ensemble corresponding to the imf as the final imf result 9 c j t 1 n i 1 n c j i t 10 ε n ε n where n is the number of times the white noise is added that is the total signal number ε is the amplitude of the white noise added with ε 0 15 used in this paper and ε n is the error of the original signal and the signal obtained by the sum of the final imfs when the amplitude of the noise is constant the more times white noise is added the closer the final result is to the true value based on many trials this paper takes n 200 in the analysis considering the principle of eemd the acceleration signal of the water entry impact is processed and the components and characteristics of the signal can be obtained by analysing the decomposed imf components taking condition 6 as an example the eemd decomposition result of axial water entry impact acceleration is shown in fig 5 fig 5 shows that the axial water entry impact acceleration signal under this test condition generates 9 imf components and the residual r through eemd decomposition in the figure the first line is the original signal the 2 10 lines are imf1 imf2 imf9 and the last line is the residual the first third order imf components have a high frequency and short wavelength which represent the noise or high frequency components in the original signal its amplitude is large which indicates that the energy occupied by the first 3 order components is also large as the decomposition progresses the frequency of the obtained component gradually decreases and the wavelength becomes longer until the last component with a very low frequency is decomposed this indicates that both the high frequency component and the low frequency component are included in the water entry impact acceleration signal as seen from table 9 and fig 13 below the low frequency component may be the natural frequency of the vehicle vibration excited by the impact load and the high frequency component may be caused by the shock wave propagating inside the vehicle each imf component contains different time feature scales and is displayed at different adaptive frequency resolutions the residual is a monotonically varying component with a small amplitude which represents the overall trend of the original signal the above decomposition results show that the essence of the eemd method is a bandpass filter with an adaptive bandwidth transformation which decomposes the original decomposed signal into imf1 imf2 imf9 and residual r to recognize the sources and components of the water entry impact acceleration signal from the imfs the eemd method combining the modal analysis described in section 4 1 is adopted in this paper the processing steps of this method are as follows first the original signal is decomposed based on the eemd method and a burg power spectrum analysis of imf components is carried out to obtain the power spectrum of each imf component then the modal analysis is performed on the vehicle and the high frequency imf component is filtered from the original signal with the natural frequency of the second order bending mode as the cut off frequency thus the filtered signal is obtained by reconstructing the remaining imf components starting from the essential characteristics of the signal this method does not need to set any parameters but needs only to select different imf components for reconstruction to obtain different filtering results the reason why this paper adopts the burg method to analyse the power spectrum is that it has some obvious advantages with the increase of order the resolution of burg method is improved in addition some implicit extrapolation of data and autocorrelation functions makes it possible to exceed a given length not affected by window functions as classical spectral estimates therefore the resolution of burg spectrum is higher and the corresponding spectrum line is much smoother at present in addition to burg method commonly used methods for the analysis of power spectrum mainly include bartlett welch and so on compared with burg method bartlett method has the advantage of high resolution and the disadvantage of large dispersion rough curve and large variance welch method is greatly improved based on the bartlett method however after weighting each sequence with window functions the main lobe of the power spectrum becomes wider and the resolution decreases although the smooth estimation results are obtained in view of the above considerations the burg method is used for power spectrum analysis combined with the data processing method proposed in this paper fig 6 shows the filtering results obtained after selecting different imf components for the water entry acceleration signal in the axial direction of working condition 6 the burg power spectrum results of the original signal indicate that its energy is concentrated mainly at approximately 5 khz fig 6 a the burg power spectrum of the signal filtered after subtracting the first order imf component has a peak at approximately 1 khz and 2 khz indicating that the original signal still has high frequency components fig 6 b the power spectrum of the signal which is filtered after subtracting the first three orders of the imf shows a peak at approximately 908 hz fig 6 d which is nearly the natural frequency 942 04 hz table 9 of the second order bending mode of model e this low frequency component is the natural frequency of the vehicle caused by the impact load this means that the signal after subtracting the first three orders of the imf is the rigid body water entry load of the vehicle and the peak load is 155 2 g here g is the acceleration of gravity 3 numerical simulations 3 1 numerical models the analysis is carried out by the explicit finite element method based on a multi material eulerian formulation and penalty coupling method the fluids water and air are solved in the eulerian formulation whereas the motion of the structure auv and the free surface are tracked using the lagrangian formulation the fluid structure interaction fsi is calculated based on the penalty method souli and benson 2010 the fluids and structure are modelled with solid 164 three dimensional elements in the numerical simulation and the gravitational effect is considered while the surface tension effect is neglected in the analysis the water and the air are treated as compressible fluids and the corresponding properties are described by the equations of state eoss the gruneisen eos is used in the water domain and the linear polynomial eos is applied to the air domain the gruneisen eos is given by the following formulation 11 p ρ c 2 μ 1 1 γ 0 2 μ a 2 μ 2 1 s 1 1 μ s 2 μ 2 μ 1 s 3 μ 3 μ 1 3 2 γ 0 a μ e the linear polynomial eos is defined by the following formulation 12 p c 0 c 1 μ c 2 μ 2 c 3 μ 3 c 4 c 5 μ c 6 μ 2 e where e is the initial internal energy per unit volume ρ is the density c is the bulk speed of sound s 1 s 2 and s 3 are unitless coefficients γ 0 is the gruneisen constant a is the first order volume correction to γ 0 and c 0 c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 c 5 and c 6 are the polynomial equation coefficients note that the air was considered compressible by setting c 0 c 2 c 3 c 4 c 5 c 6 0 the compression μ is defined in terms of the relative volume v as follows 13 μ 1 v v the parameters used in the simulation for the water and air are shown in table 5 the size of the air domain is 3000 mm 500 mm 2400 mm and the size of the water domain is 3000 mm 1500 mm 2400 mm the boundaries of the domain are defined as non reflecting and the inner nodes are free the convergence study results show that when the mesh size of the eulerian element is 4 times that of the lagrangian element both the accuracy and the computational efficiency are considerable shi et al 2019b the final vehicle is divided into 35840 elements and the fluid domain is divided into 1800000 elements as shown in fig 7 3 2 numerical experimental correlation and discussion simulations of the water entry impact load of the experimental model were carried out based on the established finite element model to verify the accuracy of the numerical method the test conditions in table 3 such as water entry velocities water entry angles and angles of attack were used in the simulations for the initial conditions and the total simulation time was 20 ms the following are the comparisons of the cavity water entry impact acceleration velocity and displacement with the test results under different working conditions 3 2 1 comparison of the cavity fig 8 shows a comparison between the numerical results for the cavity formation and position of the auv and the experimental photographs under case 6 the time interval between two adjacent pictures is 0 5 ms because of the viewing field of the underwater high speed cameras we cannot see the head or tail of the vehicle in a picture completely a cavity forms when the model touches the water and expands dramatically as the model enters the water as the depth of water entry increases a large number of cavitation bubbles are generated on the in flight surface of the model the tail of the model first comes into contact with the cavitation wall and a large amount of splashing occurs at the interface this is because the model has a small positive attack angle at the moment it enters the water under the influence of gravity the pitching moment encountered when entering the water is also a factor producing a tendency for the head to rise for the convenience of observation we draw the outline of the cavity with a red line and a blue dotted line in the experimental and numerical results respectively as seen from the results the experimental and numerical results agree well 3 2 2 comparison of the acceleration fig 9 shows a comparison curve between the simulation and test results of water entry impact acceleration in working condition 6 the simulation results of the axial and normal water entry impact accelerations are basically identical to the trend of the test results the model suffers from a large load at the moment of water entry and then the oscillation trend of the acceleration is moderated table 6 shows the comparison between the test results and the simulation results of the impact load of water entry under seven different working conditions the relative error of the axial load peak value is less than 5 except for condition 2 5 3 while for the relative error of the normal load peak the maximum relative error of working condition 6 is 9 3 and the relative error of the other six working conditions is less than 10 this indicates that the simulation results are generally consistent with the test results 3 2 3 comparison of the impact velocity the time history curve of the water entry velocity of the vehicle can be obtained by integrating the test acceleration signal once fig 10 shows the comparison curve between the simulation result and the test result of the water entry velocity in working condition 6 the axial and normal water entry velocities are in good agreement before the water entry load reaches the peak value after which the relative error between the simulation result and the experimental value gradually increases the time history curve of axial velocity shows that the velocity attenuation rate of the test value is less than that of the numerical simulation after the peak load is reached the normal velocity time history curve shows that the velocity decay rate of the test value is essentially identical to that of the simulation result after the peak load is reached the difference between experimental results and numerical results includes two aspects absolute difference and trend difference firstly the absolute difference is analysed it may be seen from fig 9 that 1 the numerical results of the acceleration are in good agreement with the experimental results before about 3 ms 2 after 3 ms the difference between the numerical result of acceleration and the experimental result is large which leads to the gradual increase of the difference between numerical and experimental results of velocity in fig 10 next the trend difference is analysed it may be seen from fig 9 that 1 after stabilization the experimental curve of axial acceleration is horizontal while the numerical curve of axial acceleration is tilted so the velocity attenuation rate of test value is less than that of numerical simulation after the peak load is reached 2 after stabilization both the experimental curves and numerical curves of axial acceleration are horizontal so the normal velocity time history curve shows that the velocity decay rate of the test value is basically identical with that of the simulation result after the peak load is reached table 7 shows a comparison between test values and simulation results under seven working conditions of the water entry velocity changing with time the relative error of the axial velocity is approximately 6 and the relative error of the normal velocity is approximately 9 in general the numerical simulation results agree well with the experimental data 3 2 4 comparison of the displacement the time history curve of the water entry displacement of the vehicle can be obtained by quadratic integration of the water entry impact acceleration signal fig 11 shows a comparison curve between the simulation results and the test results of the water entry displacement with time in working condition 6 the simulation results are essentially consistent with the trend of the test results table 8 compares the test values and the simulation results of the water entry displacement with time under 7 working conditions the relative errors between the test values and simulation results of the axial displacement and radial displacement are both small approximately 5 according to the above analysis results the relative error between the test values and the simulation results of the impact peak during water entry is approximately 5 while the relative error of the water entry velocity is approximately 9 and the relative error of the water entry displacement is approximately 5 the results of these three aspects show that the simulation values agree well with the experimental values which verifies the accuracy and reliability of the established numerical simulation mathematical model 4 frequency domain characteristics of the impact load this paper focuses mainly on the impact force of the vehicle at the initial stage of water entry this force refers to the force when the head touches and enters the water when it enters the water and the force that acts on the vehicle a short time later at this stage the impact force subjected on the vehicle is greatest and the structure of the vehicle is most vulnerable to damage fig 12 shows the axial load curve of model d when it enters water vertically at 50 m s the axial load of the vehicle increases from 0 to the first peak within a short time approximately 1 ms after entering the water and then decreases rapidly the oscillation attenuation gradually tends to a stable value according to the water entry process of the vehicle the first waveform corresponds to the impact load during the water entry process the waveform is a typical semi sinusoidal impulse signal and the characteristic parameters describing the signal are the peak and peak pulse width the peak pulse width refers to the fraction value of the peak value of the shock pulse rising to a certain setting 0 1 of the peak value is usually taken as the set value and the time interval of this value falling wu et al 2010 through the above two characteristic parameters combined with the quality of the vehicle and related mechanical parameters the maximum impact force impact energy and impact velocity and the frequency range and distribution of the signal can be known although the impact characteristics of the time domain are quantized through the experimental and numerical methods in section 2 3 and section 3 2 the mechanics of the structural response are still not clear under the effect of water entry impact e g which vibration frequency plays a major role and which structural components cause this frequency and what is the relationship between these factors and the structural response therefore this paper mostly focuses on the issue previous studies have shown that the time domain characteristics of the impact load of the vehicle into water have the characteristics of large peak value and small pulse width to study the structural dynamic response of the vehicle under such impact load modal analysis combined with the shock response spectrum srs method was used to study the frequency domain characteristics of the structural response of the vehicle during water entry with the aim to reveal the frequency characteristics of the structural response acceleration of the vehicle 4 1 modal analysis the main purpose of modal analysis is to solve the modal parameters such as the natural frequency mode shape and modal stiffness of the system once the fluid force is transformed the structural response can be calculated by integrating the equations of motion in the time domain in the structural domain the general equations of motion of a system can be written as guan 1996 14 m x c x k x f t where m is the mass matrix c is the damping matrix k is the stiffness matrix x is the acceleration vector x is the velocity vector x is the displacement vector and f t is the excitation force vector if there is no external force then f t 0 and the free vibration equation of the system can be obtained when the natural frequency and natural mode of the vehicle are calculated since damping has little influence on the result the damping term c x can be omitted and the motion equation of undamped free vibration can be obtained as follows 15 m x k x f t 0 the characteristic equation of equation 14 is 16 k ω i 2 m x i 0 in equation 16 x i 0 corresponds to a generalized eigenvalue problem where ω i 2 is the eigenvalue and x i is the eigenvector this equation is also an nth order algebraic homogeneous equation system with the elements in x i acting as variables and k ω i 2 m as the coefficient matrix the necessary and sufficient condition for the equation to have a non zero solution is that its coefficient matrix determinant is 0 17 k ω i 2 m 0 equation 17 is called the characteristic equation of the characteristic eigenproblem form corresponding to an nth order algebraic equation containing ω i 2 this equation is solved to obtain n mutually different positive roots ω i i 1 2 n of ω and ω i is the natural frequency of the i th order mode to reveal the mechanics causing the frequency oscillations in the structural response of the auv during water entry a dry modal analysis was carried out in the commercial code ls dyna since the water impact on auv lasts for a short time and no water flows through the main part of the shell surface fixed supports are applied based on the contact relationship e g the nose of five models are fixed according to the contact between the structure and the water surface the modal analysis results show that most of the vibration mode shapes of the vehicles appear in pairs the mode shapes and the corresponding natural frequencies are almost the same but the spatial directions of the vibration are different the wave nodes of the mode shape such as bending wrinkling and vibration increase with increasing order the typical modal shapes of models b and d are shown in fig 13 the first order and second order bending mode shapes and modal frequencies of the five models are shown in table 9 the differences in the modal frequencies in different directions x y plane and y z plane are slight 4 2 description of the srs method the water entry impact load of vehicles has typical shock characteristics and the spectral decomposition method is widely used in shock signal analysis in this study the srs method is used for shock signal analysis the srs is a description of the maximum response displacement velocity or acceleration of a series of single degree of freedom systems subjected to mechanical impact as a function of the natural frequency of each system an actual physical system can be decomposed into several different single degree of freedom systems we perform an impulse response analysis on each single degree of freedom system take the maximum value of the system response and then identify a data point with its natural frequency in this way the number of data points can be obtained by decomposition into multiple single degree of freedom systems the srs of the whole system can be obtained by connecting these points with smooth curves the srs can be divided into the following three types according to different peak response methods 1 initial response spectrum referred to as the main spectrum this spectrum refers to the srs obtained by taking the peak value of the response in the impact action time the initial response spectrum has positive and negative points the positive direction refers to the response peak in the same direction as the excitation while the negative direction is the response peak value in the opposite direction to the excitation 2 residual response spectrum referred to as residual spectrum this spectrum refers to the relationship between the maximum response peak that occurs after the end of the impact and the natural frequency of the system it also has positive and negative points and the definition of positive and negative is the same as the positive and negative definition of the initial response spectrum 3 maximum response spectrum this spectrum refers to the relationship between the maximum response peak and the natural frequency of the system in all response processes that is the envelope spectrum formed by main spectrum and residual spectrum the improved recursive digital filtering algorithm is used to analyse the impact response spectrum of the water entry impact load in this study and this algorithm was proposed by smallwood in 1981 smallwood 1981 this was based on the slope invariant digital filtering model instead of the pulse invariant model namely the generalized ramp function to replace the pulse invariant model u t δ t the generalized ramp function is 18 u t a t k δ t u t k δ t where u t k δ t is the unit step function and a is the slope of the ramp at t k δ t applying the superposition principle we can obtain a model that approximates the impact input with a trapezoidal function this method is more accurate than the recursive digital filtering model with rectangular approximation suppose the sampling value of the input signal u t is u i i 1 2 n and the single degree of freedom system response x i t i 1 2 n then the recursive formula of the ramp invariant model is 19 x i p 0 u i p 1 u i 1 p 2 u i 2 q 1 x i 1 q 2 x x 2 where q 1 2 e ω n δ t ξ cos ω n δ t 1 ξ 2 q 2 e 2 ω n δ t ξ p 0 1 e ω n δ t ξ sin ω n δ t 1 ξ 2 ω n δ t 1 ξ 2 p 1 2 e ω n δ t ξ sin ω n δ t 1 ξ 2 ω n δ t 1 ξ 2 cos ω n δ t 1 ξ 2 p 2 e ω n δ t ξ e ω n δ t ξ sin ω n δ t 1 ξ 2 ω n δ t 1 ξ 2 ω n 2 π f n here ω n is the natural circular frequency of the system f n is the natural frequency ξ is the critical damping ratio and δ t is the sampling time interval there are two important parameters in the srs analysis quality factor and octave the meanings of these two parameters are as follows 1 the quality factor is defined as where ξ represents the critical damping ratio the quality factor reflects the intensity of the system damping and the steepness of the resonance peak that is the larger q is the steeper the peak the value of ξ directly affects the peak value of the impulse response spectrum for metal material structures ξ is generally taken as 0 05 2 the octave is the logarithmic scale frequency which is twice the frequency expressed as a mathematical formula 2 1 f 1 f 2 here octave refers to the ratio of the next calculated frequency to the previous calculated frequency when calculating the srs the smaller the octave the more points are analysed and the smoother the response spectrum curve however it is not good that the octave is as small as possible when the octave is too fine and the low frequency is too dense computing time is wasted and the solution has little significance in this calculation a 1 12 octave is used 4 3 results and discussion our studies show that the water entry impact loads of vehicles with different initial conditions are all typical semi sinusoidal waveforms and only the peak value and width are different the effect of the peak value and its width on the structural response are studied in this section based on the srs method 4 3 1 effect of the impact pulse width since the peak values of the axial impact load coefficients of model e are essentially equal when entering the water vertically at different velocities 30 m s 70 m s the impact pulse width decreases with increasing velocity 2 5 ms 2 3 ms 2 1 ms 2 0 ms and 1 9 ms this result can be used to analyse the effect of the pulse width on the frequency domain of the impact loads fig 14 is the srs of the impact load of model e vertically entering the water at different velocities the abscissa is the frequency and the ordinate is the nondimensional amplification factor with respect to the peak of the impact load both coordinate axes are shown in logarithmic form the results indicate that the srs is related to the pulse width of the impact load as the pulse width decreases the amplification factor of the srs increases as does the frequency of the inflection point 4 3 2 effect of the peak value the peak values of the impact loads of models c and d entering water at a velocity of 50 m s with different angles 50 60 70 80 and 90 have a significant difference while the peak widths are essentially equal the difference is less than 0 01 ms these results can be used to analyse the effect of the pulse width on the frequency domain of the impact loads figs 15 and 16 show the shock response spectra of the axial and normal impact loads of models c and d respectively the srs analysis results show that the frequencies of the inflection point under these conditions are essentially the same this phenomenon indicates that the shape and tendency of the impact waveform generated by the excitation with the different peak values are the same furthermore the inflection point frequencies and amplification factors of the srs are also the same figs 14 16 also show that if the frequency is large enough the final amplification factor remains at 1 under different waveforms and then the amplification factor no longer changes with the frequency the impact loads with smaller pulse widths have an influence on the high frequency part of the srs while the impact load with larger pulse widths has a greater influence on the low frequency part 4 3 3 effect of natural frequency the relationship between the natural frequency of the vehicle and the srs is studied below since the boundary conditions affects the natural frequency and mode shape of the vehicles to reduce the influence of boundary conditions on the results this section analyses only vertical water entry fig 17 shows the srs of the axial impact load and the second bending mode shape of models a b c d and e entering the water vertically at 50 m s the results show that the five models generate one peak frequency under this impact load the inflection point frequencies of the five models are approximately 920 hz 920 hz 920 hz 920 hz and 950 hz the corresponding second order bending natural frequencies table 9 are 923 96 hz 917 96 hz 919 8 hz 917 83 hz and 942 04 hz the results show that the second order bending mode is excited under this condition and the mode shapes are shown in fig 17 in addition the inflection point frequency of the srs is a certain order natural frequency of the vehicle but there is no obvious law for the specific frequency which is related to the position of the impact load waveform parameters and vibration mode of the vehicle the inflection point frequency is affected by the pulse widths 5 conclusions in this paper five kinds of models with different nose shapes are tested under different water entry velocities and angles the impact acceleration signals are obtained by the sensors first the composition of the impact acceleration signal was analysed then a data processing based eemd method was shown in the analysis the ale method was used for numerical simulation and the results are compared with the experimental test results from the three perspectives of acceleration velocity and displacement the simulation results are in good agreement with the test results which verifies the numerical calculation model and theoretical analysis method adopted in this paper the combination of modal analysis and srs analysis was used to study the frequency characteristics of the water entry impact load we found that the maximum acceleration shock spectrum of the impact load is related to the peak pulse width and is independent of the peak value the smaller the pulse width is the larger the inflection point frequency and magnification of the srs are the inflection point frequency of the shock response spectrum is a certain order natural frequency of the vehicle but there is no obvious law for the specific frequency which is related to the position of the impact load waveform parameters and vibration mode of the vehicle credit authorship contribution statement yao shi
