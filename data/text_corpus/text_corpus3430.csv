17150,aquatic ecosystems are affected by multiple environmental stressors across spatial and temporal scales yet the nature of stressor interactions and stressor response relationships is still poorly understood this hampers the selection of appropriate restoration measures hence there is a need to understand how ecosystems respond to multiple stressors and to unravel the combined effects of the individual stressors on the ecological status of waterbodies models may be used to relate responses of ecosystems to environmental changes as well as to restoration measures and thus provide valuable tools for water management therefore we aimed to develop and test a bayesian network bn for simulating the responses of stream macroinvertebrates to multiple stressors although the predictive performance may be further improved the developed model was shown to be suitable for scenario analyses for the selected lowland streams an increase in macroinvertebrate based ecological quality eqr was predicted for scenarios where the streams were relieved from single and multiple stressors especially a combination of measures increasing flow velocity and enhancing the cover of coarse particulate organic matter showed a significant increase in eqr compared to current conditions the use of bns was shown to be a promising avenue for scenario analyses in stream restoration management bns have the capacity for clear visual communication of model dependencies and the uncertainty associated with input data and results and allow the combination of multiple types of knowledge about stressor effect relations still to make predictions more robust a deeper understanding of stressor interactions is required to parametrize model relations also sufficient training data should be available for the water type of interest yet the application of bns may now already help to unravel the contribution of individual stressors to the combined effect on the ecological quality of water bodies which in turn may aid the selection of appropriate restoration measures that lead to the desired improvements in macroinvertebrate based ecological quality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bayesian network ecological water quality macroinvertebrate multiple stressors stream restoration 1 introduction the ecological status of water bodies is affected by multiple stressors acting over multiple spatial and temporal scales allan et al 1997 frissell et al 1986 roth et al 1996 such as increasing water temperature changes in flow reduction of morphological heterogeneity and increasing nutrient loads friberg 2010 tockner et al 2010 moreover these stressors may interact having synergistic antagonistic or additive effects on the ecological status of freshwater bodies jackson et al 2016 piggott et al 2015 the combined effects of these multiple interacting stressors are however still poorly understood folt et al 1999 jackson et al 2016 since stressor response relationships observed in controlled experiments are specific to organisms stressors and environments and are therefore difficult to extrapolate to the field jackson et al 2016 the lack of understanding of the combined effects of multiple interacting stressors may also explain why knowledge of the effect of specific management interventions on ecological water quality is still limited palmer et al 2005 pander and geist 2013 consequently a high proportion of restoration measures are ineffective even now dos reis oliveira et al 2020 palmer et al 2010 hence to increase the effectiveness of restoration measures we first need to increase our knowledge of how ecosystems respond to multiple stressors and to unravel the contribution of the individual stressors to their combined effect on the ecological status of waterbodies model simulations provide the opportunity to relate the state of an ecosystem to environmental changes as well as to restoration measures and simultaneously provide understanding of the underlying ecological interactions consequently models may be used to predict the effects of management interventions on ecosystem states in space and time and thus provide valuable tools for water management over the last decades several ecological prediction models have been developed ranging from mechanistic representations of environmental processes to food web models and statistical data driven models janssen et al 2015 for the latter techniques have been used such as decision trees artificial neural networks generalised linear and additive models fuzzy logic models and bayesian networks bns pistocchi 2018 the construction of such statistical ecological prediction models can be data driven knowledge based or a combination of both mouton et al 2009 van echelpoel 2020 a review of the advantages and drawbacks of selected modelling techniques indicated that bns are promising tools for the combined application of expert knowledge and ecosystem measurements de vries et al 2020a van echelpoel 2020 bns are causal network models in which nodes depict environmental factors and in which dependencies between nodes are expressed as probabilistic relationships mccann et al 2006 the main advantage of this type of model is that the full range of available knowledge on cause effect relations can be used originating from experts mechanistic modelling output literature and experimental and observed data landuyt et al 2013 mccann et al 2006 integrating the scattered knowledge on cause effect relations in water bodies moreover in these models samples with incomplete datasets can still provide knowledge barton et al 2012 the uncertainty associated with the input data is explicitly accounted for and the predicted outcome is reported as likelihoods uusitalo 2007 in addition bns provide a visualisation of the causal relationship between the predictors which helps with communication of the model limitations of this model type are the lack of representation of feedback loops and the requirement for discretising continuous data uusitalo 2007 however for evaluating stressor effect relations in water bodies we considered that the numerous advantages of bns outweighed these drawbacks the aim of the present study was therefore to develop and test a bayesian network for simulating responses of stream macroinvertebrates to multiple stressors since we anticipated that stressor effect relationships would be context specific model predictions were approached using water type and region specific relationships de vries et al 2020b to this end a bn model was developed which included the links between macroinvertebrate based ecological quality and stream characteristics for a single water type the temperate sandy lowland streams within the north western european plain the availability of an extensive dataset with measurements of multiple stressors and ecological responses for dutch lowland streams enabled us to develop this bn model the developed model was then applied to predict the influence of stream restoration management scenarios on ecological quality as represented by macroinvertebrates 2 methods 2 1 study area the studied lowland streams were located on the ice pushed ridges in the veluwe area in the centre of the netherlands fig 1 the land use in the catchments consisted of agricultural fields urban areas and deciduous and coniferous woodlands mean annual rainfall in the study area was 850 mm and daily temperature varied between 16 and 29 c the flow velocities in the groundwater and precipitation fed streams varied strongly 10 80 cm s the stream bottoms consisted of sand and gravel 2 2 macroinvertebrate and environmental data the data was collected by the dutch water authority vallei and veluwe during regular monitoring programmes over the period 1981 2017 in total 208 sites in the upper courses of the lowland streams were selected at these sites macroinvertebrate abundance data was collected as a part of regular monitoring programs for each macroinvertebrate sample the ecological quality ratio eqr was calculated according to the dutch assessment system which expresses the ecological quality of a water body ranging from 0 1 0 as a fraction of the reference situation 1 0 van der molen et al 2016 in addition for each macroinvertebrate sample the mean preference score ranging from 1 5 for several environmental variables of all species present in that sample was calculated using relative abundance frequencies to this end an environmental preference dataset was used verberk et al 2012 environmental variables that were monitored at the same locations and at the same moment as the macroinvertebrate samples included water temperature dissolved oxygen concentration stream velocity shading total phosphorous concentration biological oxygen demand chlorophyll concentration stream gradient silt cover macrophyte cover coarse particular organic matter cover and the presence of wood and gravel however not all variables were measured at all sites and on all occasions and therefore only environmental monitoring data was included when macroinvertebrate abundance data and at least a single environmental variable were monitored simultaneously this resulted in a set of 933 samples fig 1 2 3 bn theory in short bns consist of causal network structures in which nodes representing important system variables are related to each other through arrows representing dependencies charniak 1991 the state of a node is determined by the states of its parent nodes this approach is described by bayes theorem in which prior probabilities are updated given the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution ellison 2004 the type of relation between a node and its parent nodes as well as the associated uncertainty are recorded in a conditional probability table cpt cpts can be based on multiple types of data including expert knowledge process based modelling output literature based values experimental and observational data observational data is preferred but when gaps are present in the dataset other types of evidence may be used to quantify the relationships between the nodes cpt relations that are initially based on expert knowledge can also be trained by using field observations hence bns have the advantage of being able to deal with incomplete datasets and of providing ways to combine different sources of knowledge uusitalo 2007 a bn captures relations between a set of variables which may be uncertain probabilistic or imprecise when the predictions are used in decision making the explicit reporting of the associated uncertainty and the variability in the model results provides an advantage of this approach over deterministic methods that lack this reporting mccann et al 2006 another advantage of bns is that calculations can be made in the two directions of the arrows between the nodes the values of child nodes can be calculated given the values of the parent nodes and vice versa consequently bns can be used to predict the outcome of scenarios given a set of causal variables but also as diagnostic tools to deduce the probabilities of causes given the observed consequences by using the dependencies in the model structure backwards barton et al 2012 mccann et al 2006 2 4 model development a five step model development process was adopted marcot et al 2006 following several guidelines aguilera et al 2011 chen and pollino 2012 landuyt et al 2013 1 model structure an influence diagram was set up showing the causal relations between the environmental variables and the macroinvertebrate based eqr 2 model parametrisation the cpts picturing the relationships between the nodes in the model structure were defined using expert knowledge and model based and literature based relationships in this step also continuous variables were discretized 3 model training the cpts were trained using observations 4 model testing model performance was tested using independent observations 5 model application a final model version for application was trained using all available data model structure step 1 the constructed bn represents a causal network of the environmental factors that influence macroinvertebrate assemblages the chosen outcome variable was the eqr the development of the early stages of the model structure was described in skeffington et al 2014s based on literature and input from stream macroinvertebrate experts the key environmental factors that influence the eqr in this specific water type and region were selected including temperature oxygen concentration flow velocity food quality and substrate variability sandin and johnson 2004 verberk et al 2012 verdonschot et al 1998 these factors score the response to the environmental variables on a scale from 0 1 thus giving the user the opportunity to see which stressor is most limiting for a high eqr the optimal values of these key factors were based on water type and region specific preferences of the reference macroinvertebrate assemblage verdonschot et al 2000 next predictors of those environmental variables that span local to regional spatial scales were included resulting in the model structure depicted in fig 2 the selection of the included variables was made to cover all relevant processes from reach to catchment scale but at the same time aimed to limit model complexity in addition to the environmental variables five nodes were included that represent the average preference score of the observed macroinvertebrate assemblage for the variables flow velocity cpom silt gravel and wood these scores are based on a preference database that lists species specific preferences for environmental variables based on experimental and distribution data verberk et al 2012 and range from 1 low preference to 5 high preference inclusion of these nodes served as an additional source of information about the quality of a water body based on the preferences of the local macroinvertebrate assemblage model parametrisation step 2 initially the relationships between the nodes in the model were based on literature mechanistic modelling outcomes and expert judgement table a 1 when possible a relationship was expressed as an equation discretisation was either based on equal intervals or on equal frequency to assure an even spread of data chen and pollino 2012 the number of discretisation classes for each node was either 4 5 or 6 balancing a minimum resolution to picture environmental processes with sufficient data availability per class training and testing of the network step 3 and 4 step 3 and 4 were combined in a k fold cross validation context marcot 2012 the dataset was split into 3 parts of which 2 parts were used for training the network and 1 part for testing the network performance for a stable validation outcome among trained model variations subsets of data for cross validation can be made using stratified classes although this was not applied here the subsets of data did have a similar distribution of eqr classes model training and testing was done for 3 consecutive runs where in each run another part of the dataset was used for testing the resulting metrics were then averaged for overall model performance cross validation was performed on several model variations to test the influence of differences in structure and parametrisation on the prediction performance i e discretisation method number of discretisation classes and the inclusion exclusion of nodes representing macroinvertebrate preference data table 1 sensitivity analysis of the network was performed to identify the factors that had the strongest influence on the target node it was thought more valuable to compare the model results as a continuous eqr value to observed continuous values as the use of eqr classes would not be informative enough in practice conventional metrics such as the number of correctly classified instances only use the classified output of the model expressed as discrete values and are therefore less suitable for testing the performance of the model in predicting the actual continuous eqr therefore in this study performance was tracked using the correlation between the observed and predicted eqr scores marcot 2012 although the performance might be more strictly assessed than by using class based metrics the eqr scores used were expected values predicted by the target node which is the average of the discretized classes weighted by the probability of occurrence to develop and test the bn model the netica bn software was used as a modelling shell norsys 1998 this software provides a graphical user interface can handle input of continuous data provides ways to perform sensitivity analysis and can work in batch mode to more easily run the model for multiple sites scenario analysis step 5 based on the performance analysis the best performing model variation was selected next this model was trained with all available data marcot 2006 table a 3 and subsequently applied to predict the influence of stream restoration management scenarios on macroinvertebrate based ecological quality to this end sites were relieved from either one or multiple stressors table 2 in which only combinations of scenarios that targeted at least two different key factors were considered a comparison was made between the effect of removing single and multiple stressors per stream or stream stretch 3 results the first steps in developing the model were constructing the network structure and then informing it with literature and expert based knowledge step 1 and 2 in the third step the knowledge informed network was trained using actual monitoring data training the network with monitoring data resulted in adjusted probabilities directly affecting 17 nodes with a maximum change in probabilities of 60 for instance there was a relatively high number of high gradient streams in the dataset consequently the corresponding probabilities were adjusted such that for any new datapoint without observations for stream gradient the model assumed a higher prior probability that it is a high gradient stream this in turn altered the prediction of the status of the target node the ecological quality expressed by the eqr this adjustment is reflected by the larger bar in the top right node of fig 3 b compared to fig 3a in step 4 of the model development the network was tested using a part of the dataset applying a 3 fold cross validation the performance of the tested model variations table 3 was expressed as correlations between the observed and the predicted eqr scores and showed scores up to 0 35 expressing a relatively poor predictive performance the model variation performing best was obtained by incorporating 6 discretisation classes using equal frequency discretisation and including the trait preferences nodes the sensitivity analysis shows the influence of the environmental factors on macroinvertebrate based eqr the target node in decreasing order fig 4 revealing that temperature velocity and cpom had the strongest influence whereas the factors macrophytes stream gradient and total phosphorous concentration had a very limited influence this best performing model variation was subsequently applied to compare the model eqr predictions with the observed eqr per stream fig 5 showing that in half of the cases the eqr was predicted well this concerned mainly streams with a relatively low eqr in contrast in the other half of the streams having a relatively high observed ecological water quality the predicted eqr was lower than the observed eqr in these underpredicted cases either the model judged the environmental variables too severely or the observed eqr was overrepresenting the actual ecological quality as a result of a too optimistic underlying assessment system to gain more insight into these underpredictions the two most deviating cases the zwaanspreng and egelbeek were considered in more detail to this end the average preference score of the macroinvertebrate assemblage was calculated for each sample for the factor flow velocity one of the most influential environmental variables fig 4 and the only factor for which enough preference data was available fig 6 the mean flow velocity preference scores for these samples was relatively high mean preference score 3 6 out of 5 and also the flow velocity was generally high mean 0 31 m s likewise the observed eqr was also high mean 0 81 this points to the model having underpredicted the eqr of these sites based on the factor flow velocity however flow velocity is only one of the factors determining the eqr and therefore also other factors might have contributed to the underestimated eqr however as there is insufficient data available for the actual assemblage preference for the other environmental factors we could not evaluate the contribution of these factors to the underpredictions of the eqr in the scenario analysis step 5 the model was used to predict the effect of relieving the stream from single and multiple stressors on the target node the eqr for all streams combined significant differences in eqr were observed when compared with the current conditions fig 7 a yet for scenarios involving the relief of a single stressor more negative than positive effects were observed in contrast when a combination of stressors was removed the majority of scenarios showed positive effects on the eqr in some of the streams the effects of taking away the stressors could not be predicted not shown which might be due to inconsistencies between the observed and the scenario based variables in the model where nodes receive contradicting input when the scenario effects were considered per individual stream there was a high variation in the results fig a1 nevertheless for half of the streams clear management effects were still observed to illustrate this the hierdense beek and tongerense beek were considered in more detail because these streams showed the clearest effects of stressor relief and had the largest dataset respectively moreover the specificity of the predictions was increased when the samples were grouped in stream stretches that represent a specific waterbody subtype within similar surrounding conditions as can be seen for the upstream stretch of the stream hierdense beek fig 5 for this stretch of the hierdense beek and for the stream tongerense beek several positive effects of management scenarios were observed fig 7b 7c relieving the stream from most single stressors and stressor combinations increased the eqr in contrast scenarios involving an increase in velocity showed negative effects on the eqr except when this measure was combined with increased cpom cover where a strong positive effect was seen especially the combined approaches that increased cpom cover and flow velocity or cpom cover and substrate quality wood and gravel presence had a positive effect on the mean eqr of both streams 4 discussion the aim of our study was to develop and test a bayesian network for simulating macroinvertebrate based ecological water quality based on the responses of stream macroinvertebrates to multiple stressors the model was developed for a specific water type in a single region where multiple stressors affected the stream ecosystem quality although surrounded by substantial margins of uncertainty as seen in fig 7 the bn clearly showed the positive influence of restoration measures on the ecological quality of the studied lowland streams below we will discuss the performance of the bn in the scenario analyses the complexity of predicting the effects of multiple stressors on macroinvertebrate based ecological quality and how this approach can be applied in stream restoration management 4 1 bn model development bns are promising as tools in restoration management as they offer a way to include expert knowledge with associated uncertainties in combination with monitoring data and output from process based modelling in addition the explicit expression of the associated uncertainty and the clear visualisation of the causal model structure are advantages of this technique which make it a suitable tool to support water managers in decision making barton et al 2012 uusitalo 2007 however to be able to train the knowledge informed network using observations for each pair of connected nodes there should be a set of data available that covers the full range of all possible combinations of node states cain 2001 this is a requirement which may be difficult to comply with in practice especially when the focus is on a specific water type in the development of our bn model choices had to be made to deal with the inherent complexity of aquatic ecosystems to this end the main predictors of the macroinvertebrate based eqr were selected however there was a trade off between the desired model complexity and the availability of training data where a lack of data would decrease model performance see also marcot et al 2006 hence to select the optimal model variation multiple model structures and parameterisations were tested in the comparison of these slightly adjusted models equal frequency discretisation gave better predictive performance than discretisation based on predefined class boundaries however compare boets et al 2015 although all discretisation methods imply a simplification of continuous data aguilera et al 2011 using equal frequency discretisation ensures that each class of a node is represented equally in the data which supports a better training of the conditional probabilities in the network also the inclusion of the preference nodes slightly improved the predictions our results showed the impact of restoration measures in the scenario analysis compared to the current situation but the overall absolute performance of the bn model was still limited especially for streams with a high observed ecological quality the eqr was underpredicted by the model this might be partly due to gaps in the dataset consequently it was not possible to train each knowledge based cpt with observed data table a 3 a possible explanation may also be that the model only predicts the effects of changes in environmental factors on macroinvertebrates whereas in reality dispersal and biotic interaction filters also determine the macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and therefore the ecological quality of a specific site poff 1997 in addition the interactions between environmental factors are not completely understood and cannot be fully incorporated moreover the model is static and therefore assumes that the assemblage is in equilibrium with the environmental conditions at each site austin 2002 but this is not always the case belyea and lancaster 1999 wiens 1984 together these complexities which are not well understood could have influenced the performance of the model therefore the current model is not yet thought to be acceptable for application as such given that predictions are not yet in accordance with the observations with a more complete dataset testing of additional model variations and an increased insight in stressor interactions to improve model relations this model type might be further applied as a tool in restoration management 4 2 multiple stressor effects on macroinvertebrate based ecological quality waterbodies are generally subjected to multiple stressors birk 2018 this creates a complex task for water managers who aim to improve the ecological status of stream ecosystems in addition stressor interactions may take place that either enhance the added effects of additional stressors synergism or decrease these combined effects antagonism folt et al 1999 such interactive effects are specific to stressors organisms and environments and consequently are difficult to predict jackson et al 2016 with this added complexity simulating ecological quality remains a complex task as our study showed despite this complexity the present bn scenario analyses showed that ecological quality can be improved when the streams are relieved from specific stressors or combinations thereof whereas other restoration scenarios may prove to be less effective for the studied streams the strongest positive effect resulted from increasing flow velocity in combination with the presence of cpom whereas only improving flow velocity yielded no positive effect this may be explained by the interaction between flow velocity and cpom only increasing stream velocity would not safeguard the variation in flow required for patches of coarse material to persist providing necessary habitat for stream organisms de brouwer et al 2019 to gain more insight in the interaction between flow velocity and cpom cover these key environmental factors could be included in the network in more detail than they are now the added value of combining restoration scenarios was also observed for the scenarios that enhanced the presence of wood and gravel substrate and the cover of cpom in the scenarios where the streams are relieved from the individual stressors already a positive impact is seen but when the stream is relieved from both stressors simultaneously the macroinvertebrate based ecological quality improves even more than expected based on the contributions of the single stressors which could point at a positive synergistic interaction of stressor relief similarly such interactive effects on macroinvertebrates have been observed for other environmental stressors beermann et al 2018 jackson et al 2016 yet for the other combined scenarios in the present study where multiple stressors were adjusted no interactive effects were observed indeed also for other water bodies it was reported that additive effects of multiple stressors prevail gieswein et al 2017 however the current model is partly knowledge informed and not completely based on data this is especially the case for the target node where the relationship picturing the combination of multiple stressors into a combined response was based on expert knowledge to better quantify the interactions between the stressors of interest additional statistical analyses could be carried out on a more extensive dataset feld et al 2016 glendell et al 2019 in addition experiments may help to disentangle the interactive effects of multiple stressors elbrecht et al 2016 verberk et al 2016 only when we have more knowledge about the nature and interactions of stressor response relationships for specific species and complete assemblages can we develop modelling of multiple stressor impacts further in turn the application of models can show us where these knowledge gaps persist and where additional experiments might be needed to better understand underlying processes consequently bns and other approaches are complementary in their contribution to an increase of the understanding of multiple stressor effects apart from the interaction between stressors other studies showed that choosing measures based on identifying multiple stressors covering the entire catchment proved to be more effective dos reis oliveira et al 2020 feld et al 2011 van puijenbroek et al 2019 this illustrates the significance of simultaneously considering multiple stressors over multiple scales for effective stream restoration in conclusion the present model exercise demonstrated that applying different scenarios enhances the understanding of the effects of combinations of measures on macroinvertebrate based ecological quality and may aid in selecting and prioritizing the most promising restoration measures as discussed below 4 3 bns as tools in restoration management nowadays in the practice of stream restoration the selected measures are still strongly based on assumptions rather than proofs of their positive effects on the ecological status of stream ecosystem dos reis oliveira et al 2020 which was the main motivation to perform the present study the application of the current bn model indeed enhanced the insights into the possible effects of management scenarios on the ecological quality as represented by macroinvertebrates hence these model predictions may be used to inform water managers which measures to prioritize in restoration management to effectively alleviate stress this increases the chance that the applied restoration measures do indeed lead to the desired improvement in the ecological status of stream ecosystems whereas we used the bn model to show the relative impact of combinations of restoration measures on macroinvertebrate based ecological quality such models can also be used backwards in a diagnostic approach to find causes for observed symptoms feld et al 2020 trigg et al 2000 ideally a model performing well tailored to the study area would give insight into which environmental factors would produce most effect for the manager the next step would be to identify how these variables might be targeted by linking these to actual restoration measures however this prioritisation is often not just based on the outcome of the model in these scenario analyses the use of site specific knowledge would permit the manager to decide which variables to prioritize for example knowledge of the possibility and cost of certain measures and of restoration efforts and disturbances that have taken place in the past as shown here scenario analyses can be especially informative in situations where multiple stressors are acting in the case of a single dominant stressor a specific measure may be more easily selected but for a situation with a more even contribution of multiple stressors selecting and prioritizing restoration measures may not be straightforward in these cases scenario analyses may help to choose a combination of measures to alleviate the pressure on the ecosystem and to improve the ecological water quality the current model was designed and trained for a single area and water type when applied to other areas the main model structure can still be used as a starting point although the choice for key environmental factors parametrisation of the cpts calibration and validation should be carried out in a way tailored to the water type and region of interest ultimately in the application of bns challenges remain with the abovementioned complexities in addition kaikkonen et al 2021 list the remaining challenges of bns used in environmental management such as models lacking validation unclear discretisation methods and lack of clarity about the source of expert knowledge indeed most bn applications fail to test the predictive ability of the model death et al 2015 as described here discretisation and validation of the model outcomes is not straightforward better reporting of such challenges associated with these technical aspects may therefore improve future robustness of bn applications in addition recent technical developments might further increase the possibilities of bn applications such as the use of hybrid networks that can represent continuous variables without the information loss associated with discretisation kaikkonen et al 2021 the success of applying bns for similar purposes in the future depends on the availability of high quality data and the possibility to include a more fundamental understanding of the complexity of ecosystems with context specific knowledge on how interactions between multiple stressors affect macroinvertebrate assemblages the current approach has contributed to an increased understanding of the complexity of these aquatic ecosystems moreover our study showed how bns can be used in a scenario analysis to select and prioritize the most promising restoration measures 5 conclusions in this study the application of bns for simulating the effects of multiple stressors on macroinvertebrate based ecological water quality was tested although the predictive performance can be further improved our application illustrated how these models can be used to increase our knowledge of how ecosystems respond to multiple stressors to make predictions more robust a deeper understanding of stressor interactions is required also sufficient training data should be available for the water type of interest still bns allow us to make steps in unravelling the contribution of the individual stressors to their combined effect on the ecological quality of water bodies this in turn may aid the selection of appropriate restoration measures that lead to the desired improvements

17150,aquatic ecosystems are affected by multiple environmental stressors across spatial and temporal scales yet the nature of stressor interactions and stressor response relationships is still poorly understood this hampers the selection of appropriate restoration measures hence there is a need to understand how ecosystems respond to multiple stressors and to unravel the combined effects of the individual stressors on the ecological status of waterbodies models may be used to relate responses of ecosystems to environmental changes as well as to restoration measures and thus provide valuable tools for water management therefore we aimed to develop and test a bayesian network bn for simulating the responses of stream macroinvertebrates to multiple stressors although the predictive performance may be further improved the developed model was shown to be suitable for scenario analyses for the selected lowland streams an increase in macroinvertebrate based ecological quality eqr was predicted for scenarios where the streams were relieved from single and multiple stressors especially a combination of measures increasing flow velocity and enhancing the cover of coarse particulate organic matter showed a significant increase in eqr compared to current conditions the use of bns was shown to be a promising avenue for scenario analyses in stream restoration management bns have the capacity for clear visual communication of model dependencies and the uncertainty associated with input data and results and allow the combination of multiple types of knowledge about stressor effect relations still to make predictions more robust a deeper understanding of stressor interactions is required to parametrize model relations also sufficient training data should be available for the water type of interest yet the application of bns may now already help to unravel the contribution of individual stressors to the combined effect on the ecological quality of water

heterogeneity and increasing nutrient loads friberg 2010 tockner et al 2010 moreover these stressors may interact having synergistic antagonistic or additive effects on the ecological status of freshwater bodies jackson et al 2016 piggott et al 2015 the combined effects of these multiple interacting stressors are however still poorly understood folt et al 1999 jackson et al 2016 since stressor response relationships observed in controlled experiments are specific to organisms stressors and environments and are therefore difficult to extrapolate to the field jackson et al 2016 the lack of understanding of the combined effects of multiple interacting stressors may also explain why knowledge of the effect of specific management interventions on ecological water quality is still limited palmer et al 2005 pander and geist 2013 consequently a high proportion of restoration measures are ineffective even now dos reis oliveira et al 2020 palmer et al 2010 hence to increase the effectiveness of restoration measures we first need to increase our knowledge of how ecosystems respond to multiple stressors and to unravel the contribution of the individual stressors to their combined effect on the ecological status of waterbodies model simulations provide the opportunity to relate the state of an ecosystem to environmental changes as well as to restoration measures and simultaneously provide understanding of the underlying ecological interactions consequently models may be used to predict the effects of management interventions on ecosystem states in space and time and thus provide valuable tools for water management over the last decades several ecological prediction models have been developed ranging from mechanistic representations of environmental processes to food web models and statistical data driven models janssen et al 2015 for the latter techniques have been used such as decision trees artificial neural networks generalised linear and additive models fuzzy logic models and bayesian networks bns pistocchi 2018 the construction of such statistical ecological prediction models can be data driven knowledge based or a combination of both mouton

in these models samples with incomplete datasets can still provide knowledge barton et al 2012 the uncertainty associated with the input data is explicitly accounted for and the predicted outcome is reported as likelihoods uusitalo 2007 in addition bns provide a visualisation of the causal relationship between the predictors which helps with communication of the model limitations of this model type are the lack of representation of feedback loops and the requirement for discretising continuous data uusitalo 2007 however for evaluating stressor effect relations in water bodies we considered that the numerous advantages of bns outweighed these drawbacks the aim of the present study was therefore to develop and test a bayesian network for simulating responses of stream macroinvertebrates to multiple stressors since we anticipated that stressor effect relationships would be context specific model predictions were approached using water type and region specific relationships de vries et al 2020b to this end a bn model was developed which included the links between macroinvertebrate based ecological quality and stream characteristics for a single water type the temperate sandy lowland streams within the north western european plain the availability of an extensive dataset with measurements of multiple stressors and ecological responses for dutch lowland streams enabled us to develop this bn model the developed model was then applied to predict the influence of stream restoration management scenarios on ecological quality as represented by macroinvertebrates 2 methods 2 1 study area the studied lowland streams were located on the ice pushed ridges in the veluwe area in the centre of the netherlands fig 1 the land use in the catchments consisted of agricultural fields urban areas and deciduous and coniferous woodlands mean annual rainfall in the study area was 850 mm and daily temperature varied between 16 and 29 c the flow velocities in the groundwater and precipitation fed streams varied strongly 10 80 cm s the stream bottoms consisted of sand and gravel 2 2 macroinvertebrate and environmental data the data was collected by the dutch water authority vallei and veluwe during regular monitoring programmes over the period 1981 2017 in total 208 sites in the upper courses of the lowland streams were selected at these sites macroinvertebrate abundance data was collected as a part of regular monitoring programs for each macroinvertebrate sample the ecological quality ratio eqr was calculated according to the dutch assessment system which expresses the ecological quality of a water body ranging from 0 1 0 as a fraction of the reference situation 1 0 van der molen et al 2016 in addition for each macroinvertebrate sample the mean preference score ranging from 1 5 for several environmental variables of all species present in that sample was calculated using relative abundance frequencies to this end an environmental preference dataset was used verberk et al 2012 environmental variables that were monitored at the same locations and at the same moment as the macroinvertebrate samples included water temperature dissolved oxygen concentration stream velocity shading total phosphorous concentration biological oxygen demand chlorophyll concentration stream gradient silt cover macrophyte cover coarse particular organic matter cover and the presence of wood and gravel however not all variables were measured at all sites and on all occasions and therefore only environmental monitoring data was included when macroinvertebrate abundance data and at least a single environmental variable were monitored simultaneously this resulted in a set of 933 samples fig 1 2 3 bn theory in short bns consist of causal network structures in which nodes representing important system variables are related to each other through arrows representing dependencies charniak 1991 the state of a node is determined by the states of its parent nodes this approach is described by bayes theorem in which prior probabilities are updated given the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution ellison 2004 the type of relation between a node and its parent nodes as well as the associated uncertainty are recorded in a conditional probability table cpt cpts can be based on multiple types of data including expert knowledge process based modelling output literature based values experimental and observational data observational data is preferred but when gaps are present in the dataset other types of evidence may be used to quantify the relationships between the nodes cpt relations that are initially based on expert knowledge can also be trained by using field observations hence bns have the advantage of being able to deal with incomplete datasets and of providing ways to combine different sources of knowledge uusitalo 2007 a bn captures relations between a set of variables which may be uncertain probabilistic or imprecise when the predictions are used in decision making the explicit reporting of the associated uncertainty and the variability in the model results provides an advantage of this approach over deterministic methods that lack this reporting mccann et al 2006 another advantage of bns is that calculations can be made in the two directions of the arrows between the nodes the values of child nodes can be calculated given the values of the parent nodes and vice versa consequently bns can be used to predict the outcome of scenarios given a set of causal variables but also as diagnostic tools to deduce the probabilities of causes given the observed consequences by using the dependencies in the model structure backwards barton et al 2012 mccann et al 2006 2 4 model development a five step model development process was adopted marcot et al 2006 following several guidelines aguilera et al 2011 chen and pollino 2012 landuyt et al 2013 1 model structure an influence diagram was set up showing the causal relations between the environmental variables and the macroinvertebrate based eqr 2 model parametrisation the cpts picturing the relationships between the nodes in the model structure were defined using expert knowledge and model based and literature based relationships in this step also continuous variables were discretized 3 model training the cpts were trained using observations 4 model testing model performance was tested using independent observations 5 model application a final model version for application was trained using all available data model structure step 1 the constructed bn represents a causal network of the environmental factors that influence macroinvertebrate assemblages the chosen outcome variable was the eqr the development of the early stages of the model structure was described in skeffington et al 2014s based on literature and input from stream macroinvertebrate experts the key environmental factors that influence the eqr in this specific water type and region were selected including temperature oxygen concentration flow velocity food quality and substrate variability sandin and johnson 2004 verberk et al 2012 verdonschot et al 1998 these factors score the response to the environmental variables on a scale from 0 1 thus giving the user the opportunity to see which stressor is most limiting for a high eqr the optimal values of these key factors were based on water type and region specific preferences of the reference macroinvertebrate assemblage verdonschot et al 2000 next predictors of those environmental variables that span local to regional spatial scales were included resulting in the model structure depicted in fig 2 the selection of the included variables was made to cover all relevant processes from reach to catchment scale but at the same time aimed to limit model complexity in addition to the environmental variables five nodes were included that represent the average preference score of the observed macroinvertebrate assemblage for the variables flow velocity cpom silt gravel and wood these scores are based on a preference database that lists species specific preferences for environmental variables based on experimental and distribution data verberk et al 2012 and range from 1 low preference to 5 high preference inclusion of these nodes served as an additional source of information about the quality of a water body based on the preferences of the local macroinvertebrate assemblage model parametrisation step 2 initially the relationships between the nodes in the model were based on literature mechanistic modelling outcomes and expert judgement table a 1 when possible a relationship was expressed as an equation discretisation was either based on equal intervals or on equal frequency to assure an even spread of data chen and pollino 2012 the number of discretisation classes for each node was either 4 5 or 6 balancing a minimum resolution to picture environmental processes with sufficient data availability per class training and testing of the network step 3 and 4 step 3 and 4 were combined in a k fold cross validation context marcot 2012 the dataset was split into 3 parts of which 2 parts were used for training the network and 1 part for testing the network performance for a stable validation outcome among trained model variations subsets of data for cross validation can be made using stratified classes although this was not applied here the subsets of data did have a similar distribution of eqr classes model training and testing was done for 3 consecutive runs where in each run another part of the dataset was used for testing the resulting metrics were then averaged for overall model performance cross validation was performed on several model variations to test the influence of differences in structure and parametrisation on the prediction performance i e discretisation method number of discretisation classes and the inclusion exclusion of nodes representing macroinvertebrate preference data table 1 sensitivity analysis of the network was performed to identify the factors that had the strongest influence on the target node it was thought more valuable to compare the model results as a continuous eqr value to observed continuous values as the use of eqr classes would not be informative enough in practice conventional metrics such as the number of correctly classified instances only use the classified output of the model expressed as discrete values and are therefore less suitable for testing the performance of the model in predicting the actual continuous eqr therefore in this study performance was tracked using the correlation between the observed and predicted eqr scores marcot 2012 although the performance might be more strictly assessed than by using class based metrics the eqr scores used were expected values predicted by the target node which is the average of the discretized classes weighted by the probability of occurrence to develop and test the bn model the netica bn software was used as a modelling shell norsys 1998 this software provides a graphical user interface can handle input of continuous data provides ways to perform sensitivity analysis and can work in batch mode to more easily run the model for multiple sites scenario analysis step 5 based on the performance analysis the best performing model variation was selected next this model was trained with all available data marcot 2006 table a 3 and subsequently applied to predict the influence of stream restoration management scenarios on macroinvertebrate based ecological quality to this end sites were relieved from either one or multiple stressors table 2 in which only combinations of scenarios that targeted at least two different key factors were considered a comparison was made between the effect of removing single and multiple stressors per stream or stream stretch 3 results the first steps in developing the model were constructing the network structure and then informing it with literature and expert based knowledge step 1 and 2 in the third step the knowledge informed network was trained using actual monitoring data training the network with monitoring data resulted in adjusted probabilities directly affecting 17 nodes with a maximum change in probabilities of 60 for instance there was a relatively high number of high gradient streams in the dataset consequently the corresponding probabilities were adjusted such that for any new datapoint without observations for stream gradient the model assumed a higher prior probability that it is a high gradient stream this in turn altered the prediction of the status of the target node the ecological quality expressed by the eqr this adjustment is reflected by the larger bar in the top right node of fig 3 b compared to fig 3a in step 4 of the model development the network was tested using a part of the dataset applying a 3 fold cross validation the performance of the tested model variations table 3 was expressed as correlations between the observed and the predicted eqr scores and showed scores up to 0 35 expressing a relatively poor predictive performance the model variation performing best was obtained by incorporating 6 discretisation classes using equal frequency discretisation and including the trait preferences nodes the sensitivity analysis shows the influence of the environmental factors on macroinvertebrate based eqr the target node in decreasing order fig 4 revealing that temperature velocity and cpom had the strongest influence whereas the factors macrophytes stream gradient and total phosphorous concentration had a very limited influence this best performing model variation was subsequently applied to compare the model eqr predictions with the observed eqr per stream fig 5 showing that in half of the cases the eqr was predicted well this concerned mainly streams with a relatively low eqr in contrast in the other half of the streams having a relatively high observed ecological water quality the predicted eqr was lower than the observed eqr in these underpredicted cases either the model judged the environmental variables too severely or the observed eqr was overrepresenting the actual ecological quality as a result of a too optimistic underlying assessment system to gain more insight into these underpredictions the two most deviating cases the zwaanspreng and egelbeek were considered in more detail to this end the average preference score of the macroinvertebrate assemblage was calculated for each sample for the factor flow velocity one of the most influential environmental variables fig 4 and the only factor for which enough preference data was available fig 6 the mean flow velocity preference scores for these samples was relatively high mean preference score 3 6 out of 5 and also the flow velocity was generally high mean 0 31 m s likewise the observed eqr was also high mean 0 81 this points to the model having underpredicted the eqr of these sites based on the factor flow velocity however flow velocity is only one of the factors determining the eqr and therefore also other factors might have contributed to the underestimated eqr however as there is insufficient data available for the actual assemblage preference for the other environmental factors we could not evaluate the contribution of these factors to the underpredictions of the eqr in the scenario analysis step 5 the model was used to predict the effect of relieving the stream from single and multiple stressors on the target node the eqr for all streams combined significant differences in eqr were observed when compared with the current conditions fig 7 a yet for scenarios involving the relief of a single stressor more negative than positive effects were observed in contrast when a combination of stressors was removed the majority of scenarios showed positive effects on the eqr in some of the streams the effects of taking away the stressors could not be predicted not shown which might be due to inconsistencies between the observed and the scenario based variables in the model where nodes receive contradicting input when the scenario effects were considered per individual stream there was a high variation in the results fig a1 nevertheless for half of the streams clear management effects were still observed to illustrate this the hierdense beek and tongerense beek were considered in more detail because these streams showed the clearest effects of stressor relief and had the largest dataset respectively moreover the specificity of the predictions was increased when the samples were grouped in stream stretches that represent a specific waterbody subtype within similar surrounding conditions as can be seen for the upstream stretch of the stream hierdense beek fig 5 for this stretch of the hierdense beek and for the stream tongerense beek several positive effects of management scenarios were observed fig 7b 7c relieving the stream from most single stressors and stressor combinations increased the eqr in contrast scenarios involving an increase in velocity showed negative effects on the eqr except when this measure was combined with increased cpom cover where a strong positive effect was seen especially the combined approaches that increased cpom cover and flow velocity or cpom cover and substrate quality wood and gravel presence had a positive effect on the mean eqr of both streams 4 discussion the aim of our study was to develop and test a bayesian network for simulating macroinvertebrate based ecological water quality based on the responses of stream macroinvertebrates to multiple stressors the model was developed for a specific water type in a single region where multiple stressors affected the stream ecosystem quality although surrounded by substantial margins of uncertainty as seen in fig 7 the bn clearly showed the positive influence of restoration measures on the ecological quality of the studied lowland streams below we will discuss the performance of the bn in the scenario analyses the complexity of predicting the effects of multiple stressors on macroinvertebrate based ecological quality and how this approach can be applied in stream restoration management 4 1 bn model development bns are promising as tools in restoration management as they offer a way to include expert knowledge with associated uncertainties in combination with monitoring data and output from process based modelling in addition the explicit expression of the associated uncertainty and the clear visualisation of the causal model structure are advantages of this technique which make it a suitable tool to support water managers in decision making barton et al 2012 uusitalo 2007 however to be able to train the knowledge informed network using observations for each pair of connected nodes there should be a set of data available that covers the full range of all possible combinations of node states cain 2001 this is a requirement which may be difficult to comply with in practice especially when the focus is on a specific water type in the development of our bn model choices had to be made to deal with the inherent complexity of aquatic ecosystems to this end the main predictors of the macroinvertebrate based eqr were selected however there was a trade off between the desired model complexity and the availability of training data where a lack of data would decrease model performance see also marcot et al 2006 hence to select the optimal model variation multiple model structures and parameterisations were tested in the comparison of these slightly adjusted models equal frequency discretisation gave better predictive performance than discretisation based on predefined class boundaries however compare boets et al 2015 although all discretisation methods imply a simplification of continuous data aguilera et al 2011 using equal frequency discretisation ensures that each class of a node is represented equally in the data which supports a better training of the conditional probabilities in the network also the inclusion of the preference nodes slightly improved the predictions our results showed the impact of restoration measures in the scenario analysis compared to the current situation but the overall absolute performance of the bn model was still limited especially for streams with a high observed ecological quality the eqr was underpredicted by the model this might be partly due to gaps in the dataset consequently it was not possible to train each knowledge based cpt with observed data table a 3 a possible explanation may also be that the model only predicts the effects of changes in environmental factors on macroinvertebrates whereas in reality dispersal and biotic interaction filters also determine the macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and therefore the ecological quality of a specific site poff 1997 in addition the interactions between environmental factors are not completely understood and cannot be fully incorporated moreover the model is static and therefore assumes that the assemblage is in equilibrium with the environmental conditions at each site austin 2002 but this is not always the case belyea and lancaster 1999 wiens 1984 together these complexities which are not well understood could have influenced the performance of the model therefore the current model is not yet thought to be acceptable for application as such given that predictions are not yet in accordance with the observations with a more complete dataset testing of additional model variations and an increased insight in stressor interactions to improve model relations this model type might be further applied as a tool in restoration management 4 2 multiple stressor effects on macroinvertebrate based ecological quality waterbodies are generally subjected to multiple stressors birk 2018 this creates a complex task for water managers who aim to improve the ecological status of stream ecosystems in addition stressor interactions may take place that either enhance the added effects of additional stressors synergism or decrease these combined effects antagonism folt et al 1999 such interactive effects are specific to stressors organisms and environments and consequently are difficult to predict jackson et al 2016 with this added complexity simulating ecological quality remains a complex task as our study showed despite this complexity the present bn scenario analyses showed that ecological quality can be improved when the streams are relieved from specific stressors or combinations thereof whereas other restoration scenarios may prove to be less effective for the studied streams the strongest positive effect resulted from increasing flow velocity in combination with the presence of cpom whereas only improving flow velocity yielded no positive effect this may be explained by the interaction between flow velocity and cpom only increasing stream velocity would not safeguard the variation in flow required for patches of coarse material to persist providing necessary habitat for stream organisms de brouwer et al 2019 to gain more insight in the interaction between flow velocity and cpom cover these key environmental factors could be included in the network in more detail than they are now the added value of combining restoration scenarios was also observed for the scenarios that enhanced the presence of wood and gravel substrate and the cover of cpom in the scenarios where the streams are relieved from the individual stressors already a positive impact is seen but when the stream is relieved from both stressors simultaneously the macroinvertebrate based ecological quality improves even more than expected based on the contributions of the single stressors which could point at a positive synergistic interaction of stressor relief similarly such interactive effects on macroinvertebrates have been observed for other environmental stressors beermann et al 2018 jackson et al 2016 yet for the other combined scenarios in the present study where multiple stressors were adjusted no interactive effects were observed indeed also for other water bodies it was reported that additive effects of multiple stressors prevail gieswein et al 2017 however the current model is partly knowledge informed and not completely based on data this is especially the case for the target node where the relationship picturing the combination of multiple stressors into a combined response was based on expert knowledge to better quantify the interactions between the stressors of interest additional statistical analyses could be carried out on a more extensive dataset feld et al 2016 glendell et al 2019 in addition experiments may help to disentangle the interactive effects of multiple stressors elbrecht et al 2016 verberk et al 2016 only when we have more knowledge about the nature and interactions of stressor response relationships for specific species and complete assemblages can we develop modelling of multiple stressor impacts further in turn the application of models can show us where these knowledge gaps persist and where additional experiments might be needed to better understand underlying processes consequently bns and other approaches are complementary in their contribution to an increase of the understanding of multiple stressor effects apart from the interaction between stressors other studies showed that choosing measures based on identifying multiple stressors covering the entire catchment proved to be more effective dos reis oliveira et al 2020 feld et al 2011 van puijenbroek et al 2019 this illustrates the significance of simultaneously considering multiple stressors over multiple scales for effective stream restoration in conclusion the present model exercise demonstrated that applying different scenarios enhances the understanding of the effects of combinations of measures on macroinvertebrate based ecological quality and may aid in selecting and prioritizing the most promising restoration measures as discussed below 4 3 bns as tools in restoration management nowadays in the practice of stream restoration the selected measures are still strongly based on assumptions rather than proofs of their positive effects on the ecological status of stream ecosystem dos reis oliveira et al 2020 which was the main motivation to perform the present study the application of the current bn model indeed enhanced the insights into the possible effects of management scenarios on the ecological quality as represented by macroinvertebrates hence these model predictions may be used to inform water managers which measures to prioritize in restoration management to effectively alleviate stress this increases the chance that the applied restoration measures do indeed lead to the desired improvement in the ecological status of stream ecosystems whereas we used the bn model to show the relative impact of combinations of restoration measures on macroinvertebrate based ecological quality such models can also be used backwards in a diagnostic approach to find causes for observed symptoms feld et al 2020 trigg et al 2000 ideally a model performing well tailored to the study area would give insight into which environmental factors would produce most effect for the manager the next step would be to identify how these variables might be targeted by linking these to actual restoration measures however this prioritisation is often not just based on the outcome of the model in these scenario analyses the use of site specific knowledge would permit the manager to decide which variables to prioritize for example knowledge of the possibility and cost of certain measures and of restoration efforts and disturbances that have taken place in the past as shown here scenario analyses can be especially informative in situations where multiple stressors are acting in the case of a single dominant stressor a specific measure may be more easily selected but for a situation with a more even contribution of multiple stressors selecting and prioritizing restoration measures may not be straightforward in these cases scenario analyses may help to choose a combination of measures to alleviate the pressure on the ecosystem and to improve the ecological water quality the current model was designed and trained for a single area and water type when applied to other areas the main model structure can still be used as a starting point although the choice for key environmental factors parametrisation of the cpts calibration and validation should be carried out in a way tailored to the water type and region of interest ultimately in the application of bns challenges remain with the abovementioned complexities in addition kaikkonen et al 2021 list the remaining challenges of bns used in environmental management such as models lacking validation unclear discretisation methods and lack of clarity about the source of expert knowledge indeed most bn applications fail to test the predictive ability of the model death et al 2015 as described here discretisation and validation of the model outcomes is not straightforward better reporting of such challenges associated with these technical aspects may therefore improve future robustness of bn applications in addition recent technical developments might further increase the possibilities of bn applications such as the use of hybrid networks that can represent continuous variables without the information loss associated with discretisation kaikkonen et al 2021 the success of applying bns for similar purposes in the future depends on the availability of high quality data and the possibility to include a more fundamental understanding of the complexity of ecosystems with context specific knowledge on how interactions between multiple stressors affect macroinvertebrate assemblages the current approach has contributed to an increased understanding of the complexity of these aquatic ecosystems moreover our study showed how bns can be used in a scenario analysis to select and prioritize the most promising restoration measures 5 conclusions in this study the application of bns for simulating the effects of multiple stressors on macroinvertebrate based ecological water quality was tested although the predictive performance can be further improved our application illustrated how these models can be used to increase our knowledge of how ecosystems respond to multiple stressors to make predictions more robust a deeper understanding of stressor interactions is required also sufficient training data should be available for the water type of interest still bns allow us to make steps in unravelling the contribution of the individual stressors to their combined effect on the ecological quality of water bodies this in turn may aid the selection of appropriate restoration measures that lead to the desired improvements

slow growing and vulnerable microorganisms such as anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria and nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo microorganisms while anammox granules have been widely applied little is known about how to speed up the granulation process of n damo microorganisms which grow even slower than anammox bacteria in this study we used mature anammox granules as biotic carriers to embed n damo microorganisms which obtained combined anammox n damo granules within 6 months the results of whole granule 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing showed the coexistence of anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea the microbial stratification along granule radius was further elucidated by cryosection 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing showing the dominance of n damo archaea and anammox bacteria at inner and outer layers respectively moreover the images of cryosection fluorescence in situ hybridization fish verified this stratification and also indicated a shift in microbial stratification specifically n damo bacteria and n damo archaea attached to the anammox granule surface initially which moved to the inner layer after 4 months operation on the basis of combined anammox n damo granules a practically useful nitrogen removal rate 1 0 kg n m3 d was obtained from sidestream wastewater which provides new avenue to remove nitrogen from

sidestream nitrogen removal cryosection 1 introduction nitrogen removal is a critical function of wastewater treatment plants wwtps which accounts for the majority of carbon and energy consumption

reaction 1 nh4 1 32no2 1 02n2 0 26no3 2 03h2o has attracted extensive attention because of its capability to reduce up to 100 carbon consumption and 60 energy for aeration compared to the nitrogen removal via conventional nitrification and denitrification kartal et al 2010 nevertheless the effluent quality of anammox process usually cannot meet the stringent regulation due to the nitrate accumulation lackner et al 2014 before discharged anammox effluent requires to be polished by supplementing external carbon sources such as acetate and methanol which will offset the savings by using anammox process cao et al 2020 compared with commonly used carbon sources methane is not only cheaper but also in situ available in wwtps which is usually produced in anaerobic digesters meng et al 2020 recently the discovery of nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo processes opened a new avenue to use methane as an alternative carbon source for denitrification ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 two distinct microbial groups are identified to be involved in n damo processes along with the anaerobic methane oxidation a bacterial group within nc10 phylum reaction 2 3ch4 8no2 8h 3co2 4n2 10h2o n damo bacteria is able to reduce nitrite to dinitrogen gas ettwig et al 2010 while an archaeal group belonging to euryarchaeota phylum reaction 3 ch4 4no3 co2 4no2 2h2o n damo archaea is capable of reducing nitrate to nitrite haroon et al 2013 however a bottleneck limiting the application is the slow growth rate of n damo microorganisms generally with doubling times of more than several weeks guerrero cruz et al 2019 lu et al 2019 thus the selection of an appropriate reactor configuration is of great significance in order to sustain sufficient biomass and avoid the washout of biomass to fulfill this criteria biofilm systems have been considered as a preferable configuration for the application of n damo microorganisms due to its ability to separate sludge retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt nerenberg 2016 in particular membrane biofilm reactor mbfr has been employed for enriching n damo microorganisms to remove nitrogen from different types of wastewater e g domestic sewage mainstream liu et al 2020b and anaerobic digestion liquor sidestream liu et al 2020c in mbfr the supplied methane can transfer from gas phase to liquid phase without bubble thus protecting the biofilm attached on the membrane surface and enhance the methane transfer efficiency based on the mass balance calculation more than 90 of methane supplied in mbfr could be utilized by the biofilms while only minor methane was dissipated in the off gas in a very recent study a stable nitrogen removal rate of 1 0 kg m3 d was achieved in an mbfr coupling anammox and n damo microorganisms under oxygen limiting condition 0 1 mg o2 l liu et al 2019b this success indicated the impacts of dissolved oxygen in partial nitritation effluent on anaerobic microorganisms could be alleviated likely because the limited oxygen penetration in the deeper layer of biofilm which should be investigated in the future while showing high level nitrogen removal rate and satisfactory effluent quality the biofilm systems require cautious operation to manage the biofilm thickness and to avoid incidental biofilm detachment granules as a special biofilm aggregate exhibit unique features including rapid settling velocity high loading rate specific microbial stratification and relative insensitivity against inhibitors thus being a favorable platform for the cultivation of slow growing and vulnerable microorganisms adav et al 2008 winkler et al 2018 among all anammox granules okabe et al 2011 tang et al 2011 winkler et al 2012 and aerobic granular sludge ags arrojo et al 2004 cheng et al 2020 franca et al 2018 morgenroth et al 1997 are two state of art technologies attracting extensive research attention compared with biofilm based systems less capital cost is expected as the granules do not require carriers to attach on moreover the mature granules can be easily collected stored and used to inoculate new reactors however the study of n damo granules is still in infancy while it took more than 1 year to obtain n damo granules from suspended flocs by fan et al 2019 fu et al 2019 also obtained small n damo granules 200 μm in a sequence batch reactor sbr thus the approaches about how to shorten this granulation period require more investigation rather than using n damo flocs as inoculum we hypothesize that using mature anammox granules as biotic carriers to couple n damo microorganisms can shorten the period of the formation of n damo granules with expectation that suspended flocs can attach to the surface of mature granules to prove this hypothesis suspended biomass consisting of n damo microorganisms were inoculated in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb with mature anammox granules while the overall microbial community at steady state was revealed by the whole granule 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the microbial stratification inside granules was elucidated by cryosection 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and cryosection fluorescence in situ hybridization fish meanwhile the characteristics i e sludge volume index svi size distribution and sludge specific density of obtained granules were determined and the feasibility to achieve efficient nitrogen removal was examined these findings not only provide an alternative to obtain n damo granules rapidly but also offer a new option to remove nitrogen from wastewater by using methane as carbon source 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment set up a lab scale uasb with 2 l working volume and 1 l three phases separator was established fig 1 to provide sufficient upflow rate 0 5 4 5 m h the bulk liquid was recirculated from the reactor top to the bottom by a peristaltic pump longer pump china the feed to the reactor was deoxygenated and stored in a 10 l drum which was connected to a 10 l gas bag filled with nitrogen gas this was to ensure the strictly anaerobic condition of uasb a bunch of hollow fiber membrane 200 μm of inner diameter and 300 μm of outer diameter mitsubishi japan which was used in mbfr to provide methane efficiently was implemented in the settling area above the three phases separator of uasb the membrane module was connected to a compressed methane cylinder 95 ch4 5 co2 with inner pressured maintained at 1 5 atm similar to mbfr the methane supplied from membrane lumen could transfer from gas phase to liquid phase through pure diffusion without bubble developed leading to very less methane dissipation the ph was monitored by a meter oakton australia and maintained at 7 0 0 2 through dosing 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh manually the temperature was controlled at 30 0 5 c by an immersion heater circulator th8000 ratek australia 2 2 operational strategies initially the uasb was inoculated with 1000 ml anammox granules 20 g vss l from a pilot scale anammox reactor brisbane australia following the inoculation the reactor was fed with synthetic and partially nitrified anaerobic digestion liquor containing ammonium 500 mg n l and nitrite 550 mg n l in phase i day 1 99 as there was no methane or other organic carbon supplied only anammox reaction was activated in this period the hrt was decreased from 2 0 to 1 0 d on day 29 following the enhanced nitrogen removal performance at the beginning of phase ii day 100 144 300 ml of suspended flocs 2 g vss l taken from a parent reactor comprising n damo microorganisms hu et al 2009 were further inoculated into the uasb to avoid the biomass washout only stock solutions of ammonium chloride 46 g nh4 n l 1 and sodium nitrate 46 g no3 n

with no biomass observed in the settling area above three phases separator indicating all the suspended flocs have been attached on the anammox granules from day 145 the continuous feeding of synthetic wastewater 500 mg nh4 n l 550 mg no2 n l was restarted to avoid potential inhibition from a shock loading the initial nitrogen loading rate was set at a low level 0 28 kg n m3 d according to the microbial activity at the end of phase ii gradually the hrt was decreased from 3 7 to 1 0 d during the entire course of the experiment effluent samples were taken 2 to 3 times per week to monitor

carrier gas the biological nitrogen conversion rates facilitated by the anammox and n damo reactions reactions 1 3 were determined from the measured ammonium nitrite and nitrate consumption rates

the cryosection 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was conducted following the protocols proposed by lu et al 2013 about 100 ml fresh granules were collected from uasb firstly the collected granules were gently washed over a 500 μm mesh sieve to remove the small fines while the retained granules were then transferred into a column reactor 1 l in total filled with 500 ml deoxygenated milliq water a cylindrical stirrer bar 20 mm 5 mm was placed at the bottom of reactor to generate shearing force at 800 rpm in the first 2 h and at 500 rpm in 3 12 h samples were sieved through a 200 μm mesh sieve

visually show the existence of anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea which was not designed for quantitatively estimating their relative abundances 3 results 3 1 from anammox granules to combined anammox n damo granules the uasb was established and operated for 271 days during the entire experiment involving three phases table 1 in phase i mature anammox granules were obtained without any methane supplied following the increased activity of anammox bacteria the hrt was decreased from 2 0 to 1 0 d on day 29 fig 2 a the tn concentration in effluent was 173 2 25 3 mg n l including residual ammonium of 96 7 18 3 mg n l and residual nitrate of 75 1 18 8 mg n l fig 2a meanwhile the nitrite concentration in effluent was consistently below 1 0 mg n l correspondingly the ratio of nitrite removed to ammonium removed was 1 36 0 06 which agreed with the stoichiometry of anammox reaction theoretical ratio of 1 32 according to reaction 1 overall the tn removal efficiency was 83 5 2 4 fig 2b which was at the same level to other anammox systems christensson et al 2013 meng et al 2015 vlaeminck et al 2009 upon the inoculation of n damo microorganisms on day 100 methane was supplied through the hollow fiber membrane and stock solutions were manually added to provide ammonium and nitrate phase ii as shown in fig 2c the ammonium and nitrate concentration gradually decreased after each addition of stock solutions while the nitrite concentration was below 1 0 mg n l constantly this phenomenon indicated that the activity of n damo archaea reducing nitrate to nitrite was the limited step meanwhile the bulk liquid gradually became clear with most of the inoculated n damo biomass attached to the granule surface following this observation the activity of n damo archaea also increased from 9 0 mg n l d day 100 104 to 34 0 mg n l d day 142 144 fig 2d on day 145 the synthetic sidestream wastewater was fed into the system continuously at an initial hrt of 3 7 d phase iii which was determined according to the nitrate removal rate at the end of phase ii while the nitrite and nitrate concentrations were both below 1 0 mg n l the ammonium concentration in effluent elevated to 23 2 mg n l on day 146 temporarily and then dropped to 2 1 mg n l on day 158 fig 2a to further increase the nitrogen loading rate the hrt was decreased to 2 8 d on day 159 similarly the nitrite and nitrate concentrations remained to be below 1 0 mg n l while the ammonium concentration increased to 18 2 mg n l on day 160 and then decreased to 1 6 mg n l on day 170 similar phenomenon was also observed when the hrt was decreased to 2 2 d on day 175 however when the hrt was further decreased to 2 0 d on day 187 not only the ammonium but also the nitrate started to be accumulated the average nitrate concentration at hrt of 2 0 d was 5 8 mg n l day 187 198 which increased to 11 1 mg n l at hrt of 1 8 d day 199 205 and to 24 7 mg n l at hrt of 1 6 d day 206 216 at the final hrt of 1 0 d the nitrate in effluent was at average of 26 6 mg n l compared with phase i without the methane supply the tn removal efficiency significantly increased from 83 5 2 4 to 94 8 2 4 p 0 01 fig 2b with the stepwise decrease of hrt from 3 7 to 1 0 d the tn removal rate increased from 0 3 to 1 0 kg n m3 d in phase iii according to the three microbial reactions individual contribution by each of the three key reactions was calculated si and presented in fig 2b firstly the activity of anammox bacteria was nearly an order of magnitude higher than n damo bacteria and n damo archaea indicating anammox contributed to the majority of nitrogen removed in this granule based system moreover the nitrite removal rate by anammox bacteria ran stepwise increased following the decreasing hrt showing a high capacity to remove nitrogen by this granular system in contrast there was no obvious trend for the nitrite removal rate by n damo bacteria rdb which fluctuated at a low level with average value of only 11 5 mg n l d compared with the average ran at hrt of 1 0 d 629 3 mg n l d n damo bacteria only contributed to about 2 0 nitrite removal indicating that anammox bacteria outcompeted n damo bacteria in the competition for nitrite which agreed with their different kinetics i e nitrite affinity constant for n damo bacteria of 0 1 mg n l nitrite affinity constant for anammox bacteria of 0 05 mg n l liu et al 2020a additionally although the nitrate concentration in effluent accumulated gradually fig 2a the increase of nitrate removal rate by n damo archaea rda adhered to the decrease of hrt closely specifically the rda significantly increased from 34 0 mg n l d hrt of 3 7 d to 97 3 mg n l d hrt of 1 0 d p 0 01 indicating the enhanced n damo archaeal activity 3 2 characteristics of granular sludges the granules in bright red color could be visually observed at the bottom of uasb fig 3 while suspended biomass was hardly detected in the bulk liquid above three phases separator mlvss 0 01 g l indicating the good separation between sludge and liquid the characteristics of anammox granules sampled at the end of phase i and combined anammox n damo granules sampled at the end of phase iii were summarized in table 2 the mlvss increased from 13 1 0 5 to 15 6 0 6 g l after more than 170 days operation the ratio of mlvss to mlss was in the range of 0 7 0 8 which was at the same level to the other granules arrojo et al 2006 arrojo et al 2004 tang et al 2011 yu et al 2019 the median diameter of granules at the end of phase i and phase iii was 0 7 0 2 and 0 7 0 1 mm respectively with no significant change in size distribution p 0 05 at the end of experiment the percentage of granules coupling anammox and n damo microorganisms with diameter larger than 0 6 mm were above 80 regarding the settling ability of combined anammox n damo granules the svi5 and svi30 were determined to be 32 2 and 27 4 ml g respectively moreover the ratio of svi5 to svi30 ranged in 1 10 1 23 indicating a good settling ability in addition the sludge specific density of anammox n damo granules was determined to be 96 4 g vss l granules which was in accordance with other types of granules e g anammox granules 91 120 g vss l granules aerobic granules 40 70 g vss l granules anaerobic granules 128 136 g vss l granules beun et al 2002 franco et al 2006 tang et al 2011 3 3 microbial community of granular sludge to elucidate the microbial community high throughput 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was conducted for the whole granule firstly fig 4 a fig s1 and fig s2 which revealed that the dominant phyla in phase iii were chloroflexi 25 3 patescibacteria 20 8 proteobacteria 13 6 euryarchaeota 9 9 planctomycetes 9 1 actinobacteriota 6 0 armatimonadetes 4 3 bacteroidota 3 1 firmicutes 2 1 acidobacteriota 2 0 and nc10 1 3 fig s1 both n damo archaea and n damo bacteria were found in the granules the candidatus methanoperedens 9 9 identified in the obtained granules was affiliated to the euryarchaeota phylum which is recognized as the nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation archaea haroon et al 2013 all the sequences detected in the nc10 phylum fell within the genus of candidatus methylomirabilis with 1 3 relative abundance with known ability to couple nitrite reduction with anaerobic methane oxidation ettwig et al 2010 furthermore the candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia belonging to the planctomycetes phylum which are well known anammox bacteria jetten et al 2009 were detected with relative abundance of 1 7 and 0 6 respectively notably it has been shown that the correlation between microbial abundance and activity can be weak ishii et al 2013 speth et al 2016 stewart et al 2012 therefore it is difficult to link the activity of functional microorganisms anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea to their abundances based on the information available in addition to these microbial populations with known functions there were other microorganisms detected with high abundance such as candidatus roizmanbacteria 16 4 chloroflexi sbr1031 6 6 anaerolineaceae uncultured 4 7 and sm1a02 4 7 as methane was the only carbon source supplied these unidentified microorganisms more likely depended on the organic carbon released by cell lysis or extracellular polymeric substance eps amino acids excreted by the others lawson et al 2017a speth et al 2016 for example candidatus roizmanbacteria is archived in a superphylum candidate parcubacteria which lacks cultured representatives in a recent study 12 single amplified genomes within this group were analyzed to show the capability for polysaccharide uptake and respiratory nitrate reduction león zayas et al 2017 the microorganisms belonging to chloroflexi phylum and anaerolineaceae family were detected as flanking partners in n damo hu et al 2015 lu et al 2016 and anammox cultures kindaichi et al 2012 lawson et al 2017b the microorganisms within these groups were inferred to use organic carbon from cell lysis for their growth cao et al 2016 kindaichi et al 2012 and they may play roles in the granulation process gao et al 2011 similarly the detection of sm1a02 in granules was also observed in other n damo lou et al 2019 and anammox cultures akaboci et al 2018 cao et al 2016 but their functions are still unknown which should be further explored further the microbial stratification along the granule radius was studied by shearing the granules into 7 layers with microbial community of each layer elucidated by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fig 4b the pca scatter plot presented a clear separation between the inner layers layers 1 6 and the outer layer layer 7 fig 4c illustrating that the microbial community was different from the granule surface to the granule inner layers furthermore the heat map fig 4d displaying the distributions of the n damo archaea n damo bacteria and anammox bacteria in the different layers layer 1 to layer 7 confirmed the dominance of anammox bacteria and n damo archaea at outer layer and inner layer respectively meanwhile n damo bacteria were only detected at inner layer layers 1 6 which were outcompeted by anammox bacteria at granule surface cryosection fish were conducted to further verify the distribution of three key microbial populations fig 4e and f after mixing the n damo flocs with mature anammox granules n damo bacteria and n damo archaea successfully adhered to the surface of anammox granules which were clustered together fig 4e after approximate 4 months enrichment fig 4f the majority of n damo microorganisms moved to the inner side of granules and were coated by anammox bacteria at the outer layer while a minor fraction could still be observed at the granule surface growing closely to anammox bacteria such a unique microbial stratification observed by fish was consistent with the results of cryosection 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fig 4b this phenomenon could be associated with the kinetics of these microorganisms and substrate bioavailability specifically n damo archaea might not grow at the granule surface because no nitrate was provided from the liquid additionally anammox bacteria with a higher nitrite affinity 0 05 mg n l hao et al 2002 would likely dominate over n damo bacteria with a lower nitrite affinity 0 1 mg n l liu et al 2020a in the competition for nitrite at the granule surface secondly the growth rates of n damo microorganisms are very slow with doubling time of more than weeks guerrero cruz et al 2019 lu et al 2019 therefore the granule surface with higher shear force is not favorable for the growth of such slow growing microorganisms while the inner layer of granule will protect them from being washed out 4 discussion 4 1 comparison among n damo flocs biofilms and granules it has been more than a decade since the first enrichment of n damo microorganisms in 2006 raghoebarsing et al 2006 in the first ten years researchers mainly focused on elucidating the metabolic pathway of these new microbial populations ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 luesken et al 2012 and the detection of their existence in natural and engineered systems deutzmann et al 2014 hu et al 2014 luesken et al 2011 wang et al 2012 in the very recent five years more and more studies started to employ n damo process in wastewater and groundwater treatment lai et al 2018 martínez quintela et al 2020 nie et al 2020 silva teira et al 2017 due to their unique characteristics to use methane as electron donor to reduce nitrite nitrate n damo process has been considered as an alternative to remove nitrogen and also to mitigate the dissolved methane emission liu et al 2019a as summarized in table 3 n damo microorganisms have been enriched in different biomass types such as flocs biofilms and granules notably the initial enrichment usually started from flocs which were easier to be operated bhattacharjee et al 2016 ding et al 2016 raghoebarsing et al 2006 zhu et al 2012 however the suspended flocs have a considerable disadvantage for practical application which is the poor settling ability according to our measurement on the flocs of n damo microorganisms used in this study haroon et al 2013 the svi30 was above 200 ml g indicating a poor settling performance thus the suspended flocs could be easily washed out along with the effluent resulting in difficulties to retain sufficient biomass inside bioreactor in order to avoid the biomass loss the reactors with suspended biomass have to be operated in batch mode with a significantly long srt e g above 300 days in haroon et al 2013 nonetheless the mlvss of these systems was still very low 0 5 1 5 mg l leading to a limited nitrogen removal rate consequently suspended flocs are not suitable for real applications of n damo process among the recent applications of n damo microorganisms biofilm system is a popular configuration chen et al 2016 ding et al 2017 liu et al 2020a xie et al 2018 up to date the demonstration of n damo process in biofilm systems has been achieved in various wastewater streams such as domestic sewage mainstream liu et al 2020b and anaerobic digestion liquor sidestream liu et al 2020c with biofilms completely attached to the membrane no biomass will be washed out in effluent theoretically due to the sufficient biomass sustained a practically useful nitrogen removal rate was achieved up to 1 kg n m3 d which is one of the major benefits of biofilm systems compared with suspended flocs however the microbial activity highly depends on the biofilm thickness while the thin biofilm results in poor nitrogen removal due to insufficient biomass the mass transfer will be limited in the excessively thick biofilm martin and nerenberg 2012 indeed the management of biofilm thickness is critical for stable mbfr operation in practice a suitable biofilm thickness requires cautious operation such as increasing shear gas sparging celmer et al 2008 semmens et al 2003 and adding chemicals e g surfactants splendiani et al 2006 moreover the hollow fiber membrane in mbfr is used not only to support biofilm development as carrier but also to deliver methane when a leaking happens to an aged fiber after a long term operation the biofilms need to be teared off before replaced with a new fiber this replacement will likely damage the reactor performance and will also take extra time for the biofilm reattachment compared with flocs the granular system has a much higher settling capability with svi30 of only 23 5 ml g therefore the majority of biomass could be sustained in the reactor leading to a high mlvss concentration of 15 6 0 6 g l at the steady state while the nitrogen removal rate obtained here was at the same level of biofilms table 3 there are a few unique advantages of granular sludge firstly the capital cost of granular systems is lower because no plastic carriers is required secondly granular sludge is easier to be collected stored and used to inoculate new reactors thirdly the replacement of hollow fibers is easier in the present uasb because the hollow fibers in uasb were only used to deliver methane with no biomass attached they can be replaced easily without concerning the impact to the overall performance based on these benefits a high level nitrogen removal from high strength wastewater was demonstrated achieving a tn removal rate of 1 0 kg n m3 d and a tn removal efficiency of 94 8 this rate achieved is practically useful for the nitrogen removal in high strength wastewater lackner et al 2014 4 2 two keys for the rapid formation of n damo granules in the present study a novel uasb based technology is developed to rapidly couple n damo microorganisms to anammox granules the achievement of n damo granules has been demonstrated in previous studies for example fan et al 2019 obtained n damo granules from n damo flocs in more than 1 year and fu et al 2019 studied the impacts of methane transfer in small n damo granules 200 μm compared to these previous studies the present study proposes a new method for the rapid development of large anammox n damo granules 700 μm in 6 months there are two keys for this quick achievement firstly the mature anammox granules were used as biotic carriers to support n damo microorganisms attaching on the granule surface generally the formation of granule biofilm includes three steps i e attachment microcolony formation and maturation van wolferen et al 2018 the eps is of significance for this process of sludge aggregation which can cluster free living cells together hou et al 2015 orell et al 2013 while anammox bacteria are known to produce more eps than other microorganisms chen et al 2013 hou et al 2015 such as activated sludge and denitrifying sludge the knowledge of eps production by archaea is very limited the long granulation process 1 year of n damo microorganisms in previous study was likely due to the insufficient eps generated from n damo microorganisms fan et al 2019 in this study we used mature anammox granules as biotic carriers which have already possessed sufficient eps on the granule surface once the suspended flocs of n damo microorganisms were inoculated they could attach to the anammox granule surface with the help of existed eps thus being embedded in the granules easily evidenced by the observation that the liquid became clear in 5 6 weeks of phase ii the flocs of n damo microorganisms immobilized on the biotic carriers anammox granules in a relatively short time similar mechanism was proposed in a anammox granule reactor which showed the enlargement of anammox granules by the aggregation of other anammox micro granules flocs wang et al 2020 once the microcolonies of n damo microorganisms were formed on the granule surface the second key is to avoid the dispersion of these new immigrants specifically a high shear force can lead to the detachment of n damo microorganisms from the surface of these new combined granules thus it is important to provide a moderate condition to allow them growing and becoming part of granules eventually van wolferen et al 2018 in this study we used the strategy by gradually increasing the shear force in terms of upflow velocity in phase iii with continuous feeding the upflow velocity was elevated from 0 5 to 4 5 m h stepwise following the gradually enhanced microbial activities fig 2b after another 4 months operation the new immigrants n damo bacteria and n damo archaea moved to the granule inner layer fig 4d indicating the maturation of combined anammox and n damo granules 5 conclusions in this study a lab scale uasb integrating the anammox and n damo microorganisms in granules was developed which demonstrated a high level nitrogen from synthetic high strength wastewater the major conclusions and outcomes are the formation of granules coupling anammox and n damo microorganisms was achieved in 6 months using mature anammox granules as biotic carriers and stepwise increasing the upflow velocity were two keys to obtain combined anammox n damo granules rapidly a practically useful nitrogen removal rate 1 0 kg n m 3 d 1 was obtained the microbial stratification along granule radius was elucidated showing the dominance of anammox bacteria and n damo archaea at outer layer and inner layer respectively compared with flocs the good settleability of combined anammox n damo granules is the key to achieve a high level nitrogen removal

17151,granular sludge exhibits unique features including rapid settling velocity high loading rate and relative insensitivity against inhibitors thus being a favorable platform for the cultivation of slow growing and vulnerable microorganisms such as anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria and nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo microorganisms while anammox granules have been widely applied little is known about how to speed up the granulation process of n damo microorganisms which grow even slower than anammox bacteria in this study we used mature anammox granules as biotic carriers to embed n damo microorganisms which obtained combined anammox n damo granules within 6 months the results of whole granule 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing showed the coexistence of anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea the microbial stratification along granule radius was further elucidated by cryosection 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing showing the dominance of n damo archaea and anammox bacteria at inner and outer layers respectively moreover the images of cryosection fluorescence in situ hybridization fish verified this stratification and also indicated a shift in microbial stratification specifically n damo bacteria and n damo archaea attached to the anammox granule surface initially which moved to the inner layer after 4 months operation on the basis of combined anammox n damo granules a practically useful nitrogen removal rate 1 0 kg n m3 d was obtained from sidestream wastewater which provides new avenue to remove nitrogen from wastewater using methane as carbon source graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo anaerobic methane oxidation granule sidestream nitrogen removal cryosection 1 introduction nitrogen removal is a critical function of wastewater treatment plants wwtps which accounts for the majority of carbon and energy consumption mccarty 2018 compared with aerobic process anaerobic treatments possess a significant potential to drive wwtps from energy consumer to energy producer among all anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox reaction 1 nh4 1 32no2 1 02n2 0 26no3 2 03h2o has attracted extensive attention because of its capability to reduce up to 100 carbon consumption and 60 energy for aeration compared to the nitrogen removal via conventional nitrification and denitrification kartal et al 2010 nevertheless the effluent quality of anammox process usually cannot meet the stringent regulation due to the nitrate accumulation lackner et al 2014 before discharged anammox effluent requires to be polished by supplementing external carbon sources such as acetate and methanol which will offset the savings by using anammox process cao et al 2020 compared with commonly used carbon sources methane is not only cheaper but also in situ available in wwtps which is usually produced in anaerobic digesters meng et al 2020 recently the discovery of nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo processes opened a new avenue to use methane as an alternative carbon source for denitrification ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 two distinct microbial groups are identified to be involved in n damo processes along with the anaerobic methane oxidation a bacterial group within nc10 phylum reaction 2 3ch4 8no2 8h 3co2 4n2 10h2o n damo bacteria is able to reduce nitrite to dinitrogen gas ettwig et al 2010 while an archaeal group belonging to euryarchaeota phylum reaction 3 ch4 4no3 co2 4no2 2h2o n damo archaea is capable of reducing nitrate to nitrite haroon et al 2013 however a bottleneck limiting the application is the slow growth rate of n damo microorganisms generally with doubling times of more than several weeks guerrero cruz et al 2019 lu et al 2019 thus the selection of an appropriate reactor configuration is of great significance in order to sustain sufficient biomass and avoid the washout of biomass to fulfill this criteria biofilm systems have been considered as a preferable configuration for the application of n damo microorganisms due to its ability to separate sludge retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt nerenberg 2016 in particular membrane biofilm reactor mbfr has been employed for enriching n damo microorganisms to remove nitrogen from different types of wastewater e g domestic sewage mainstream liu et al 2020b and anaerobic digestion liquor sidestream liu et al 2020c in mbfr the supplied methane can transfer from gas phase to liquid phase without bubble thus protecting the biofilm attached on the membrane surface and enhance the methane transfer efficiency based on the mass balance calculation more than 90 of methane supplied in mbfr could be utilized by the biofilms while only minor methane was dissipated in the off gas in a very recent study a stable nitrogen removal rate of 1 0 kg m3 d was achieved in an mbfr coupling anammox and n damo microorganisms under oxygen limiting condition 0 1 mg o2 l liu et al 2019b this success indicated the impacts of dissolved oxygen in partial nitritation effluent on anaerobic microorganisms could be alleviated likely because the limited oxygen penetration in the deeper layer of biofilm which should be investigated in the future while showing high level nitrogen removal rate and satisfactory effluent quality the biofilm systems require cautious operation to manage the biofilm thickness and to avoid incidental biofilm detachment granules as a special biofilm aggregate exhibit unique features including rapid settling velocity high loading rate specific microbial stratification and relative insensitivity against inhibitors thus being a favorable platform for the cultivation of slow growing and vulnerable microorganisms adav et al 2008 winkler et al 2018 among all anammox granules okabe et al 2011 tang et al 2011 winkler et al 2012 and aerobic granular sludge ags arrojo et al 2004 cheng et al 2020 franca et al 2018 morgenroth et al 1997 are two state of art technologies attracting extensive research attention compared with biofilm based systems less capital cost is expected as the granules do not require carriers to attach on moreover the mature granules can be easily collected stored and used to inoculate new reactors however the study of n damo granules is still in infancy while it took more than 1 year to obtain n damo granules from suspended flocs by fan et al 2019 fu et al 2019 also obtained small n damo granules 200 μm in a sequence batch reactor sbr thus the approaches about how to shorten this granulation period require more investigation rather than using n damo flocs as inoculum we hypothesize that using mature anammox granules as biotic carriers to couple n damo microorganisms can shorten the period of the formation of n damo granules with expectation that suspended flocs can attach to the surface of mature granules to prove this hypothesis suspended biomass consisting of n damo microorganisms were inoculated in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb with mature anammox granules while the overall microbial community at steady state was revealed by the whole granule 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the microbial stratification inside granules was elucidated by cryosection 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and cryosection fluorescence in situ hybridization fish meanwhile the characteristics i e sludge volume index svi size distribution and sludge specific density of obtained granules were determined and the feasibility to achieve efficient nitrogen removal was examined these findings not only provide an alternative to obtain n damo granules rapidly but also offer a new option to remove nitrogen from wastewater by using methane as carbon source 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment set up a lab scale uasb with 2 l working volume and 1 l three phases separator was established fig 1 to provide sufficient upflow rate 0 5 4 5 m h the bulk liquid was recirculated from the reactor top to the bottom by a peristaltic pump longer pump china the feed to the reactor was deoxygenated and stored in a 10 l drum which was connected to a 10 l gas bag filled with nitrogen gas this was to ensure the strictly anaerobic condition of uasb a bunch of hollow fiber membrane 200 μm of inner diameter and 300 μm of outer diameter mitsubishi japan which was used in mbfr to provide methane efficiently was implemented in the settling area above the three phases separator of uasb the membrane module was connected to a compressed methane cylinder 95 ch4 5 co2 with inner pressured maintained at 1 5 atm similar to mbfr the methane supplied from membrane lumen could transfer from gas phase to liquid phase through pure diffusion without bubble developed leading to very less methane dissipation the ph was monitored by a meter oakton australia and maintained at 7 0 0 2 through dosing 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh manually the temperature was controlled at 30 0 5 c by an immersion heater circulator th8000 ratek australia 2 2 operational strategies initially the uasb was inoculated with 1000 ml anammox granules 20 g vss l from a pilot scale anammox reactor brisbane australia following the inoculation the reactor was fed with synthetic and partially nitrified anaerobic digestion liquor containing ammonium 500 mg n l and nitrite 550 mg n l in phase i day 1 99 as there was no methane or other organic carbon supplied only anammox reaction was activated in this period the hrt was decreased from 2 0 to 1 0 d on day 29 following the enhanced nitrogen removal performance at the beginning of phase ii day 100 144 300 ml of suspended flocs 2 g vss l taken from a parent reactor comprising n damo microorganisms hu et al 2009 were further inoculated into the uasb to avoid the biomass washout only stock solutions of ammonium chloride 46 g nh4 n l 1 and sodium nitrate 46 g no3 n l 1 were periodically dosed into the reactor to maintain the concentrations of ammonium and nitrate in the range of 0 80 mg n l instead of the continuous feeding gradually the bulk liquid became clear with no biomass observed in the settling area above three phases separator indicating all the suspended flocs have been attached on the anammox granules from day 145 the continuous feeding of synthetic wastewater 500 mg nh4 n l 550 mg no2 n l was restarted to avoid potential inhibition from a shock loading the initial nitrogen loading rate was set at a low level 0 28 kg n m3 d according to the microbial activity at the end of phase ii gradually the hrt was decreased from 3 7 to 1 0 d during the entire course of the experiment effluent samples were taken 2 to 3 times per week to monitor the nh4 no2 and no3 concentrations 2 3 analytical methods the determination of 5 min and 30 min sludge volume indices svi5 and svi30 mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentrations were carried out following the standard method apha 2005 the sludge specific density was measured according to beun et al 2002 the particle size distribution of granules was measured using a particle size analyzer malvern mastersizer 2000 uk liquid samples were taken from the overflow bottle with 1 5 ml syringes and filtered immediately through 0 22 μm disposable sterile millipore filters merck the concentrations of no2 n no3 n and nh4 n were assayed with a lachat quickchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wi for the gas measurements gas samples of 0 1 ml were taken weekly from the headspace of the overflow bottle to measure the concentration of methane through a gas chromatograph agilent gc7890a using argon as the carrier gas the biological nitrogen conversion rates facilitated by the anammox and n damo reactions reactions 1 3 were determined from the measured ammonium nitrite and nitrate consumption rates

wiki ecogenomic org doku php id amplicon pipeline readme including quality control and taxonomy assignment a final table summarizing the operational taxonomic units otu was generated from the pipeline the cryosection 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was conducted following the protocols proposed by lu et al 2013 about 100 ml fresh granules were collected from uasb firstly the collected granules were gently washed over a 500 μm mesh sieve to remove the small fines while the retained granules were then transferred into a column reactor 1 l in total filled with 500 ml deoxygenated milliq water a cylindrical stirrer bar 20 mm 5 mm was placed at the bottom of reactor to generate shearing force at 800 rpm in the first 2 h and at 500 rpm in 3 12 h samples were sieved through a 200 μm mesh sieve every 2 h the obtained fines were centrifuged for dna extraction and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing as described above while the size of retained granules above the sieve was measured using an electronic microscope zeiss imager a1 australia afterwards these remaining granules were transferred back to the column reactor for further shearing after the last sieving at 12 h both the fines and the remaining granules were centrifuged respectively for 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing therefore there were 7 samples obtained in total representing the microorganisms at different depth of

rrna gene amplicon sequencing were deposited at the ncbi short read archive under the project number prjna667202 2 5 cryosection fish cryosection fish was conducted to show the microbial stratification along the granule radius briefly the fresh granules were fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde pfa overnight firstly which was then transferred into a vial filled with optimal cutting temperature oct solution sakura finetek tokoyo japan for 12 h afterward 10 15 granules were placed at the bottom of a square mold and frozen immediately using dry ice the specimen was sliced on a hyrax c60 cryostat machine zeiss oberkochen germany with a knife temperature of 18 c and the specimen temperature of 20 c to obtain a 10 μm slice on poly l lysine coated slide polysciences gymea australia the slides were store at 20 c for fish experiments the fish was conducted following the protocols described in ettwig et al 2008 in details the slides were air dried for 12 h and dehydrated for 3 min each in ethanol solutions 50 80 and 98 successively afterwards the prepared slides were hybridized for fish with designed oligonucleotide probes using 40 formamide at 46 c for 2 h the probes were designed previously s amx 820 a a 18 5 aaaacccctctacttagtgccc 3 for anammox bacteria s nc10 1162 a a 18 5 gccttcctccagcttgacgctg 3 for nc10 bacteria s darc 872 a a 18 5 ggctccacccgttgtagt 3 for damo archaea labelled cells were visualized on an lsm512 confocal laser scanning microscope carl zeiss with ar ion laser 488 nm and two hene lasers 543 and 633 nm the fish experiment was only to visually show the existence of anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea which was not designed for quantitatively estimating their relative abundances 3 results 3 1 from anammox granules to combined anammox n damo granules the uasb was established and operated for 271 days during the entire experiment involving three phases table 1 in phase i mature anammox granules were obtained without any methane supplied following the increased activity of anammox bacteria the hrt was decreased from 2 0 to 1 0 d on day 29 fig 2 a the tn concentration in effluent was 173 2 25 3 mg n l including residual ammonium of 96 7 18 3 mg n l and residual nitrate of 75 1 18 8 mg n l fig 2a meanwhile the nitrite concentration in effluent was consistently below 1 0 mg n l correspondingly the ratio of nitrite removed to ammonium removed was 1 36 0 06 which agreed with the stoichiometry of anammox reaction theoretical ratio of 1 32 according to reaction 1 overall the tn removal efficiency was 83 5 2 4 fig 2b which was at the same level to other anammox systems christensson et al 2013 meng et al 2015 vlaeminck et al 2009 upon the inoculation of n damo microorganisms on day 100 methane was supplied through the hollow fiber membrane and stock solutions were manually added to provide ammonium and nitrate phase ii as shown in fig 2c the ammonium and nitrate concentration gradually decreased after each addition of stock solutions while the nitrite concentration was below 1 0 mg n l constantly this phenomenon indicated that the activity of n damo archaea reducing nitrate to nitrite was the limited step meanwhile the bulk liquid gradually became clear with most of the inoculated n damo biomass attached to the granule surface following this observation the activity of n damo archaea also increased from 9 0 mg n l d day 100 104 to 34 0 mg n l d day 142 144 fig 2d on day 145 the synthetic sidestream wastewater was fed into the system continuously at an initial hrt of 3 7 d phase iii which was determined according to the nitrate removal rate at the end of phase ii while the nitrite and nitrate concentrations were both below 1 0 mg n l the ammonium concentration in effluent elevated to 23 2 mg n l on day 146 temporarily and then dropped to 2 1 mg n l on day 158 fig 2a to further increase the nitrogen loading rate the hrt was decreased to 2 8 d on day 159 similarly the nitrite and nitrate concentrations remained to be below 1 0 mg n l while the ammonium concentration increased to 18 2 mg n l on day 160 and then decreased to 1 6 mg n l on day 170 similar phenomenon was also observed when the hrt was decreased to 2 2 d on day 175 however when the hrt was further decreased to 2 0 d on day 187 not only the ammonium but also the nitrate started to be accumulated the average nitrate concentration at hrt of 2 0 d was 5 8 mg n l day 187 198 which increased to 11 1 mg n l at hrt of 1 8 d day 199 205 and to 24 7 mg n l at hrt of 1 6 d day 206 216 at the final hrt of 1 0 d the nitrate in effluent was at average of 26 6 mg n l compared with phase i without the methane supply the tn removal efficiency significantly increased from 83 5 2 4 to 94 8 2 4 p 0 01 fig 2b with the stepwise decrease of hrt from 3 7 to 1 0 d the tn removal rate increased from 0 3 to 1 0 kg n m3 d in phase iii according to the three microbial reactions individual contribution by each of the three key reactions was calculated si and presented in fig 2b firstly the activity of anammox bacteria was nearly an order of magnitude higher than n damo bacteria and n damo archaea indicating anammox contributed to the majority of nitrogen removed in this granule based system moreover the nitrite removal rate by anammox bacteria ran stepwise increased following the decreasing hrt showing a high capacity to remove nitrogen by this granular system in contrast there was no obvious trend for the nitrite removal rate by n damo bacteria rdb which fluctuated at a low level with average value of only 11 5 mg n l d compared with the average ran at hrt of 1 0 d 629 3 mg n l d n damo bacteria only contributed to about 2 0 nitrite removal indicating that anammox bacteria outcompeted n damo bacteria in the competition for nitrite which agreed with their different kinetics i e nitrite affinity constant for n damo bacteria of 0 1 mg n l nitrite affinity constant for anammox bacteria of 0 05 mg n l liu et al 2020a additionally although the nitrate concentration in effluent accumulated gradually fig 2a the increase of nitrate removal rate by n damo archaea rda adhered to the decrease of hrt closely specifically the rda significantly increased from 34 0 mg n l d hrt of 3 7 d to 97 3 mg n l d hrt of 1 0 d p 0 01 indicating the enhanced n damo archaeal activity 3 2 characteristics of granular sludges the granules in bright red color could be visually observed at the bottom of uasb fig 3 while suspended biomass was hardly detected in the bulk liquid above three phases separator mlvss 0 01 g l indicating the good separation between sludge and liquid the characteristics of anammox granules sampled at the end of phase i and combined anammox n damo granules sampled at the end of phase iii were summarized in table 2 the mlvss increased from 13 1 0 5 to 15 6 0 6 g l after more than 170 days operation the ratio of mlvss to mlss was in the range of 0 7 0 8 which was at the same level to the other granules arrojo et al 2006 arrojo et al 2004 tang et al 2011 yu et al 2019 the median diameter of granules at the end of phase i and phase iii was 0 7 0 2 and 0 7 0 1 mm respectively with no significant change in size distribution p 0 05 at the end of experiment the percentage of granules coupling anammox and n damo microorganisms with diameter larger than 0 6 mm were above 80 regarding the settling ability of combined anammox n damo granules the svi5 and svi30 were determined to be 32 2 and 27 4 ml g respectively moreover the ratio of svi5 to svi30 ranged in 1 10 1 23 indicating a good settling ability in addition the sludge specific density of anammox n damo granules was determined to be 96 4 g vss l granules which was in accordance with other types of granules e g anammox granules 91 120 g vss l granules aerobic granules 40 70 g vss l granules anaerobic granules 128 136 g vss l granules beun et al 2002 franco et al 2006 tang et al 2011 3 3 microbial community of granular sludge to elucidate the microbial community high throughput 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was conducted for the whole granule firstly fig 4 a fig s1 and fig s2 which revealed that the dominant phyla in phase iii were chloroflexi 25 3 patescibacteria 20 8 proteobacteria 13 6 euryarchaeota 9 9 planctomycetes 9 1 actinobacteriota 6 0 armatimonadetes 4 3 bacteroidota 3 1 firmicutes 2 1 acidobacteriota 2 0 and nc10 1 3 fig s1 both n damo archaea and n damo bacteria were found in the granules the candidatus methanoperedens 9 9 identified in the obtained granules was affiliated to the euryarchaeota phylum which is recognized as the nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation archaea haroon et al 2013 all the sequences detected in the nc10 phylum fell within the genus of candidatus methylomirabilis with 1 3 relative abundance with known ability to couple nitrite reduction with anaerobic methane oxidation ettwig et al 2010 furthermore the candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia belonging to the planctomycetes phylum which are well known anammox bacteria jetten et al 2009 were detected with relative abundance of 1 7 and 0 6 respectively notably it has been shown that the correlation between microbial abundance and activity can be weak ishii et al 2013 speth et al 2016 stewart et al 2012 therefore it is difficult to link the activity of functional microorganisms anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea to their abundances based on the information available in addition to these microbial populations with known functions there were other microorganisms detected with high abundance such as candidatus roizmanbacteria 16 4 chloroflexi sbr1031 6 6 anaerolineaceae uncultured 4 7 and sm1a02 4 7 as methane was the only carbon source supplied these unidentified microorganisms more likely depended on the organic carbon released by cell lysis or extracellular polymeric substance eps amino acids excreted by the others lawson et al 2017a speth et al 2016 for example candidatus roizmanbacteria is archived in a superphylum candidate parcubacteria which lacks cultured representatives in a recent study 12 single amplified genomes within this group were analyzed to show the capability for polysaccharide uptake and respiratory nitrate reduction león zayas et al 2017 the microorganisms belonging to chloroflexi phylum and anaerolineaceae family were detected as flanking partners in n damo hu et al 2015 lu et al 2016 and anammox cultures kindaichi et al 2012 lawson et al 2017b the microorganisms within these groups were inferred to use organic carbon from cell lysis for their growth cao et al 2016 kindaichi et al 2012 and they may play roles in the granulation process gao et al 2011 similarly the detection of sm1a02 in granules was also observed in other n damo lou et al 2019 and anammox cultures akaboci et al 2018 cao et al 2016 but their functions are still unknown which should be further explored further the microbial stratification along the granule radius was studied by shearing the granules into 7 layers with microbial community of each layer elucidated by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fig 4b the pca scatter plot presented a clear separation between the inner layers layers 1 6 and the outer layer layer 7 fig 4c illustrating that the microbial community was different from the granule surface to the granule inner layers furthermore the heat map fig 4d displaying the distributions of the n damo archaea n damo bacteria and anammox bacteria in the different layers layer 1 to layer 7 confirmed the dominance of anammox bacteria and n damo archaea at outer layer and inner layer respectively meanwhile n damo bacteria were only detected at inner layer layers 1 6 which were outcompeted by anammox bacteria at granule surface cryosection fish were conducted to further verify the distribution of three key microbial populations fig 4e and f after mixing the n damo flocs with mature anammox granules n damo bacteria and n damo archaea successfully adhered to the surface of anammox granules which were clustered together fig 4e after approximate 4 months enrichment fig 4f the majority of n damo microorganisms moved to the inner side of granules and were coated by anammox bacteria at the outer layer while a minor fraction could still be observed at the granule surface growing closely to anammox bacteria such a unique microbial stratification observed by fish was consistent with the results of cryosection 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fig 4b this phenomenon could be associated with the kinetics of these microorganisms and substrate bioavailability specifically n damo archaea might not grow at the granule surface because no nitrate was provided from the liquid additionally anammox bacteria with a higher nitrite affinity 0 05 mg n l hao et al 2002 would likely dominate over n damo bacteria with a lower nitrite affinity 0 1 mg n l liu et al 2020a in the competition for nitrite at the granule surface secondly the growth rates of n damo microorganisms are very slow with doubling time of more than weeks guerrero cruz et al 2019 lu et al 2019 therefore the granule surface with higher shear force is not favorable for the growth of such slow growing microorganisms while the inner layer of granule will protect them from being washed out 4 discussion 4 1 comparison among n damo flocs biofilms and granules it has been more than a decade since the first enrichment of n damo microorganisms in 2006 raghoebarsing et al 2006 in the first ten years researchers mainly focused on elucidating the metabolic pathway of these new microbial populations ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 luesken et al 2012 and the detection of their existence in natural and engineered systems deutzmann et al 2014 hu et al 2014 luesken et al 2011 wang et al 2012 in the very recent five years more and more studies started to employ n damo process in wastewater and groundwater treatment lai et al 2018 martínez quintela et al 2020 nie et al 2020 silva teira et al 2017 due to their unique characteristics to use methane as electron donor to reduce nitrite nitrate n damo process has been considered as an alternative to remove nitrogen and also to mitigate the dissolved methane emission liu et al 2019a as summarized in table 3 n damo microorganisms have been enriched in different biomass types such as flocs biofilms and granules notably the initial enrichment usually started from flocs which were easier to be operated bhattacharjee et al 2016 ding et al 2016 raghoebarsing et al 2006 zhu et al 2012 however the suspended flocs have a considerable disadvantage for practical application which is the poor settling ability according to our measurement on the flocs of n damo microorganisms used in this study haroon et al 2013 the svi30 was above 200 ml g indicating a poor settling performance thus the suspended flocs could be easily washed out along with the effluent resulting in difficulties to retain sufficient biomass inside bioreactor in order to avoid the biomass loss the reactors with suspended biomass have to be operated in batch mode with a significantly long srt e g above 300 days in haroon et al 2013 nonetheless the mlvss of these systems was still very low 0 5 1 5 mg l leading to a limited nitrogen removal rate consequently suspended flocs are not suitable for real applications of n damo process among the recent applications of n damo microorganisms biofilm system is a popular configuration chen et al 2016 ding et al 2017 liu et al 2020a xie et al 2018 up to date the demonstration of n damo process in biofilm systems has been achieved in various wastewater streams such as domestic sewage mainstream liu et al 2020b and anaerobic digestion liquor sidestream liu et al 2020c with biofilms completely attached to the membrane no biomass will be washed out in effluent theoretically due to the sufficient biomass sustained a practically useful nitrogen removal rate was achieved up to 1 kg n m3 d which is one of the major benefits of biofilm systems compared with suspended flocs however the microbial activity highly depends on the biofilm thickness while the thin biofilm results in poor nitrogen removal due to insufficient biomass the mass transfer will be limited in the excessively thick biofilm martin and nerenberg 2012 indeed the management of biofilm thickness is critical for stable mbfr operation in practice a suitable biofilm thickness requires cautious operation such as increasing shear gas sparging celmer et al 2008 semmens et al 2003 and adding chemicals e g surfactants splendiani et al 2006 moreover the hollow fiber membrane in mbfr is used not only to support biofilm development as carrier but also to deliver methane when a leaking happens to an aged fiber after a long term operation the biofilms need to be teared off before replaced with a new fiber this replacement will likely damage the reactor performance and will also take extra time for the biofilm reattachment compared with flocs the granular system has a much higher settling capability with svi30 of only 23 5 ml g therefore the majority of biomass could be sustained in the reactor leading to a high mlvss concentration of 15 6 0 6 g l at the steady state while the nitrogen removal rate obtained here was at the same level of biofilms table 3 there are a few unique advantages of granular sludge firstly the capital cost of granular systems is lower because no plastic carriers is required secondly granular sludge is easier to be collected stored and used to inoculate new reactors thirdly the replacement of hollow fibers is easier in the present uasb because the hollow fibers in uasb were only used to deliver methane with no biomass attached they can be replaced easily without concerning the impact to the overall performance based on these benefits a high level nitrogen removal from high strength wastewater was demonstrated achieving a tn removal rate of 1 0 kg n m3 d and a tn removal efficiency of 94 8 this rate achieved is practically useful for the nitrogen removal in high strength wastewater lackner et al 2014 4 2 two keys for the rapid formation of n damo granules in the present study a novel uasb based technology is developed to rapidly couple n damo microorganisms to anammox granules the achievement of n damo granules has been demonstrated in previous studies for example fan et al 2019 obtained n damo granules from n damo flocs in more than 1 year and fu et al 2019 studied the impacts of methane transfer in small n damo granules 200 μm compared to these previous studies the present study proposes a new method for the rapid development of large anammox n damo granules 700 μm in 6 months there are two keys for this quick achievement firstly the mature anammox granules were used as biotic carriers to support n damo microorganisms attaching on the granule surface generally the formation of granule biofilm includes three steps i e attachment microcolony formation and maturation van wolferen et al 2018 the eps is of significance for this process of sludge aggregation which can cluster free living cells together hou et al 2015 orell et al 2013 while anammox bacteria are known to produce more eps than other microorganisms chen et al 2013 hou et al 2015 such as activated sludge and denitrifying sludge the knowledge of eps production by archaea is very limited the long granulation process 1 year of n damo microorganisms in previous study was likely due to the insufficient eps generated from n damo microorganisms fan et al 2019 in this study we used mature anammox granules as biotic carriers which have already possessed sufficient eps on the granule surface once the suspended flocs of n damo microorganisms were inoculated they could attach to the anammox granule surface with the help of existed eps thus being embedded in the granules easily evidenced by the observation that the liquid became clear in 5 6 weeks of phase ii the flocs of n damo microorganisms immobilized on the biotic carriers anammox granules in a relatively short time similar mechanism was proposed in a anammox granule reactor which showed the enlargement of anammox granules by the aggregation of other anammox micro granules flocs wang et al 2020 once the microcolonies of n damo microorganisms were formed on the granule surface the second key is to avoid the dispersion of these new immigrants specifically a high shear force can lead to the detachment of n damo microorganisms from the surface of these new combined granules thus it is important to provide a moderate condition to allow them growing and becoming part of granules eventually van wolferen et al 2018 in this study we used the strategy by gradually increasing the shear force in terms of upflow velocity in phase iii with continuous feeding the upflow velocity was elevated from 0 5 to 4 5 m h stepwise following the gradually enhanced microbial activities fig 2b after another 4 months operation the new immigrants n damo bacteria and n damo archaea moved to the granule inner layer fig 4d indicating the maturation of combined anammox and n damo granules 5 conclusions in this study a lab scale uasb integrating the anammox and n damo microorganisms in granules was developed which demonstrated a high level nitrogen from synthetic high strength wastewater the major conclusions and outcomes are the formation of granules coupling anammox and n damo microorganisms was achieved in 6 months using mature anammox granules as biotic carriers and stepwise increasing the upflow velocity were two keys to obtain combined anammox n damo granules rapidly a practically useful nitrogen removal rate 1 0 kg n m 3 d 1 was obtained the microbial stratification along granule radius was elucidated showing the dominance of anammox bacteria and n damo archaea at outer layer and inner layer respectively compared with flocs the good settleability of combined anammox n damo granules is the key to achieve a high level nitrogen removal

jurisdictions limits nitrosodimethylamine to 10 ng l california department of public health 2013 massachusetts office of eea 2004 who 2008 however there are many dbps which remain unregulated such as hans and hams which are more toxic than thms and haas wagner and plewa 2017 therefore corresponding strategies should be applied to control dbp formation in finished water to reduce the health risks chlorine is the most commonly used disinfectant due to its low cost and ability to effectively inactivate microorganisms and viruses however large numbers of c dbps e g tcm bdcm and dichloroacetic acid dcaa are produced when chlorine is used as a disinfectant sedlak and gunten 2011 therefore many dwtps have used alternative disinfectants such as chloramines which reduced formation of c dbps compared to chlorine hua and reckhow 2007 however chloramines increase the formation of some n dbps which also tend to exhibit greater toxicity than the currently regulated c dbps guay et al 2005 hanigan et al 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 previous studies have shown that chinese hamster ovary cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of unregulated n dbps were 1 3 orders of magnitude higher than those of the regulated c dbps plewa et al 2008 2017 therefore n dbps are often the driver of toxicity among the dbps measured despite being present at low concentrations in finished water muellner et al 2007 verdugo et al 2020 water resources are strained due to population growth and increased pollution therefore dwtps attempt to maximum internal plant recycling of wash and waste water flows filter backwash water fbw and sedimentation sludge water ssw are being considered as raw water sources for dwtps hong et al 2016 king et al 2020 fbw and ssw produced during water treatment account for approximately 2 10 of total water flow in dwtps gottfried et al 2008 therefore recycling fbw and ssw not only reduces the costs of treatment and transportation but also increases net water production rates in dwtps bourgeois et al 2004 krasner et al 2009 however we have recently shown that fbw and ssw contain large quantities of dbps and precursors which result in the formation ofthms haas hans and hams when chlorinated qian et al 2020 a recent study also showed that nitrosamines were produced during recycling of settled sludge supernatant due to polymer residue westerhoff et al 2019 fbw and

p i l c 50 i 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of disinfection time on dbp formation 3 1 1 carbonaceous dbps fig 1 a and b show thm and haa formation in both fbw and ssw increased with longer disinfection contact time we plot molar rather than mass concentration units to facilitate comparison among dbp species and to more accurately compare dbp yields mole dbp per unit doc from precursors additionally throughout this work we present the formation of dbps in undiluted fbw and ssw samples which is likely to be significantly greater than would be expected at a treatment plant which dilutes fbw and ssw supernatants significantly with plant influent water however the precursors present in fbw and ssw samples are chemically unchanged by dilution and thus the trends and potential mitigation strategies identified here are representative of those which would be expected at full scale among four thms tcm was the primary thm species in all samples and accounted for 47 60 of the total thm formation tcm concentrations during chlorination of fbw and ssw reached 358 nm and 387 nm respectively after a 120 min reaction time bromo thms br thms accounted for 42 and 53 of the total thm yield in fbw and ssw after 120 min respectively br thms in ssw were greater than those in fbw due to the greater bromide concentrations in ssw br thms formed more rapidly than chloro thms reaching 58 at 10 min of their total 120 min formation compared to chloro thms which formed 52 of their total formation at 10 min br thms are more easily and rapidly generated in the presence of high bromide concentrations because hypobromous acid hobr preferentially substitutes br atoms more than hypochlorous acid hocl substitutes cl allard et al 2015 westerhoff et al 2004 although chloro thms accounted for greater molar concentrations of the total thm load br thms should not be ignored given their rapid formation particularly in cases with high br concentrations haa yields also increased with disinfection time which was mostly attributed to the increase of chloro haas caa concentrations were 45 111 nm in ssw and accounted for 66 76 of the total haa yield compared to 12 47 of the haa yield in fbw attributable to caa the difference in caa concentration is reflective of the overall difference in haa concentrations where formation in fbw 30 52 nm was less than ssw 68 167 nm this is likely due to lower doc concentrations in fbw 1 9 compared to 3 1 mgc l table s1 another reason may be that ssw contained more reactive haa precursors than fbw du et al 2017 mccormick et al 2010 in fbw bcaa was the dominant haa species within 60 min but decreased with increasing contact time haa may hydrolyze but hydrolysis kinetics are much slower than other dbps wang et al 2018 however there was a negative linear correlation between br thms and bcaa in fbw r2 0 92 p 0 05 fig s1 indicating that bcaa further reacted with hobr to form corresponding br thms previous research has also determined that haas can decompose to thms wang et al 2019 zhang and minear 2002 3 1 2 nitrogenous dbps as shown in fig 1c hans were rapidly generated within the first 10 min and subsequently increased gradually with disinfection time which is attributed to the increased levels of bromo hans br hans hans reached their maximum yields at 120 min in fbw and ssw which were 31 and 36 nm respectively among the seven hans four hans e g can dcan bcan and dban were detected in fbw and ssw br hans were the primary hans in ssw and accounted for 53 66 of the total han formation which contrasted with the formation of haas this result indicated that br hans were generated with increased disinfection times br hans especially dban are the most cyto and genotoxic hans for which data are available wagner and plewa 2017 fig 1d shows that the total yields of hams in fbw and ssw also demonstrated an increasing trend over time which indicated that longer disinfection times enhanced ham formation chloro hams were the main ham during chlorination the maximum yields of hams in fbw and ssw were observed at 120 min and eventually reached 41 nm and 46 nm respectively in general total dbp concentrations and calculated toxicities showed a similar trend which increased over time figs s2a and s2c although thms and haas predominated among the measured dbp classes at all disinfection times the calculated toxicities of thms and haas accounted for less than 4 of the total calculated dbps toxicity due to their low toxic potency plewa et al 2017 others have also recently shown that thms are unlikely to be the drivers of toxicity in disinfected samples chuang and mitch 2017 li and mitch 2018 at low oxidant exposures cxt mg min l hams are the main dbp that contributed to the calculated toxicity but did not increase over time the increase in total calculated toxicity is attributed to the increase of han formation hans constituted 30 53 and 42 66 of the total calculated toxicity respectively during fbw and ssw disinfection and the group toxicity was dominated by dban therefore contact times between disinfectant and water should be minimized to reduce dbp formation and associated toxicity 3 2 effects of disinfectant dose and type on the dbp formation 3 2 1 carbonaceous dbps the formation of thms and haas in fbw and ssw with 120 min disinfection times at different chlorine and chloramine doses are shown in fig 2 a and b the thm yields in both water samples exhibited gradually increasing trends as the chlorine or chloramine doses increased from 5 mg cl2 l to 20 mg cl2 l thm concentrations in ssw during chlorination were higher than those in fbw due to the high doc and bromide concentrations in ssw the maximum yields of thms in fbw and ssw during chlorination reached 646 nm and 958 nm respectively at the highest chlorine dose 20 mg cl2 l compared with the chlorination process thm concentrations in fbw and ssw at a 20 mg cl2 l dose of chloramine decreased by 21 and 50 to 509 nm and 575 nm respectively this result showed that thm formation can be effectively controlled by reducing disinfectant dose or by using chloramine as the disinfectant instead of chlorine haa formation was not affected by chlorine dose which was different from thm formation fig 2b the dcaa and bcaa formations rose continuously with chlorine dose whereas caa formation had an opposite trend the reason may be that halogen atoms cl and br further substituted in the presence of high chlorine doses so that caa progressed to form dcaa and bcaa wang et al 2019 in ssw haa concentrations decreased by 40 68 during chloramination compared to chlorination which is attributed to the reduced concentration of caa haa yields were higher at the highest chloramine dose nh2cl concentration 20 mg cl2 l than at other doses 3 2 2 nitrogenous dbps fig 2c and d show hans and ham formations in fbw and ssw at different chlorine and chloramine doses the hans in fbw remained at 31 9 nm to 32 9 nm respectively which indicated that the chlorine dose only slightly affected han formation however han yields decreased with increasing chlorine doses in ssw likely because hans were hydrolyzed to hams or other dbps huang et al 2012 previous studies have also reported that han degradation rates increased with chlorine concentrations chu et al 2009 reckhow et al 2001 as the chloramine dose increased han concentrations reached their maxima at the highest chloramine doses for both water samples fbw and ssw exhibited the same ham formation trend during disinfection fig 2d ham yields in both water samples decreased as the chlorine dose increased which was consistent with the formation of hans in ssw at different chlorine doses however there was an opposite trend of ham formation during chloramination of both water samples when compared to chlorination indicating that high chloramine doses favored han and ham formations consistent with a previous publication hong et al 2013 as shown in fig 2c and d the han and ham concentrations produced by chloramination of fbw and ssw at the highest dose 20 mg cl2 l exceeded those produced by chlorination therefore dwtps should focus dbp mitigation efforts on han and ham formation when chloramines are applied to the return flows as shown in fig s3 the calculated toxicity decreased steadily with increasing chlorine doses which is attributed to the decreased han and ham concentrations thus there may be an opportunity to reduce toxicity by increasing chlorine dose and destroying some more toxic dbps this does not however take into account non detected i e unknown dbps for which the contribution to total toxicity is likewise unknown but may be substantial mckenna et al 2020 stalter et al 2020 in both samples and at the highest chlorine chloramine dose calculated toxicities with chloramination exceeded those at the highest chlorine dose thus minimizing chloramine dose or use of free chlorine may be preferential to control dbp formation in situation with recycling of ssw and fbw 3 3 effects of ph on dbp formation during chlorination 3 3 1 carbonaceous dbps the formation of thms and haas in fbw and ssw at varying ph are shown in fig 3 a and b the thm and haa yields in fbw and ssw gradually increased as the ph increased from 6 to 8 this is because thm and haa formation by base catalyzed hydrolysis prevails under alkaline conditions liang and singer 2003 during ssw chlorination the maximum thm and haa formation were higher than those of fbw and reached 1 072 nm and 198 nm respectively at ph 8 among four thms and nine haas tcm and caa were affected the most by ph moreover bdcm and dbam yields also increased with increasing ph and these results agree with previous studies which showed that alkaline environments favor formation of thms and haas fang et al 2019 3 3 2 nitrogenous dbps hans exhibited a trend that was opposite to thms and haas such that hans were produced to a greater extent at acidic and neutral conditions compared to alkaline conditions fig 3c these results are consistent with previous studies showing that han hydrolysis increases with ph reckhow et al 2001 yu and reckhow 2015 previous studies have also determined that han yields reached peaks at ph 7 for some model precursors fang et al 2019 ham formation steadily decreased from 57 nm to 14 nm in fbw and from 61 nm to 34 nm in ssw as the ph increased from 6 to 8 both hams and hans hydrolyze under alkaline conditions eventually to the corresponding haas although hydrolysis of hans to hams should increase measured ham concentrations ding et al 2018 huang et al 2013 yu and reckhow 2017 it is likely that the corresponding ham hydrolyzed to haas before measurement and instead account for some formation of measured haas hydrolysis of hams and hans to haas is notable because nitrogenous dbps are generally more toxic than carbonaceous wagner and plewa 2017 in fig s4 we show the calculated toxicities after chlorination of both water samples versus ph total dbp formation increased with increasing ph but calculated dbp toxicity deceased steadily due to minimization of han and hams the unadjusted ph of the fbw and ssw samples was 7 5 and 7 7 table s1 however fbw and ssw are typically recycled to the head of the plant and thus are subject to chlorination at the ph of the finished water thus ph at the point of chlorination and in the distribution system should be monitored and adjusted to increase hydrolysis of hams and hans again this is based on the toxicity of the measured dbps which does not encompass all potentially toxic organic matter in the chlorinated samples 3 4 effect of bromide on the dbp formation during chlorination 3 4 1 carbonaceous dbps as shown in fig 4 a thm formation decreased at bromide additions between 0 mg l and 0 8 mg l followed by an increase with addition of 1 mg l bromide thm formation tended to decrease with increasing dose due to the decrease of tcm and bdcm formation as bromide levels increased dbcm formation also gradually increased from 56 nm to 95 nm and from 9 nm to 44 nm in fbw and ssw respectively tbm formation increased at greater doses of bromide from 86 nm to 174 nm and from 30 nm to 103 nm for fbw and ssw respectively however the sum of the increase of dbcm and tbm was lower than the losses of tcm and bdcm indicating that the increase in more brominated thms was due partially to oxidation of additional organic matter rather than further oxidation of lesser brominated thms bif values for thms in both water sources also continuously increased fig 5 a haa formation during chlorination of both water samples at different bromide doses increased with bromide concentrations due mostly to increased caa formation dcaa bcaa cdbaa and tbaa also slightly increased with bromide concentrations with increasing bromide bif was modestly increased to much less of an extent than for thms illustrating that thms are more subject to bromine substitution than haas 3 4 2 nitrogenous dbps the total han formation during chlorination of fbw and ssw remained relatively stable with increasing bromide doses from 26 nm to 33 nm in fbw and from 32 nm to 39 nm in ssw fig 4c dcan formation was decreased to the greatest extent at higher bromide doses decreased in fbw and ssw from 14 nm to 7 nm and from 10 nm to 6 nm respectively but was offset by the formation of dban dban formation increased from 5 nm to 9 nm and from 11 nm to 25 nm respectively a total bromide spiked plus background concentration of 0 4 mg l was the inflection point where br hans began to dominate the han pool over chloro hans similar to the formation of haas ham formation increased with bromide although a plateauing was apparent at bromide concentrations above 0 65 mg l fbw and 1 22 mg l ssw the reason for this plateauing is not clear but the maximum formations of hams in fbw and ssw were found at the highest bromide dose and reached 76 nm and 73 nm respectively the bif values of hans for both water samples all rose noticeably with increasing bromide concentrations and exhibited the greatest bif values among the four measured dbps fig 5 the greater incorporation of bromide into hans is consistent with published literature fang et al 2019 ham bif did not increase with increasing bromide dose total dbp concentrations and calculated toxicities from the chlorination of both water samples at varying bromide dose are shown in fig s5 thm concentrations were much greater than any other group of dbp however increasing calculated toxicity as a function of bromide dose is attributable to increasing formation of dban and cam rather than thms hans accounted for 3 2 4 7 of the total dbps but contributed 54 68 of the calculated toxicity therefore strategies for bromide removal from fbw and ssw should be considered to reduce dbp formation especially bromo dbps during fbw and ssw recycling 4 conclusion this study investigated the formation of thms haas hans and hams during disinfection of fbw and ssw and specific conclusions are as follows 1 when ph disinfectant concentration and bromide concentrations were held constant nearly all detected dbp concentrations increased with increasing contact time calculated toxicity also tended to increase with increasing chlorine contact time 2 reducing chlorine dose reduced thm formation but promoted han and ham formation resulting in increased calculated toxicity for chloramination of fbw and ssw formation of n dbps was greatest at the highest applied chloramine dose 3 alkaline ph effectively controlled n dbp formation but increased c dbp formation likely due to hydrolysis of the n dbps hydrolysis of the more toxic n dbps reduced calculated toxicity 4 bifs for thms and hans increased with increasing bromide concentration but were relatively constant for haas and hams increasing bromide concentrations caused an increased in calculated toxicity due mostly to the formation of dban 5 reducing disinfection contact time increasing chlorine dose or decreasing chloramine dose and removing bromide from fbw and ssw are effective strategies for reducing dbp formation and the calculated toxicity of thms hans haas and hams during fbw and ssw recycling 6 hydrolysis of dbps via ph control may be an effective strategy in reducing risk to consumers declaration of

increased with extended chlorination for both fbw and ssw during chlorination of both fbw and ssw elevated chlorine doses significantly increased thm yields per unit dissolved organic carbon doc but decreased han and ham yields with minimum effect on haa yields chloramine disinfection effectively inhibited c dbp formation but promoted n dbps yields which increased with chloramine dose calculated toxicities after chloramination increased with chloramine dose which was opposite to the trend found after free chlorine addition an examination of ph effects demonstrated that c dbps were more readily generated at alkaline ph ph 8 while acidic conditions ph 6 favored n dbp formation total dbp concentrations increased at higher ph levels but calculated dbp toxicity deceased due to lower han

hans and hams which are more toxic than thms and haas wagner and plewa 2017 therefore corresponding strategies should be applied to control dbp formation in finished water to reduce the health risks chlorine is the most commonly used disinfectant due to its low cost and ability to effectively inactivate microorganisms and viruses however large numbers of c dbps e g tcm bdcm and dichloroacetic acid dcaa are produced when chlorine is used as a disinfectant sedlak and gunten 2011 therefore many dwtps have used alternative disinfectants such as chloramines which reduced formation of c dbps compared to chlorine hua and reckhow 2007 however chloramines increase the formation of some n dbps which also tend to exhibit greater toxicity than the currently regulated c dbps guay et al 2005 hanigan et al 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 previous studies have shown that chinese hamster ovary cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of unregulated n dbps were 1 3 orders of magnitude higher than those of the regulated c dbps plewa et al 2008 2017 therefore n dbps are often the driver of toxicity among the dbps measured despite being present at low concentrations in finished water muellner et al 2007 verdugo et al 2020 water resources are strained due to population growth and increased pollution therefore dwtps attempt to maximum internal plant recycling of wash and waste water flows filter backwash water fbw and sedimentation sludge water ssw are being considered as raw water sources for dwtps hong et al 2016 king et al 2020 fbw and ssw produced during water treatment account for

rates in dwtps bourgeois et al 2004 krasner et al 2009 however we have recently shown that fbw and ssw contain large quantities of dbps and precursors which result in the formation ofthms haas hans

p i l c 50 i 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of disinfection time on dbp formation 3 1 1 carbonaceous dbps fig 1 a and b show thm and haa formation in both fbw and ssw increased with longer disinfection contact time we plot molar rather than mass concentration units to facilitate comparison among dbp species and to more accurately compare dbp yields mole dbp per unit doc from precursors additionally throughout this work we present the formation of dbps in undiluted fbw and ssw samples which is likely to be significantly greater than would be expected at a treatment plant which dilutes fbw and ssw supernatants significantly with plant influent water however the precursors present in fbw and ssw samples are chemically unchanged by dilution and thus the trends and potential mitigation strategies identified here are representative of those which would be expected at full scale among four thms tcm was the primary thm species in all samples and accounted for 47 60 of the total thm formation tcm concentrations during chlorination of fbw and ssw reached 358 nm and 387 nm respectively after a 120 min reaction time bromo thms br thms accounted for 42 and 53 of the total thm yield in fbw and ssw after 120 min respectively br thms in ssw were greater than those in fbw due to the greater bromide concentrations in ssw br thms formed more rapidly than chloro thms reaching 58 at 10 min of their total 120 min formation compared to chloro thms which formed 52 of their total formation at 10 min br thms are more easily and rapidly generated in the presence of high bromide concentrations because hypobromous acid hobr preferentially substitutes br atoms more than hypochlorous acid hocl substitutes cl allard et al 2015 westerhoff et al 2004 although chloro thms accounted for greater molar concentrations of the total thm load br thms should not be ignored given their rapid formation particularly in cases with high br concentrations haa yields also increased with disinfection time which was mostly attributed to the increase of chloro haas caa concentrations were 45 111 nm in ssw and accounted for 66 76 of the total haa yield compared to 12 47 of the haa yield in fbw attributable to caa the difference in caa concentration is reflective of the overall difference in haa concentrations where formation in fbw 30 52 nm was less than ssw 68 167 nm this is likely due to lower doc concentrations in fbw 1 9 compared to 3 1 mgc l table s1 another reason may be that ssw contained more reactive haa precursors than fbw du et al 2017 mccormick et al 2010 in fbw bcaa was the dominant haa species within 60 min but decreased with increasing contact time haa may hydrolyze but hydrolysis kinetics are much slower than other dbps wang et al 2018 however there was a negative linear correlation between br thms and bcaa in fbw r2 0 92 p 0 05 fig s1 indicating that bcaa further reacted with hobr to form corresponding br thms previous research has also determined that haas can decompose to thms wang et al 2019 zhang and minear 2002 3 1 2 nitrogenous dbps as shown in fig 1c hans were rapidly generated within the first 10 min and subsequently increased gradually with disinfection time which is attributed to the increased levels of bromo hans br hans hans reached their maximum yields at 120 min in fbw and ssw which were 31 and 36 nm respectively among the seven hans four hans e g can dcan bcan and dban were detected in fbw and ssw br hans were the primary hans in ssw and accounted for 53 66 of the total han formation which contrasted with the formation of haas this result indicated that br hans were generated with increased disinfection times br hans especially dban are the most cyto and genotoxic hans for which data are available wagner and plewa 2017 fig 1d shows that the total yields of hams in fbw and ssw also demonstrated an increasing trend over time which indicated that longer disinfection times enhanced ham formation chloro hams were the main ham during chlorination the maximum yields of hams in fbw and ssw were observed at 120 min and eventually reached 41 nm and 46 nm respectively in general total dbp concentrations and calculated toxicities showed a similar trend which increased over time figs s2a and s2c although thms and haas predominated among the measured dbp classes at all disinfection times the calculated toxicities of thms and haas accounted for less than 4 of the total calculated dbps toxicity due to their low toxic potency plewa et al 2017 others have also recently shown that thms are unlikely to be the drivers of toxicity in disinfected samples chuang and mitch 2017 li and mitch 2018 at low oxidant exposures cxt mg min l hams are the main dbp that contributed to the calculated toxicity but did not increase over time the increase in total calculated toxicity is attributed to the increase of han formation hans constituted 30 53 and 42 66 of the total calculated toxicity respectively during fbw and ssw disinfection and the group toxicity was dominated by dban therefore contact times between disinfectant and water should be minimized to reduce dbp formation and associated toxicity 3 2 effects of disinfectant dose and type on the dbp formation 3 2 1 carbonaceous dbps the formation of thms and haas in fbw and ssw with 120 min disinfection times at different chlorine and chloramine doses are shown in fig 2 a and b the thm yields in both water samples exhibited gradually increasing trends as the chlorine or chloramine doses increased from 5 mg cl2 l to 20 mg cl2 l thm concentrations in ssw during chlorination were higher than those in fbw due to the high doc and bromide concentrations in ssw the maximum yields of thms in fbw and ssw during chlorination reached 646 nm and 958 nm respectively at the highest chlorine dose 20 mg cl2 l compared with the chlorination process thm concentrations in fbw and ssw at a 20 mg cl2 l dose of chloramine decreased by 21 and 50 to 509 nm and 575 nm respectively this result showed that thm formation can be effectively controlled by reducing disinfectant dose or by using chloramine as the disinfectant instead of chlorine haa formation was not affected by chlorine dose which was different from thm formation fig 2b the dcaa and bcaa formations rose continuously with chlorine dose whereas caa formation had an opposite trend the reason may be that halogen atoms cl and br further substituted in the presence of high chlorine doses so that caa progressed to form dcaa and bcaa wang et al 2019 in ssw haa concentrations decreased by 40 68 during chloramination compared to chlorination which is attributed to the reduced concentration of caa haa yields were higher at the highest chloramine dose nh2cl concentration 20 mg cl2 l than at other doses 3 2 2 nitrogenous dbps fig 2c and d show hans and ham formations in fbw and ssw at different chlorine and chloramine doses the hans in fbw remained at 31 9 nm to 32 9 nm respectively which indicated that the chlorine dose only slightly affected han formation however han yields decreased with increasing chlorine doses in ssw likely because hans were hydrolyzed to hams or other dbps huang et al 2012 previous studies have also reported that han degradation rates increased with chlorine concentrations chu et al 2009 reckhow et al 2001 as the chloramine dose increased han concentrations reached their maxima at the highest chloramine doses for both water samples fbw and ssw exhibited the same ham formation trend during disinfection fig 2d ham yields in both water samples decreased as the chlorine dose increased which was consistent with the formation of hans in ssw at different chlorine doses however there was an opposite trend of ham formation during chloramination of both water samples when compared to chlorination indicating that high chloramine doses favored han and ham formations consistent with a previous publication hong et al 2013 as shown in fig 2c and d the han and ham concentrations produced by chloramination of fbw and ssw at the highest dose 20 mg cl2 l exceeded those produced by chlorination therefore dwtps should focus dbp mitigation efforts on han and ham formation when chloramines are applied to the return flows as shown in fig s3 the calculated toxicity decreased steadily with increasing chlorine doses which is attributed to the decreased han and ham concentrations thus there may be an opportunity to reduce toxicity by increasing chlorine dose and destroying some more toxic dbps this does not however take into account non detected i e unknown dbps for which the contribution to total toxicity is likewise unknown but may be substantial mckenna et al 2020 stalter et al 2020 in both samples and at the highest chlorine chloramine dose calculated toxicities with chloramination exceeded those at the highest chlorine dose thus minimizing chloramine dose or use of free chlorine may be preferential to control dbp formation in situation with recycling of ssw and fbw 3 3 effects of ph on dbp formation during chlorination 3 3 1 carbonaceous dbps the formation of thms and haas in fbw and ssw at varying ph are shown in fig 3 a and b the thm and haa yields in fbw and ssw gradually increased as the ph increased from 6 to 8 this is because thm and haa formation by base catalyzed hydrolysis prevails under alkaline conditions liang and singer 2003 during ssw chlorination the maximum thm and haa formation were higher than those of fbw and reached 1 072 nm and 198 nm respectively at ph 8 among four thms and nine haas tcm and caa were affected the most by ph moreover bdcm and dbam yields also increased with increasing ph and these results agree with previous studies which showed that alkaline environments favor formation of thms and haas fang et al 2019 3 3 2 nitrogenous dbps hans exhibited a trend that was opposite to thms and haas such that hans were produced to a greater extent at acidic and neutral conditions compared to alkaline conditions fig 3c these results are consistent with previous studies showing that han hydrolysis increases with ph reckhow et al 2001 yu and reckhow 2015 previous studies have also determined that han yields reached peaks at ph 7 for some model precursors fang et al 2019 ham formation steadily decreased from 57 nm to 14 nm in fbw and from 61 nm to 34 nm in ssw as the ph increased from 6 to 8 both hams and hans hydrolyze under alkaline conditions eventually to the corresponding haas although hydrolysis of hans to hams should increase measured ham concentrations ding et al 2018 huang et al 2013 yu and reckhow 2017 it is likely that the corresponding ham hydrolyzed to haas before measurement and instead account for some formation of measured haas hydrolysis of hams and hans to haas is notable because nitrogenous dbps are generally more toxic than carbonaceous wagner and plewa 2017 in fig s4 we show the calculated toxicities after chlorination of both water samples versus ph total dbp formation increased with increasing ph but calculated dbp toxicity deceased steadily due to minimization of han and hams the unadjusted ph of the fbw and ssw samples was 7 5 and 7 7 table s1 however fbw and ssw are typically recycled to the head of the plant and thus are subject to chlorination at the ph of the finished water thus ph at the point of chlorination and in the distribution system should be monitored and adjusted to increase hydrolysis of hams and hans again this is based on the toxicity of the measured dbps which does not encompass all potentially toxic organic matter in the chlorinated samples 3 4 effect of bromide on the dbp formation during chlorination 3 4 1 carbonaceous dbps as shown in fig 4 a thm formation decreased at bromide additions between 0 mg l and 0 8 mg l followed by an increase with addition of 1 mg l bromide thm formation tended to decrease with increasing dose due to the decrease of tcm and bdcm formation as bromide levels increased dbcm formation also gradually increased from 56 nm to 95 nm and from 9 nm to 44 nm in fbw and ssw respectively tbm formation increased at greater doses of bromide from 86 nm to 174 nm and from 30 nm to 103 nm for fbw and ssw respectively however the sum of the increase of dbcm and tbm was lower than the losses of tcm and bdcm indicating that the increase in more brominated thms was due partially to oxidation of additional organic matter rather than further oxidation of lesser brominated thms bif values for thms in both water sources also continuously increased fig 5 a haa formation during chlorination of both water samples at different bromide doses increased with bromide concentrations due mostly to increased caa formation dcaa bcaa cdbaa and tbaa also slightly increased with bromide concentrations with increasing bromide bif was modestly increased to much less of an extent than for thms illustrating that thms are more subject to bromine substitution than haas 3 4 2 nitrogenous dbps the total han formation during chlorination of fbw and ssw remained relatively stable with increasing bromide doses from 26 nm to 33 nm in fbw and from 32 nm to 39 nm in ssw fig 4c dcan formation was decreased to the greatest extent at higher bromide doses decreased in fbw and ssw from 14 nm to 7 nm and from 10 nm to 6 nm respectively but was offset by the formation of dban dban formation increased from 5 nm to 9 nm and from 11 nm to 25 nm respectively a total bromide spiked plus background concentration of 0 4 mg l was the inflection point where br hans began to dominate the han pool over chloro hans similar to the formation of haas ham formation increased with bromide although a plateauing was apparent at bromide concentrations above 0 65 mg l fbw and 1 22 mg l ssw the reason for this plateauing is not clear but the maximum formations of hams in fbw and ssw were found at the highest bromide dose and reached 76 nm and 73 nm respectively the bif values of hans for both water samples all rose noticeably with increasing bromide concentrations and exhibited the greatest bif values among the four measured dbps fig 5 the greater incorporation of bromide into hans is consistent with published literature fang et al 2019 ham bif did not increase with increasing bromide dose total dbp concentrations and calculated toxicities from the chlorination of both water samples at varying bromide dose are shown in fig s5 thm concentrations were much greater than any other group of dbp however increasing calculated toxicity as a function of bromide dose is attributable to increasing formation of dban and cam rather than thms hans accounted for 3 2 4 7 of the total dbps but contributed 54 68 of the calculated toxicity therefore strategies for bromide removal from fbw and ssw should be considered to reduce dbp formation especially bromo dbps during fbw and ssw recycling 4 conclusion this study investigated the formation of thms haas hans and hams during disinfection of fbw and ssw and specific conclusions are as follows 1 when ph disinfectant concentration and bromide concentrations were held constant nearly all detected dbp concentrations increased with increasing contact time calculated toxicity also tended to increase with increasing chlorine contact time 2 reducing chlorine dose reduced thm formation but promoted han and ham formation resulting in increased calculated toxicity for chloramination of fbw and ssw formation of n dbps was greatest at the highest applied chloramine dose 3 alkaline ph effectively controlled n dbp formation but increased c dbp formation likely due to hydrolysis of the n dbps hydrolysis of the more toxic n dbps reduced calculated toxicity 4 bifs for thms and hans increased with increasing bromide concentration but were relatively constant for haas and hams increasing bromide concentrations caused an increased in calculated toxicity due mostly to the formation of dban 5 reducing disinfection contact time increasing chlorine dose or decreasing chloramine dose and removing bromide from fbw and ssw are effective strategies for reducing dbp formation and the calculated toxicity of thms hans haas and hams during fbw and ssw recycling 6 hydrolysis of dbps via ph control may be an effective strategy in reducing risk to consumers declaration of

17153,since the start of synthetic fertilizer production more than a hundred years ago the coastal ocean has been exposed to increasing nutrient loading which has led to eutrophication and extensive algal blooms such hypereutrophic waters might harbor anaerobic nitrogen n cycling processes due to low oxygen microniches associated with abundant organic particles but studies on nitrate reduction in coastal pelagic environments are scarce here we report on 15n isotope labeling experiments metagenome and rt qpcr data from a large hypereutrophic lagoon indicating that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra and denitrification were active processes even though the bulk water was fully oxygenated 224 µm o2 dnra in the bottom water corresponded to 83 of whole ecosystem dnra water sediment while denitrification was predominant in the sediment microbial taxa important for dnra according to the metagenomic data were dominated by bacteroidetes genus parabacteroides and proteobacteria genus wolinella while denitrification was mainly associated with proteobacterial genera pseudomonas achromobacter and brucella the metagenomic and microscopy data suggest that these anaerobic processes were likely occurring in low oxygen microniches related to extensive growth of filamentous cyanobacteria including diazotrophic dolichospermum and non diazotrophic planktothrix by summing the total nitrate fluxes through dnra and denitrification it results that dnra retains approximately one fifth 19 of the fixed n that goes through the nitrate pool this is noteworthy as dnra represents thus a very important recycling mechanism for fixed n which sustains algal proliferation and leads to further enhancement of eutrophication in these endangered ecosystems graphical abstract

have led to cultural eutrophication and subsequent phytoplankton blooms howarth and marino 2006 mineralization of such planktonic material accelerates oxygen o2 consumption which potentially leads to anoxia especially in scarcely ventilated and stratified aquatic systems breitburg et al 2018 carpenter et al 1998 under these conditions p is quickly recycled through internal feedback and diazotrophs such as bloom forming cyanobacteria capable of n2 fixation become the main source of biological n montoya et al 2004 the arising conditions in which the system presents nuisance algal blooms low visibility 1 5 m and extremely high 50 µg l 1 chlorophyll a concentrations are called hypereutrophic paerl et al 2011 under oxic conditions nitrifying bacteria oxidize the fixed ammonium nh4 to nitrate no3 which is further reduced to n2 under anoxic conditions through denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox canfield et al 2005 in addition to these two no3 depending pathways no3 may be reduced by another metabolic process the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra which recycles fixed n in the system laboratory reactor studies have demonstrated that this process is in competition for free no3 with denitrification van den berg et al 2015 and its activity may increase when organic carbon is in surplus over no3 i e a high c no3 ratio kraft et al 2014 recent literature has also shown that this process is ubiquitous in multiple aquatic environments due to the presence of oxic anoxic interfaces where no3 is supplied via the oxic interface and together with the availability of electron donors organic matter sulfide etc facilitate dnra activity e g caffrey et al 2019 hellemann et al 2020 klawonn et al 2015 stief et al 2018 in eutrophic lakes and coastal waters the strictly anaerobic no3 reduction pathways are mostly constrained to the top mm sediment layers canfield et al 2005 because of the vast size of benthic ecosystems the oxic anoxic interface in sediments constitutes the largest n loss environment on earth seitzinger et al 2006 water column anoxia can also host intense anaerobic n cycling processes when no3 is available and no3 reduction pathways move vertically from the sediment to the water column e g bonaglia et al 2016 in addition to anoxic sediment and waters dnra and denitrification have also been described in a number of other anoxic microenvironments found on zooplankton carcasses e g stief et al 2018 and phytoplankton aggregates e g klawonn et al 2015 bulk water incubation experiments aimed at quantifying rates of no3 reduction have therefore generally focused on anoxic sulfidic waters e g brettar and rheinheimer 1991 suboxic waters of oxygen minimum zones e g dalsgaard et al 2003 and on baltic sea waters at the oxic anoxic interface bonaglia et al 2016 except for a recent study reporting on coupled nitrification denitrification associated with suspended sediment particles in riverine water xia et al 2017 to our knowledge studies quantifying no3 reduction in oxic waters are still missing in order to bridge this gap we carried out a combination of geochemical and molecular assessments of an array of aerobic and anaerobic n cycling processes in a hypereutrophic model system the curonian lagoon baltic sea which constitutes the largest lagoon in europe due to external loading and internal nutrient cycling this lagoon presents massive phytoplankton blooms throughout the summer and chlorophyll a concentrations well above 50 µg l 1 zilius et al 2014 the water column might therefore contain anoxic microenvironments making dnra and denitrification possible even though the water column is oxygenated we hypothesized that 1 the lagoon oxic bottom waters have the potential for hosting active no3 reduction processes 2 in the highly organic and eutrophic waters dnra rates are higher than denitrification and 3 sediment no3 reduction is quantitatively higher than in the water column we tested these hypotheses by applying a combination of 15n incubation experiments metagenomic analysis and quantitative reverse transcription pcr rt qpcr of both pelagic and benthic environments 2 material and

laboratory within 1 hour on ice except for the 10 and 25 l plastic tanks and immediately analysed water and sediment cores collected in the field were used in various incubation experiments to

injected to a final concentration of 0 3 µm 15nh4 through the butyl septum this was followed by short incubations with three time points t0 t1 1 5 h and t2 3 h at each time point bottles n 3 were sacrificed and 60 70 ml of water were filtered on a pre combusted 25 mm advantec gf75 glass fiber filters for po15n analyses filters were frozen at 20 c until analysis additional aliquots of filtered water 15 ml were frozen at 20 c for nutrient analyses see below ammonium consumption rates were calculated following glibert et al 1982 klawonn et al 2019 during incubations the 15nh4 concentrations commonly decrease exponentially with time due to the concurrent assimilation of 15nh4 and dilution through 14nh4 regeneration to account for this exponential decrease we used a non linear curve fitting 2 k l n c t c 0 t where ct and c0 are the 15nh4 concentrations at time t and time zero respectively note that we did not measure the 15nh4 concentrations directly but calculated them as the difference between the initially added amount of 15nh4 and the amount of 15n in the pon at each time point since total nh4 concentrations were not significantly different between time points t test p range 0 07 1 00 nh4 consumption and remineralisation rates were similar and calculated as k c with c as the mean nh4 concentrations during incubations glibert et al 1982 since we used the amount of 15n in the pon to calculate nh4 consumption rates those can be considered as nh4 assimilation rates 2 4 water column nutrient transformation and no3 reduction experiment eight large plexiglass cylinders i d 8 cm 30 cm length filled with 1 3 l of bottom water each were submerged into an incubation tank containing approximately 20 l of aerated collected field water and maintained at constant temperature 21 3 0 2 c two stirrer bars driven by an external magnet at 40 rpm were inserted in each cylinder approximately at 10 cm height distance to each other to avoid water stagnation during incubation a first incubation for oxygen consumption and nutrient transformation processes nh4 no3 no2 was conducted by sealing four of the cylinders with rubber stoppers while avoiding bubbles the incubation was conducted in the dark and lasted six hours and before and at the end a 20 ml of aliquot was subsampled filtered gf 75 filters and frozen at 20 c for nutrient analysis dissolved o2 was monitored with a pre calibrated oxygen microsensor ox 50 microsensor unisense a s a second incubation using the other set of four cylinders was performed to target no3 reduction processes by means of the 15no3 tracer addition technique the water inside each cylinder was spiked with 15n no3 from a stock solution 20 mm na15no3 98 15n atom sigma aldrich to a final concentration of 15 µm 15n to calculate the exact isotopic enrichment water samples for no3 analysis were collected prior and after the isotope addition at the start of the time series incubation the cylinders were sealed with gas tight plastic lids avoiding bubbles at intervals of approximately 4 h and over an incubation time of 8 h the cores were sampled through the perforated lid using a glass syringe equipped with a viton tubing the water removed was replaced with new water from the tank and the dilution factor was considered in the calculations from each core a 40 ml subsample was transferred to a 12 ml exetainer labco ltd containing 200 μl of 7 m zncl2 for 15nh4 and 15n2 measurements or filtered on a pre combusted gf 75 filter that was frozen 20 c for later po15n analysis denitrification and dnra rates were calculated according to bonaglia et al 2016 3 d e n i t r i f i c a t i o n r a t e 30 n 2 r f n o 3 2 4 d n r a r a t e 15 nh 4 r f n o 3 2 where 30n2r is the production rate of labelled n2 15nh4 r is the production rate of labelled nh4 and f no3 is the fraction of 15n in the no3 pool 2 5 benthic nutrient flux and no3 reduction rate measurements a total of 16 large sediment cores were submerged into an incubation tank containing 200 l of aerated collected field water kept at a constant temperature 21 3 0 2 c cores were left uncapped in the tank to allow for full water mixing between the water inside the cores and tank bottom water a stirrer bar driven by an external magnet at 40 rpm was inserted to the water phase of each core approximately 15 cm above the sediment surface to avoid water stagnation during incubation after preincubation overnight a gas tight lid was placed on each core and dark incubations started four cores were immediately uncapped and 40 ml water aliquots were collected from each transferred into 12 ml exetainers labco ltd and fixed with 200 µl of 7 m zncl2 for further gas measurements a second 40 ml water aliquot was filtered gf 75 filters into a plastic test tube and frozen immediately at 20 c for dissolved n analyses see 2 6 section for details at 1 h time intervals four cores were uncapped and subsampled for respective analysis the cores were then returned back to tank for subsequent incubation the second incubation for no3 reduction followed the rationale of the revised isotope pairing technique r ipt risgaard petersen et al 2003 the overlying water inside each core was spiked with 15n no3 from a stock solution 20 mm na15no3 98 15n atom sigma aldrich to final concentrations of 15 µm 15n n 8 cores and 30 µm 15n n 8 cores to calculate the exact isotopic enrichment water samples for no3 analysis were collected prior and after the isotope addition the two different 15no3 concentrations were used to validate the method assumptions and to test for anammox activity risgaard petersen et al 2003 since the resulting rates were not significantly different assumptions were met anammox activity disregarded and denitrification rates pooled the cores were left uncapped for 45 min to allow enough time to establish a stable no3 concentration in the surface layer of the sediment at the start of the time course incubation all cores were capped with rubber stoppers and every 1 5 h four cores two per treatment were sacrificed and sediments were gently mixed with the overlying water down to the depth of 5 10 cm thereafter 20 ml aliquots of the slurry were transferred into 12 ml exetainers labco ltd and fixed with 200 μl of 7 m zncl2 for 29n2 and 30n2 analysis an additional 40 ml subsample was collected and treated with 1 3 m kcl vigorously shaken for 30 min centrifuged supernatant 3000 rpm for 10 min was filtered and frozen at 20 c for analyses of the exchangeable nh4 pool and the 15nh4 fraction all benthic rates were calculated

reduction processes with both active dnra and denitrification similar findings have been reported from other pelagic coastal systems but only after turning the water anoxic zeng et al 2019 consequently apparent denitrification rates in the previous study 6 107 nmol l 1 h 1 were 1 3 orders of magnitude higher than our measured rates table s2 to our knowledge this is the first report of genuinely active water column no3 reduction in shallow estuarine systems by combining results from the isotope tracer experiments and flux measurements in the benthic and pelagic compartments we were able to reconstruct the whole lagoon n cycle fig 5 our data show that no3 reduction in the water column was dominated by dnra 83 while in the sediment denitrification dominated 96 interestingly whole lagoon dnra was estimated to retain 19 of the fixed n2 that goes through the no3 pool intended as dnra dnra denitrification this highly organic and eutrophic estuarine system with dnra dominance over denitrification in the water column differs from the deep anoxic basins of the open baltic sea where denitrification is more prominent than dnra bonaglia et al 2016 dalsgaard et al 2013 hietanen et al 2012 the fact that water column dnra was higher than denitrification might be explained by the very high c no3 ratio in the pelagic environment which renders dnra thermodynamically more favourable kraft et al 2014 tiedje et al 1983 all water column processes were measured at full o2 saturation 255 µm o2 fig s2 during stagnation events when o2 respiration exceeds its supply bottom water can rapidly undergo hypoxia in the curonian lagoon fig s4 zilius et al 2014 under hypoxia the potential of the water column to significantly contribute to n recycling and n loss via dnra and denitrification respectively will increase dramatically klawonn et al 2015 considering that the lagoon was n limited and phytoplankton biomass was high we cannot exclude that a portion of the added 15no3 was assimilated by the phytoplankton and re mineralized to nh4 klawonn et al 2015 however we have three lines of evidence against this possibility first we could not measure any 15no3 being incorporated into po15n we acknowledge the fact that our 15no3 experiment was carried out in dark only and thus we cannot exclude that minimal no3 incorporation into po15n might have happened in light conditions but since the bottom waters of the lagoon are dark we are confident that 15no3 was carried out dissimilatory second we detected the highest amounts of nrfa rna transcripts in the bottom water compared to surface water and sediment these transcripts translate for a nitrite reductase enzyme used specifically in dnra mohan et al 2004 rna transcripts have previously been observed for this gene in oxic waters in the hypereutrophic lake taihu china krausfeldt et al 2017 however here we also conducted incubation experiments with 15no3 additions in both water and sediment to confirm that this was an active process the no3 reduction experiments indicated that dnra activity was higher than denitrification in the bottom water a pattern that was further confirmed by the higher number of nrfa transcripts compared to nirs ones third the major players in these waters planktothrix anabaena and dolichospermum have never been shown to our knowledge to be able to carry out dark no3 assimilation thus interpreting our chemistry and molecular results together we suggest that dnra was an active process in the oxygenated lagoon waters our results thus imply that dnra in the oxic waters can facilitate a complete nh4 cycling nh4 uptake mineralization nh4 release nitrification to no3 not directly measured in our study but supported by the rt qpcr amoa transcript data reduction to nh4 via dnra 4 2 pelagic niches for anaerobic process the transcription of marker genes encoding for no3 reduction and its derivatives typically occurs under low oxygen conditions härtig and zumft 1999 in our study this might have been associated with anoxic microniches on e g zooplankton carcasses stief et al 2018 and most likely on phytoplankton aggregates klawonn et al 2015 since the lagoon s water column was dominated by filamentous cyanobacteria it is very likely that anoxic microniches were present inside cyanobacterial aggregates klawonn et al 2015 we cannot exclude that denitrification and or dnra associated with suspended sediment particles xia et al 2017 may have contributed to the measured rates however we consider the latter process negligible since the lagoon is an extremely low energy ecosystem which is characterized by stagnant conditions especially during summer months with a water residence time of more than 4 months at the sampling site mėžinė et al 2019 bacteria capable of dnra are diverse and include e g bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria mohan et al 2004 which were also detected and attributed to dnra in our metagenome data for both the water and sediment notably bacteroidetes were uniquely associated with dnra genes compared to the other n cycling pathways most of the dnra genes were attributed to species parabacteroides distasonis and wolinella succinogenes in the uniprotkb database parabacteroides distasonis has been detected in e g the human gut ravcheev and thiele 2014 and in an anaerobic industrial wastewater reactor amended with no3 to promote dnra and denitrification xie et al 2015 wolinella succinogenes is a known n cycling bacterium capable of dnra and reduction of n2o to n2 hollocher 1996 luckmann et al 2014 moreover members of bacteroidetes are often found closely associated with filaments of cyanobacteria allgaier and grossart 2006 eigemann et al 2019 likely benefiting from cyanobacterial exudates adam et al 2016 most of the denitrification genes were attributed to achromobacter cycloclastes and pseudomonas aeruginosa both pseudomonas aeruginosa and achromobacter sp have been described capable of aerobic denitrification kathiravan and krishnani 2014 in addition the human pathogens brucella melitensis and e coli that have previously been detected in sediment and water zhou et al 2019 were also found to be associated with the detected denitrification genes our results suggest that low oxygen or anoxic microniches associated with cyanobacteria and other algae might have been essential for dnra and denitrification to function furthermore our measured chlorophyll a values are in the same range as those reported for other hypereutrophic waters in e g asia paerl et al 2011 xing et al 2005 and north america bigham et al 2009 norris and laws 2017 thus our findings of active no3 reduction in oxic waters are relevant for a large number of aquatic systems worldwide 4 3 recycling dominates over n2 fixation the nifh transcripts in our study indicated active diazotrophic communities in the water column and sediments the highest n2 fixation activity was measured in the surface water layer where also the cyanobacterial biomass was higher likely explained by enhanced growth due to photosynthesis castenholz 2015 yet we could detect relatively high n2 fixation rates in the dark bottom water more work is required to understand how long these cyanobacteria can fix n2 in dark conditions under high energetic cost due to gas vesicle and mixing events heterocystous cyanobacteria can migrate upward to the surface layer walsby et al 1995 where they can gain energy during photosynthesis measured δ15n 2 21 from living material and nh4 uptake suggest that the pelagic communities of bacteria plus phytoplankton use a combined source of n for their growth since the particulate organic nitrogen from n2 alone would have a lower signal ca 2 voss et al 1997 our results show that n2 fixation rates only partly 13 meet nutritional needs for the microbial community fig 5 however up to 50 of this fixed n could be released as nh4 adam et al 2016 it seems likely that recycling of organic matter to nh4 supplies the major amount of required n which has previously been reported for other systems see e g présing et al 2001 and recently also for the coastal baltic sea klawonn et al 2019 measured high nh4 uptake rates and low standing concentration 1 µm further indicate high turnover rates of nh4 in the water column we suggest that under n limitation the lagoon efficiently fixes and recycles n via coupled n2 fixation organic matter oxidation and assimilative processes thus this recycling allows the conspicuous presence of non fixing cyanobacteria 52 of total phytoplankton biomass and other phytoplankton 23 biomass based on microscopy counts data s2 which typically thrive in periods of higher inorganic n availability paerl and otten 2013 the study site is representative of 55 of the lagoon s surface water zilius et al 2014 which allows for upscaling processes in a wider context including n inputs removal and recycling the physical conditions are generally stable in the summer that lead to stratified waters but strong wind events are observed in autumn and winter that cause resuspension mėžinė et al 2019 making our extrapolation representative only for the summer period in this area pelagic n2 fixation delivers 45 of the total n input n2 fixation din release and tn riverine input during summer with intensive cyanobacterial blooms july september assuming that the main tributary delivers 10 075 t of n zilius et al 2018 considering the denitrification rates only 11 of n input 1133 t is removed from the lagoon ecosystem this is supported by a calculated low denitrification efficiency 22 sensu eyre and ferguson 2009 thus the largest part of n is recycled in the system including via dnra in the water column 5 conclusions we have shown that hypereutrophic oxygenated waters contain active dnra and to a lesser extent denitrification which were likely conducted in anoxic microniches related to the large growth of filamentous algae microbial genera associated with detected dnra genes were predominated by parabacteroides and wolinella while denitrification genes were associated with pseudomonas achromobacter and brucella with dnra being active in the processing of nitrate reduction to the more bioavailable and less mobile ammonium this process might sustain the growth of the pelagic community even further our data support the presence of a complete ammonium re cycling within the oxic waters of the lagoon with clear implications for the enhancement of eutrophication since the conditions found in the studied lagoon e g chlorophyll a concentrations are similar to those found in other hypereutrophic systems bigham et al 2009 norris and laws 2017 paerl et al 2011 xing et al 2005 we argue that our findings of active dnra in oxic waters are relevant for a large number of aquatic systems worldwide enhanced water column dnra might lower the capacity for these ecosystems to provide services such as water filtration carbon

17153,since the start of synthetic fertilizer production more than a hundred years ago the coastal ocean has been exposed to increasing nutrient loading which has led to eutrophication and extensive algal blooms such hypereutrophic waters might harbor anaerobic nitrogen n cycling processes due to low oxygen microniches associated with abundant organic particles but studies on nitrate reduction in coastal pelagic environments are scarce here we report on 15n isotope labeling experiments metagenome and rt qpcr data from a large hypereutrophic lagoon indicating that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra and denitrification were active processes even though the bulk water was fully oxygenated 224 µm o2 dnra in the bottom water corresponded to 83 of whole ecosystem dnra water sediment while denitrification was predominant in the sediment microbial taxa important for dnra according to the metagenomic data were dominated by bacteroidetes genus parabacteroides and proteobacteria genus wolinella while denitrification was mainly associated with proteobacterial genera pseudomonas achromobacter and brucella the metagenomic and microscopy data suggest that these anaerobic processes were likely occurring in low oxygen microniches related to extensive growth of filamentous cyanobacteria including diazotrophic dolichospermum and non diazotrophic planktothrix by summing the total nitrate fluxes through dnra and denitrification it results that dnra retains approximately one fifth 19 of the fixed n that goes through the nitrate pool this is noteworthy as dnra represents thus a very important recycling mechanism for fixed n which sustains algal proliferation and leads to further enhancement of eutrophication in these endangered ecosystems graphical abstract

anoxia especially in scarcely ventilated and stratified aquatic systems breitburg et al 2018 carpenter et al 1998 under these conditions p is quickly recycled through internal feedback and diazotrophs such as bloom forming cyanobacteria capable of n2 fixation become the main source of biological n montoya et al 2004 the arising conditions in which the system presents nuisance algal blooms low visibility 1 5 m and extremely high 50 µg l 1 chlorophyll a concentrations are called hypereutrophic paerl et al 2011 under oxic conditions nitrifying bacteria oxidize the fixed ammonium nh4 to nitrate no3 which is further reduced to n2 under anoxic conditions through denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox canfield et al 2005 in addition to these two no3 depending pathways no3 may be reduced by another metabolic process the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra which recycles fixed n in the system laboratory reactor studies have demonstrated that this process is in competition for free no3 with denitrification van den berg et al 2015 and its activity may increase when organic carbon is in surplus over no3 i e a high c no3 ratio kraft et al 2014 recent literature has also shown that this process is ubiquitous in multiple aquatic environments due to the presence of oxic anoxic interfaces where no3 is supplied via the oxic interface and together with the availability of electron donors organic matter sulfide etc facilitate dnra activity e g caffrey et al 2019 hellemann et al 2020 klawonn et al 2015 stief et al 2018 in eutrophic lakes and coastal waters the strictly anaerobic no3 reduction pathways are mostly constrained to the top mm sediment layers canfield et al 2005 because of the vast size of benthic ecosystems the oxic anoxic interface in sediments constitutes the largest n loss environment on earth seitzinger et al 2006 water column anoxia can also host intense anaerobic n cycling processes when no3 is available and no3 reduction pathways move vertically from the sediment to the water column e g bonaglia et al 2016 in addition to anoxic sediment and waters dnra and denitrification have also been described in a number of other anoxic microenvironments found on zooplankton carcasses e g stief et al 2018 and phytoplankton aggregates e g klawonn et al 2015 bulk water incubation experiments aimed at quantifying rates of no3 reduction have therefore generally focused on anoxic sulfidic waters e g brettar and rheinheimer 1991 suboxic waters of oxygen minimum zones e g dalsgaard et al 2003 and on baltic sea waters at the oxic anoxic interface bonaglia et al 2016 except for a recent study reporting on coupled nitrification denitrification associated with suspended sediment particles in riverine water xia et al 2017 to our knowledge studies quantifying no3 reduction in oxic waters are still missing in order to bridge this gap we carried out a combination of geochemical and molecular assessments of an array of aerobic and anaerobic n cycling processes in a hypereutrophic model system the curonian lagoon baltic sea which constitutes the largest lagoon in europe due to external loading and internal nutrient cycling this lagoon presents massive phytoplankton blooms throughout the summer and chlorophyll a concentrations well above 50 µg l 1 zilius et al 2014 the water column might therefore contain anoxic microenvironments making dnra and denitrification possible even though the water column is oxygenated we hypothesized that 1 the lagoon oxic bottom waters have the potential for hosting active no3 reduction processes 2 in the highly organic and eutrophic waters dnra rates are higher than denitrification and 3 sediment no3 reduction is quantitatively higher than in the water column we tested these hypotheses by applying a combination of 15n incubation experiments metagenomic analysis and quantitative reverse transcription pcr rt qpcr of both pelagic and benthic environments 2 material and methods 2 1 field sampling water and sediment samples were collected on the 26th of august 2019 in the south central half of the curonian lagoon close to the resort town nida 55 17 2388 n 21 01 2898 e fig 1 this part of the lagoon has a 3 5 m water depth a water renewal time of 190 days annual mean and the water is situated above fluffy oxygen depleted and organic rich sediment umgiesser et al 2016 zilius et al 2014 during sampling in situ temperature oxygen and salinity profiles were measured in the water column using an ysi 460 multiprobe xylem fig s1 in addition vertical profiles of photosynthetically active radiation par were measured with a li 192 underwater quantum sensor li cor water samples were collected in triplicate from the surface 0 5 m depth and bottom 3 m depth layers using a 2 l ruttner water sampler and transferred to 1 sterilized 1 l amber borosilicate bottles for molecular and flow cytometer analysis 2 opaque 2 l hpde bottles for chemical analyses of environmental variables and 3 plastic 10 l tanks for measurements of nutrient transformation rates additional samples 40 ml from both the surface and bottom layers were preserved in 50 ml centrifuge tubes with acetic lugol s solution for microscopic phytoplankton counting finally 200 l of bottom water was collected for preincubation and incubation procedures in the laboratory during sampling 16 large i d 8 cm 30 cm length and 7 small i d 4 6 cm 25 cm length intact sediment cores were collected using a hand corer within 50 150 m of the sampling station the large cores were used for benthic net flux and no3 reduction processes measurements while the small cores were used for sediment characterization and nucleic acids extraction all water and sediment samples were transported back to the laboratory within 1 hour on ice except for the 10 and 25 l plastic tanks and immediately analysed water and sediment cores collected in the field were used in various incubation experiments to quantify different n cycling pathways see table 1 for an overview of these experiments 2 2 water column n2 fixation experiment pelagic n2 fixation was determined using the 15n2 technique according to montoya et al 1996 the samples were filled without air bubbles into 500 ml transparent hdpe bottles and through a gas tight septum each sample received 0 5 ml 15n2 98 15n2 sigma aldrich as the isotopic equilibration takes up to several hours mohr et al 2010 we incubated the samples for 24 h mulholland et al 2012 wannicke et al 2018 surface water samples n 3 were incubated in outdoor tanks at ambient irradiance 14 h light and 10 h dark while bottom water samples n 3 were wrapped in aluminum foil as in situ irradiance was below 1 of surface par at these depths three controls without 15n2 tracer each for the surface and bottom water were incubated in parallel after incubation the suspended material was collected on pre combusted 8 h at 450 c advantec gf75 glass fiber filters 0 3 µm pore size for particulate organic po 15n analyses n2 fixation rates µmol l 1 h 1 were calculated following montoya et al 1996 as 1 n 2 fixation rate at 15 n pon at 15 n control at 15 n n 2 at 15 n control pon t where at 15n is the atom percentage of 15n in the pon pool in 15n amended samples at 15n pon and in control samples at 15n control and in the dissolved n2 pool at 15n n2 pon is the amount of particulate organic nitrogen and t is the incubation time all samples were stored frozen until analysis volumetric rates of n2 fixation were calculated by converting areal rates taking into account the depth of the water column and the thickness of each layer montoya et al 1996 2 3 water column nh4 assimilation experiment ammonium assimilation rates in the water column were conducted based on a method previously described by bartl et al 2018 briefly 27 250 ml polycarbonate bottles were filled with collected field water to the top avoiding bubbles sealed and assigned in triplicates to the following treatments a 9 bottom water in dark b 9 surface water in light and c 9 surface water in dark a volume of 200 µl from a 312 5 µm 15nh4cl stock solution 99 15n atom sigma aldrich was injected to a final concentration of 0 3 µm 15nh4 through the butyl septum this was followed by short incubations with three time points t0 t1 1 5 h and t2 3 h at each time point bottles n 3 were sacrificed and 60 70 ml of water were filtered on a pre combusted 25 mm advantec gf75 glass fiber filters for po15n analyses filters were frozen at 20 c until analysis additional aliquots of filtered water 15 ml were frozen at 20 c for nutrient analyses see below ammonium consumption rates were calculated following glibert et al 1982 klawonn et al 2019 during incubations the 15nh4 concentrations commonly decrease exponentially with time due to the concurrent assimilation of 15nh4 and dilution through 14nh4 regeneration to account for this exponential decrease we used a non linear curve fitting 2 k l n c t c 0 t where ct and c0 are the 15nh4 concentrations at time t and time zero respectively note that we did not measure the 15nh4 concentrations directly but calculated them as the difference between the initially added amount of 15nh4 and the amount of 15n in the pon at each time point since total nh4 concentrations were not significantly different between time points t test p range 0 07 1 00 nh4 consumption and remineralisation rates were similar and calculated as k c with c as the mean nh4 concentrations during incubations glibert et al 1982 since we used the amount of 15n in the pon to calculate nh4 consumption rates those can be considered as nh4 assimilation rates 2 4 water column nutrient transformation and no3 reduction experiment eight large plexiglass cylinders i d 8 cm 30 cm length filled with 1 3 l of bottom water each were submerged into an incubation tank containing approximately 20 l of aerated collected field water and maintained at constant temperature 21 3 0 2 c two stirrer bars driven by an external magnet at 40 rpm were inserted in each cylinder approximately at 10 cm height distance to each other to avoid water stagnation during incubation a first incubation for oxygen consumption and nutrient transformation processes nh4 no3 no2 was conducted by sealing four of the cylinders with rubber stoppers while avoiding bubbles the incubation was conducted in the dark and lasted six hours and before and at the end a 20 ml of aliquot was subsampled filtered gf 75 filters and frozen at 20 c for nutrient analysis dissolved o2 was monitored with a pre calibrated oxygen microsensor ox 50 microsensor unisense a s a second incubation using the other set of four cylinders was performed to target no3 reduction processes by means of the 15no3 tracer addition technique the water inside each cylinder was spiked with 15n no3 from a stock solution 20 mm na15no3 98 15n atom sigma aldrich to a final concentration of 15 µm 15n to calculate the exact isotopic enrichment water samples for no3 analysis were collected prior and after the isotope addition at the start of the time series incubation the cylinders were sealed with gas tight plastic lids avoiding bubbles at intervals of approximately 4 h and over an incubation time of 8 h the cores were sampled through the perforated lid using a glass syringe equipped with a viton tubing the water removed was replaced with new water from the tank and the dilution factor was considered in the calculations from each core a 40 ml subsample was transferred to a 12 ml exetainer labco ltd containing 200 μl of 7 m zncl2 for 15nh4 and 15n2 measurements or filtered on a pre combusted gf 75 filter that was frozen 20 c for later po15n analysis denitrification and dnra rates were calculated according to bonaglia et al 2016 3 d e n i t r i f i c a t i o n r a t e 30 n 2 r f n o 3 2 4 d n r a r a t e 15 nh 4 r f n o 3 2 where 30n2r is the production rate of labelled n2 15nh4 r is the production rate of labelled nh4 and f no3 is the fraction of 15n in the no3 pool 2 5 benthic nutrient flux and no3 reduction rate measurements a total of 16 large sediment cores were submerged into an incubation tank containing 200 l of aerated collected field water kept at a constant temperature 21 3 0 2 c cores were left uncapped in the tank to allow for full water mixing between the water inside the cores and tank bottom water a stirrer bar driven by an external magnet at 40 rpm was inserted to the water phase of each core approximately 15 cm above the sediment surface to avoid water stagnation during incubation after preincubation overnight a gas tight lid was placed on each core and dark incubations started four cores were immediately uncapped and 40 ml water aliquots were collected from each transferred into 12 ml exetainers labco ltd and fixed with 200 µl of 7 m zncl2 for further gas measurements a second 40 ml water aliquot was filtered gf 75 filters into a plastic test tube and frozen immediately at 20 c for dissolved n analyses see 2 6 section for details at 1 h time intervals four cores were uncapped and subsampled for respective analysis the cores were then returned back to tank for subsequent incubation the second incubation for no3 reduction followed the rationale of the revised isotope pairing technique r ipt risgaard petersen et al 2003 the overlying water inside each core was spiked with 15n no3 from a stock solution 20 mm na15no3 98 15n atom sigma aldrich to final concentrations of 15 µm 15n n 8 cores and 30 µm 15n n 8 cores to calculate the exact isotopic enrichment water samples for no3 analysis were collected prior and after the isotope addition the two different 15no3 concentrations were used to validate the method assumptions and to test for anammox activity risgaard petersen et al 2003 since the resulting rates were not significantly different assumptions were met anammox activity disregarded and denitrification rates pooled the cores were left uncapped for 45 min to allow enough time to establish a stable no3 concentration in the surface layer of the sediment at the start of the time course incubation all cores were capped with rubber stoppers and every 1 5 h four cores two per treatment were sacrificed and sediments were gently mixed with the overlying water down to the depth of 5 10 cm thereafter 20 ml aliquots of the slurry were transferred into 12 ml exetainers labco ltd and fixed with 200 μl of 7 m zncl2 for 29n2 and 30n2 analysis an additional 40 ml subsample was collected and treated with 1 3 m kcl vigorously shaken for 30 min centrifuged supernatant 3000 rpm for 10 min was filtered and frozen at 20 c for analyses of the exchangeable nh4 pool and the 15nh4 fraction all benthic rates were calculated following established protocols bonaglia et al 2014 2 6 water analysis water samples were filtered gf 75 filters within 1 5 h of collection into 10 ml pe tubes for dissolved inorganic nutrient nh4 no2 nox dip and 25 ml glass vials for organic nitrogen don analysis and frozen immediately 20 c all dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations from field sampling and experiments were determined with a

phi x174 controls sequences were removed by using seqprep 1 2 st john 2011 and by mapping reads against the phix genome using bowtie2 2 3 4 3 langmead and salzberg 2012 respectively the reads were quality trimmed using trimmomatic 0 36 bolger et al 2014 using command leading 20 trailing 20 minlen 100 which yielded final quality trimmed reads with an average length of 145 bp and 34 5 million

62 602 n 2 as well as nirs transcripts 1329 2716 n 2 table 4 4 discussion 4 1 water column nitrate reduction processes we found that the oxic bottom water of the hypereutrophic model system hosted no3 reduction processes with both active dnra and denitrification similar findings have been reported from other pelagic coastal systems but only after turning the water anoxic zeng et al 2019 consequently apparent denitrification rates in the previous study 6 107 nmol l 1 h 1 were 1 3 orders of magnitude higher than our measured rates table s2 to our knowledge this is the first report of genuinely active water column no3 reduction in shallow estuarine systems by combining results from the isotope tracer experiments and flux measurements in the benthic and pelagic compartments we were able to reconstruct the whole lagoon n cycle fig 5 our data show that no3 reduction in the water column was dominated by dnra 83 while in the sediment denitrification dominated 96 interestingly whole lagoon dnra was estimated to retain 19 of the fixed n2 that goes through the no3 pool intended as dnra dnra denitrification this highly organic and eutrophic estuarine system with dnra dominance over denitrification in the water column differs from the deep anoxic basins of the open baltic sea where denitrification is more prominent than dnra bonaglia et al 2016 dalsgaard et al 2013 hietanen et al 2012 the fact that water column dnra was higher than denitrification might be explained by the very high c no3 ratio in the pelagic environment which renders dnra thermodynamically more favourable kraft et al 2014 tiedje et al 1983 all water column processes were measured at full o2 saturation 255 µm o2 fig s2 during stagnation events when o2 respiration exceeds its supply bottom water can rapidly undergo hypoxia in the curonian lagoon fig s4 zilius et al 2014 under hypoxia the potential of the water column to significantly contribute to n recycling and n loss via dnra and denitrification respectively will increase dramatically klawonn et al 2015 considering that the lagoon was n limited and phytoplankton biomass was high we cannot exclude that a portion of the added 15no3 was assimilated by the phytoplankton and re mineralized to nh4 klawonn et al 2015 however we have three lines of evidence against this possibility first we could not measure any 15no3 being incorporated into po15n we acknowledge the fact that our 15no3 experiment was carried out in dark only and thus we cannot exclude that minimal no3 incorporation into po15n might have happened in light conditions but since the bottom waters of the lagoon are dark we are confident that 15no3 was carried out dissimilatory second we detected the highest amounts of nrfa rna transcripts in the bottom water compared to surface water and sediment these transcripts translate for a nitrite reductase enzyme used specifically in dnra mohan et al 2004 rna transcripts have previously been observed for this gene in oxic waters in the hypereutrophic lake taihu china krausfeldt et al 2017 however here we also conducted incubation experiments with 15no3 additions in both water and sediment to confirm that this was an active process the no3 reduction experiments indicated that dnra activity was higher than denitrification in the bottom water a pattern that was further confirmed by the higher number of nrfa transcripts compared to nirs ones third the major players in these waters planktothrix anabaena and dolichospermum have never been shown to our knowledge to be able to carry out dark no3 assimilation thus interpreting our chemistry and molecular results together we suggest that dnra was an active process in the oxygenated lagoon waters our results thus imply that dnra in the oxic waters can facilitate a complete nh4 cycling nh4 uptake mineralization nh4 release nitrification to no3 not directly measured in our study but supported by the rt qpcr amoa transcript data reduction to nh4 via dnra 4 2 pelagic niches for anaerobic process the transcription of marker genes encoding for no3 reduction and its derivatives typically occurs under low oxygen conditions härtig and zumft 1999 in our study this might have been associated with anoxic microniches on e g zooplankton carcasses stief et al 2018 and most likely on phytoplankton aggregates klawonn et al 2015 since the lagoon s water column was dominated by filamentous cyanobacteria it is very likely that anoxic microniches were present inside cyanobacterial aggregates klawonn et al 2015 we cannot exclude that denitrification and or dnra associated with suspended sediment particles xia et al 2017 may have contributed to the measured rates however we consider the latter process negligible since the lagoon is an extremely low energy ecosystem which is characterized by stagnant conditions especially during summer months with a water residence time of more than 4 months at the sampling site mėžinė et al 2019 bacteria capable of dnra are diverse and include e g bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria mohan et al 2004 which were also detected and attributed to dnra in our metagenome data for both the water and sediment notably bacteroidetes were uniquely associated with dnra genes compared to the other n cycling pathways most of the dnra genes were attributed to species parabacteroides distasonis and wolinella succinogenes in the uniprotkb database parabacteroides distasonis has been detected in e g the human gut ravcheev and thiele 2014 and in an anaerobic industrial wastewater reactor amended with no3 to promote dnra and denitrification xie et al 2015 wolinella succinogenes is a known n cycling bacterium capable of dnra and reduction of n2o to n2 hollocher 1996 luckmann et al 2014 moreover members of bacteroidetes are often found closely associated with filaments of cyanobacteria allgaier and grossart 2006 eigemann et al 2019 likely benefiting from cyanobacterial exudates adam et al 2016 most of the denitrification genes were attributed to achromobacter cycloclastes and pseudomonas aeruginosa both pseudomonas aeruginosa and achromobacter sp have been described capable of aerobic denitrification kathiravan and krishnani 2014 in addition the human pathogens brucella melitensis and e coli that have previously been detected in sediment and water zhou et al 2019 were also found to be associated with the detected denitrification genes our results suggest that low oxygen or anoxic microniches associated with cyanobacteria and other algae might have been essential for dnra and denitrification to function furthermore our measured chlorophyll a values are in the same range as those reported for other hypereutrophic waters in e g asia paerl et al 2011 xing et al 2005 and north america bigham et al 2009 norris and laws 2017 thus our findings of active no3 reduction in oxic waters are relevant for a large number of aquatic systems worldwide 4 3 recycling dominates over n2 fixation the nifh transcripts in our study indicated active diazotrophic communities in the water column and sediments the highest n2 fixation activity was measured in the surface water layer where also the cyanobacterial biomass was higher likely explained by enhanced growth due to photosynthesis castenholz 2015 yet we could detect relatively high n2 fixation rates in the dark bottom water more work is required to understand how long these cyanobacteria can fix n2 in dark conditions under high energetic cost due to gas vesicle and mixing events heterocystous cyanobacteria can migrate upward to the surface layer walsby et al 1995 where they can gain energy during photosynthesis measured δ15n 2 21 from living material and nh4 uptake suggest that the pelagic communities of bacteria plus phytoplankton use a combined source of n for their growth since the particulate organic nitrogen from n2 alone would have a lower signal ca 2 voss et al 1997 our results show that n2 fixation rates only partly 13 meet nutritional needs for the microbial community fig 5 however up to 50 of this fixed n could be released as nh4 adam et al 2016 it seems likely that recycling of organic matter to nh4 supplies the major amount of required n which has previously been reported for other systems see e g présing et al 2001 and recently also for the coastal baltic sea klawonn et al 2019 measured high nh4 uptake rates and low standing concentration 1 µm further indicate high turnover rates of nh4 in the water column we suggest that under n limitation the lagoon efficiently fixes and recycles n via coupled n2 fixation organic matter oxidation and assimilative processes thus this recycling allows the conspicuous presence of non fixing cyanobacteria 52 of total phytoplankton biomass and other phytoplankton 23 biomass based on microscopy counts data s2 which typically thrive in periods of higher inorganic n availability paerl and otten 2013 the study site is representative of 55 of the lagoon s surface water zilius et al 2014 which allows for upscaling processes in a wider context including n inputs removal and recycling the physical conditions are generally stable in the summer that lead to stratified waters but strong wind events are observed in autumn and winter that cause resuspension mėžinė et al 2019 making our extrapolation representative only for the summer period in this area pelagic n2 fixation delivers 45 of the total n input n2 fixation din release and tn riverine input during summer with intensive cyanobacterial blooms july september assuming that the main tributary delivers 10 075 t of n zilius et al 2018 considering the denitrification rates only 11 of n input 1133 t is removed from the lagoon ecosystem this is supported by a calculated low denitrification efficiency 22 sensu eyre and ferguson 2009 thus the largest part of n is recycled in the system including via dnra in the water column 5 conclusions we have shown that hypereutrophic oxygenated waters contain active dnra and to a lesser extent denitrification which were likely conducted in anoxic microniches related to the large growth of filamentous algae microbial genera associated with detected dnra genes were predominated by parabacteroides and wolinella while denitrification genes were associated with pseudomonas achromobacter and brucella with dnra being active in the processing of nitrate reduction to the more bioavailable and less mobile ammonium this process might sustain the growth of the pelagic community even further our data support the presence of a complete ammonium re cycling within the oxic waters of the lagoon with clear implications for the enhancement of eutrophication since the conditions found in the studied lagoon e g chlorophyll a concentrations are similar to those found in other hypereutrophic systems bigham et al 2009 norris and laws 2017 paerl et al 2011 xing et al 2005 we argue that our findings of active dnra in oxic waters are relevant for a large number of aquatic systems worldwide enhanced water column dnra might lower the capacity for these ecosystems to provide services such as water filtration carbon

17154,in this study we designed an integrated electrochemical filtration system for catalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate pms and degradation of aqueous microcontaminants composites of carbon nanotube cnt and nanoscale zero valence copper nzvc were developed to serve as high performance catalysts electrode and filtration media simultaneously we observed both radical and nonradical reaction pathways which collectively contributed to the degradation of model pollutants congo red was completely removed via a single pass through the nzvccnt filter τ 2 s at neutral ph the rapid kinetics of congo red degradation were maintained across a wide ph range from 3 0 7 0 in complicated matrixes e g tap water and lake water and for the degradation of a wide array of persistent organic contaminants the superior activity of nzvccnt stems from the boosted redox cycles of cu2 cu in the presence of an external electric field the flow through design remarkably outperformed the conventional batch system due to the convection enhanced mass transport mechanism studies suggested that the carbonyl group and electrophilic oxygen of cnt served as electron donor and electron acceptor respectively to activate pms to generate oh and 1o2 via one electron transport the electron deficient cu atoms are prone to react with pms via surface hydroxyl group to produce reactive intermediates cu2 o o so3 and then 1o2 will be generated by breaking the coordination bond of the metastable intermediate the study will provide a green strategy for the remediation of organic pollution by a highly efficient and integrated system based on catalytic oxidation electrochemistry and nano filtration techniques graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peroxymonosulfate copper singlet oxygen hydroxyl radical carbocatalysis 1 introduction peroxymonosulfate pms based advanced oxidation processes aops has been extensively studied for water purification via radical and nonradical pathways ji et al 2018 lyu et al 2019 the radical mechanism involves the generation of sulfate radicals so4 and or hydroxyl radicals oh by the external stimuli e g heat photo radio and electricity or via a one electron reduction reaction of pms to cleave the peroxide oo bond over a catalyst chen et al 2020a cheng et al 2019 liu et al 2019b wang et al 2020e in contrast in a nonradical pathway the organics act as an electron donor to direct sacrifice electron s to the surface activated pms catalyst complex the electron acceptor leading to the oxidation of the pollutant via a charge migration process qin et al 2020 it is widely recognized that transition metals are popular pms activators to generate free radicals li et al 2018 yan et al 2019 while carbonaceous materials activate pms in a nonradical manner hu et al 2020 wang et al 2020a however some recent studies unveiled distinct behaviors for example fe mn oxides were reported to activate pms to generate singlet oxygen 1o2 as nonradical reactive oxygen species ros yu et al 2018 similar phenomena were also reported for other metal oxides such as mno2 co3o4 and sno2 khan et al 2018 liu et al 2020a hence the mechanisms of radical and nonradical regimes are still debatable which call for further exploration recently intensive efforts have been devoted to transition metal based heterogeneous catalysts for pms activation among them iron based catalysts can effectively activate pms but suffer several major limitations as those in fenton reactions e g a narrow ph range and the generation of iron sludge for post treatment martins et al 2011 cobalt based catalysts demonstrated excellent performances in pms activation but health concerns are raised due to potential leakage of toxic cobalt ions in water anipsitakis et al 2006 zhou et al 2018 alternatively copper based catalysts particularly nanoscale zero valence copper nzvc is a promising pms catalyst due to their high reactivity and wide ph working window nie et al 2017 reported that magnetic cu0 fe3o4 composites could efficiently activate pms to generate 1o2 which induced rapid and complete degradation of rhodamine b methylene blue orange ii phenol and 4 chlorophenol the activity of nzvc for pms activation relies on the cu2 cu redox cycles another benefit of choosing cu based catalysts was their reduced toxicity compared with that of co based ones a recent report indicated that the total hazard index of co 2 91 10 1 was 100 times higher than cu 3 08 10 3 dahmardeh behrooz et al 2021 there are still two major challenges in the cu based pms systems i the sluggish circulation kinetics of cu2 cu and ii the difficulty in recycling the nanoscale catalysts for the former the sluggish kinetics of cu2 to cu conversion usually lead to a low reaction rate thus poor degradation efficiency this is caused by the inevitable loss of cu2 that was dissolved into the solution from the solid catalyst surface for example a cu2ocu c fenton catalyst demonstrated significant decay in performance over consecutive cycles under acidic ph conditions due to copper corrosion sun et al 2018 several tactics have been developed to boost the cu2 cu circulation for example the addition of small molecule reductants e g hydroxylamine is effective to accelerate the cu2 cu cycle xiang et al 2019 although the introduction of adventitious chemicals is not desirable in practical applications for the second challenge although several nzvc catalysts have been recently developed for pms activation these nanoscale catalysts can hardly be used in practical application due to the poor stability and requirement for post separation and regeneration weon et al 2020 this can be addressed by anchoring the active compounds onto supports to enhance the structural robustness and to achieve easy recovery and reuse in addition the adsorption and oxidation kinetics in conventional batch reactors are typically limited by mass transfer this is due to the slow diffusion of pms to the catalyst surface and the generated ros to react with target pollutants in the bulk solution to this end a flow through design is more advantageous because of convection enhanced mass transfer as compared with the conventional batch electrochemistry the phenol removal rate was increased by 10 folds under a plug flow configuration liu et al 2019a cnt has been reported to trigger an electron transfer process from the organic donor to the carbon activated pms to fulfil a redox process the nonradical process occurs dominantly at the catalyst solution interfaces which is different from the radical pathways in the bulk solution duan et al 2018b ren et al 2020 found that nitrogen doping elevated the potential of metastable carbon pms complex and improved the organic removal efficiency via intensified pms adsorption and electron transfer meanwhile thanks to the outstanding electric physicochemical and mechanical properties the one dimensional structure of cnt can be constructed into stable large surface and conductive networks liu et al 2020b the derived 3d networks are promising candidates as a substrate for loading nanocatalysts an electrode for electrochemical reactions and a filtration membrane for a continuous flow reactor however the composite filter consists of nzvc and cnt have yet been evaluated in the pms based aops system regarding removal efficiency reaction pathways and engineering feasibility it is anticipated that applying an electric field may further improve the robustness of the loaded nzvc

ml of 0 5 m nabh4 solution further flew through the cnt coocu2 networks at a flow rate of 1 ml min to attain in situ reduction of cu2 to cu0 the obtained filter was denoted as nzvccnt hybrid filter 2 2 electrochemical pms activation for organic compounds removal to eliminate the contribution of physical adsorption induced organic removal all the experiments were conducted after achieving adsorption saturation of the filter by passing through 150 ml of 0 015 mm congo red solution at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min for 2 5 h two operational modes e g single pass filtration and batch were conducted for comparison electrochemical filtration experiments were performed using a commercial whatman polycarbonate filtration casing with modifications see fig s1 vecitis et al 2011 the as fabricated nzvccnt filter was used as the cathode and a perforated titanium plate was used as the anode flow rate was controlled by an ismatec ism833c peristaltic pump switzerland in a typical experiment 50 ml of 0 015 mm congo red solution with 1 5 mm pms passed through the system the impacts of cu loading 0 to 0 2 mm pms concentration 0 to 1 5 mm flow rate 1 0 to 2 5 ml min solution ph 3

solution ph was adjusted by 1 m naoh and or hcl applied voltage was controlled by a dc power supply model dh1766a 1 and the electric current was measured by a multimeter model fluke 18b china to further evaluate the practicability of the system congo red spiked tap and lake water jingyue lake within the donghua campus shanghai samples as well as few other refractory and or emerging contaminants e g methylene blue methyl orange antibiotic tetracycline and bisphenol a also challenged the filtration system all the experiments were conducted in triplicate to ensure reproducibility 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of the nzvccnt filter the surface morphology of nzvccnt membrane was characterized by fesem and fetem techniques as shown in fig 1 a no apparent change in the macroscale morphology of cnt was observed after loading nzvc fetem results in fig 1b suggest that these introduced nzvc particles possessed an average diameter of 1 2 nm in nearly spherical shapes which are grafted along the cnt cooh sidewalls cross sectional views of the cnt and nzvccnt filters revealed a similar thickness of both samples 100 μm fig s2a and b which is in well accordance with that obtained using a thickness gauge see fig s2c e the contact angle of a pristine cnt filter was 90 see fig s3 while the contact angle of a nzvccnt filter was close to 0 due to the increased hydrophilicity after the hno3 treatment similar brunauer emmett teller surface area 127 vs 117 m2 g pore volumes 0 355 vs 0 352 cm3 g fig s4 and tensile strength 0 55 mpa vs 0 57 mpa fig s5 of cnt and nzvccnt filter indicated that the presence of nzvc particles negligibly impacted the porous structure as well as the mechanical properties of cnt xrd spectra indicated an amorphous phase resulting from the low crystal degree of nzvc see fig s6a based on the tga analysis the weight loss above 400 c can be ascribed to the decomposition of carboxylic functional groups on the cnt surface baharudin et al 2020 the content of the loaded cu species was determined to be 10 8 wt see fig s6b xps was further employed to confirm the valence state of loaded cu onto the cnt filter as displayed in fig 2 a the cu 2p3 2 peaks can be split into cu0 cu and cu2 centered at 932 5 933 2 and 935 5 ev desario et al 2019 in the cu 2p1 2 spectra the peaks centered at 952 952 4 and 953 7 ev corresponded to the signal of cu cu0 and cu2 respectively chi et al 2019 ye et al 2020 according to previous reports copper oxides are prone to form due to the inevitable spontaneous corrosion of cu0 during the preparation process iqbal et al 2019 fig 2b and c showed the xps spectra of cu at an applied voltage of 0 v and 0 5 v respectively in addition the high resolution o 1 s spectra of fresh nzvccnt sample in fig 2d were deconvoluted into three separate peaks centered at 531 7 533 1 and 533 7 ev assigned to cu oh co and co respectively xu et al 2020 all these results suggested the successful preparation of nzvccnt hybrid filters 3 2 electrochemical pms activation toward organic degradation to evaluate the catalytic activity of the as developed nzvccnt filter toward pms activation a common refractory azo dye congo red was used as a model organic pollutant kwiecińska et al 2020 fig 3 illustrated the degradation performance of congo red under various experimental conditions as a function of time under neutral ph 6 5 0 5 the congo red degradation by pms alone 1 5 mm was insignificant only 15 of pms degradation was observed in 40 min which was due to the low oxidative capability of pms only 9 7 of congo red was removed in the absence of pms via adsorption by the filter in catalytic systems pure cnt showed a mediocre activity toward pms activation with 46 8 of congo red decomposition after flowing through the system when a potential of 0 5 v was applied to the cnt pms system the efficiency was not obviously improved although few electricity intensified carbon pms systems were previously reported baharudin et al 2020 liu et al 2019b nie et al 2018 compared with the commercial carbon cloth 25 1 of congo red removal in single pass mode cnt demonstrated 24 2 of increment in congo red degradation possibly due to the enlarged specific surface area as well as improved electric conductivity previous studies revealed that cnt acts as a bridge to facilitate electron transfer from the adsorbed organic compounds to the activated pms by the conductive sp2 hybridized carbon network duan et al 2014 in addition several transition metals e g cu fe and mn were also capable to activate pms to degrade organics ding et al 2016 ye et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 in this work commercial nzvc supported by ptfe membrane removed 49 5 of congo red by a single pass through the hybrid filter at 0 5 v such catalytic activity was similar to that of the cnt pms system a complete degradation of congo red was observed in the nzvccnt system at 0 5 v indicating a significant synergy among the electric field nzvc and cnt noted that the hydraulic retention time hrt within the filer was only 1 2 s indicating an excellent performance of the integrated system to demonstrate the decisive role of the electric field on cu2 cu cycling control experiment in absence of electric field was performed as expected the initial degradation efficiency of congo red was as high as that in the presence of the electric field but the activity gradually decayed with time after 40 min of filtration the degradation efficiency decreased to 51 0 the decline in activity may be due to the cu loss and the poor cycling of cu2 cu without the stimulation of external electric field 3 3 mechanism study 3 3 1 identification of reactive species cnt has been reported as an electron mediator to coordinate charge transport from organic compounds to pms resulting in organic pollutant oxidation without the involvement of radical ros and singlet oxygen duan et al 2014 to detect such oxidation process furfuryl alcohol ffa and methanol were added into congo red solution simultaneously to quench the radical and single oxygen mediated oxidation as observed in fig s7 congo red was barely degraded by the cnt pms system regardless of the presence of electric field or not suggesting that this system did not involve the electron transfer pathway to further elucidate the origins of ros in the system the reaction solution was pre purged with n2 for 1 h to eliminate dissolved oxygen prior to reaction and n2 was continuously injected to maintain the oxygen deficient environment during the degradation process the similar degradation profile in the n2 saturated nzvccnt pms system indicated that dissolved oxygen did not contribute to the formation of ros these results provided solid evidences that ros originated from pms activation by nzvccnt assisted with the electric field previous studies indicated that pms activation involved different mechanisms including both radical and nonradical pathways duan et al 2018a wang et al 2020d to identify ros generated in the nzvccnt pms filtration system chemical quenching experiments were first performed using different radical scavengers i e tert butyl alcohol tba methanol na2co3 and ffa tba was used as a quencher for oh due to their high affinity k 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 compared with that of so4 k 4 0 9 1 105 m 1s 1 zhu et al 2020 methanol are reactive toward both oh k 1 2 2 8 109 m 1s 1 and so4 k 1 6 7 7 107 m 1s 1 and ffa were used to verify the contribution from 1o2 as illustrated in fig 4 a excessive tba inhibited congo red degradation and the reaction rate decreased from 1 20 to 0 51 min 1 which is similar to the system with methanol 0 51 min 1 fig 4b this phenomenon implied that so4 has negligible contribution to congo red degradation and some other radical or nonradical reactive species may participate in this process firstly we investigated the presence of superoxide radical o2 by employing na2co3 as a specific quenching agent wang et al 2020b with na2co3 concentration increased from 0 to 100 mm the cr degradation efficiency decreased from 100 to 68 0 consequently it is well known that o2 is the parent species for 1o2 we further verified the presence of 1o2 using ffa as scavenger chen et al 2020b as shown in fig 4c when 100 mm ffa was spiked 70 0 of congo red degradation was inhibited which is in well accordance with the contribution of o2 this revealed that 1o2 was significantly contributed to the organic degradation via nonradical pathway the proportional contributions of oh and 1o2 were calculated to be 30 2 and 69 8 respectively see text s4 and table s1 to shed light on the reaction pathway electron paramagnetic resonance epr was further conducted using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp as spin trapping agents to capture the short lifetime radicals and 1o2 respectively see fig 5 a typical three line characteristic temp 1o2 signals with an intensity ratio of 1 1 1 and a very weak four line characteristic signals of dmpo oh with multiplied intensities 1 2 2 1 appeared for the system with only pms these signals might originate from the slow decomposition of pms in water which mainly generated 1o2 as depicted in eq 1 1 hso 5 so 5 2 hso 4 so 4 2 2 1 o 2 previous studies suggested that hso5 was the dominant pms species in weak acidic medium while so5 2 was the dominant pms species under weak alkaline conditions donald and john 1955 then 1o2 was produced via the nucleophilic attack of so5 2 toward the peroxide oxygen of hso5 the considerably intensified signals in the presence of cnt suggesting the improved yields of 1o2 and oh while negligible change was observed when a weak electric field was introduced this was consistent with the degradation results in fig 3 despite that transition metals oxides have been extensively reported to activate pms or peroxydisulfate pds to produce radical ros sheng et al 2019 wang et al 2020d nzvc pms was merely involved in the generation of 1o2 via a nonradical pathway as displayed in fig 5a epr spectra did not show the characteristic signals for so4 in the presence of dmpo probably due to the limited yield or their rapid transformation to oh however we obtained several signal peaks in addition to dmpo oh which can be ascribed to the hyperfine splitting of dmpo x stemmed from the fast oxidation of dmpo the generation of dmpo x affirms the powerful oxidizing capacity of the ros generated from the nzvccnt pms system these signals may also be dmpoh induced by the reduction treatment of nabh4 during the materials preparation although the presence of o2 has been confirmed in the quenching experiments it was hard to capture its characteristic peaks by dmpo in aqueous solution due to the high disproportionation rate of o2 that inhibits the reaction between o2 and dmpo or the overlapped signals by dmpo x or dmpo oh ma et al 2018 to verify this we performed the radical capture experiment in absolute methanol instead of ultrapure water ye et al 2020 methanol suppressed the disproportionation of o2 and spontaneously quenched oh and so4 as indicted in fig s8 the characteristic signals of dmpoo2 were observed further verifying the generation of o2 luo et al 2019 hence both radical and nonradical pathways contribute to the organic degradation collaboratively in the proposed electrocatalytic filtration system 3 3 2 interactions between the nzvccnt and pms previous studies reported that carbonaceous materials can stimulate pms to degrade organic pollutants via multiple oxidative pathways in view of electron affinity both electrophilic e g peroxides and superoxides and nucleophilic e g co oxygen species exist on carbonaceous materials generally both nucleophilic co and electrophilic groups can activate pms to generate reactive radicals via electron transfer li et al 2020 recently revealed that co played an essential role in pms activation by theoretical simulations similar conclusions were also obtained by duan et al 2018b these claims were supported by the xps results in fig 2e where the proportion of co decreased and the content of co increased after the reaction this indicated that the electron rich co groups served as the pms activation centers by sacrificing electrons to break the peroxide oo bond of pms eq 2 liu et al 2014 peng et al 2013 also defects in cnts may contribute to the generation of 1o2 cheng et al 2019 however other routes may also contribute to the formation of 1o2 previous study suggested that the electrophilic oxygen on the surface of cnt played an essential role in the production of 1o2 xu et al 2020 to verify this claim we applied ki and h2so4 to deactivate the electrophilic oxygen groups xu et al 2020 eq 5 6 since the solution ph also impacted the system efficacy we first treated the nzvccnt filter with ki and h2so4 and then performed the adsorption saturation and filtration this could eliminate the negative impact of h2so4 on the solution ph as well as the treatment efficiency by comparing the catalytic performances of cnt before and after the iodometric titration a noticeable decline in the degradation efficiency was observed from 51 0 control group to 27 7 see fig s9 hence the functions of electrophilic peroxide o2 2 and superoxide species o2 were verified that these electron deficient species abstracted one electron from pms to generate singlet oxygen through electron transfer and radical self quenching reactions eq 3 4 2 hso 5 e oh so 4 2 3 hso 5 e h hso 5 4 2 so 5 so 4 o 2 so 4 1 o 2 2 so 4 5 o 2 2 2 ki 2 h 2 s o 4 o 2 2 khs o 4 i 2 h 2 o 6 2 o 2 6 ki 6 h 2 s o 4 o 2 6 khs o 4 3 i 2 3 h 2 o epr trapping and quenching experiments showed that 1o2 played an essential role in organic degradation by comparing the epr spectra of nzvccnt pms and cnt pms the driving force of 1o2 generation was the cu species results of quenching experiments also indicated the involvement of o2 in the nzvccnt pms system next the process of 1o2 generation was explored these pms molecules may combine with the catalyst to form metastable complexes as the intermediate for ros generation to evaluate the type of the complexation the effect of ionic strength was investigated wang et al 2020c increasing the ionic strength will affect the electrostatic interactions outer sphere interactions in a heterogeneous system by compressing the thickness of the electric double layers whereas the inner sphere interactions are hardly influenced feng et al 2016 fig s10a illustrated that the degradation efficiency was not affected with the increase of ionic strength 1 10 mm naclo4 which indicated that the interactions between nzvc and pms occurred via the inner sphere complexation additionally as observed from the xps diagram an obvious decline of the content of hydroxyl group was observed after reaction highlighting the indispensable role of cu oh in nzvccnt for pms activation li et al 2020 verified that oh was inactive for pms activation by density functional theory calculations and chemical quenching experiments therefore cu plays an indispensable role in the nzvccnt pms system the study suggested that some surface hydroxy groups were replaced by pms during the complexation of pms with nzvc particles based on above findings we speculated that the partial surface cu atoms appeared in an electron deficient state which are prone to react with pms via surface hydroxyl groups to produce reactive copper intermediates cu2 o o so3 eq 7 then 1o2 was generated by breaking the coordination bond of the metastable intermediate after accepting an electron from another pms molecule eq 8 subsequently 1o2 was produced from coupling of two o2 eq 9 10 on the other hand it was reported that so5 from the decomposition of hso5 possibly combined with the cu site to generate 1o2 via eq 11 12 however since the decomposition rate of pms to produce 1o2 was very low the corresponding contribution should be insignificant lou et al 2017 the cod removal efficiency of congo red was up to 78 9 indicating the as developed heterogeneous pms activation process have the potential to serve as a powerful technique for practical applications the proposed mechanism of pms activation using electrochemical nzvccnt filter was summarized in scheme 1 7 c u 2 oh h o o so 3 c u 2 o o so 3 h 2 o 8 2 c u 2 o o so 3 3 h 2 o hso 5 2 c u oh 3 so 4 2 2 o 2 5 h 9 c u 2 o o so 3 o 2 o h c u oh so 4 2 3 1 o 2 10 2 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 1 o 2 h 2 o 2 2 o h 11 hso 5 so 5 h e 12 2 c u 2 so 5 2 c u 2 2 so 4 2 1 o 2 3 3 3 reactive sites of congo red and degradation pathways as shown in fig 6 a the molecular structure of congo red is geometrically symmetric thus only half of the atoms were considered for dft calculations the results indicated that n21 f 0 0 0312 n22 f 0 0 0363 c27 f 0 0 0320 n55 f 0 0 0234 o59 f 0 0 0499 and o61 f 0 0 0499 possessed a high fukui index and were the most vulnerable sites in congo red to be attacked by oh or 1o2 see fig 6b based on the calculations and previous studies erdemoğlu et al 2008 güy et al 2016 li et al 2013 sakkas et al 2010 three primary degradation pathways of congo red were proposed and displayed in fig 6c firstly the attack of n21 or n22 sites by ros led to the cleavage of the nn bond and compounds d and e were produced consequently further oxidation of e results in deamination for the formation of i secondly attack on c27 and n55 sites led to the deamination and production of compounds b and c in addition h was produced after the further cleavage of nn bond from c thirdly the attack on o60 and o61 sites of the sulfo group resulted in desulfonation and production of compounds f and g subsequent deamination of g led to the formation of j in a subsequent reaction h i and j would be further oxidized to lower molecular weight compounds in addition previous researches also reported that hydroxycyclohexadienyl radical may be formed after being attacked by electrophilic radicals such as oh neta et al 1977 pan et al 1993 thus we further explored the results of oh attack on congo red from the perspective of reaction energy via dft calculation see fig s11 the gibbs free energy results indicate that oh is more likely to add on the c atom around the benzene ring and sulfonic acid group pathway b shown in fig s11 δg 26 51 kcal mol rather than generate hydrocyclohexadienyl radical after electron transfer pathway a shown in fig s11 δg 37 20 kcal mol therefore the possibility of hydrocyclohexadienyl radical formation is different from benzene first congo red contains electrophilic sites with high reactivity see fig 6 and electrophilic radicals tend to attack these active sites secondly due to the structure of congo red molecule containing electrophilic functional groups like sulfonic acid group even if the hydrocyclohexadienyl radial is formed the conjugated structure of the aromatic rings and massive delocalized π electrons will lead to capture of electrons from the active functional groups thus resulting in quench of the hydrocyclohexadienyl radicals therefore the radicals attack mechanism and congo red degradation pathway are consistent with the results we present in fig 6 3 4 system efficacy evaluation the impact of operational parameters and solution chemistry on the system efficacy was available in the supporting information see text s5 fig s10 and fig s12 to evaluate the practicability of nzvccnt pms the stability and validity of the designed flow through system was tested experiments for simulated wastewater were conducted in tap water or lake water containing 0 015 mm congo red in a single pass mode see fig s13a although tap water contains various mineral ions the efficiency of the catalytic filtration system did not compromise compared with that in ultrapure water which was attributed to the stable inner sphere complexation of cu2 o o so3 that was not affected by the ionic strength a satisfactory degradation efficiency was also attained in lake water 90 0 in metal based catalysis the transition metals with variable valence states can coordinate redox reactions and meanwhile the process will cause the leakage of metal ions for example sun et al prepared reduced oxide supported iron oxide catalyst to activate pms and the iron loss was up to 12 5 wt sun et al 2020 in this study the cu loss was identified to be 0 02 mg g which accounted for less than 1 wt of initial cu loading complete pollutant removal was remained after 2 5 h continuous operation see fig s13b demonstrating the structural and chemical robustness of the as developed composite catalysts finally to verify the universal applicability of this system a few other types of refractory contaminants with different molecular structures e g methylene blue a cation refractory azo dye methyl orange an anionic refractory azo dye tetracycline a typical antibiotic bisphenol a an emerging contaminant were further evaluated in the electrochemical filtration system see fig s13c the results suggested that all of these organic compounds can be effectively degraded by a single pass through the catalytic filtration system despite that the degradation efficiency of bisphenol a was slightly lower still above 70 all of the above results indicated the outstanding practicability of the nzvccnt pms system furthermore the energy consumption of our electrochemical filtration system was calculated to be only 0 0084 kwh m3 under the optimal conditions an applied voltage of 0 5 v with a corresponding current of 1 0 ma this value is lower than state of art electrochemical process which consumed 0 1 40 kwh m3 ferreira et al 2020 table s2 quantitatively exemplify the superiority of the proposed technology with reported electro filtration systems in terms of organic degradation efficiencies energy requirement and stability these findings suggested that our nzvccnt pms system provided a promising aops technique with high efficiency and low energy chemical input which can be harnessed for the practical treatment of complicated water matrixes 4 conclusions in summary we designed a novel electrocatalytic filtration and oxidation system with pms the system realized rapid and effective degradation of various selected model compounds both radical and nonradical pathways contributed to the organic oxidation processes the boosted oxidation kinetics of the coupled technology lies in the facilitated circulation of cu2 cu couples with the assistance of the electric field the flow through design provided convection enhanced mass transport leading to excellent performance compared to the conventional batch system the system remained a high efficacy across a wide ph range and in complicated water matrixes therefore the electrocatalytic membrane based aops system provides a promising technology for the remediation of organic contamination in a sustainable manner

17154,in this study we designed an integrated electrochemical filtration system for catalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate pms and degradation of aqueous microcontaminants composites of carbon nanotube cnt and nanoscale zero valence copper nzvc were developed to serve as high performance catalysts electrode and filtration media simultaneously we observed both radical and nonradical reaction pathways which collectively contributed to the degradation of model pollutants congo red was completely removed via a single pass through the nzvccnt filter τ 2 s at neutral ph the rapid kinetics of congo red degradation were maintained across a wide ph range from 3 0 7 0 in complicated matrixes e g tap water and lake water and for the degradation of a wide array of persistent organic contaminants the superior activity of nzvccnt stems from the boosted redox cycles of cu2 cu in the presence of an external electric field the flow through design remarkably outperformed the conventional batch system due to the convection enhanced mass transport mechanism studies suggested that the carbonyl group and electrophilic oxygen of cnt served as electron donor and electron acceptor respectively to activate pms to generate oh and 1o2 via one electron transport the electron deficient cu atoms are prone to react with pms via surface hydroxyl group to produce reactive intermediates cu2 o o so3 and then 1o2 will be generated by breaking the coordination bond of the metastable intermediate the study will provide a green strategy for the remediation of organic pollution by a highly efficient and integrated system based on catalytic oxidation electrochemistry and nano filtration techniques graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peroxymonosulfate copper singlet oxygen hydroxyl radical carbocatalysis 1 introduction peroxymonosulfate pms based advanced oxidation processes aops has been extensively studied for water purification via radical and nonradical pathways ji et al 2018 lyu et al 2019 the radical mechanism involves the generation of sulfate radicals so4 and or hydroxyl radicals oh by the external stimuli e g heat photo radio and electricity or via a one electron reduction reaction of pms to cleave the peroxide oo bond over a catalyst chen et al 2020a cheng et al 2019 liu et al 2019b wang et al 2020e in contrast in a nonradical pathway the organics act as an electron donor to direct sacrifice electron s to the surface activated pms catalyst complex the electron acceptor leading to the oxidation of the pollutant via a charge migration process qin et al 2020 it is widely recognized that transition metals are popular pms activators to generate free radicals li et al 2018 yan et al 2019 while carbonaceous materials activate pms in a nonradical manner hu et al 2020 wang et al 2020a however some recent studies unveiled distinct behaviors for example fe mn oxides were reported to activate pms to generate singlet oxygen 1o2 as nonradical reactive oxygen species ros yu et al 2018 similar phenomena were also reported for other metal oxides such as mno2 co3o4 and sno2 khan et al 2018 liu et al 2020a hence the mechanisms of radical and nonradical regimes are still debatable which call for further exploration recently intensive efforts have been devoted to transition metal based heterogeneous catalysts for pms activation among them iron based catalysts can effectively activate pms but suffer several major limitations as those in fenton reactions e g a narrow ph range and the generation of iron sludge for post treatment martins et al 2011 cobalt based catalysts demonstrated excellent performances in pms activation but health concerns are raised due to potential leakage of toxic cobalt ions in water anipsitakis et al 2006 zhou et al 2018 alternatively copper based catalysts particularly nanoscale zero valence copper nzvc is a promising pms catalyst due to their high reactivity and wide ph working window nie et al 2017 reported that magnetic cu0 fe3o4 composites could efficiently activate pms to generate 1o2 which induced rapid and complete degradation of rhodamine b methylene blue orange ii phenol and 4 chlorophenol the activity of nzvc for pms activation relies on the cu2 cu redox cycles another benefit of choosing cu based catalysts was their reduced toxicity compared with that of co based ones a recent report indicated that the total hazard index of co 2 91 10 1 was 100 times higher than cu 3 08 10 3 dahmardeh behrooz et al 2021 there are still two major challenges in the cu based pms systems i the sluggish circulation kinetics of cu2 cu and ii the difficulty in recycling the nanoscale catalysts for the former the sluggish kinetics of cu2 to cu conversion usually lead to a low reaction rate thus poor degradation efficiency this is caused by the inevitable loss of cu2 that was dissolved into the solution from the solid catalyst surface for example a cu2ocu c fenton catalyst demonstrated significant decay in performance over consecutive cycles under acidic ph conditions due to copper corrosion sun et al 2018 several tactics have been developed to boost the cu2 cu circulation for example the addition of small molecule reductants e g hydroxylamine is effective to accelerate the cu2 cu cycle xiang et al 2019 although the introduction of adventitious chemicals is not desirable in practical applications for the second challenge although several nzvc catalysts have been recently developed for pms activation these nanoscale catalysts can hardly be used in practical application due to the poor stability and requirement for post separation and regeneration weon et al 2020 this can be addressed by anchoring the active compounds onto supports to enhance the structural robustness and to achieve easy recovery and reuse in addition the adsorption and oxidation kinetics in conventional batch reactors are typically limited by mass transfer this is due to the slow diffusion of pms to the catalyst surface and the generated ros to react with target pollutants in the bulk solution to this end a flow through design is more advantageous because of convection enhanced mass transfer as compared with the conventional batch electrochemistry the phenol removal rate was increased by 10 folds under a plug flow configuration liu et al 2019a cnt has been reported to trigger an electron transfer process from the organic donor to the carbon activated pms to fulfil a redox process the nonradical process occurs dominantly at the catalyst solution interfaces which is different from the radical pathways in the bulk solution duan et al 2018b ren et al 2020 found that nitrogen doping elevated the potential of metastable carbon pms complex and improved the organic removal efficiency via intensified pms adsorption and electron transfer meanwhile thanks to the outstanding electric physicochemical and mechanical properties the one dimensional structure of cnt can be constructed into stable large surface and conductive networks liu et al 2020b the derived 3d networks are promising candidates as a substrate for loading nanocatalysts an electrode for electrochemical reactions and a filtration membrane for a continuous flow reactor however the composite filter consists of nzvc and cnt have yet been evaluated in the pms based aops system regarding removal efficiency reaction pathways and engineering feasibility it is anticipated that applying an electric field may further improve the robustness of the loaded nzvc catalysts due to the accelerated redox cycle of cu2 cu herein we designed a novel electrocatalytic continuous flow filtration system based on a composite catalyst of nzvccnt for highly efficient pms

adsorption saturation of the filter by passing through 150 ml of 0 015 mm congo red solution at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min for 2 5 h two operational modes e g single pass filtration and batch were conducted for comparison electrochemical filtration experiments were performed using a commercial whatman polycarbonate filtration casing with modifications see fig s1 vecitis et al 2011 the as fabricated nzvccnt filter was used as the cathode and a perforated titanium plate was used as the anode flow rate was controlled by an ismatec ism833c peristaltic pump switzerland in a typical experiment 50 ml of 0 015 mm congo red solution with 1 5 mm pms passed through the system the impacts of cu loading 0 to 0 2 mm pms concentration 0 to 1 5 mm flow rate 1 0 to 2 5 ml min solution ph 3

further evaluate the practicability of the system congo red spiked tap and lake water jingyue lake within the donghua campus shanghai samples as well as few other refractory and or emerging contaminants e g methylene blue methyl orange antibiotic tetracycline and bisphenol a also challenged the filtration system all the experiments were conducted in triplicate to ensure reproducibility 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of the nzvccnt filter the surface morphology of nzvccnt membrane was characterized by fesem and fetem techniques as shown in fig 1 a no apparent change in the macroscale morphology of cnt was observed after loading nzvc fetem results in fig 1b suggest that these introduced nzvc particles possessed an average diameter of 1 2 nm in nearly spherical shapes which are grafted along the cnt cooh sidewalls cross sectional views of the cnt and nzvccnt filters revealed a similar thickness of both samples 100 μm fig s2a and b which is in well accordance with that obtained using a thickness gauge see fig s2c e the contact angle of a pristine cnt filter was 90 see fig s3 while the contact angle of a nzvccnt filter was close to 0 due to the increased hydrophilicity after the hno3 treatment similar brunauer emmett teller surface area 127 vs 117 m2 g pore volumes 0 355 vs 0 352 cm3 g fig s4 and tensile strength 0 55 mpa vs 0 57 mpa fig s5 of cnt and nzvccnt filter indicated that the presence of nzvc particles negligibly impacted the porous structure as well as the mechanical properties of cnt xrd spectra indicated an amorphous phase resulting from the low crystal degree of nzvc see fig s6a based on the tga analysis the weight loss above 400 c can be ascribed to the decomposition of carboxylic functional groups on the cnt surface baharudin et al 2020 the content of the loaded cu species was determined to be 10 8 wt see fig s6b xps was further employed to confirm the valence state of loaded cu onto the cnt filter as displayed in fig 2 a the cu 2p3 2 peaks can be split into cu0 cu and cu2 centered at 932 5 933 2 and 935 5 ev desario et al 2019 in the cu 2p1 2 spectra the peaks centered at 952 952 4 and 953 7 ev corresponded to the signal of cu cu0 and cu2 respectively chi et al 2019 ye et al 2020 according to previous reports copper oxides are prone to form due to the inevitable spontaneous corrosion of cu0 during the preparation process iqbal et al 2019 fig 2b and c showed the xps spectra of cu at an applied voltage of 0 v and 0 5 v respectively in addition the high resolution o 1 s spectra of fresh nzvccnt sample in fig 2d were deconvoluted into three separate peaks centered at 531 7 533 1 and 533 7 ev assigned to cu oh co and co respectively xu et al 2020 all these results suggested the successful preparation of nzvccnt hybrid filters 3 2 electrochemical pms activation toward organic degradation to evaluate the catalytic activity of the as developed nzvccnt filter toward pms activation a common refractory azo dye congo red was used as a model organic pollutant kwiecińska et al 2020 fig 3 illustrated the degradation performance of congo red under various experimental conditions as a function of time under neutral ph 6 5 0 5 the congo red degradation by pms alone 1 5 mm was insignificant only 15 of pms degradation was observed in 40 min which was due to the low oxidative capability of pms only 9 7 of congo red was removed in the absence of pms via adsorption by the filter in catalytic systems pure cnt showed a mediocre activity toward pms activation with 46 8 of congo red decomposition after flowing through the system when a potential of 0 5 v was applied to the cnt pms system the efficiency was not obviously improved although few electricity intensified carbon pms systems were previously reported baharudin et al 2020 liu et al 2019b nie et al 2018 compared with the commercial carbon cloth 25 1 of congo red removal in single pass mode cnt demonstrated 24 2 of increment in congo red degradation possibly due to the enlarged specific surface area as well as improved electric conductivity previous studies revealed that cnt acts as a bridge to facilitate electron transfer from the adsorbed organic compounds to the activated pms by the conductive sp2 hybridized carbon network duan et al 2014 in addition several transition metals e g cu fe and mn were also capable to activate pms to degrade organics ding et al 2016 ye et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 in this work commercial nzvc supported by ptfe membrane removed 49 5 of congo red by a single pass through the hybrid filter at 0 5 v such catalytic activity was similar to that of the cnt pms system a complete degradation of congo red was observed in the nzvccnt system at 0 5 v indicating a significant synergy among the electric field nzvc and cnt noted that the hydraulic retention time hrt within the filer was only 1 2 s indicating an excellent performance of the integrated system to demonstrate the decisive role of the electric field on cu2 cu cycling control experiment in absence of electric field was performed as expected the initial degradation efficiency of congo red was as high as that in the presence of the electric field but the activity gradually decayed with time after 40 min of filtration the degradation efficiency decreased to 51 0 the decline in activity may be due to the cu loss and the poor cycling of cu2 cu without the stimulation of external electric field 3 3 mechanism study 3 3 1 identification of reactive species cnt has been reported as an electron mediator to coordinate charge transport from organic compounds to pms resulting in organic pollutant oxidation without the involvement of radical ros and singlet oxygen duan et al 2014 to detect such oxidation process furfuryl alcohol ffa and methanol were added into congo red solution simultaneously to quench the radical and single oxygen mediated oxidation as observed in fig s7 congo red was barely degraded by the cnt pms system regardless of the presence of electric field or not suggesting that this system did not involve the electron transfer pathway to further elucidate the origins of ros in the system the reaction solution was pre purged with n2 for 1 h to eliminate dissolved oxygen prior to reaction and n2 was continuously injected to maintain the oxygen deficient environment during the degradation process the similar degradation profile in the n2 saturated nzvccnt pms system indicated that dissolved oxygen did not contribute to the formation of ros these results provided solid evidences that ros originated from pms activation by nzvccnt assisted with the electric field previous studies indicated that pms activation involved different mechanisms including both radical and nonradical pathways duan et al 2018a wang et al 2020d to identify ros generated in the nzvccnt pms filtration system chemical quenching experiments were first performed using different radical scavengers i e tert butyl alcohol tba methanol na2co3 and ffa tba was used as a quencher for oh due to their high affinity k 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 compared with that of so4 k 4 0 9 1 105 m 1s 1 zhu et al 2020 methanol are reactive toward both oh k 1 2 2 8 109 m 1s 1 and so4 k 1 6 7 7 107 m 1s 1 and ffa were used to verify the contribution from 1o2 as illustrated in fig 4 a excessive tba inhibited congo red degradation and the reaction rate decreased from 1 20 to 0 51 min 1 which is similar to the system with methanol 0 51 min 1 fig 4b this phenomenon implied that so4 has negligible contribution to congo red degradation and some other radical or nonradical reactive species may participate in this process firstly we investigated the presence of superoxide radical o2 by employing na2co3 as a specific quenching agent wang et al 2020b with na2co3 concentration increased from 0 to 100 mm the cr degradation efficiency decreased from 100 to 68 0 consequently it is well known that o2 is the parent species for 1o2 we further verified the presence of 1o2 using ffa as scavenger chen et al 2020b as shown in fig 4c when 100 mm ffa was spiked 70 0 of congo red degradation was inhibited which is in well accordance with the contribution of o2 this revealed that 1o2 was significantly contributed to the organic degradation via nonradical pathway the proportional contributions of oh and 1o2 were calculated to be 30 2 and 69 8 respectively see text s4 and table s1 to shed light on the reaction pathway electron paramagnetic resonance epr was further conducted using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp as spin trapping agents to capture the short lifetime radicals and 1o2 respectively see fig 5 a typical three line characteristic temp 1o2 signals with an intensity ratio of 1 1 1 and a very weak four line characteristic signals of dmpo oh with multiplied intensities 1 2 2 1 appeared for the system with only pms these signals might originate from the slow decomposition of pms in water which mainly generated 1o2 as depicted in eq 1 1 hso 5 so 5 2 hso 4 so 4 2 2 1 o 2 previous studies suggested that hso5 was the dominant pms species in weak acidic medium while so5 2 was the dominant pms species under weak alkaline conditions donald and john 1955 then 1o2 was produced via the nucleophilic attack of so5 2 toward the peroxide oxygen of hso5 the considerably intensified signals in the presence of cnt suggesting the improved yields of 1o2 and oh while negligible change was observed when a weak electric field was introduced this was consistent with the degradation results in fig 3 despite that transition metals oxides have been extensively reported to activate pms or peroxydisulfate pds to produce radical ros sheng et al 2019 wang et al 2020d nzvc pms was merely involved in the generation of 1o2 via a nonradical pathway as displayed in fig 5a epr spectra did not show the characteristic signals for so4 in the presence of dmpo probably due to the limited yield or their rapid transformation to oh however we obtained several signal peaks in addition to dmpo oh which can be ascribed to the hyperfine splitting of dmpo x stemmed from the fast oxidation of dmpo the generation of dmpo x affirms the powerful oxidizing capacity of the ros generated from the nzvccnt pms system these signals may also be dmpoh induced by the reduction treatment of nabh4 during the materials preparation although the presence of o2 has been confirmed in the quenching experiments it was hard to capture its characteristic peaks by dmpo in aqueous solution due to the high disproportionation rate of o2 that inhibits the reaction between o2 and dmpo or the overlapped signals by dmpo x or dmpo oh ma et al 2018 to verify this we performed the radical capture experiment in absolute methanol instead of ultrapure water ye et al 2020 methanol suppressed the disproportionation of o2 and spontaneously quenched oh and so4 as indicted in fig s8 the characteristic signals of dmpoo2 were observed further verifying the generation of o2 luo et al 2019 hence both radical and nonradical pathways contribute to the organic degradation collaboratively in the proposed electrocatalytic filtration system 3 3 2 interactions between the nzvccnt and pms previous studies reported that carbonaceous materials can stimulate pms to degrade organic pollutants via multiple oxidative pathways in view of electron affinity both electrophilic e g peroxides and superoxides and nucleophilic e g co oxygen species exist on carbonaceous materials generally both nucleophilic co and electrophilic groups can activate pms to generate reactive radicals via electron transfer li et al 2020 recently revealed that co played an essential role in pms activation by theoretical simulations similar conclusions were also obtained by duan et al 2018b these claims were supported by the xps results in fig 2e where the proportion of co decreased and the content of co increased after the reaction this indicated that the electron rich co groups served as the pms activation centers by sacrificing electrons to break the peroxide oo bond of pms eq 2 liu et al 2014 peng et al 2013 also defects in cnts may contribute to the generation of 1o2 cheng et al 2019 however other routes may also contribute to the formation of 1o2 previous study suggested that the electrophilic oxygen on the surface of cnt played an essential role in the production of 1o2 xu et al 2020 to verify this claim we applied ki and h2so4 to deactivate the electrophilic oxygen groups xu et al 2020 eq 5 6 since the solution ph also impacted the system efficacy we first treated the nzvccnt filter with ki and h2so4 and then performed the adsorption saturation and filtration this could eliminate the negative impact of h2so4 on the solution ph as well as the treatment efficiency by comparing the catalytic performances of cnt before and after the iodometric titration a noticeable decline in the degradation efficiency was observed from 51 0 control group to 27 7 see fig s9 hence the functions of electrophilic peroxide o2 2 and superoxide species o2 were verified that these electron deficient species abstracted one electron from pms to generate singlet oxygen through electron transfer and radical self quenching reactions eq 3 4 2 hso 5 e oh so 4 2 3 hso 5 e h hso 5 4 2 so 5 so 4 o 2 so 4 1 o 2 2 so 4 5 o 2 2 2 ki 2 h 2 s o 4 o 2 2 khs o 4 i 2 h 2 o 6 2 o 2 6 ki 6 h 2 s o 4 o 2 6 khs o 4 3 i 2 3 h 2 o epr trapping and quenching experiments showed that 1o2 played an essential role in organic degradation by comparing the epr spectra of nzvccnt pms and cnt pms the driving force of 1o2 generation was the cu species results of quenching experiments also indicated the involvement of o2 in the nzvccnt pms system next the process of 1o2 generation was explored these pms molecules may combine with the catalyst to form metastable complexes as the intermediate for ros generation to evaluate the type of the complexation the effect of ionic strength was investigated wang et al 2020c increasing the ionic strength will affect the electrostatic interactions outer sphere interactions in a heterogeneous system by compressing the thickness of the electric double layers whereas the inner sphere interactions are hardly influenced feng et al 2016 fig s10a illustrated that the degradation efficiency was not affected with the increase of ionic strength 1 10 mm naclo4 which indicated that the interactions between nzvc and pms occurred via the inner sphere complexation additionally as observed from the xps diagram an obvious decline of the content of hydroxyl group was observed after reaction highlighting the indispensable role of cu oh in nzvccnt for pms activation li et al 2020 verified that oh was inactive for pms activation by density functional theory calculations and chemical quenching experiments therefore cu plays an indispensable role in the nzvccnt pms system the study suggested that some surface hydroxy groups were replaced by pms during the complexation of pms with nzvc particles based on above findings we speculated that the partial surface cu atoms appeared in an electron deficient state which are prone to react with pms via surface hydroxyl groups to produce reactive copper intermediates cu2 o o so3 eq 7 then 1o2 was generated by breaking the coordination bond of the metastable intermediate after accepting an electron from another pms molecule eq 8 subsequently 1o2 was produced from coupling of two o2 eq 9 10 on the other hand it was reported that so5 from the decomposition of hso5 possibly combined with the cu site to generate 1o2 via eq 11 12 however since the decomposition rate of pms to produce 1o2 was very low the corresponding contribution should be insignificant lou et al 2017 the cod removal efficiency of congo red was up to 78 9 indicating the as developed heterogeneous pms activation process have the potential to serve as a powerful technique for practical applications the proposed mechanism of pms activation using electrochemical nzvccnt filter was summarized in scheme 1 7 c u 2 oh h o o

2 so 5 2 c u 2 2 so 4 2 1 o 2 3 3 3 reactive sites of congo red and degradation pathways as shown in fig 6 a the molecular structure of congo red is geometrically symmetric thus only half of the atoms were considered for dft calculations the results indicated that n21 f 0 0 0312 n22 f 0 0 0363 c27 f 0 0 0320 n55 f 0 0 0234 o59 f 0 0 0499 and o61 f 0 0 0499 possessed a high fukui index and were the most vulnerable sites in congo red to be attacked by oh or 1o2 see fig 6b based on the calculations and previous studies erdemoğlu et al 2008 güy et al 2016 li et al 2013 sakkas et al 2010 three primary degradation pathways of congo red were proposed and displayed in fig 6c firstly the attack of n21 or n22 sites by ros led to the cleavage of the nn bond and compounds d and e were produced consequently further oxidation of e results in deamination for the formation of i secondly attack on c27 and n55 sites led to the deamination and production of compounds b and c in addition h was produced after the further cleavage of nn bond from c thirdly the attack on o60 and o61 sites of the sulfo group resulted in desulfonation and production of compounds f and g subsequent deamination of g led to the formation of j in a subsequent reaction h i and j would be further oxidized to lower molecular weight compounds in addition previous researches also reported that hydroxycyclohexadienyl radical may be formed after being attacked by electrophilic radicals such as oh neta et al 1977 pan et al 1993 thus we further explored the results of oh attack on congo red from the perspective of reaction energy via dft calculation see fig s11 the gibbs free energy results indicate that oh is more likely to add on the c atom around the benzene ring and sulfonic acid group pathway b shown in fig s11 δg 26 51 kcal mol rather than generate hydrocyclohexadienyl radical after electron transfer pathway a shown in fig s11 δg 37 20 kcal mol therefore the possibility of hydrocyclohexadienyl radical formation is different from benzene first congo red contains electrophilic sites with high reactivity see fig 6 and electrophilic radicals tend to attack these active sites secondly due to the structure of congo red molecule containing electrophilic functional groups like sulfonic acid group even if the hydrocyclohexadienyl radial is formed the conjugated structure of the aromatic rings and massive delocalized π electrons will lead to capture of electrons from the active functional groups thus resulting in quench of the hydrocyclohexadienyl radicals therefore the radicals attack mechanism and congo red degradation pathway are consistent with the results we present in fig 6 3 4 system efficacy evaluation the impact of operational parameters and solution chemistry on the system efficacy was available in the supporting information see text s5 fig s10 and fig s12 to evaluate the practicability of nzvccnt pms the stability and validity of the designed flow through system was tested experiments for simulated wastewater were conducted in tap water or lake water containing 0 015 mm congo red in a single pass mode see fig s13a although tap water contains various mineral ions the efficiency of the catalytic filtration system did not compromise compared with that in ultrapure water which was attributed to the stable inner sphere complexation of cu2 o o so3 that was not affected by the ionic strength a satisfactory degradation efficiency was also attained in lake water 90 0 in metal based catalysis the transition metals with variable valence states can coordinate redox reactions and meanwhile the process will cause the leakage of metal ions for example sun et al prepared reduced oxide supported iron oxide catalyst to activate pms and the iron loss was up to 12 5 wt sun et al 2020 in this study the cu loss was identified to be 0 02 mg g which accounted for less than 1 wt of initial cu loading complete pollutant removal was remained after 2 5 h continuous operation see fig s13b demonstrating the structural and chemical robustness of the as developed composite catalysts finally to verify the universal applicability of this system a few other types of refractory contaminants with different molecular structures e g methylene blue a cation refractory azo dye methyl orange an anionic refractory azo dye tetracycline a typical antibiotic bisphenol a an emerging contaminant were further evaluated in the electrochemical filtration system see fig s13c the results suggested that all of these organic compounds can be effectively degraded by a single pass through the catalytic filtration system despite that the degradation efficiency of bisphenol a was slightly lower still above 70 all of the above results indicated the outstanding practicability of the nzvccnt pms system furthermore the energy consumption of our electrochemical filtration system was calculated to be only 0 0084 kwh m3 under the optimal conditions an applied voltage of 0 5 v with a corresponding current of 1 0 ma this value is lower than state of art electrochemical process which consumed 0 1 40 kwh m3 ferreira et al 2020 table s2 quantitatively exemplify the superiority of the proposed technology with reported electro filtration systems in terms of organic degradation efficiencies energy requirement and stability these findings suggested that our nzvccnt pms system provided a promising aops technique with high efficiency and low energy chemical input which can be harnessed for the practical treatment of complicated water matrixes 4 conclusions in summary we designed a novel electrocatalytic filtration and oxidation system with pms the system realized rapid and effective degradation of various selected model compounds both radical and nonradical pathways contributed to the organic oxidation processes the boosted oxidation kinetics of the coupled technology lies in the facilitated circulation of cu2 cu couples with the assistance of the electric field the flow through design provided convection enhanced mass transport leading to excellent performance compared to the conventional batch system the system remained a high efficacy across a wide ph range and in complicated water matrixes therefore the electrocatalytic membrane based aops system provides a promising technology for the remediation of organic contamination in a sustainable manner
