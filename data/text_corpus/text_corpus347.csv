1735,water temperature is vitally important to the health of rivers and streams influencing the integrity of ecosystems aquatic biogeochemistry and the habitability of waterways for a variety of species while climate is often regarded as the primary driver of stream temperature regimes other factors including hydrology watershed characteristics and human impacts add substantial complexity to the variability of water temperatures however it remains challenging to disentangle the influence of these drivers through time and across rivers spanning diverse settings to quantify the underlying controls on river thermal regimes we applied conditional inference random forest models to predict maximum monthly stream temperatures and thermal sensitivities averaged across a 4 year period 2016 to 2020 at 410 watersheds spanning the conterminous united states maximum stream temperatures were selected given their ecological relevance while thermal sensitivity which measures the relationship between air and water temperatures was used to assess the responsiveness of stream temperatures to climate forcings we interpreted these random forest models using variable importance rankings describing seasonal and spatial variability in the dominant controls on water temperatures although our empirical results confirm that climate is indeed a primary control on temperature magnitude our models highlight the diversity in drivers of water temperature variability across seasons hydrologic regions and between metrics by combining random forest models with process based understanding of stream thermal regimes we provide new insights on the dynamic controls of water temperature variability across broad geographical domains informing region and season specific controls for tailored thermal watershed management and guiding the framing of future water temperature modeling keywords river water temperature thermal regimes random forest machine learning data availability the data and code used in this study are freely available on github at https github com jswade stream temperature rf 1 introduction the water temperature of streams is a leading control on overall water quality mediating the rate of solute processing and the viability of aquatic habitats caissie 2006 ouellet et al 2020 steel et al 2017 webb et al 2008 as such it is critical to understand the distribution of stream thermal regimes and to identify the underlying environmental drivers of water temperature variability though there are many examples of studies that have characterized key drivers of river flow regimes at regional national and global scales hammond et al 2021 konapala mishra 2020 price et al 2021 singh basu 2022 there are comparatively fewer studies that seek to categorize river thermal regimes over large geographical domains recent efforts to classify stream temperature behavior into distinct groups have emphasized that while general patterns in variability driven by regional climate gradients exist thermal regimes are strongly heterogeneous indicating the presence of other second order drivers garner et al 2014 hill et al 2014 maheu et al 2016 willis et al 2021 the controls on stream thermal regimes are diverse spanning a range of meteorologic landscape and hydrologic processes across nested space and time domains dugdale et al 2017 hannah garner 2015 webb 1996 although climate appears to be the dominant macro scale control on stream temperature hydrologic and watershed characteristics likely moderate climate forcings introducing complexity at the basin and reach scale hannah garner 2015 laiz√© et al 2017 supplementing these site specific controls the transformative effect of anthropogenic activity on earth system processes can perturb numerous aspects of stream thermal regimes croghan et al 2019 ficklin et al 2023 broadly human activity alters climate forcings on streams anthropogenic climate change as well as the hydrologic and landscape controls that mediate those forcings urbanization deforestation gw pumping channelization dam construction wetland destruction caissie 2006 poole berman 2001 given the close links between global climate patterns and stream thermal regimes future anthropogenic warming is anticipated to propagate into warming of water temperatures caldwell et al 2015 isaak et al 2012 michel et al 2022 van vliet et al 2011 however trends in future water temperatures are likely to be geographically non uniform due to the space time variability of watershed and hydrologic forcings kelleher et al 2021 therefore it is remarkably important both to the management of thermal regimes and to the ecosystem services provided by river networks to better understand how climate and watershed processes interact in space and time to control water temperature behavior relationships between hydrologic variables of interest such as stream temperature and moderating environmental factors are likely nonlinear and interactive for this reason many process based models struggle to uncover complex macro and basin scale patterns inherent to hydrologic systems nearing et al 2021 disentangling the primary controls on water quality variables and in specific stream temperature therefore requires the use of nonparametric data driven methods konapala mishra 2020 supervised machine learning algorithms are a popular tool in this context as such algorithms are capable of parsing large environmental datasets and inferring subtle relationships between input predictors and output variables without explicitly representing physical processes konapala mishra 2020 nearing et al 2021 tyralis et al 2019 in recent years machine learning has been increasingly applied to the prediction of stream temperature rahmani lawson et al 2021 rahmani shen et al 2021 sadler et al 2022 zwart et al 2022 by incorporating an extensive range of environmental predictors these data driven models are capable of generating robust and accurate simulations of stream temperature magnitude and variability across broad spatial scales however despite the frequent application of machine learning to water resources prediction only a limited number of studies use the technique to identify influential controls on hydrologic or thermal behavior addor et al 2018 gannon et al 2022 hammond et al 2021 hill et al 2014 konapala mishra 2020 though our understanding of controls on river temperature regimes continues to develop we still lack insight regarding how the dominant controls on thermal characteristics vary seasonally and across broad spatial scales to address this we leverage publicly available records of stream temperature and environmental covariates at 410 sites to explore the following questions 1 what are the relative influences of climate watershed characteristics hydrologic controls and anthropogenic disturbances on stream temperature magnitude and variability in the conterminous us 2 do the dominant drivers of stream thermal regimes differ seasonally and across spatial domains while stream thermal regimes are complex and can be quantified in myriad ways we focused on two primary metrics maximum water temperature and thermal sensitivity calculated monthly for all sites to infer key drivers of water temperature we applied a supervised machine learning approach to derive models predicting monthly water temperature metrics using a suite of environmental covariates to our knowledge our study represents one of the most comprehensive data driven investigations of empirical drivers of water temperature regimes that not only accounts for regional variability but also considers how drivers may vary at seasonal scales such insight is vital for not only improving our understanding of river temperature regimes but managing complex landscapes and the ecosystems they support now and into the future 2 material and methods the general approach of our methodology is outlined in fig 1 across selected stream sites we quantified two metrics of water temperature variability at a monthly time scale and extracted variables describing climate watershed characteristics hydrology and human impacts thought to either directly or indirectly shape water temperatures we then fit a suite of random forest models to predict water temperature metrics using these environmental covariates finally by leveraging variable importance metrics to rank predictors by their relative influence we inferred how dominant controls on river thermal regimes vary seasonally within specific geographic domains and across degrees of anthropogenic disruption 2 1 site selection we chose to investigate the dominant drivers of stream temperature regimes in the conterminous us given the availability of public data and the presence of strong gradients in climate physiographic landscapes and degrees of human impacts across us watersheds our analysis focuses on 410 u s geological survey usgs sites with relatively complete records 10 missing of daily stream temperature and discharge observations from 2016 to 2020 fig 2 this recent period was chosen to maximize the number of sites available given the continual expansion of the usgs stream temperature monitoring network over time all sites are present in the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow dataset gages ii falcone et al 2010 as this dataset contains quantitative descriptors of watershed characteristics climate and anthropogenic influence for usgs stream gages the sites chosen span a broad range of watershed sizes geographic settings and degrees of human influence fig 2 2 2 stream temperature signatures to explore and explain variability in stream temperature regimes we adapted the concepts of hydrologic signatures hannah et al 2000 mcmillan 2020 and thermal facets casado et al 2013 steel et al 2017 to calculate two quantitative stream temperature signatures that capture aspects of a site s thermal behavior stream temperature signatures were calculated from mean daily stream temperature observations across 4 years of data 2016 2020 retrieved from the usgs national water information system usgs 2016 first we extracted the maximum monthly stream temperature abbreviated stmax at each gage stmax has clear ecological implications with extreme water temperatures being linked to aquatic ecosystem mortality o neal 2002 values were first calculated at a monthly scale and then averaged for each month across the analysis period we also calculated monthly thermal sensitivity abbreviated ts which represents the slope of the linear regression between daily air temperatures and stream temperatures ts describes how water temperatures are coupled to air temperatures and can be used as a proxy to evaluate how stream thermal regimes are buffered from climate forcings kelleher et al 2012 air temperature observations at each site used in calculations of ts were derived from the prism gridded climate dataset daly et al 2008 as with stmax ts values were taken as a monthly average across the analysis period 2 3 site predictors we selected 23 quantitative variables primarily derived from the gages ii dataset falcone et al 2010 that could be linked to aspects of stream temperatures regimes fig 3 we also included median monthly discharge from the 2016 2020 modeling period in the predictor set retrieved at each site using the usgs nwis with the exception of monthly air temperature precipitation and discharge all selected predictor variables were static in time we acknowledge that by using static gages ii variables as predictors in our models we are not necessarily representing the time varying states of selected watersheds in many cases the gages ii dataset quantifies environmental characteristics using observations averaged over long time periods that are not concurrent with our study period 2016 2020 our use of static gages ii predictors may affect our ability to detect seasonal patterns in importance and further inclusion of variables that track temporal changes in landscape states may improve model quality singh basu 2022 variables were excluded from the final set of input predictors if they displayed strong multicollinearity with other variables of interest assessed by spearman correlation œÅ 0 8 these included the removal of annual mean air temperature which was correlated with monthly air temperature the removal of pet which was correlated with monthly air temperature the removal of developed land cover and road density which were correlated with imperviousness this left us with a set of 23 variables for further analysis we classified variables from our analysis into four broad categories climate watershed characteristics hydrology and human impacts these categories enable a comprehensive evaluation of the relative and cumulative effect of each variable category while many of the variables may span multiple potential categories we placed them into the category that most closely described their relationship with stream thermal processes complete descriptions of the selected predictor variables are available in the supplementary material table s2 2 4 applying random forest models to infer drivers of stream temperature regimes 2 4 1 training random forest models to infer controlling drivers of stream thermal regimes we applied random forest rf models an ensemble learning algorithm based on the aggregation of numerous independent regression trees breiman 2001 tyralis et al 2019 the primary goal of an rf model is to use a set of input predictor variables covariates to simulate an observed value of interest random forest models have been used to predict streamflow in ungauged basins white 2017 assess flood severity and extent albers et al 2016 woznicki et al 2019 and evaluate the dominant controls on hydrologic behavior konapala mishra 2020 price et al 2021 the original random forest algorithm breiman 2001 which is underlain by classification and regression trees has been modified to function using conditional inference trees to reduce model bias strobl et al 2007 while similar in structure to a typical regression tree conditional inference trees differ in that their splitting criteria for recursive partitioning is based on hypothesis tests of independence between covariates and the response variable rather than an arbitrary maximum tree depth hothorn et al 2006 using the cforest function in the r party package strobl et al 2009 we generated a series of conditional inference rf models to predict stream temperature signatures stmax and ts at a monthly time scale using 23 quantitative variables as predictors each rf model was fit on a training set 80 of data and validated against a test set 20 of data the training and test sets were geographically stratified using 7 aggregated huc2 regions such that subdivisions of the dataset had an equal proportion of sites from each geographic region model hyperparameters mtry and ntree were manually tuned using 5 fold cross validation on input training sets for each combination of stream temperature metric month and subset of data we fit the models using a ntree value of 1000 an mtry value of 10 a bootstrapped fraction of 0 63 without replacement and a minimum splitting criterion of 0 1 for each stream temperature signature and unique subset of input sites we created 12 independent models corresponding to each month of the year performance for each of these rf models was assessed using test set error applied to 20 of sites not used in model training further analysis of error is reported in the results section to further investigate spatial drivers of stream temperature regimes we subdivided the full dataset into smaller subsets based on huc2 regions representing gradients in climate and physiography and the influence of dams the geographic subsets included sites from three data rich hydrologic regions new england mid atlantic huc2 01 02 n 58 south atlantic gulf huc2 03 n 65 and pacific northwest huc2 17 n 96 we also filtered the input sites into two subsets based on the presence of a major dam in each watershed major dam n 239 no major dam n 171 to disentangle the relationship between dams and stream temperature regimes in the gages ii dataset major dams are defined as dams greater than 15 m in height or with a total storage greater than 6 million m3 falcone et al 2010 2 4 2 identifying influential predictors of stream temperature signatures the output of random forest models like other so called black box machine learning algorithms may be challenging to interpret in isolation ribeiro et al 2016 however variable importance metrics help to translate the ensemble of trees into an understandable explanation of the model s behavior permutation variable importance may be used to rank predictor variables based on their relative utility in predicting model output these importance algorithms function by randomly permuting each predictor variable while holding all others constant mimicking the removal of that predictor from the ensemble of trees in the model strobl et al 2008 after permuting each variable it is possible to assess the decrease in model accuracy to measure the relative importance of a specific variable to model performance while random forest models tend to be resistant to multicollinearity in explanatory variables konapala mishra 2020 permutation importance hereby referred to as marginal permutation importance may struggle to correctly identify important predictors in datasets with highly correlated variables strobl et al 2008 when a variable is randomly permuted its correlative links with other predictor variables are broken disrupting the underlying structure in the dataset as datasets containing environmental variables tend to have strong multicollinearity e g elevation and precipitation marginal permutation importance may be a sub optimal option for assessing variable importance conditional permutation importance introduced by strobl et al 2008 is an alternative rf importance metric that accounts for predictor correlation in a dataset rather than permuting each variable randomly while holding others constant conditional permutation importance permutes predictor variables of a conditional inference tree model only within set ranges of other variables preserving the dataset s correlation structure strobl et al 2008 given the outlined benefits we make use of this method in our study for all models we computed the conditional permutation importance for each predictor variable ranking predictors by their relative importance in simulating the stream temperature signatures strobl et al 2008 variable importance values were normalized within each rf model to enable comparisons in variable rankings between models although rf importance metrics indicate the relative importance of each variable in predicting a temperature signature they give no information on the direction of that importance therefore we also quantified the spearman s rank correlation a measure of nonlinear association between temperature signatures and each predictor variable to characterize the direction of impact for each variable of interest 3 results 3 1 observed spatial and temporal variability in stream thermal regimes at the 410 selected water temperature gages during the 2016 2020 study period we observed considerable space time variability in the calculated stmax and ts metrics across the conterminous us fig 4 across all sites and months monthly stmax had a mean value of 15 2 c and a range of 0 c at many sites during winter months to a maximum of 32 0 c ts had a mean value of 0 3 across all months and sites ranging from 0 4 to 0 9 negative ts values which indicate a decoupling of air and stream temperatures were rare and typically occurred at sites influenced by dams during winter months both stmax and ts were generally organized along a north south latitudinal trend fig 4a 4c sites in the northern and rocky mountain regions of the us has stmax values ranging from 0 to 5 c and ts values ranging from 0 1 to 0 2 in comparison streams in the southeastern us tended to have higher stmax values and ts values closer to unity ts appeared to be more heterogeneous at regional scales than stmax during winter months in contrast summer stmax and ts values did not display the same latitudinal organization as observed during winter months fig 4b 4d instead stmax tended to be relatively homogeneous and warmer 25 32 c in the eastern us and generally cooler and more variable in the western us summer ts displayed a similar albeit weaker east to west pattern as stmax though variability in ts appeared to be greater between proximal basins than at large regional scales in the us northeast ts varied noticeably between neighboring watersheds across most sites selected for analysis summer ts was larger in magnitude nearer to unity as compared with winter values 3 2 rf model error test set error for all rf models is organized in table 1 error metrics are presented as rmse normalized against the mean observed test set value rmsen to enable comparisons between months and metrics additional plots and tables of training and test set error including detailed model r2 values are presented in the supplemental material overall models of monthly stmax outperformed models of ts in all months for comparable subsets of input sites in general test set error tended to be higher in winter for models of stmax and higher in summer for models of ts though this pattern was not universal across all months and subsets of sites models of undammed sites had lower error than both models of dammed sites and all sites for each of the studied metrics the normalized rmse of stmax predictions in each of the selected hydrologic regions was relatively low however other metrics of error suggest that these values may be artificially depressed by the lack of variability in the magnitude of observations within each region we also concluded that the error of ts model predictions in the huc2 specific models was too large for further interpretation and as such the importance results of these models are excluded from this analysis while there are few stream temperature analyses that are directly comparable to our work isaak et al 2017 presented spatial statistical models capable of predicting mean summer stream temperatures at 22 000 sites in the pacific northwest with an r2 of 0 91 in comparison our models of stmax achieved r2 values ranging from 0 65 to 0 92 table s3 given that we consider far fewer sites a shorter period of record and a different metric maximum monthly instead of mean monthly in our analyses the performance of our models was generally comparable to that of isaak et al 2017 for models of all sites r2 values for ts models were considerably lower than those of stmax models ranging from 0 50 to 0 70 the relatively high error we observed in models of ts aligns well with findings from addor et al 2018 who showed that derived hydrologic signatures were more difficult to predict than metrics focused solely on magnitude as the ts metric incorporates variability in both air and water temperatures rather than strictly temperature magnitude it follows that it would be more difficult to simulate accurately than stmax 3 3 exploring inferred controls on stream temperature variability using a combination of variable importance metrics and spearman s rank correlations we inferred the dominant drivers of variability of monthly maximum stream temperatures stmax and thermal sensitivity ts air temperature the average annual percentage of precipitation falling as snow hereafter referred to as snow fraction baseflow index and watershed slope were the most important variables in predicting stmax at all sites fig 5 a air temperature was the strongest predictor of stmax in all months though its importance diminished in june july and august across all months climate was the leading predictor category for stmax models fig 7a predictor importance metrics of ts showed more variability than those of stmax models in contrast dam storage volume was the most important predictor of ts for all sites and across all months with larger storage volumes corresponding to less variability in stream temperature with respect to air temperature fig 6 a this dominance of dam storage was most apparent in summer and early autumn with this single predictor accounting for 76 3 and 81 2 of total august and september importance respectively air temperature and snow fraction also emerged as important winter predictors of ts accounting for 48 6 and 12 2 of total january importance respectively given the clearly identified influence of dams on stream thermal regimes both in this study and in published literature ahmad et al 2021 casado et al 2013 we also generated rf models for monthly temperature signatures at sites without major upstream dams models of sites with major dams showed similar patterns of importance to models of the full dataset and as such are only presented in the supplemental material considering only sites with no major upstream dams we observed a strong shift in the dominant predictors of ts fig 6b 7d and negligible change in the predictors of stmax fig 5b 7c much like the models of stmax at all sites air temperature and snow fraction made up the largest proportion of relative importance in predicting stream temperature magnitude at undammed sites the aggregate predictor importance values of stmax were relatively unchanged between models for all sites versus models for undammed sites fig 7a 7b climate predictors became slightly more important and less seasonally variable in undammed stmax models along with a slight loss of importance in hydrological predictors during summer months with the removal of dammed sites the leading predictors in ts models shifted away from dam storage to a broader suite of variables fig 6b these predictors which tended to be temporally inconsistent included air temperature measures of precipitation snow fraction baseflow index and watershed slope the relative magnitude of these importance metrics was highly variable from month to month at sites without dams we identified climate as the most important winter predictor class and hydrology variables as the dominant summer controls on ts fig 7d by modeling stream temperature signatures at a monthly time step we were able to discern seasonal patterns in the controls of variability that would not be revealed by annual scale models we observed these time varying patterns in predictors of both stmax and ts for each of the modeled subsets though to differing degrees while the two most important predictors of stmax air temperature and snow fraction were generally consistent throughout the year their relative importance decreased from late spring to early autumn during these summer months a broader set of predictors including baseflow index drainage area watershed slope and dam storage had increased importance in predicting stmax fig 5a we observed this pattern in stmax models of all sites and undammed sites with winter variance primarily explained by air temperature and summer variance explained by a suite of predictors from each of the four variable categories seasonal variability in predictor importance was notably more pronounced in models of ts as noted above dam storage was the leading predictor of ts during summer months though its relative importance diminished during winter and early spring fig 6a while dam storage did contribute roughly 20 of relative importance during these months monthly air temperature became the most importance winter predictor of ts in december january and february we found a similar seasonal contrast in predictors of ts at undammed sites though summer models identified baseflow index snow fraction watershed slope and watershed elevation as relatively important predictors instead of dam storage spearman rank correlations tended to have little seasonal variability in direction for each predictor across months using smaller scale geographic models new england mid atlantic huc2 01 02 south atlantic gulf huc2 03 pacific northwest huc2 17 we observed regional variability in the leading controls of stmax while all three regional models identified air temperature as a relatively important predictor each region also had unique predictors within the categories of human impacts hydrology and watershed characteristics in addition to air temperature influential predictors of stmax included snow fraction dam storage watershed elevation and forest land cover in the new england mid atlantic region and snow fraction wetland land cover water table depth and baseflow index in the south atlantic gulf in the pacific northwest snow fraction was the leading predictor across all months peaking in importance in january and february agricultural land cover linked to warmer maximum sts forested land cover riparian forest land cover and watershed slope linked to cooler maximum sts were also influential predictors of stmax in the region our results from the three selected hydrologic regions highlight the complexity of basin scale controls on stream temperature 4 discussion 4 1 revealing relative controls on stream temperature variability in an era of changing climate and increasing human influence on the landscape it has become increasingly necessary to better constrain the drivers of stream thermal variability across spatial and temporal scales steel et al 2017 the results of our models confirm that river temperatures are influenced by a complex set of variables describing climate hydrology watershed characteristics and human impacts caissie 2006 hannah garner 2015 webb 1996 within this nested predictor set regional climate is often recognized as a first order control on stream temperature magnitude given the strong coupling between latitudinal variance in net radiation and water temperatures garner et al 2014 hannah garner 2015 as the leading predictor of stmax in all our models the high relative importance of monthly air temperature reflects this overarching control of climate on continental scale variability fig 5 7 air temperature is often used as a predictor in models of water temperature magnitude when heat fluxes at a site are unknown acting as a proxy for heat received by a stream from incoming solar radiation arismendi et al 2014 caissie 2006 casado et al 2013 lisi et al 2015 as air temperature tends to vary along the same latitudinal gradient as stream temperatures fig 4 particularly during winter months the variable is useful in predicting stmax at a continental scale we found that the percentage of annual precipitation received as snow snow fraction was the second most influential predictor of stmax in models of all sites and undammed sites fig 5 snowmelt runoff represents a considerable proportion of spring and summer streamflow in seasonally cold watersheds and can drastically alter stream thermal regimes leach moore 2014 michel et al 2020 yan et al 2021 when streamflow is sourced from snowmelt the relative temperature of its relatively cool source water can overcome radiative heat fluxes resulting in buffered water temperatures blaen et al 2013 leach moore 2014 we observed a similar effect where predicted stmax tended to be lower at sites that received higher proportions of precipitation as snow however it s not clear whether the importance of snow in our models reflects the hydrologic relationship between streamflow source and water temperature or if the predictor is simply another manifestation of climate gradients continental scale patterns in snow fraction coincide closely those of air temperature making it difficult to disentangle the spatial correlation between the variables and isolate the true source of the predictor s influence furthermore within the gages ii dataset the snow fraction variable only represents a static mean annual proportion of precipitation from 1901 to 2000 rather than a more detailed record of monthly snowpack volume aligned with our model period therefore the snow fraction predictor likely derives some of its importance in models of stmax by acting as a secondary proxy of regional climate patterns nonetheless our models show tentative evidence of a mechanistic link between snow and colder water temperatures leach moore 2014 null et al 2013 while we attribute broad spatial patterns in stream thermal regimes to regional climate variability basin to reach scale characteristics impart an additional layer of complexity on stream thermal regimes these watershed characteristics which include riparian shading land cover and subsurface hydrology among others modify a stream s radiative and hydrologic inputs to produce varied thermal responses from a single set of climate forcings hannah garner 2015 orr et al 2015 our second stream temperature metric the slope of the regression relationship between air temperatures and water temperatures ts is an explicit representation of how basin scale processes moderate broad scale climate conditions kelleher et al 2012 thermal sensitivity has been linked to measures of baseflow index stream size snowpack watershed slope and elevation beaufort et al 2020 kelleher et al 2012 lisi et al 2015 segura et al 2015 geographic trends in ts were weaker than those observed in stmax fig 4 confirming prior findings that metrics of water temperature sensitivity tend to be highly variable at regional and sub regional scales kelleher et al 2012 our analysis captured not only the importance of climate but equally the moderating effects of basin scale controls in importance metrics of stmax and ts models fig 5 6 in models of stmax a combination of hydrologic and watershed characteristics variables gained in relative importance during summer months the importance of baseflow to both stmax fig 5 and ts at undammed sites fig 6b aligns with our expectations of groundwater induced cooling of water temperatures summer stream temperatures are often depressed and decoupled from air temperatures along reaches receiving large fluxes of groundwater inflow due to the relatively cold temperature of groundwater beaufort et al 2020 kelleher et al 2012 we also identified two proxies of hydrologic residence time drainage area and watershed slope as influential geomorphic predictors of stmax fig 5 in large watersheds draining low gradient terrain long hydrologic residence times allow surface waters to accumulate radiative inputs and reach warmer maximum temperatures caissie 2006 garner et al 2014 lisi et al 2015 in contrast smaller and steeper watersheds tend to produce cooler thermal responses due to their shorter residence times lisi et al 2015 segura et al 2015 watershed elevation also imparted a buffering effect on models of ts at undammed sites likely due to correlative links between elevation watershed slope and snowpack fig 6b during winter and into early spring ts had a strong positive relationship with air temperatures where colder temperatures corresponded to decoupled air water temperatures while it was challenging to identify a definitive mechanism for this control prior studies have observed that air and water temperatures tend to become disconnected when water temperatures approach 0 c kelleher et al 2012 mohseni et al 1998 this effect could be attributed to river ice cover which would insulate waters from radiative forcings or to the presence of snow that melting of which would provide an external source of cold water to buffer waters against temperature change brown hannah 2008 mellor et al 2017 rain on snow events could also contribute relatively cool water to streams further decoupling air and water temperatures leach moore 2014 while our findings do agree with the existing literature it is important to keep in mind that our findings are based on empirical inference though rf models can effectively detect influential predictors of temperature behavior our analysis does not pinpoint how a certain predictor affects a stream s thermal regime to alleviate this shortcoming deterministic water models which explicitly quantify energy and fluid fluxes could be paired with machine learning models to confirm the role of a predictor of interest 4 2 anthropogenic influence on stream thermal regimes the river network of the continental us through a wide range of anthropogenic modifications has been heavily fragmented disrupted and impounded dynesius nilsson 1994 grill et al 2019 the construction of dams deforestation of riparian buffers channelization and urbanization have interrupted the natural hydrologic regimes of free flowing rivers and in turn dramatically altered their thermal behavior grill et al 2019 hester doyle 2011 while each catchment is affected by a unique suite of anthropogenic influences human disturbances generally tend to cause net warming of water temperatures through loss of shading reduced groundwater exchange and the effects of a warming global climate caissie 2006 hester doyle 2011 hill et al 2014 somers et al 2013 the most notable exception to this general trend of anthropogenic warming is that of dams and their associated upstream reservoirs along river reaches downstream of large dams the seasonal patterns of stream thermal regimes are altered often resulting in cooler and more insensitive water temperatures in the summer and warmer temperatures in autumn and winter seasons ahmad et al 2021 angilletta et al 2008 casado et al 2013 kelleher et al 2012 this effect is most pronounced for dams that bottom release from the relatively cold hypolimnion of deep thermally stratified reservoirs cheng et al 2020 the anthropogenic impacts on stream thermal regimes are readily apparent in models of both stmax and ts overprinting other natural controls across all sites the volume of dam storage normalized to watershed area per the national inventory of dams was the single most important predictor of ts fig 6a 7c in our dataset larger volumes of dam storage in watersheds corresponded to decoupled air water temperatures and more insensitive water temperature responses the importance of dam storage in models of ts likely illustrates the strong contrast in sensitivity between undammed streams where water temperatures tend to be more atmospherically coupled and impounded streams which have relatively flat ts relationships kelleher et al 2012 these effects were mirrored though to a lesser degree in models of monthly stmax although dam storage was relatively uninfluential across all sites fig 5a reservoir volume exhibited a strong negative correlation with predicted summer stmax for dammed sites supplemental material fig s2 the diminished importance of dam storage in models of stmax relative to models of ts could indicate that extreme temperatures although moderated by the effects of reservoirs are still primarily controlled by atmospheric forcings amongst sites in impounded watersheds the apparent cooling and atmospheric decoupling effects of dams may also reflect the contrast in hydrologic function between impoundments of varying sizes though large reservoirs often cause cool and insensitive downstream temperatures casado et al 2013 cheng et al 2020 comparatively smaller storage dams can induce the opposite effect resulting in downstream warming for instance maheu et al 2016 found that releases from shallow impoundments depth 6 m which have a larger proportion of surface area exposed to radiative heating caused warming of summer stream temperatures by up to 2 c given that our dataset contains a wide range of reservoir volumes the importance of dam storage in our models may highlight these opposing end member behaviors we also emphasize that although the mean distance from gages effected by impoundments n 239 to the nearest major dam was 18 3 km we still observed the alteration of stream thermal regimes by dams this underscores the longitudinal persistence of dams downstream thermal effects which under some circumstances can still be observed up to 100 km downstream angilletta et al 2008 lowney 2000 willis et al 2021 the importance of dam storage in our models clearly indicates the necessity to better understand the thermal implications of dam operations on river networks to accurately predict future stream temperatures while dams may embody the most direct disruption of natural hydrologic systems urbanization climate change and other human actions on the landscape also intersect with stream thermal regimes hester doyle 2011 kurylyk et al 2015 steel et al 2017 deforestation of riparian buffers wondzell et al 2019 declines in groundwater inflow due to pumping and other diversions kurylyk et al 2015 warmer air temperatures hill et al 2014 wondzell et al 2019 and power plant effluent discharges miara et al 2018 all been linked to warmer stream temperatures hester doyle 2011 mechanistically anthropogenic activities alter hydrological and thermal process and yet outside of dam storage little of this influence is captured in our models there are several potential explanations for this lack of importance given to human related predictors first while our models contain key predictors that explicitly represent anthropogenic disruption there are many other impacts associated with human activity that cannot be determined at the scale of our investigation additionally anthropogenic impacts are also implicitly represented by their modification of predictors such as air temperature riparian forest land cover and baseflow index as human activities on the landscape overprint natural hydrologic and thermal responses it is difficult to discern whether the importance of a particular predictor such as baseflow index is controlled by natural patterns in subsurface flow or human disruption of hydrologic systems finally the paucity of sites used in this study due to limited st observations makes it likely that our models undersample urban streams and therefore underrepresent the influence of humans on stream thermal regimes of the urbanized sites that we do include our models may struggle to adequately represent stream temperature behavior given the inherent difficulty in modeling the complex variability of urban hydrologic systems 4 3 seasonal variability in key controls of stream temperatures the importance of individual predictors as well as the aggregate importance of predictor categories tended to vary seasonally for both modeled st metrics in response to the relative strength of dynamic drivers fig 5 6 7 8 in models of stmax at all sites this effect was best demonstrated by the relative rise in importance of baseflow index drainage area dam storage and watershed slope during summer months fig 5a we observed a similar summer decline in the influence of climate predictors accompanied by a shift to a more complex suite of basin scale predictors for ts fig 6 prior modeling studies of stream temperature regimes have found comparable summer winter contrasts in influential model predictors in monthly multiple linear regression models of maximum and mean stream temperature respectively hrachowitz et al 2010 and imholt et al 2013 noted that summer models of thermal behavior required more parameters than winter models these results coupled with findings from our models suggest that the controls on both stream temperature magnitude and ts are more complex during summer months hrachowitz et al 2010 imholt et al 2013 while these seasonal patterns in importance are logically supported by our understanding of stream thermal processes it is also possible that a component of this signal may be an artifact of ensemble learning algorithms and associated variable importance metrics when applied to rf models variable importance metrics assess which predictors are most useful in differentiating the behavior of a metric across a set of sites in winter we observe strong latitudinal contrasts in both air and stream temperatures in the conterminous us which likely reflect differences in incoming radiation received by between northern and southern sites fig 4a these coincident spatial patterns make air temperature an effective winter predictor of stmax fig 5 this does not mean that regional climate and radiative inputs are less influential controls on summer stream temperatures at individual sites only that that differences in thermal behavior across sites are not easily explained by summer climate 4 4 implications for watershed management globally climate change is expected to alter the thermal regimes of streams with the warmest water temperatures projected to increase by up to 2 c ficklin et al 2013 van vliet et al 2013 wanders et al 2019 watershed management strategies including riparian planting preservation of natural land cover and groundwater and flow manipulation have been employed to resist this regime shift and to preserve cold water refugia for sensitive instream ecosystems beaufort et al 2020 kurylyk et al 2015 machine learning and big data investigations of stream temperature can supplement these efforts as such approaches are capable of efficiently identifying the most influential atmospheric and landscape controls on thermal processes from large environmental datasets we do however acknowledge that the conclusions drawn from continental scale models may be challenging to translate into actionable management solutions at specific sites the rivers of the us drain catchments that span a diverse spectrum of physiography and climate and as such it is probable that stream thermal regimes in each ecoregion are influenced by different landscape processes the spatially unfocused continental scale rf models likely struggle to capture this regional heterogeneity in controls regional models of water temperature behavior present a promising alternative to nation wide models as they can discern relevant controls at scales better suited to the management of individual watersheds in our models of stmax in three distinct regions we show that although climate remained a dominant influence across the us its influence was mediated by a suite of watershed scale predictors unique to each geographic area fig 8 for example wetland land cover and water table depth were relatively influential predictors of stmax in the south atlantic gulf region yet the variables showed negligible importance in the other two selected regions fig 8b similarly riparian forest land cover had a strong negative effect on spring water temperatures in the pacific northwest an effect not observed in the us northeast or south fig 8c these contrasts confirm that much like the drivers of hydrologic behavior the controls on stream thermal regimes are also non uniform across the us with considerable implications for the management of water temperatures gannon et al 2022 hammond et al 2021 this spatial heterogeneity suggests that the efficacy of successful thermal management strategies in one geographic region may not translate into similar levels of success elsewhere however regional inference is limited in under monitored regions such as the us southwest with additional stream temperature monitoring machine learning models of stream temperatures at sub regional scales could become increasingly practical future investigations of landscape controls on stream thermal regimes should attempt to discern influential processes at local spatial scales by leveraging the information provided by data intensive yet regional models thermal management strategies can be tailored to target watershed modifications that are most effective for a specific region hrachowitz et al 2010 imholt et al 2013 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated the distribution of two water temperature metrics stmax and ts across 410 rivers in the conterminous us and used rf models to infer the dominant space time drivers of stream thermal regimes our results highlight that above all else there is not a single set of universal controls that comprehensively explain stream temperature behavior instead we found that the most influential controls on select water temperature metrics varied across a range of predictor categories climate watershed characteristics hydrology and human influence broadly maximum water temperatures were linked most closely to air temperatures although the role of climate was mediated by basin scale processes especially in summer months the presence of major dams was the most influential predictor of thermal sensitivity within our dataset illustrating the profound impact anthropogenic disturbances have on stream thermal processes often these human impacts on river water temperature have been somewhat overlooked ficklin et al 2023 although many approaches to the study of stream temperatures focus solely on the warmest summer water temperatures we highlight explicitly the need to explore the controls on additional modes of water temperature variability in both space and time while we address maximum temperatures and thermal sensitivity at a monthly time step in our models there are many other stream temperature metrics of ecological importance including degree day accumulation diurnal range and the timing and frequency of extreme events casado et al 2013 steel et al 2017 these metrics will almost certainly be controlled by unique combinations of land surface processes and a comprehensive understanding of their dominant drivers will allow for the development of more effective management approaches as well as providing new information on river water temperature controls we believe our results make a methodological contribution our analysis exemplifies the discerning power of machine learning approaches when applied to large and complex environmental datasets random forest algorithms and related tree based models are relatively simple ml applications yet they allow us to resolve complex and seasonally variable controls on stream thermal regimes while the findings of our analysis demonstrate the advantages provided by big data approaches to hydrology they also emphasize that caution and nuance are needed in translating model results into human interpretable insights the types of models used in this study rely only on statistical relationships between water temperature behavior and landscape covariates meaning that their implications are inferential rather than causal to extend confidence in predictions and to support management predictions we recommend that machine learning approaches should be supplemented by process based hydrologic understanding and models to confirm the influence and interaction of variables across individual sites nonetheless by powerful comparative analysis our research yields new perspectives into the time varying controls water temperature regimes across watersheds that span strong gradients in climate hydrology watershed characteristics and degrees of

1735,water temperature is vitally important to the health of rivers and streams influencing the integrity of ecosystems aquatic biogeochemistry and the habitability of waterways for a variety of species while climate is often regarded as the primary driver of stream temperature regimes other factors including hydrology watershed characteristics and human impacts add substantial complexity to the variability of water temperatures however it remains challenging to disentangle the influence of these drivers through time and across rivers spanning diverse settings to quantify the underlying controls on river thermal regimes we applied conditional inference random forest models to predict maximum monthly stream temperatures and thermal sensitivities averaged across a 4 year period 2016 to 2020 at 410 watersheds spanning the conterminous united states maximum stream temperatures were selected given their ecological relevance while thermal sensitivity which measures the relationship between air and water temperatures was used to assess the responsiveness of stream temperatures to climate forcings we interpreted these random forest models using variable importance rankings describing seasonal and spatial variability in the dominant controls on water temperatures although our empirical results confirm that climate is indeed a primary control on temperature magnitude our models highlight the diversity in drivers of water temperature variability across seasons hydrologic regions and between metrics by combining random forest models with process based understanding of stream thermal regimes we provide new insights on the dynamic controls of water temperature variability across broad geographical domains informing region and season specific controls for tailored thermal watershed management and guiding the framing of future water temperature modeling keywords river water temperature thermal regimes random forest machine learning data availability the data and code used in this study are freely available on github at https github com jswade stream temperature rf 1 introduction the water temperature of streams is a leading control on overall water quality mediating the rate of solute processing and the viability of aquatic habitats caissie 2006 ouellet et al 2020 steel et al 2017 webb et al 2008 as such it is critical to understand the distribution of stream thermal regimes and to identify the underlying environmental drivers of water temperature variability though there are many examples of studies that have characterized key drivers of river flow regimes at regional national and global scales hammond et al 2021 konapala mishra 2020 price et al 2021 singh basu 2022 there are comparatively fewer studies that seek to categorize river thermal regimes over large geographical domains recent efforts to classify stream temperature behavior into distinct groups have emphasized that while general patterns in variability driven by regional climate gradients exist thermal regimes are strongly heterogeneous indicating the presence of other second order drivers garner et al 2014 hill et al 2014 maheu et al 2016 willis et al 2021 the controls on stream thermal regimes are diverse spanning a range of meteorologic landscape and hydrologic processes across nested space and time domains dugdale et al 2017 hannah garner 2015 webb 1996 although climate appears to be the dominant macro scale control on stream temperature hydrologic and watershed characteristics likely moderate climate forcings introducing complexity at the basin and reach scale hannah garner 2015 laiz√© et al 2017 supplementing these site specific controls the transformative effect of anthropogenic activity on earth system processes can perturb numerous aspects of stream thermal regimes croghan et al 2019 ficklin et al 2023 broadly human activity alters climate forcings on streams anthropogenic climate change as well as the hydrologic and landscape controls that mediate those forcings urbanization deforestation gw pumping channelization dam construction wetland destruction caissie 2006 poole berman 2001 given the close links between global climate patterns and stream thermal regimes future anthropogenic warming is anticipated to propagate into warming of water temperatures caldwell et al 2015 isaak et al 2012 michel et al 2022 van vliet et al 2011 however trends in future water temperatures are likely to be geographically non uniform due to the space time variability of watershed and hydrologic forcings kelleher et al 2021 therefore it is remarkably important both to the management of thermal regimes and to the ecosystem services provided by river networks to better understand how climate and watershed processes interact in space and time to control water temperature behavior relationships between hydrologic variables of interest such as stream temperature and moderating environmental factors are likely nonlinear and interactive for this reason many process based models struggle to uncover complex macro and basin scale patterns inherent to hydrologic systems nearing et al 2021 disentangling the primary controls on water quality variables and in specific stream temperature therefore requires the use of nonparametric data driven methods konapala mishra 2020 supervised machine learning algorithms are a popular tool in this context as such algorithms are capable of parsing large environmental datasets and inferring subtle relationships between input predictors and output variables without explicitly representing physical processes konapala mishra 2020 nearing et al 2021 tyralis et al 2019 in recent years machine learning has been increasingly applied to the prediction of stream temperature rahmani lawson et al 2021 rahmani shen et al 2021 sadler et al 2022 zwart et al 2022 by incorporating an extensive range of environmental predictors these data driven models are capable of generating robust and accurate simulations of stream temperature magnitude and variability across broad spatial scales however despite the frequent application of machine learning to water resources prediction only a limited number of studies use the technique to identify influential controls on hydrologic or thermal behavior addor et al 2018 gannon et al 2022 hammond et al 2021 hill et al 2014 konapala mishra 2020 though our understanding of controls on river temperature regimes continues to develop we still lack insight regarding how the dominant controls on thermal characteristics vary seasonally and across broad spatial scales to address this we leverage publicly available records of stream temperature and environmental covariates at 410 sites to explore the following questions 1 what are the relative influences of climate watershed characteristics hydrologic controls and anthropogenic disturbances on stream temperature magnitude and variability in the conterminous us 2 do the dominant drivers of stream thermal regimes differ seasonally and across spatial domains while stream thermal regimes are complex and can be quantified in myriad ways we focused on two primary metrics maximum water temperature and thermal sensitivity calculated monthly for all sites to infer key drivers of water temperature we applied a supervised machine learning approach to derive models predicting monthly water temperature metrics using a suite of environmental covariates to our knowledge our study represents one of the most comprehensive data driven investigations of empirical drivers of water temperature regimes that not only accounts for regional variability but also considers how drivers may vary at seasonal scales such insight is vital for not only improving our understanding of river temperature regimes but managing complex landscapes and the ecosystems they support now and into the future 2 material and methods the general approach of our methodology is outlined in fig 1 across selected stream sites we quantified two metrics of water temperature variability at a monthly time scale and extracted variables describing climate watershed characteristics hydrology and human impacts thought to either directly or indirectly shape water temperatures we then fit a suite of random forest models to predict water temperature metrics using these environmental covariates finally by leveraging variable importance metrics to rank predictors by their relative influence we inferred how dominant controls on river thermal regimes vary seasonally within specific geographic domains and across degrees of anthropogenic disruption 2 1 site selection we chose to investigate the dominant drivers of stream temperature regimes in the conterminous us given the availability of public data and the presence of strong gradients in climate physiographic landscapes and degrees of human impacts across us watersheds our analysis focuses on 410 u s geological survey usgs sites with relatively complete records 10 missing of daily stream temperature and discharge observations from 2016 to 2020 fig 2 this recent period was chosen to maximize the number of sites available given the continual expansion of the usgs stream temperature monitoring network over time all sites are present in the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow dataset gages ii falcone et al 2010 as this dataset contains quantitative descriptors of watershed characteristics climate and anthropogenic influence for usgs stream gages the sites chosen span a broad range of watershed sizes geographic settings and degrees of human influence fig 2 2 2 stream temperature signatures to explore and explain variability in stream temperature regimes we adapted the concepts of hydrologic signatures hannah et al 2000 mcmillan 2020 and thermal facets casado et al 2013 steel et al 2017 to calculate two quantitative stream temperature signatures that capture aspects of a site s thermal behavior stream temperature signatures were calculated from mean daily stream temperature observations across 4 years of data 2016 2020 retrieved from the usgs national water information system usgs 2016 first we extracted the maximum monthly stream temperature abbreviated stmax at each gage stmax has clear ecological implications with extreme water temperatures being linked to aquatic ecosystem mortality o neal 2002 values were first calculated at a monthly scale and then averaged for each month across the analysis period we also calculated monthly thermal sensitivity abbreviated ts which represents the slope of the linear regression between daily air temperatures and stream temperatures ts describes how water temperatures are coupled to air temperatures and can be used as a proxy to evaluate how stream thermal regimes are buffered from climate forcings kelleher et al 2012 air temperature observations at each site used in calculations of ts were derived from the prism gridded climate dataset daly et al 2008 as with stmax ts values were taken as a monthly average across the analysis period 2 3 site predictors we selected 23 quantitative variables primarily derived from the gages ii dataset falcone et al 2010 that could be linked to aspects of stream temperatures regimes fig 3 we also included median monthly discharge from the 2016 2020 modeling period in the predictor set retrieved at each site using the usgs nwis with the exception of monthly air temperature precipitation and discharge all selected predictor variables were static in time we acknowledge that by using static gages ii variables as predictors in our models we are not necessarily representing the time varying states of selected watersheds in many cases the gages ii dataset quantifies environmental characteristics using observations averaged over long time periods that are not concurrent with our study period 2016 2020 our use of static gages ii predictors may affect our ability to detect seasonal patterns in importance and further inclusion of variables that track temporal changes in landscape states may improve model quality singh basu 2022 variables were excluded from the final set of input predictors if they displayed strong multicollinearity with other variables of interest assessed by spearman correlation œÅ 0 8 these included the removal of annual mean air temperature which was correlated with monthly air temperature the removal of pet which was correlated with monthly air temperature the removal of developed land cover and road density which were correlated with imperviousness this left us with a set of 23 variables for further analysis we classified variables from our analysis into four broad categories climate watershed characteristics hydrology and human impacts these categories enable a comprehensive evaluation of the relative and cumulative effect of each variable category while many of the variables may span multiple potential categories we placed them into the category that most closely described their relationship with stream thermal processes complete descriptions of the selected predictor variables are available in the supplementary material table s2 2 4 applying random forest models to infer drivers of stream temperature regimes 2 4 1 training random forest models to infer controlling drivers of stream thermal regimes we applied random forest rf models an ensemble learning algorithm based on the aggregation of numerous independent regression trees breiman 2001 tyralis et al 2019 the primary goal of an rf model is to use a set of input predictor variables covariates to simulate an observed value of interest random forest models have been used to predict streamflow in ungauged basins white 2017 assess flood severity and extent albers et al 2016 woznicki et al 2019 and evaluate the dominant controls on hydrologic behavior konapala mishra 2020 price et al 2021 the original random forest algorithm breiman 2001 which is underlain by classification and regression trees has been modified to function using conditional inference trees to reduce model bias strobl et al 2007 while similar in structure to a typical regression tree conditional inference trees differ in that their splitting criteria for recursive partitioning is based on hypothesis tests of independence between covariates and the response variable rather than an arbitrary maximum tree depth hothorn et al 2006 using the cforest function in the r party package strobl et al 2009 we generated a series of conditional inference rf models to predict stream temperature signatures stmax and ts at a monthly time scale using 23 quantitative variables as predictors each rf model was fit on a training set 80 of data and validated against a test set 20 of data the training and test sets were geographically stratified using 7 aggregated huc2 regions such that subdivisions of the dataset had an equal proportion of sites from each geographic region model hyperparameters mtry and ntree were manually tuned using 5 fold cross validation on input training sets for each combination of stream temperature metric month and subset of data we fit the models using a ntree value of 1000 an mtry value of 10 a bootstrapped fraction of 0 63 without replacement and a minimum splitting criterion of 0 1 for each stream temperature signature and unique subset of input sites we created 12 independent models corresponding to each month of the year performance for each of these rf models was assessed using test set error applied to 20 of sites not used in model training further analysis of error is reported in the results section to further investigate spatial drivers of stream temperature regimes we subdivided the full dataset into smaller subsets based on huc2 regions representing gradients in climate and physiography and the influence of dams the geographic subsets included sites from three data rich hydrologic regions new england mid atlantic huc2 01 02 n 58 south atlantic gulf huc2 03 n 65 and pacific northwest huc2 17 n 96 we also filtered the input sites into two subsets based on the presence of a major dam in each watershed major dam n 239 no major dam n 171 to disentangle the relationship between dams and stream temperature regimes in the gages ii dataset major dams are defined as dams greater than 15 m in height or with a total storage greater than 6 million m3 falcone et al 2010 2 4 2 identifying influential predictors of stream temperature signatures the output of random forest models like other so called black box machine learning algorithms may be challenging to interpret in isolation ribeiro et al 2016 however variable importance metrics help to translate the ensemble of trees into an understandable explanation of the model s behavior permutation variable importance may be used to rank predictor variables based on their relative utility in predicting model output these importance algorithms function by randomly permuting each predictor variable while holding all others constant mimicking the removal of that predictor from the ensemble of trees in the model strobl et al 2008 after permuting each variable it is possible to assess the decrease in model accuracy to measure the relative importance of a specific variable to model performance while random forest models tend to be resistant to multicollinearity in explanatory variables konapala mishra 2020 permutation importance hereby referred to as marginal permutation importance may struggle to correctly identify important predictors in datasets with highly correlated variables strobl et al 2008 when a variable is randomly permuted its correlative links with other predictor variables are broken disrupting the underlying structure in the dataset as datasets containing environmental variables tend to have strong multicollinearity e g elevation and precipitation marginal permutation importance may be a sub optimal option for assessing variable importance conditional permutation importance introduced by strobl et al 2008 is an alternative rf importance metric that accounts for predictor correlation in a dataset rather than permuting each variable randomly while holding others constant conditional permutation importance permutes predictor variables of a conditional inference tree model only within set ranges of other variables preserving the dataset s correlation structure strobl et al 2008 given the outlined benefits we make use of this method in our study for all models we computed the conditional permutation importance for each predictor variable ranking predictors by their relative importance in simulating the stream temperature signatures strobl et al 2008 variable importance values were normalized within each rf model to enable comparisons in variable rankings between models although rf importance metrics indicate the relative importance of each variable in predicting a temperature signature they give no information on the direction of that importance therefore we also quantified the spearman s rank correlation a measure of nonlinear association between temperature signatures and each predictor variable to characterize the direction of impact for each variable of interest 3 results 3 1 observed spatial and temporal variability in stream thermal regimes at the 410 selected water temperature gages during the 2016 2020 study period we observed considerable space time variability in the calculated stmax and ts metrics across the conterminous us fig 4 across all sites and months monthly stmax had a mean value of 15 2 c and a range of 0 c at many sites during winter months to a maximum of 32 0 c ts had a mean value of 0 3 across all months and sites ranging from 0 4 to 0 9 negative ts values which indicate a decoupling of air and stream temperatures were rare and typically occurred at sites influenced by dams during winter months both stmax and ts were generally organized along a north south latitudinal trend fig 4a 4c sites in the northern and rocky mountain regions of the us has stmax values ranging from 0 to 5 c and ts values ranging from 0 1 to 0 2 in comparison streams in the southeastern us tended to have higher stmax values and ts values closer to unity ts appeared to be more heterogeneous at regional scales than stmax during winter months in contrast summer stmax and ts values did not display the same latitudinal organization as observed during winter months fig 4b 4d instead stmax tended to be relatively homogeneous and warmer 25 32 c in the eastern us and generally cooler and more variable in the western us summer ts displayed a similar albeit weaker east to west pattern as stmax though variability in ts appeared to be greater between proximal basins than at large regional scales in the us northeast ts varied noticeably between neighboring watersheds across most sites selected for analysis summer ts was larger in magnitude nearer to unity as compared with winter values 3 2 rf model error test set error for all rf models is organized in table 1 error metrics are presented as rmse normalized against the mean observed test set value rmsen to enable comparisons between months and metrics additional plots and tables of training and test set error including detailed model r2 values are presented in the supplemental material overall models of monthly stmax outperformed models of ts in all months for comparable subsets of input sites in general test set error tended to be higher in winter for models of stmax and higher in summer for models of ts though this pattern was not universal across all months and subsets of sites models of undammed sites had lower error than both models of dammed sites and all sites for each of the studied metrics the normalized rmse of stmax predictions in each of the selected hydrologic regions was relatively low however other metrics of error suggest that these values may be artificially depressed by the lack of variability in the magnitude of observations within each region we also concluded that the error of ts model predictions in the huc2 specific models was too large for further interpretation and as such the importance results of these models are excluded from this analysis while there are few stream temperature analyses that are directly comparable to our work isaak et al 2017 presented spatial statistical models capable of predicting mean summer stream temperatures at 22 000 sites in the pacific northwest with an r2 of 0 91 in comparison our models of stmax achieved r2 values ranging from 0 65 to 0 92 table s3 given that we consider far fewer sites a shorter period of record and a different metric maximum monthly instead of mean monthly in our analyses the performance of our models was generally comparable to that of isaak et al 2017 for models of all sites r2 values for ts models were considerably lower than those of stmax models ranging from 0 50 to 0 70 the relatively high error we observed in models of ts aligns well with findings from addor et al 2018 who showed that derived hydrologic signatures were more difficult to predict than metrics focused solely on magnitude as the ts metric incorporates variability in both air and water temperatures rather than strictly temperature magnitude it follows that it would be more difficult to simulate accurately than stmax 3 3 exploring inferred controls on stream temperature variability using a combination of variable importance metrics and spearman s rank correlations we inferred the dominant drivers of variability of monthly maximum stream temperatures stmax and thermal sensitivity ts air temperature the average annual percentage of precipitation falling as snow hereafter referred to as snow fraction baseflow index and watershed slope were the most important variables in predicting stmax at all sites fig 5 a air temperature was the strongest predictor of stmax in all months though its importance diminished in june july and august across all months climate was the leading predictor category for stmax models fig 7a predictor importance metrics of ts showed more variability than those of stmax models in contrast dam storage volume was the most important predictor of ts for all sites and across all months with larger storage volumes corresponding to less variability in stream temperature with respect to air temperature fig 6 a this dominance of dam storage was most apparent in summer and early autumn with this single predictor accounting for 76 3 and 81 2 of total august and september importance respectively air temperature and snow fraction also emerged as important winter predictors of ts accounting for 48 6 and 12 2 of total january importance respectively given the clearly identified influence of dams on stream thermal regimes both in this study and in published literature ahmad et al 2021 casado et al 2013 we also generated rf models for monthly temperature signatures at sites without major upstream dams models of sites with major dams showed similar patterns of importance to models of the full dataset and as such are only presented in the supplemental material considering only sites with no major upstream dams we observed a strong shift in the dominant predictors of ts fig 6b 7d and negligible change in the predictors of stmax fig 5b 7c much like the models of stmax at all sites air temperature and snow fraction made up the largest proportion of relative importance in predicting stream temperature magnitude at undammed sites the aggregate predictor importance values of stmax were relatively unchanged between models for all sites versus models for undammed sites fig 7a 7b climate predictors became slightly more important and less seasonally variable in undammed stmax models along with a slight loss of importance in hydrological predictors during summer months with the removal of dammed sites the leading predictors in ts models shifted away from dam storage to a broader suite of variables fig 6b these predictors which tended to be temporally inconsistent included air temperature measures of precipitation snow fraction baseflow index and watershed slope the relative magnitude of these importance metrics was highly variable from month to month at sites without dams we identified climate as the most important winter predictor class and hydrology variables as the dominant summer controls on ts fig 7d by modeling stream temperature signatures at a monthly time step we were able to discern seasonal patterns in the controls of variability that would not be revealed by annual scale models we observed these time varying patterns in predictors of both stmax and ts for each of the modeled subsets though to differing degrees while the two most important predictors of stmax air temperature and snow fraction were generally consistent throughout the year their relative importance decreased from late spring to early autumn during these summer months a broader set of predictors including baseflow index drainage area watershed slope and dam storage had increased importance in predicting stmax fig 5a we observed this pattern in stmax models of all sites and undammed sites with winter variance primarily explained by air temperature and summer variance explained by a suite of predictors from each of the four variable categories seasonal variability in predictor importance was notably more pronounced in models of ts as noted above dam storage was the leading predictor of ts during summer months though its relative importance diminished during winter and early spring fig 6a while dam storage did contribute roughly 20 of relative importance during these months monthly air temperature became the most importance winter predictor of ts in december january and february we found a similar seasonal contrast in predictors of ts at undammed sites though summer models identified baseflow index snow fraction watershed slope and watershed elevation as relatively important predictors instead of dam storage spearman rank correlations tended to have little seasonal variability in direction for each predictor across months using smaller scale geographic models new england mid atlantic huc2 01 02 south atlantic gulf huc2 03 pacific northwest huc2 17 we observed regional variability in the leading controls of stmax while all three regional models identified air temperature as a relatively important predictor each region also had unique predictors within the categories of human impacts hydrology and watershed characteristics in addition to air temperature influential predictors of stmax included snow fraction dam storage watershed elevation and forest land cover in the new england mid atlantic region and snow fraction wetland land cover water table depth and baseflow index in the south atlantic gulf in the pacific northwest snow fraction was the leading predictor across all months peaking in importance in january and february agricultural land cover linked to warmer maximum sts forested land cover riparian forest land cover and watershed slope linked to cooler maximum sts were also influential predictors of stmax in the region our results from the three selected hydrologic regions highlight the complexity of basin scale controls on stream temperature 4 discussion 4 1 revealing relative controls on stream temperature variability in an era of changing climate and increasing human influence on the landscape it has become increasingly necessary to better constrain the drivers of stream thermal variability across spatial and temporal scales steel et al 2017 the results of our models confirm that river temperatures are influenced by a complex set of variables describing climate hydrology watershed characteristics and human impacts caissie 2006 hannah garner 2015 webb 1996 within this nested predictor set regional climate is often recognized as a first order control on stream temperature magnitude given the strong coupling between latitudinal variance in net radiation and water temperatures garner et al 2014 hannah garner 2015 as the leading predictor of stmax in all our models the high relative importance of monthly air temperature reflects this overarching control of climate on continental scale variability fig 5 7 air temperature is often used as a predictor in models of water temperature magnitude when heat fluxes at a site are unknown acting as a proxy for heat received by a stream from incoming solar radiation arismendi et al 2014 caissie 2006 casado et al 2013 lisi et al 2015 as air temperature tends to vary along the same latitudinal gradient as stream temperatures fig 4 particularly during winter months the variable is useful in predicting stmax at a continental scale we found that the percentage of annual precipitation received as snow snow fraction was the second most influential predictor of stmax in models of all sites and undammed sites fig 5 snowmelt runoff represents a considerable proportion of spring and summer streamflow in seasonally cold watersheds and can drastically alter stream thermal regimes leach moore 2014 michel et al 2020 yan et al 2021 when streamflow is sourced from snowmelt the relative temperature of its relatively cool source water can overcome radiative heat fluxes resulting in buffered water temperatures blaen et al 2013 leach moore 2014 we observed a similar effect where predicted stmax tended to be lower at sites that received higher proportions of precipitation as snow however it s not clear whether the importance of snow in our models reflects the hydrologic relationship between streamflow source and water temperature or if the predictor is simply another manifestation of climate gradients continental scale patterns in snow fraction coincide closely those of air temperature making it difficult to disentangle the spatial correlation between the variables and isolate the true source of the predictor s influence furthermore within the gages ii dataset the snow fraction variable only represents a static mean annual proportion of precipitation from 1901 to 2000 rather than a more detailed record of monthly snowpack volume aligned with our model period therefore the snow fraction predictor likely derives some of its importance in models of stmax by acting as a secondary proxy of regional climate patterns nonetheless our models show tentative evidence of a mechanistic link between snow and colder water temperatures leach moore 2014 null et al 2013 while we attribute broad spatial patterns in stream thermal regimes to regional climate variability basin to reach scale characteristics impart an additional layer of complexity on stream thermal regimes these watershed characteristics which include riparian shading land cover and subsurface hydrology among others modify a stream s radiative and hydrologic inputs to produce varied thermal responses from a single set of climate forcings hannah garner 2015 orr et al 2015 our second stream temperature metric the slope of the regression relationship between air temperatures and water temperatures ts is an explicit representation of how basin scale processes moderate broad scale climate conditions kelleher et al 2012 thermal sensitivity has been linked to measures of baseflow index stream size snowpack watershed slope and elevation beaufort et al 2020 kelleher et al 2012 lisi et al 2015 segura et al 2015 geographic trends in ts were weaker than those observed in stmax fig 4 confirming prior findings that metrics of water temperature sensitivity tend to be highly variable at regional and sub regional scales kelleher et al 2012 our analysis captured not only the importance of climate but equally the moderating effects of basin scale controls in importance metrics of stmax and ts models fig 5 6 in models of stmax a combination of hydrologic and watershed characteristics variables gained in relative importance during summer months the importance of baseflow to both stmax fig 5 and ts at undammed sites fig 6b aligns with our expectations of groundwater induced cooling of water temperatures summer stream temperatures are often depressed and decoupled from air temperatures along reaches receiving large fluxes of groundwater inflow due to the relatively cold temperature of groundwater beaufort et al 2020 kelleher et al 2012 we also identified two proxies of hydrologic residence time drainage area and watershed slope as influential geomorphic predictors of stmax fig 5 in large watersheds draining low gradient terrain long hydrologic residence times allow surface waters to accumulate radiative inputs and reach warmer maximum temperatures caissie 2006 garner et al 2014 lisi et al 2015 in contrast smaller and steeper watersheds tend to produce cooler thermal responses due to their shorter residence times lisi et al 2015 segura et al 2015 watershed elevation also imparted a buffering effect on models of ts at undammed sites likely due to correlative links between elevation watershed slope and snowpack fig 6b during winter and into early spring ts had a strong positive relationship with air temperatures where colder temperatures corresponded to decoupled air water temperatures while it was challenging to identify a definitive mechanism for this control prior studies have observed that air and water temperatures tend to become disconnected when water temperatures approach 0 c kelleher et al 2012 mohseni et al 1998 this effect could be attributed to river ice cover which would insulate waters from radiative forcings or to the presence of snow that melting of which would provide an external source of cold water to buffer waters against temperature change brown hannah 2008 mellor et al 2017 rain on snow events could also contribute relatively cool water to streams further decoupling air and water temperatures leach moore 2014 while our findings do agree with the existing literature it is important to keep in mind that our findings are based on empirical inference though rf models can effectively detect influential predictors of temperature behavior our analysis does not pinpoint how a certain predictor affects a stream s thermal regime to alleviate this shortcoming deterministic water models which explicitly quantify energy and fluid fluxes could be paired with machine learning models to confirm the role of a predictor of interest 4 2 anthropogenic influence on stream thermal regimes the river network of the continental us through a wide range of anthropogenic modifications has been heavily fragmented disrupted and impounded dynesius nilsson 1994 grill et al 2019 the construction of dams deforestation of riparian buffers channelization and urbanization have interrupted the natural hydrologic regimes of free flowing rivers and in turn dramatically altered their thermal behavior grill et al 2019 hester doyle 2011 while each catchment is affected by a unique suite of anthropogenic influences human disturbances generally tend to cause net warming of water temperatures through loss of shading reduced groundwater exchange and the effects of a warming global climate caissie 2006 hester doyle 2011 hill et al 2014 somers et al 2013 the most notable exception to this general trend of anthropogenic warming is that of dams and their associated upstream reservoirs along river reaches downstream of large dams the seasonal patterns of stream thermal regimes are altered often resulting in cooler and more insensitive water temperatures in the summer and warmer temperatures in autumn and winter seasons ahmad et al 2021 angilletta et al 2008 casado et al 2013 kelleher et al 2012 this effect is most pronounced for dams that bottom release from the relatively cold hypolimnion of deep thermally stratified reservoirs cheng et al 2020 the anthropogenic impacts on stream thermal regimes are readily apparent in models of both stmax and ts overprinting other natural controls across all sites the volume of dam storage normalized to watershed area per the national inventory of dams was the single most important predictor of ts fig 6a 7c in our dataset larger volumes of dam storage in watersheds corresponded to decoupled air water temperatures and more insensitive water temperature responses the importance of dam storage in models of ts likely illustrates the strong contrast in sensitivity between undammed streams where water temperatures tend to be more atmospherically coupled and impounded streams which have relatively flat ts relationships kelleher et al 2012 these effects were mirrored though to a lesser degree in models of monthly stmax although dam storage was relatively uninfluential across all sites fig 5a reservoir volume exhibited a strong negative correlation with predicted summer stmax for dammed sites supplemental material fig s2 the diminished importance of dam storage in models of stmax relative to models of ts could indicate that extreme temperatures although moderated by the effects of reservoirs are still primarily controlled by atmospheric forcings amongst sites in impounded watersheds the apparent cooling and atmospheric decoupling effects of dams may also reflect the contrast in hydrologic function between impoundments of varying sizes though large reservoirs often cause cool and insensitive downstream temperatures casado et al 2013 cheng et al 2020 comparatively smaller storage dams can induce the opposite effect resulting in downstream warming for instance maheu et al 2016 found that releases from shallow impoundments depth 6 m which have a larger proportion of surface area exposed to radiative heating caused warming of summer stream temperatures by up to 2 c given that our dataset contains a wide range of reservoir volumes the importance of dam storage in our models may highlight these opposing end member behaviors we also emphasize that although the mean distance from gages effected by impoundments n 239 to the nearest major dam was 18 3 km we still observed the alteration of stream thermal regimes by dams this underscores the longitudinal persistence of dams downstream thermal effects which under some circumstances can still be observed up to 100 km downstream angilletta et al 2008 lowney 2000 willis et al 2021 the importance of dam storage in our models clearly indicates the necessity to better understand the thermal implications of dam operations on river networks to accurately predict future stream temperatures while dams may embody the most direct disruption of natural hydrologic systems urbanization climate change and other human actions on the landscape also intersect with stream thermal regimes hester doyle 2011 kurylyk et al 2015 steel et al 2017 deforestation of riparian buffers wondzell et al 2019 declines in groundwater inflow due to pumping and other diversions kurylyk et al 2015 warmer air temperatures hill et al 2014 wondzell et al 2019 and power plant effluent discharges miara et al 2018 all been linked to warmer stream temperatures hester doyle 2011 mechanistically anthropogenic activities alter hydrological and thermal process and yet outside of dam storage little of this influence is captured in our models there are several potential explanations for this lack of importance given to human related predictors first while our models contain key predictors that explicitly represent anthropogenic disruption there are many other impacts associated with human activity that cannot be determined at the scale of our investigation additionally anthropogenic impacts are also implicitly represented by their modification of predictors such as air temperature riparian forest land cover and baseflow index as human activities on the landscape overprint natural hydrologic and thermal responses it is difficult to discern whether the importance of a particular predictor such as baseflow index is controlled by natural patterns in subsurface flow or human disruption of hydrologic systems finally the paucity of sites used in this study due to limited st observations makes it likely that our models undersample urban streams and therefore underrepresent the influence of humans on stream thermal regimes of the urbanized sites that we do include our models may struggle to adequately represent stream temperature behavior given the inherent difficulty in modeling the complex variability of urban hydrologic systems 4 3 seasonal variability in key controls of stream temperatures the importance of individual predictors as well as the aggregate importance of predictor categories tended to vary seasonally for both modeled st metrics in response to the relative strength of dynamic drivers fig 5 6 7 8 in models of stmax at all sites this effect was best demonstrated by the relative rise in importance of baseflow index drainage area dam storage and watershed slope during summer months fig 5a we observed a similar summer decline in the influence of climate predictors accompanied by a shift to a more complex suite of basin scale predictors for ts fig 6 prior modeling studies of stream temperature regimes have found comparable summer winter contrasts in influential model predictors in monthly multiple linear regression models of maximum and mean stream temperature respectively hrachowitz et al 2010 and imholt et al 2013 noted that summer models of thermal behavior required more parameters than winter models these results coupled with findings from our models suggest that the controls on both stream temperature magnitude and ts are more complex during summer months hrachowitz et al 2010 imholt et al 2013 while these seasonal patterns in importance are logically supported by our understanding of stream thermal processes it is also possible that a component of this signal may be an artifact of ensemble learning algorithms and associated variable importance metrics when applied to rf models variable importance metrics assess which predictors are most useful in differentiating the behavior of a metric across a set of sites in winter we observe strong latitudinal contrasts in both air and stream temperatures in the conterminous us which likely reflect differences in incoming radiation received by between northern and southern sites fig 4a these coincident spatial patterns make air temperature an effective winter predictor of stmax fig 5 this does not mean that regional climate and radiative inputs are less influential controls on summer stream temperatures at individual sites only that that differences in thermal behavior across sites are not easily explained by summer climate 4 4 implications for watershed management globally climate change is expected to alter the thermal regimes of streams with the warmest water temperatures projected to increase by up to 2 c ficklin et al 2013 van vliet et al 2013 wanders et al 2019 watershed management strategies including riparian planting preservation of natural land cover and groundwater and flow manipulation have been employed to resist this regime shift and to preserve cold water refugia for sensitive instream ecosystems beaufort et al 2020 kurylyk et al 2015 machine learning and big data investigations of stream temperature can supplement these efforts as such approaches are capable of efficiently identifying the most influential atmospheric and landscape controls on thermal processes from large environmental datasets we do however acknowledge that the conclusions drawn from continental scale models may be challenging to translate into actionable management solutions at specific sites the rivers of the us drain catchments that span a diverse spectrum of physiography and climate and as such it is probable that stream thermal regimes in each ecoregion are influenced by different landscape processes the spatially unfocused continental scale rf models likely struggle to capture this regional heterogeneity in controls regional models of water temperature behavior present a promising alternative to nation wide models as they can discern relevant controls at scales better suited to the management of individual watersheds in our models of stmax in three distinct regions we show that although climate remained a dominant influence across the us its influence was mediated by a suite of watershed scale predictors unique to each geographic area fig 8 for example wetland land cover and water table depth were relatively influential predictors of stmax in the south atlantic gulf region yet the variables showed negligible importance in the other two selected regions fig 8b similarly riparian forest land cover had a strong negative effect on spring water temperatures in the pacific northwest an effect not observed in the us northeast or south fig 8c these contrasts confirm that much like the drivers of hydrologic behavior the controls on stream thermal regimes are also non uniform across the us with considerable implications for the management of water temperatures gannon et al 2022 hammond et al 2021 this spatial heterogeneity suggests that the efficacy of successful thermal management strategies in one geographic region may not translate into similar levels of success elsewhere however regional inference is limited in under monitored regions such as the us southwest with additional stream temperature monitoring machine learning models of stream temperatures at sub regional scales could become increasingly practical future investigations of landscape controls on stream thermal regimes should attempt to discern influential processes at local spatial scales by leveraging the information provided by data intensive yet regional models thermal management strategies can be tailored to target watershed modifications that are most effective for a specific region hrachowitz et al 2010 imholt et al 2013 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated the distribution of two water temperature metrics stmax and ts across 410 rivers in the conterminous us and used rf models to infer the dominant space time drivers of stream thermal regimes our results highlight that above all else there is not a single set of universal controls that comprehensively explain stream temperature behavior instead we found that the most influential controls on select water temperature metrics varied across a range of predictor categories climate watershed characteristics hydrology and human influence broadly maximum water temperatures were linked most closely to air temperatures although the role of climate was mediated by basin scale processes especially in summer months the presence of major dams was the most influential predictor of thermal sensitivity within our dataset illustrating the profound impact anthropogenic disturbances have on stream thermal processes often these human impacts on river water temperature have been somewhat overlooked ficklin et al 2023 although many approaches to the study of stream temperatures focus solely on the warmest summer water temperatures we highlight explicitly the need to explore the controls on additional modes of water temperature variability in both space and time while we address maximum temperatures and thermal sensitivity at a monthly time step in our models there are many other stream temperature metrics of ecological importance including degree day accumulation diurnal range and the timing and frequency of extreme events casado et al 2013 steel et al 2017 these metrics will almost certainly be controlled by unique combinations of land surface processes and a comprehensive understanding of their dominant drivers will allow for the development of more effective management approaches as well as providing new information on river water temperature controls we believe our results make a methodological contribution our analysis exemplifies the discerning power of machine learning approaches when applied to large and complex environmental datasets random forest algorithms and related tree based models are relatively simple ml applications yet they allow us to resolve complex and seasonally variable controls on stream thermal regimes while the findings of our analysis demonstrate the advantages provided by big data approaches to hydrology they also emphasize that caution and nuance are needed in translating model results into human interpretable insights the types of models used in this study rely only on statistical relationships between water temperature behavior and landscape covariates meaning that their implications are inferential rather than causal to extend confidence in predictions and to support management predictions we recommend that machine learning approaches should be supplemented by process based hydrologic understanding and models to confirm the influence and interaction of variables across individual sites nonetheless by powerful comparative analysis our research yields new perspectives into the time varying controls water temperature regimes across watersheds that span strong gradients in climate hydrology watershed characteristics and degrees of

1736,hydrological models offer the opportunity to evaluate wetland conservation networks as nature based solutions to mitigate hydrological extremes to optimize the replication of a hydrological model response i e stream flows the models rely on input data land cover hydrographic network soil types topography meteorological data and parameters however the effect of parametric uncertainty on the simulated variables and the spatio temporal variability of this sensitivity are insufficiently documented this study presents an application of the novel global sensitivity analysis method the variogram analysis of response surface to the isolated and riparian wetland modules of hydrotel a semi distributed process based deterministic model on two watersheds located in the province of quebec canada the analysis accounted for i the spatial variability by assessing the sensitivity at various locations in the watersheds and by compiling sensitivity indices for wetland networks discretized following the strahler order classification which quantifies the structure of hydrographic networks and ii the temporal variability of the sensitivity using the generalized global sensitivity matrix the results indicate that the parameters defining the geometry of wetlands area depth are the most sensitive for both isolated and riparian wetlands and for all strahler orders the temporal assessment of sensitivity highlights the seasonal controlling processes including a peaking sensitivity of the maximum water depth in wetlands during spring snowmelt whereas the sensitivity of the evapotranspiration parameter increases during summer but is null during winter results also indicate that the parameters of the isolated modules are more sensitive for wetlands located on lower stream order upstream headwaters while those of the riparian modules display a greater sensitivity when wetlands are located on higher strahler orders downstream main channel these findings deepen our understanding of the impact of wetland features on stream flows and provide guidelines to plan future data acquisition campaigns in wetlandscapes keywords hydrotel hydroconnectivity time varying sensitivity analysis variogram analysis of response surface field data acquisition strahler order data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the development of hydrological models has advanced our understanding of how landscape features affect watershed hydrology for example the integration of wetland hydrology in watershed scale models has allowed researchers to investigate how river flows react to diverse configurations of wetland coverage location typologies and or hydro connectivity in various climates and geological environments blanchette et al 2022 evenson et al 2018 fossey et al 2016 goyette et al 2022 over the last decade or so wetlands have been the subject of increasing scientific and political attention thanks to their key role in mitigating stream flows nevertheless it is essential to remain critical when drawing conclusions from model outputs indeed exhaustive sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of semi distributed hydrological models used to assess the impact of wetlands on hydrological variables have yet to be carried out comprehensively consequently although models were developed with the most up to date scientific knowledge of wetland hydrology it is still unclear how uncertainties in input data and model parameters may affect simulation results for instance most semi distributed hydrological models rely on empirical power equations describing volume area depth relationships that are governed by wetland geometry rahman et al 2016 among models hydrotel a semi distributed hydrological model fossey et al 2015 assumes that maximum wetland extents can be derived from remotely sensed land cover data this maximum surface area along with parameters of the volume area depth relationships subsequently intervene at every computational time step to assess water storage and fluxes meanwhile remotely sensed data are affected by antecedent meteorological and soil moisture conditions at the time of acquisition and conversely govern the spatial resolution of input data and wetland parameters thus impacting model response all these issues emphasize the need for an in depth quantification of the effect of any parameter induced uncertainties on model outputs by definition sensitivity analysis sa studies how the uncertainty in the output of a model can be apportioned to the different sources of uncertainty in the model input saltelli et al 2004 the scientific community agrees that sa should be the first step of any new model implementation as it provides key insights on its performances to reproduce a given system razavi et al 2021 reported four overarching purposes of sa i explore causalities processes and interactions of the modelled system ii reduce dimensionality iii target data acquisition and iv support decision two main categories of sa coexist first local sa refers to methods where inputs are modified around a nominal value to observe the effect on model response local methods provide a simple and fast option to perform sa but they are limited to assessing the impact of individual parameters independently not accounting for possible interactions in this context local methods are inadequate when it comes to assessing complex models representing earth and environmental systems including hydrological models for these systems global sensitivity analysis gsa methods such as derivative based morris 1991 distribution based sobol 1993 variogram based razavi and gupta 2016b a or regression based iman and helton 1988 are better suited as they provide a global representation of how the different factors work and interact across the full problem space to influence some function of the system output razavi et al 2021 although it comes with high computational costs gsa remains a judicious means of comprehensively assessing the quality of model input approximation and diagnosing any flaw in model structure traditional sensitivity analysis applications rely on performance metrics which aggregate the propagation of uncertainties and may lead to a loss of information regarding sensitivity at finer temporal scales pianosi and wagener 2016 in response to this loss of information time variant gsa tools where sensitivity metrics are computed at every time step have been developed to study how simulated processes dominance varies in time pianosi and wagener 2016 razavi and gupta 2019 among others bajracharya et al 2020 korgaonkar et al 2020 medina and mu√±oz 2020 razavi and gupta 2019 pianosi and wagener 2016 performed a time variant sensitivity analysis using pawn pianosi and wagener 2015 a density based sa method on the hydrologiska byr√•ns vattenbalansavdelning hbv model applied to three watersheds in the usa the english river in iowa the french broad river in north carolina and the guadalupe river in texas their results confirmed that time variant sensitivity analysis can reveal sensitivity information that could be hidden in sa based on aggregated performance metrics among the models that are well suited for representing wetlands at the watershed scale many underwent a form of sa while developing a swat extension module simulating riparian wetlands rw liu et al 2008 conducted a partial and local sa on the wetland geometric parameters normal depth and ratio between normal and maximum surface areas relative to stream flow for an application on the upper canagagigue creek watershed 53 km2 in southern ontario canada their results highlighted the necessity of calibrating geometric parameters especially when field data are available building upon this work rahman et al 2016 modified the rw extension module of swat by replacing the unidirectional interaction between wetlands and river aquifer with a hydraulic based bidirectional connection to assess how these parameters affect the sensitivity of stream flows and wetland storage they analyzed the temporal dynamics of parameter sensitivity reusser et al 2011 based on the fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast cukier et al 1973 they applied this method on two sub basins wetland drainage area 96 located in the barak kushiyara river transboundary watershed 35 563 km2 shared by india and bangladesh their results revealed a high temporal variability in parameter sensitivity to assess the impact of geographically isolated wetlands iws on water table and base flow variation mclaughlin et al 2014 combined shallow water table and soil moisture process based models with a wetland hydrology model their sa showed that wetland elevation and confining layer elevation which are driven by changes in the geometry of the wetland system displayed a significant sensitivity as a first attempt to understand the relative sensitivities of the wetland parameters of hydrotel a semi distributed hydrological model fossey et al 2015 performed a local sa using the b√©cancour river watershed 2 597 km2 12 of wetlands cover including 8 of iws and 4 of rws they used the local one parameter at a time method ben nasr 2014 bouda et al 2014 mailhot and villeneuve 2003 to evaluate how parameter variations affected stream flows at three different locations within the watershed following an upstream downstream gradient their results suggested that the parameters of the iw module are the most influential ones when compared to those of the rw module with some variability between the river reaches of interest although quite informative some questions have remained especially regarding interactions between parameters and large parameter space more importantly their investigation raises questions regarding the spatio temporal variability of sensitivity including i are stream flows equally sensitive to various wetland spatial configurations at the watershed scale ii how does sensitivity temporally vary one way to provide answers to these questions is to perform a spatio temporal gsa this would not only provide a more comprehensive understanding of the influence of the wetland parameters of hydrotel but also help us to interpret the modelling results in this instance to put in perspective the role of wetlands at the watershed scale this would be particularly relevant given the fact that the model has been used to assess the role of wetlands i during floods in the large canada usa lake champlain richelieu river watershed rousseau et al 2022 ii as flood resilience landscapes in china wu et al 2020 iii in regulating streamflows wu et al 2020 and iv the effect of river damming on their hydrological functions wu et al 2021 the model has also been used to investigate whether wetlands can mitigate the impact of climate change in both canada fossey and rousseau 2016a b and china wu et al 2022 in this paper we present the results of a gsa on the iw and rw modules of hydrotel using a novel variogram based method razavi and gupta 2016b a we combine this algorithm with the generalized global sensitivity matrix ggsm to account for the sensitivity temporal variability we also specifically address the spatial variability by i carrying out the sa on two distinct watersheds located in southeastern canada the st charles river and the b√©cancour river watersheds and ii assessing the sensitivity at various locations in the latter watersheds moreover for both watersheds we test how different spatial configurations of wetlands at the watershed scale can affect parameter sensitivity 2 material and methods 2 1 study area two watersheds with distinct characteristics of wetland cover land use and soils were selected to perform the sa the st charles river watershed 554 km2 and the b√©cancour river watershed 2 597 km2 both located in quebec canada fig 1 the st charles river watershed comprises five tributaries with a stream network ranging from 1 to 5 strahler orders des hurons 137 km2 jaune 82 km2 nelson 74 km2 lorette 72 km2 and du berger 57 km2 the watershed is located on the north shore of the st lawrence river many lakes are found in the watershed the most important being lake st charles which is used as a drinking water reservoir for 300 000 citizens of the region to ensure long term protection of the water quality and quantity quebec city recently acquired a bio hydrologically relevant wetland complex to help mitigate the impact of accelerated anthropogenic development in some parts of the watershed in this specific watershed there is indeed good synergy between wetland scientists and municipal authorities to improve our understanding of wetland services and used them in urban planning wetlands and their contributing areas ca cover 6 and 22 of the watershed respectively the nelson sub watershed fig 2 d 9 has the highest wetland cover followed by the lorette sub watershed fig 2 g 7 while those two sub watersheds are dominated by iws rws dominate the other sub watersheds the majority of iws are found in headwater hillslopes the watershed is mostly urbanized in the downstream part southern portion while the northern portion is mainly covered with forests belonging to the balsam fir yellow birch and balsam fir white birch bioclimatic region agence des for√™ts priv√©es du qu√©bec 03 2001 the watershed is characterized by subpolar temperatures humid precipitation and mean growing season in the north and by moderate temperatures sub humid precipitation and long growing season in the southern part fig 3 a top and middle gerardin and mckenney 2001 litynski 1988 the k√∂ppen geiger climate classification places the watershed in the warm summer humid continental climate dfb however this classification could evolve to a hot summer humid continental climate dfa over the 2071 2100 horizon beck et al 2018 based on 47 climate change projections mean daily temperatures are expected to increase between current 1980 2019 and future 2060 2099 climate and the snow rain precipitation ratio will also decrease during winter and early spring for the st charles watershed specifically goyette et al 2022 covered with sandy loam clay loam and loamy sand soil textures most of the watershed unfolds on the grenville geological province but some parts of the downstream region are located within the st lawrence platform and the appalachians geological province the conjunction of these three geological provinces and their fault line explains a rather complex topography it is characterized by rounded and crystalline hills on the grenville province with slopes up to 60 smaller monticules and terraces in the central part with slopes lower than 10 and the part located on the appalachian province consists of a hill with slopes from 11 to 15 brodeur et al 2009 the b√©cancour river starts at the outlet of lake b√©cancour which is in the city of thetford mines and ends on the southern shore of the st lawrence river close to the city of b√©cancour the watershed has a rather high wetland cover 12 draining 31 of its territory fig 2 forested peatlands 4 9 and swamps 4 0 dominate canards illimit√©s canada and minist√®re de l environnement et lutte contre les changements climatiques 2020 but this watershed also has an important cover of open ombrotrophic peatlands 1 1 the hydrographic network includes 62 lakes 1 ha and drains a territory that is mostly covered by forests 54 eastern sugar maple basswood and sugar maple yellow birch bioclimatic domains agence foresti√®re des bois francs 2015 and agriculture 23 the watershed has moderate temperatures sub humid precipitations and a long growing season fig 3 b top and middle gerardin and mckenney 2001 litynski 1988 under current climate conditions mean precipitation is 1 297 mm in the upper part and 1 085 mm at the outlet while mean temperatures are 4 c and 4 7 c at thetford mines 1971 2000 and b√©cancour respectively morin and boulanger 2005 beck et al 2018 predicted that the k√∂ppen geiger climate classification will evolve from warm summer humid continental to hot summer humid continental in the future rugged landforms strong slopes and altitude ranging between 100 and 600 m characterize the upper southern half of the watershed located within the appalachians mountains while the lower northern half extends on the st lawrence platform where the topography is lightly undulated with gentler slopes and altitudes below 100 m the surface deposits are characterized as till with a loamy soil texture in the upper part while loamy sands cover the lower part since the majority of wetlands on the watershed are located in this region and to increase computational efficiency the sa was performed upstream of hydrometric station 024014 considering their specific discharge discharge divided by the total surface area of the watershed the st charles and b√©cancour river watersheds have similar hydrographs fig 3 a and b bottom however the st charles river watershed which has a smaller area a steeper topography and slightly higher mean precipitations shows more reactivity than the b√©cancour watershed including a higher spring snowmelt stream flow 2 2 physitel hydrotel modelling platform input data processing steps and wetland integration we performed a sa on the iw and rw

availability of local expertise to analyze and interpret the results this platform includes a specialized geographic information system gis physitel no√´l et al 2014 rousseau et al 2011 turcotte et al 2001 which is used to build and format a physiographic database to support the implementation of distributed hydrological models hydrotel bouda et al 2014 bouda et al 2012 fortin et al 2001 turcotte et al 2007 turcotte et al 2003 is a semi distributed process based deterministic model built around nine computational modules simulating different components of the hydrological cycle among them meteorological data interpolation snow accumulation and melt soil temperature and freezing potential evapotranspiration and vertical water budget are applied at the relatively hydrologically homogeneous units rhhus i e hillslopes scale the computational unit of hydrotel runoff routing relies on a geomorphological unit hydrograph generated with a reference depth of water which performs a temporal distribution of the vertical water budget output finally water routing in the hydrographic network is computed at the river reach scale using as inputs water from the upstream river reach and runoff from the adjacent hillslopes the model accounts for the contribution of wetlands to watershed hydrology via two wetland modules representing iws and rws integrated at the hillslope scale by fossey et al 2015 the iw module is represented as a control volume of the vertical water budget with its outlet connected to the runoff routing module the rw module is partially integrated to the vertical water budget and has a connection to the river flow routing module for the st charles river watershed a 20 m digital elevation model dem and a vectorial river network 1 50 000 both extracted

meteorological data including precipitation minimum and maximum temperature covering the 1963 2020 period were extracted from environment and climate change canada s database using the package weathercan in r v 4 0 4 a radius of 75 km st charles and 100 km b√©cancour from the center of each watershed was used to select the meteorological stations a total of 28 stations were considered for the st charles watershed while 63 stations were included for the b√©cancour watershed for the st charles precipitation data from 31 rain gauges operated by quebec city were also included in the meteorological dataset to prepare the physiographic database physitel i calculates the slope and flow direction for each cell ii processes the flow accumulation matrix iii discretizes the watershed

software toolkit for research involving computational heuristics ostrich v17 12 19 https www civil uwaterloo ca envmodelling ostrich html matott 2017 to minimize initialization errors and account for the water balance warm up the first year was removed prior to the calculation of the objective functions in addition winter stream flows november to march ice on period were excluded from the calibration since the uncertainty related to measurements during this period is high daily observed stream flows provided by the cehq fig 1 were compared with daily simulated stream flows using the kge gupta et al 2009 and nse log oudin et al 2006 as objective functions calculated with the r package hydrogof r core team 2020 zambrano bigiarini 2020 and the python package hydroeval hallouin 2021 for the st charles watershed a sub watershed calibration strategy was implemented meaning that each sub watershed except the st charles sub watershed was calibrated independently the values of the parameters of the nelson des hurons and jaune river being set the final calibration involved the area between the outlets of the subwatersheds and that of the st charles sub watershed using the daily observed stream flows of station 090504 fig 1 for this specific station a water intake was considered in the calibration process and an ecological stream flow 0 33 m3 s needed to be met for the whole period of calibration the b√©cancour watershed was calibrated between january 1st 2004 and december 31st 2015 using daily observed stream flows at station 024014 fig 1 minist√®re de l environnement et la lutte contre les changements climatiques 2021 for this watershed data on water withdrawals which come from underground sources or ecological stream flow were unavailable so they were not accounted for by hydrotel the calibration exercise was deemed satisfactory and characterized by good performance metrics for the different river reaches under study table 1 2 4 sensitivity analysis 2 4 1 vars toolbox theoretical background parameter sensitivity was assessed using the variogram analysis of response surface vars toolbox razavi et al 2019 which is compatible with any model through a connection with ostrich matott 2017 inspired by the variogram techniques that are of common usage in geostatistical analyses vars is a recently developed gsa method where the response surface of the model is considered as a spatially distributed dependent variable it recognizes that there is a spatial and continuous covariance structure in the model response a variogram Œ≥ equation 9 describes this spatial covariance structure for a given stochastic process 9 Œ≥ h 1 2 n h i j n h y x a y x b 2 where h is the variogram scale distance between computational points n h is the number of pairs of points that are h distant y x a and y x b are the model responses in the parametric space at location x a and x b respectively in the context of a gsa the vars method consists of generating a variogram for each parameter thus higher Œ≥ h i values indicate a higher sensitivity in the direction of parameter i razavi and gupta 2016a the sensitivity index associated with the vars method is the integrated variogram ivar equation 10 10 Œ≥ h i 0 h i Œ≥ h i d h i for a scale interval from 0 to h i and for parameter i as suggested by the authors values associated with a 50 interval ivar50 were used in this study the relative sensitivity ivar50n presented throughout the paper is calculated as follows 11 i v a r 50 n i v a r 50 i i n i v a r 50 i 2 4 2 sensitivity analyses of the wetland modules the sa focused on the parameters of the wetland modules as a first step the star based sampling strategy included in the vars toolbox was used to generate the parameter sets according to the lower and upper bounds reported in table 2 this framework generates parameter sets covering all the parametric space and facilitates the computation of sensitivity metrics razavi and gupta 2016b the strategy consists of i randomly generating m points star centers across the factor space and ii aligning equally spaced points along each dimension i e parameters n in the factor space based on a user defined sampling resolution Œ¥h following these steps the final number of parameter sets r is 12 r m n 1 Œ¥ h 1 1 in this study we used 50 stars a sampling resolution of 0 1 and the latin hypercube sampling to generate the parameter sets second for each parameter set we ran the model using the model evaluation program integrated in the parallelized version of ostrich using supercomputers beluga and narval managed by calcul qu√©bec and the digital research alliance of canada the model was run from january 1st 1999 to december 31st 2020 and a 365 day spin up period was removed from the beginning of the resulting time series to minimize initialization errors third to account for sensitivity temporal variability we calculated daily mean sensitivity indices over the 2000 2020 period i e ivar50 using vars and the generalized global sensitivity matrix ggsm in matlab r2018b to assess wetland parameter sensitivity at the hillslope scale as well as the watershed scale we then performed two categories of sas fig 4 first to assess how a variation in the value of parameters affects the outflow of the wetland modules v fout and v ex that is the hillslope hew scale a sa was conducted for specific hews located in the jaune river sub watershed based on the definition of wetland networks suggested by blanchette et al 2022 which is described in terms of specific wetland area and ca criteria four isolated hews and four riparian hews were selected fig 5 for each typology i e isolated and riparian the four wetlands belonged to one of the following networks small wetland with small ca into the small wetlands group pi small wetland with large ca into the small wetlands group pii large wetland with small ca into the large wetlands group piii and large wetland with large ca into the large wetlands group piv the selected wetlands were hydrologically independent from each other then hydrotel was run using 2750 and 2300 parameter sets and ivar50 was computed on v fout and v ex for iws and rws respectively second sas were performed at both the watershed scale and the sub watershed scale using 5000 parameter sets the parameters of both wetland modules were varied simultaneously for this analysis for the st charles river watershed ivar50 was calculated using the simulated outlet flows of the watershed and each sub watershed moreover in line with the calibration strategy for the simulated stream flows at the outlet of the watershed a water withdrawal data provided by quebec city was removed from simulated data and a minimum ecological flow of 0 33 m3 s was enforced for the b√©cancour river watershed ivar50n was calculated on simulated stream flows at station 024014 to account for the impact of wetland location on the variability of wetland parameter sensitivities we divided the wetlands of each study watershed by strahler order the strahler order classification strahler 1957 is used to quantify the structure of a hydrographic network and the relative location of each river reach it can be used as an indicator of stream size hughes et al 2011 the reaches head are assigned a value of 1 which goes up at each branch we identified the strahler order of each river reach and assigned it to the corresponding hillslopes using arcmap v10 6 1 https www esri com environmental systems research institute esri 2018 we used the list of hillslopes to assign a strahler order to each isolated hew and each riparian hew we then created hydrotel projects containing only the wetlands corresponding to specific strahler orders by modifying the files describing wetlands comma separated files listing wetland parameters and hew spatial characteristics for each hillslope or river reach for iws and rws respectively for example in the case of wetlands associated with 1st order river reaches only them were included in the simulation that is wetlands of strahler order 2 or higher were not simulated in the model this resulted in five sa projects for the b√©cancour river watershed all wetlands strahler order 1 to 4 and six projects for the st charles river watershed all wetlands strahler order 1 to 5 all those projects were evaluated with the same list of 5000 parameter sets using the supercomputers 3 results 3 1 parameter sensitivity at the hillslope hew scale the parameter sensitivity at the hillslope hew scale varies for iws and rws for both wetland modules fig 6 the geometry parameters defined by frac iw frac rw wetdnor iw wetdnor rw wetdmax iw and wetdmax rw largely explains the parametric sensitivity of wetland outflow for iws and rws they explain 59 67 and 83 97 of the sensitivity respectively indeed the geometry of wetlands directly affects the volume of water they can store and modulates hillslope hydrology local scale and watershed hydrology jones et al 2018 mclaughlin et al 2014 for iws cev iw and cprod iw explain 6 25 of the sensitivity which indicates the low sensitivity of the geometric parameters for this specific typology soil parameters ksatbs iw ksatbs rw and ksatbk iw account for 15 28 of the sensitivity for iws and 2 17 for rws the contribution of each parameter to the global sensitivity at the outlet of the hews is variable across the wetland spatial configurations and even intra typologies i e iw or rw for iws wetdmax iw has a much higher sensitivity for wetlands with larger cas ivar50n 0 57 and 0 53 for pii and piv respectively suggesting that the outflow from iws hydrologically fed by a large area is closely related to their maximum water depth moreover iws with larger cas are more sensitive to cprod iw contribution of hew to terrestrial flow conversely for iws with smaller cas the outflow is more sensitive to frac iw ivar50n 0 32 and 0 29 for pi and piii respectively and wetdnor iw ivar50n 0 23 and 0 21 for pi and piii respectively two parameters related to normal flow conditions iws with smaller cas highly rely on precipitation input to store water as they cannot rely on runoff from their cas consequently their surface area strongly affects their capacity to store water and the volume of outflows for rws wetdnor rw is more sensitive for small wetlands with small cas pi and large wetlands with large cas piv while wetlands with average spatial characteristics pii and piii are more sensitive to wetdmax rw additionally only large wetlands with large cas are sensitive to ksatbk rw these results highlight the impact of the spatial configuration area ca of a wetland on its hydrological behavior at the hillslope scale 3 2 parameter sensitivity at the watershed scale at the outlet of the st charles watershed 6 wetland cover considering all typologies of wetlands and all strahler orders the most sensitive parameters are frac rw wetdnor rw and ksatbs rw which all belong to the rw module table 3 these dominant parameters are in line with the surface area of rws 3 2 which is 1 4 times more abundant than that of iws 2 5 at watershed scale cas are 13 for both the least sensitive parameters are frac iw cev iw and wetdnor iw on the other hand the proportion of land cover by isolated and riparian hews also clearly drives the b√©cancour sensitivity rankings at the hydrometric station of the b√©cancour river the most sensitive parameters all belong to the iw module wetdnor iw ksatbs iw and cprod iw while the five least sensitive parameters are those of the rw module this reflects a clear correlation with the dominant typology of wetlands at watershed scale where iws 7 5 draining 28 of the watershed are 3 75 times more abundant than rws 2 draining 7 of the watershed for both watersheds ksatbk rw is the least sensitive parameter the contribution of this parameter is limited to a specific case of the iterative scheme fossey et al 2015 it weakens its sensitivity compared to the other parameters 3 3 spatial variability of parameter sensitivity at watershed and sub watershed scales at the outlet of the st charles river fig 7 a when considering the wetlands associated with river reaches of strahler order i wetdmax iw and cprod iw present the highest sensitivities with ivar50n values reaching 0 23 and 0 17 respectively these two parameters become impactful during high precipitation events and or snowmelt season additionally the high sensitivities of those parameters for iws related to headwater streams suggests their wetlands might have a strong impact on mitigating downstream peak flows for wetlands of strahler orders ii iii and v the rw parameters display a substantially high sensitivity with frac rw being the most sensitive parameter with ivar50n values of 0 25 0 28 and 0 25 respectively as mentioned previously frac is a very important parameter for both wetland modules as it connects s a wet m a x to s a wet n o r two variables that interact in the calculation of s a wet at every time step and ultimately to the volume of stored water for strahler order ii wetdnor rw is also among the most sensitive parameters followed by wetdmax rw which highlights the importance of the geometric parameters once more considering strahler order iii wetlands the most sensitive parameters are frac rw 0 28 ksatbs rw 0 21 and wetdnor rw 0 20 first these results reveal that while increasing stream order rw parameters become more sensitive compared to the iw parameters second they also depict that for rws located on stream order iii river flows are less influenced by changes in their maximum capacity to store water defined by wetdmax rw but seem rather driven by parameters associated with average wetdnor rw or low ksatbs rw flow conditions compared to rw located on strahler order ii for strahler order iv the most sensitive parameters are shared between the two wetland typologies ksatbs iw 0 15 wetdmax rw 0 14 and frac iw 0 13 and wetdnor iw 0 13 are ranked in the top three the dominant typology for each strahler order seems to drive the spectrum of sensitivity among parameters of the two modules indeed rws are dominant for strahler orders ii iii and v see total wetland area fig 2 while the ratio of iw to rw areas for strahler order i and iv is close to 1 1 however the ratio of ca is highly dominated by iws which could explain the high sensitivity of iw parameters for these strahler orders for the b√©cancour river watershed fig 7 b parameters related to the iw module are more sensitive among all strahler orders than those of the rw module this is expected considering the higher land cover of iws on this watershed which is always at least twice that of rws for the strahler orders ii and iii with nearly a 2 1 ratio ivar50n indices for rws are slightly higher than those for strahler orders i and iv conversely for strahler iv wetlands there is only 0 03 of rws for 1 85 of iws that is reflected in the values of ivar50n reaching the maximum value 0 29 among all hydrotel projects at watershed scale for wetdnor iw and ksatbs iw finally considering all strahler order projects and for both watersheds the time aggregated value of ksatbk rw relative sensitivity is consistently lower than 0 01 the effect of wetland typology on sensitivity rankings is even more convincing at the sub watershed scale for sub watersheds where there is a clear dominant typology the parameters related to this type of wetlands consistently have higher sensitivities when compared to those of the non dominant typology when ordering the results for each sub watershed strahler order project in ascending order of the ratios between iw and rw areas fig 8 this behavioral relationship becomes even more obvious this representation also highlights a threshold corresponding to a 1 1 ratio above which iws become dominant as do their parameters the results also suggest that although ksatbs rw was not highly sensitive at wetland scale section 3 1 its relative sensitivity metric increases considerably when investigating its impact at the watershed and sub watershed scales these results highlight the impact of location wetland vs watershed scale upstream vs downstream gradient and especially typology on parameter sensitivity 3 4 temporal variability of parameter sensitivity at watershed scale at watershed and sub watershed scales the sensitivity of stream flows to wetland parameters reveals a strong temporal variability which follows the seasonality of the different hydrological processes occurring in hews for the st charles watershed fig 9 while frac iw frac rw ksatbs iw ksatbs rw wetdnor iw and wetdnor rw exhibit high frequency variations daily they also present a substantial decrease in mean sensitivity calculated over the 2000 2020 period during the spring snowmelt season day of year doy 120 where wetdmax iw and wetdmax rw peak although wetdmax iw and wetdmax rw are not in the top three parameters when considering the watershed scale time aggregated sensitivity index wetdmax is ranked 4th and 5th for iw and rw respectively table 3 the daily mean ivar50n shows the strong influence of this parameter during spring in temperate regions during spring snowmelt is the dominant hydrological process during this time of the year wetland storage is generally at capacity and any exceeding inflow leads to wetland overflow that will reach the river network and affect stream flows therefore the maximum water table depth is highly sensitive under these conditions because it directly affects the capacity of the hew to store water this not only confirms the relevance of investigating temporal sensitivity gupta and razavi 2018 razavi and gupta 2019 but it also implies that at the peak of the spring snowmelt the variability in stream flows at the outlet of this watershed highly depends on the capacity of wetlands to store water consequently increasing or reducing this capacity hereby characterized by its maximum depth will influence output flows the peak sensitivity for wetdmax iw is delayed doy 150 compared with the peak sensitivity for wetdmax rw which occurs around doy 125 this suggests that iws may retain water longer than rws the latter being directly connected to the hydrographic network therefore when the water level in a rw reaches a certain threshold water transfers to the river the proximity and connection between rws and the river imply a high reactivity during the spring snowmelt season however this delayed peak in sensitivity does not appear for the b√©cancour river fig 10 for this watershed most of the sensitivity relies on the parameters of the iws which account for 79 of wetland area at watershed scale accordingly wetdmax iw sensitivity peak is much higher than that of wetdmax rw considering hydrogeological parameters ksatbs iw ksatbs rw and ksatbk rw results show that ivar50n remains stable for ksatbs iw and ksatbs rw for the st charles watershed during most of the year except during the spring snowmelt where as mentioned previously wetdmax rw becomes the dominant parameter for the b√©cancour watershed ivar50n ranges from 0 00 to 0 50 for ksatbs iw with slightly higher values during winter and values lower than 0 10 for ksatbs rw for both watersheds ksatbk rw is null throughout the year which confirms that this parameter could be set in the rws module finally looking more precisely at parameters related to the hydrological budget the relative sensitivity of cprod iw increases during spring and fall the relative sensitivity ranges between 0 and 0 30 for cev iw in both watersheds with almost null sensitivity beyond summer in canada 65 of the annual evapotranspiration occurs over three months that is june july and august and in the boreal shield ecozone evapotranspiration peaks in july wang et al 2013 thus during summer substantial loss of water through evapotranspiration affects stream flows while cev iw represents the percentage of evapotranspiration at the rhhu scale varying the value of this parameter directly affects the volume of water lost to the atmosphere at the hew scale v ev which in return has an impact on stream flows at the watershed scale comparing the relative sensitivities between the st charles and the b√©cancour watersheds it becomes evident that the stream flows at the outlet of the st charles river has a higher sensitivity to parameters characterizing high hydrological conditions wetdmax iw and wetdmax rw while stream flows on the b√©cancour seem more sensitive to parameters related to normal frac iw frac rw wetdnor iw and wetdnor rw and low ksatbs iw hydrological conditions aside from their different surface area ratios of iws versus rws this outcome might be explained by an insufficient wetland cover in the st charles river watershed to maintain so called normal wetland hydrological conditions wetlands of this watershed may therefore fill and overflow faster than those of the b√©cancour river consequently wetlands of the st charles watershed are more sensitive to wetdmax repeating a similar methodology on watersheds characterized by a variety of wetland covers could help refine these assumptions observing the sensitivity temporal variability for wetdmax iw specifically along a strahler order str gradient we can see that ivar50n peak occurs during spring decreases from str1 to str4 and disappears completely with str5 fig 11 a wetdmax rw shows the opposite behavior fig 11 b peak sensitivity increases from str1 to str3 and stabilizes for str4 and str5 these results corroborate those of fossey et al fossey et al 2016 regarding wetlands of the b√©cancour river watershed where upstream iws had a greater effect on modulating stream flows while downstream rws connected to the main stream were more efficient 4 discussion understanding how parameters interact in a model and affect outputs is essential to support the interpretation of simulation results not only can it help refine model parameterization but it also provides key insights on the modelled system in this paper we presented the results of a gsa performed on the wetland modules of the hydrological modelling platform physitel hydrotel using two case study watersheds along with the recently developed vars toolbox we implemented a spatio temporal gsa to quantitatively assess how wetland parameters affect simulation outputs and to guide future data acquisition field campaign to improve the representation of wetland related processes in the model our study demonstrated the dominant impact of geometric parameters at both the wetland scale i e hillslope hew scale and the watershed scale these parameters which include frac wetdmax and wetdnor participate in the calculation of the wetland water storage and wetland surface area at every computational time step such findings corroborate those of mclaughlin et al 2014 among others fossey et al 2015 liu et al 2008 who highlighted the importance of wetland geometry on stream flows however our results suggest that the relative sensitivity among these parameters varies with wetland configurations i e wetland extent and ca when investigating parameter sensitivity at the wetland scale in terms of wetland management this raises important questions as wetlands with different spatial configurations could respond differently to similar changes in their areas frac or depth wetdnor and wetdmax although we previously performed a quantitative assessment of how wetland area and ca affect stream flows blanchette et al 2022 performing an exhaustive gsa on scenarios of various wetland spatial configurations could prove to be useful to transfer our conclusions at watershed scale the methodological framework presented in this study also demonstrated that the ratio of surface area of iw to rw strongly affects the ranking of sensitivity among wetland parameters at the watershed scale accordingly in watersheds dominated by iws the sensitivity of stream flows will be mostly attributed to iw parameters while watersheds where the extent of rws exceed iw area they will exhibit higher sensitivity for rw parameters this finding nuances results found in the literature giving more impact to upstream iw compared to rw for mitigating high flows fossey et al 2016 and underlines the importance of wetland hydroconnectivity our results also indicate that wetland hydroconnectivity appears to impact stream flow sensitivity differently along a continuum of strahler orders especially when considering geometric parameters e g wetdmax indeed iws display higher sensitivities upstream low strahler order than downstream high strahler order while rws display the opposite behavior notwithstanding these findings were expected notably considering recent studies performed using hydrotel fossey et al 2015 fossey et al 2016 they are highly relevant in the context where setting wetland conservation and restoration targets at watershed scale remains a challenge for instance protecting iws located upstream constitutes an efficient mean of attenuating high flows and supporting low flows keeping in mind that changing geometrical characteristics of wetlands influences wetland outflows and river flows any wetland management strategy affecting the geometry of a wetland depth area subsurface geometry will impact stream flows more strongly if upstream iws are targeted while changes in iw geometry downstream will have a lesser impact all the above findings are particularly relevant in the context where model improvements rely on field data acquisition knowing that geometric parameters are the most sensitive data acquisition campaign should focus on water level monitoring subsurface delineation and extent mapping under various conditions considering that iws located upstream are more sensitive to their geometric characteristics than downstream iws hydrotel could benefit from field data monitoring targeting iws located on headwater rhhus conversely the geometric parameters of the rw module revealed a higher sensitivity for wetlands adjacent to the main channel str3 thus water level monitoring should focus on downstream sites additionally the high relative sensitivity of wetdmax during the spring snowmelt points towards monitoring water levels at that time of the year especially inversely saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements ksatbs should take place under low hydrological conditions e g summer or winter since this parameter shows higher sensitivity metrics during these seasons other parameters such as frac remain highly sensitive throughout the year since they are involved in the computation of wetland area at every time step this confirms the relevance of having access to high resolution wetland maps nowadays the refinement of remotely sensed technologies has enabled the development of earth imaging with increased precisions for example xi et al 2022 released an ensemble of 28 gridded maps of monthly global regional wetland extents for 1980 2020 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 in combination with water level time series these maps could improve the quantification of frac wetdmax and wetdnor in various landscapes the spatial variability of wetland parameter sensitivity emphasizes the need to reproduce this exercise for any new model implementation nevertheless the extraction of general rules based on the dominant typology and location in the watershed to refine wetland parameter calibration deserves to be explored replicating this method under different geological conditions could help refine our understanding of the spatio temporal variability of the wetland parameters sensitivity nonetheless a total of seven sub watersheds located in two different geological provinces of southeastern canada were considered in this study which represents an excellent starting point to draw conclusions on how wetland characteristics parameters affect stream flows alternatively multivariate statistical methods such as principal component analyses could help comprehend as well which characteristics of a wetlandscape are the most influential on stream flow while we are confident about our findings it is noteworthy they are model specific although we report similar results from the few related studies comparable studies are encouraged to evaluate the model related variability of wetland parameters sensitivity moreover uncertainty associated with input data such as land cover including wetland mapping and hydrometric data model structure and calibration method influence simulated stream flows and wetlands outflows although we achieved good calibration performances of the general parameters of hydrotel table 1 our sensitivity analysis focused on a unique representation of each watershed and a single calibration solution that being mentioned we did not account for the uncertainty associated with the input data because this would have required replicating computationally intensive work although we believe this would be relevant as a future step this was beyond the scope of this paper 5 conclusion in this study we investigated the spatio temporal variability of wetland parameter sensitivities using an experimental design for different configurations and locations of wetlandscapes our findings emphasize the importance of the geometric parameters on outflows of wetlands at both the hillslope hew scale and the watershed scale the gsa results confirmed that the spatial configuration of wetlands has an effect at the wetland and watershed scales as previously discussed by blanchette et al 2022 which seems mainly driven by the ratio between isolated and riparian wetland surface areas e g wetlandscapes dominated by iws display higher sensitivity indices for their parameters our results also depict a higher sensitivity for iws located upstream and for rws located downstream finally we recognize a strong temporal variability in relation with the various processes dominating the hydrological budget of wetlands from daily to seasonal time scales these outcomes can assist model diagnosis and quantitatively investigate the rankings of hydrological processes occurring in wetlands for a given period of the year or specific meteorological events although the temporal variability was expected it is to our knowledge the first time a time varying gsa is performed on the wetland modules of a semi distributed hydrological model knowing that seasonal hydrological processes highly affect wetlands accounting for this temporal variability is essential to further understand the complexity of model behavior our findings will help design field studies where wetland parameters are monitored more intensely during their peak sensitivities for example water level monitoring could focus on the spring snowmelt season to provide a better estimation of wetdmax it is rather important to notice that our study also contributed to enhance modeling practices as it demonstrated that the parameter ksatbk should be set for rw for lack of sensitivity all results will prove useful for land management practices and ever growing wetland conservation programs that require the identification of high value wetlands funding this research was

1736,hydrological models offer the opportunity to evaluate wetland conservation networks as nature based solutions to mitigate hydrological extremes to optimize the replication of a hydrological model response i e stream flows the models rely on input data land cover hydrographic network soil types topography meteorological data and parameters however the effect of parametric uncertainty on the simulated variables and the spatio temporal variability of this sensitivity are insufficiently documented this study presents an application of the novel global sensitivity analysis method the variogram analysis of response surface to the isolated and riparian wetland modules of hydrotel a semi distributed process based deterministic model on two watersheds located in the province of quebec canada the analysis accounted for i the spatial variability by assessing the sensitivity at various locations in the watersheds and by compiling sensitivity indices for wetland networks discretized following the strahler order classification which quantifies the structure of hydrographic networks and ii the temporal variability of the sensitivity using the generalized global sensitivity matrix the results indicate that the parameters defining the geometry of wetlands area depth are the most sensitive for both isolated and riparian wetlands and for all strahler orders the temporal assessment of sensitivity highlights the seasonal controlling processes including a peaking sensitivity of the maximum water depth in wetlands during spring snowmelt whereas the sensitivity of the evapotranspiration parameter increases during summer but is null during winter results also indicate that the parameters of the isolated modules are more sensitive for wetlands located on lower stream order upstream headwaters while those of the riparian modules display a greater sensitivity when wetlands are located on higher strahler orders downstream main channel these findings deepen our understanding of the impact of wetland features on stream flows and provide guidelines to plan future data acquisition campaigns in wetlandscapes keywords hydrotel hydroconnectivity time varying sensitivity analysis variogram analysis of response surface field data acquisition strahler order data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the development of hydrological models has advanced our understanding of how landscape features affect watershed hydrology for example the integration of wetland hydrology in watershed scale models has allowed researchers to investigate how river flows react to diverse configurations of wetland coverage location typologies and or hydro connectivity in various climates and geological environments blanchette et al 2022 evenson et al 2018 fossey et al 2016 goyette et al 2022 over the last decade or so wetlands have been the subject of increasing scientific and political attention thanks to their key role in mitigating stream flows nevertheless it is essential to remain critical when drawing conclusions from model outputs indeed exhaustive sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of semi distributed hydrological models used to assess the impact of wetlands on hydrological variables have yet to be carried out comprehensively consequently although models were developed with the most up to date scientific knowledge of wetland hydrology it is still unclear how uncertainties in input data and model parameters may affect simulation results for instance most semi distributed hydrological models rely on empirical power equations describing volume area depth relationships that are governed by wetland geometry rahman et al 2016 among models hydrotel a semi distributed hydrological model fossey et al 2015 assumes that maximum wetland extents can be derived from remotely sensed land cover data this maximum surface area along with parameters of the volume area depth relationships subsequently intervene at every computational time step to assess water storage and fluxes meanwhile remotely sensed data are affected by antecedent meteorological and soil moisture conditions at the time of acquisition and conversely govern the spatial resolution of input data and wetland parameters thus impacting model response all these issues emphasize the need for an in depth quantification of the effect of any parameter induced uncertainties on model outputs by definition sensitivity analysis sa studies how the uncertainty in the output of a model can be apportioned to the different sources of uncertainty in the model input saltelli et al 2004 the scientific community agrees that sa should be the first step of any new model implementation as it provides key insights on its performances to reproduce a given system razavi et al 2021 reported four overarching purposes of sa i explore causalities processes and interactions of the modelled system ii reduce dimensionality iii target data acquisition and iv support decision two main categories of sa coexist first local sa refers to methods where inputs are modified around a nominal value to observe the effect on model response local methods provide a simple and fast option to perform sa but they are limited to assessing the impact of individual parameters independently not accounting for possible interactions in this context local methods are inadequate when it comes to assessing complex models representing earth and environmental systems including hydrological models for these systems global sensitivity analysis gsa methods such as derivative based morris 1991 distribution based sobol 1993 variogram based razavi and gupta 2016b a or regression based iman and helton 1988 are better suited as they provide a global representation of how the different factors work and interact across the full problem space to influence some function of the system output razavi et al 2021 although it comes with high computational costs gsa remains a judicious means of comprehensively assessing the quality of model input approximation and diagnosing any flaw in model structure traditional sensitivity analysis applications rely on performance metrics which aggregate the propagation of uncertainties and may lead to a loss of information regarding sensitivity at finer temporal scales pianosi and wagener 2016 in response to this loss of information time variant gsa tools where sensitivity metrics are computed at every time step have been developed to study how simulated processes dominance varies in time pianosi and wagener 2016 razavi and gupta 2019 among others bajracharya et al 2020 korgaonkar et al 2020 medina and mu√±oz 2020 razavi and gupta 2019 pianosi and wagener 2016 performed a time variant sensitivity analysis using pawn pianosi and wagener 2015 a density based sa method on the hydrologiska byr√•ns vattenbalansavdelning hbv model applied to three watersheds in the usa the english river in iowa the french broad river in north carolina and the guadalupe river in texas their results confirmed that time variant sensitivity analysis can reveal sensitivity information that could be hidden in sa based on aggregated performance metrics among the models that are well suited for representing wetlands at the watershed scale many underwent a form of sa while developing a swat extension module simulating riparian wetlands rw liu et al 2008 conducted a partial and local sa on the wetland geometric parameters normal depth and ratio between normal and maximum surface areas relative to stream flow for an application on the upper canagagigue creek watershed 53 km2 in southern ontario canada their results highlighted the necessity of calibrating geometric parameters especially when field data are available building upon this work rahman et al 2016 modified the rw extension module of swat by replacing the unidirectional interaction between wetlands and river aquifer with a hydraulic based bidirectional connection to assess how these parameters affect the sensitivity of stream flows and wetland storage they analyzed the temporal dynamics of parameter sensitivity reusser et al 2011 based on the fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast cukier et al 1973 they applied this method on two sub basins wetland drainage area 96 located in the barak kushiyara river transboundary watershed 35 563 km2 shared by india and bangladesh their results revealed a high temporal variability in parameter sensitivity to assess the impact of geographically isolated wetlands iws on water table and base flow variation mclaughlin et al 2014 combined shallow water table and soil moisture process based models with a wetland hydrology model their sa showed that wetland elevation and confining layer elevation which are driven by changes in the geometry of the wetland system displayed a significant sensitivity as a first attempt to understand the relative sensitivities of the wetland parameters of hydrotel a semi distributed hydrological model fossey et al 2015 performed a local sa using the b√©cancour river watershed 2 597 km2 12 of wetlands cover including 8 of iws and 4 of rws they used the local one parameter at a time method ben nasr 2014 bouda et al 2014 mailhot and villeneuve 2003 to evaluate how parameter variations affected stream flows at three different locations within the watershed following an upstream downstream gradient their results suggested that the parameters of the iw module are the most influential ones when compared to those of the rw module with some variability between the river reaches of interest although quite informative some questions have remained especially regarding interactions between parameters and large parameter space more importantly their investigation raises questions regarding the spatio temporal variability of sensitivity including i are stream flows equally sensitive to various wetland spatial configurations at the watershed scale ii how does sensitivity temporally vary one way to provide answers to these questions is to perform a spatio temporal gsa this would not only provide a more comprehensive understanding of the influence of the wetland parameters of hydrotel but also help us to interpret the modelling results in this instance to put in perspective the role of wetlands at the watershed scale this would be particularly relevant given the fact that the model has been used to assess the role of wetlands i during floods in the large canada usa lake champlain richelieu river watershed rousseau et al 2022 ii as flood resilience landscapes in china wu et al 2020 iii in regulating streamflows wu et al 2020 and iv the effect of river damming on their hydrological functions wu et al 2021 the model has also been used to investigate whether wetlands can mitigate the impact of climate change in both canada fossey and rousseau 2016a b and china wu et al 2022 in this paper we present the results of a gsa on the iw and rw modules of hydrotel using a novel variogram based method razavi and gupta 2016b a we combine this algorithm with the generalized global sensitivity matrix ggsm to account for the sensitivity temporal variability we also specifically address the spatial variability by i carrying out the sa on two distinct watersheds located in southeastern canada the st charles river and the b√©cancour river watersheds and ii assessing the sensitivity at various locations in the latter watersheds moreover for both watersheds we test how different spatial configurations of wetlands at the watershed scale can affect parameter sensitivity 2 material and methods 2 1 study area two watersheds with distinct characteristics of wetland cover land use and soils were selected to perform the sa the st charles river watershed 554 km2 and the b√©cancour river watershed 2 597 km2 both located in quebec canada fig 1 the st charles river watershed comprises five tributaries with a stream network ranging from 1 to 5 strahler orders des hurons 137 km2 jaune 82 km2 nelson 74 km2 lorette 72 km2 and du berger 57 km2 the watershed is located on the north shore of the st lawrence river many lakes are found in the watershed the most important being lake st charles which is used as a drinking water reservoir for 300 000 citizens of the region to ensure long term protection of the water quality and quantity quebec city recently acquired a bio hydrologically relevant wetland complex to help mitigate the impact of accelerated anthropogenic development in some parts of the watershed in this specific watershed there is indeed good synergy between wetland scientists and municipal authorities to improve our understanding of wetland services and used them in urban planning wetlands and their contributing areas ca cover 6 and 22 of the watershed respectively the nelson sub watershed fig 2 d 9 has the highest wetland cover followed by the lorette sub watershed fig 2 g 7 while those two sub watersheds are dominated by iws rws dominate the other sub watersheds the majority of iws are found in headwater hillslopes the watershed is mostly urbanized in the downstream part southern portion while the northern portion is mainly covered with forests belonging to the balsam fir yellow birch and balsam fir white birch bioclimatic region agence des for√™ts priv√©es du qu√©bec 03 2001 the watershed is characterized by subpolar temperatures humid precipitation and mean growing season in the north and by moderate temperatures sub humid precipitation and long growing season in the southern part fig 3 a top and middle gerardin and mckenney 2001 litynski 1988 the k√∂ppen geiger climate classification places the watershed in the warm summer humid continental climate dfb however this classification could evolve to a hot summer humid continental climate dfa over the 2071 2100 horizon beck et al 2018 based on 47 climate change projections mean daily temperatures are expected to increase between current 1980 2019 and future 2060 2099 climate and the snow rain precipitation ratio will also decrease during winter and early spring for the st charles watershed specifically goyette et al 2022 covered with sandy loam clay loam and loamy sand soil textures most of the watershed unfolds on the grenville geological province but some parts of the downstream region are located within the st lawrence platform and the appalachians geological province the conjunction of these three geological provinces and their fault line explains a rather complex topography it is characterized by rounded and crystalline hills on the grenville province with slopes up to 60 smaller monticules and terraces in the central part with slopes lower than 10 and the part located on the appalachian province consists of a hill with slopes from 11 to 15 brodeur et al 2009 the b√©cancour river starts at the outlet of lake b√©cancour which is in the city of thetford mines and ends on the southern shore of the st lawrence river close to the city of b√©cancour the watershed has a rather high wetland cover 12 draining 31 of its territory fig 2 forested peatlands 4 9 and swamps 4 0 dominate canards illimit√©s canada and minist√®re de l environnement et lutte contre les changements climatiques 2020 but this watershed also has an important cover of open ombrotrophic peatlands 1 1 the hydrographic network includes 62 lakes 1 ha and drains a territory that is mostly covered by forests 54 eastern sugar maple basswood and sugar maple yellow birch bioclimatic domains agence foresti√®re des bois francs 2015 and agriculture 23 the watershed has moderate temperatures sub humid precipitations and a long growing season fig 3 b top and middle gerardin and mckenney 2001 litynski 1988 under current climate conditions mean precipitation is 1 297 mm in the upper part and 1 085 mm at the outlet while mean temperatures are 4 c and 4 7 c at thetford mines 1971 2000 and b√©cancour respectively morin and boulanger 2005 beck et al 2018 predicted that the k√∂ppen geiger climate classification will evolve from warm summer humid continental to hot summer humid continental in the future rugged landforms strong slopes and altitude ranging between 100 and 600 m characterize the upper southern half of the watershed located within the appalachians mountains while the lower northern half extends on the st lawrence platform where the topography is lightly undulated with gentler slopes and altitudes below 100 m the surface deposits are characterized as till with a loamy soil texture in the upper part while loamy sands cover the lower part since the majority of wetlands on the watershed are located in this region and to increase computational efficiency the sa was performed upstream of hydrometric station 024014 considering their specific discharge discharge divided by the total surface area of the watershed the st charles and b√©cancour river watersheds have similar hydrographs fig 3 a and b bottom however the st charles river watershed which has a smaller area a steeper topography and slightly higher mean precipitations shows more reactivity than the b√©cancour watershed including a higher spring snowmelt stream flow 2 2 physitel hydrotel modelling platform input data processing steps and wetland integration we performed a sa on the iw and rw modules of the physitel hydrotel modelling platform which is used by multiple institutions hydro qu√©bec yukon energy and universities √©cole de technologies sup√©rieures universit√© de sherbrooke universit√© laval universidad veracruzana in mexico northeast institute of geography and agroecology in china to mention a few these different applications of the model have confirmed its ability to reproduce accurately stream flows in a variety of hydroclimatic and geological contexts in quebec specifically hydrotel is used by the water expertise division of the ministry of environment fight against climate change fauna and park to simulate the flows of the provincial hydroclimatic atlas https cehq gouv qc ca atlas hydroclimatique using hydrotel in this study was also motivated by the availability of local expertise to analyze and interpret the results this platform includes a specialized geographic information system gis physitel no√´l et al 2014 rousseau et al 2011 turcotte et al 2001 which is used to build and format a physiographic database to support the implementation of distributed hydrological models hydrotel bouda et al 2014 bouda et al 2012 fortin et al 2001 turcotte et al 2007 turcotte et al 2003 is a semi distributed process based deterministic model built around nine computational modules simulating different components of the hydrological cycle among them meteorological data interpolation snow accumulation and melt soil temperature and freezing potential evapotranspiration and vertical water budget are applied at the relatively hydrologically homogeneous units rhhus i e hillslopes scale the computational unit of hydrotel runoff routing relies on a geomorphological unit hydrograph generated with a reference depth of water which performs a temporal distribution of the vertical water budget output finally water routing in the hydrographic network is computed at the river reach scale using as inputs water from the upstream river reach and runoff from the adjacent hillslopes the model accounts for the contribution of wetlands to watershed hydrology via two wetland modules representing iws and rws integrated at the hillslope scale by fossey et al 2015 the iw module is represented as a control volume of the vertical water budget with its outlet connected to the runoff routing module the rw module is partially integrated to the vertical water budget and has a connection to the river flow routing module for the st charles river watershed a 20 m digital elevation model dem and a vectorial river network 1 50 000 both extracted from geogratis natural resources canada 2013 https maps canada ca czs index en html were used a 20 m resolution land cover map was built by combining various datasets blanchette et al 2022 and the soil textures were extracted from the soil landscapes of canada soil landscapes of canada working group 2010 for the b√©cancour river watershed we used a previous implementation of the watershed fossey et al 2016 which included i a 30 m dem from the quebec topographic database ii a vectorial river network provided by the quebec hydrological expertise center centre d expertise hydrique du qu√©bec cehq iii a 30 m resolution land cover map of 2012 provided by university of sherbrooke and iv soil datasets from the research and development institute for the agri environment daily meteorological data including precipitation minimum and maximum temperature covering the 1963 2020 period were extracted from environment and climate change canada s database using the package weathercan in r v 4 0 4 a radius of 75 km st charles and 100 km b√©cancour from the center of each watershed was used to select the meteorological stations a total of 28 stations were considered for the st charles watershed while 63 stations were included for the b√©cancour watershed for the st charles precipitation data from 31 rain gauges operated by quebec city were also included in the meteorological dataset to prepare the physiographic database physitel i calculates the slope and flow direction for each cell ii processes the flow accumulation matrix iii discretizes the watershed into hillslopes iv for each hillslope determines the percentage of each land cover and the dominant soil texture accounting for wetlands in hydrotel also requires physitel to i identify wetlands from the land cover map ii calculate the maximum area of wetlands from the number of pixels associated to the wetland class iii delineate the ca of each wetland using the accumulation matrix iv differentiate iws and rws based on a river network adjacency threshold and for each hillslope v merge wetlands into one isolated and or one riparian hydrologically equivalent wetland hew wang et al 2008 during the latter step physitel provides the total area of all the wetlands belonging to a specific typology iw or rw to calculate the wetland maximum surface area sawet max and also the total ca of each hew to assess the fraction of the hillslope that is contributing to the hew frwet in addition physitel spatially connects the riparian hews at specific locations on the river reaches for the

asynchronous parallel multi objective optimization algorithm pareto archived dynamically dimensioned search parapadds asadzadeh and tolson 2009 tolson et al 2014 provided with the optimization software toolkit for research involving computational heuristics ostrich v17 12 19 https www civil uwaterloo ca envmodelling ostrich html matott 2017 to minimize initialization errors and account for the water balance warm up the first year was removed prior to the calculation of the objective functions in addition winter stream flows november to march ice on period were excluded from the calibration since the uncertainty related to measurements during this period is high daily observed stream flows provided by the cehq fig 1 were compared with daily simulated stream flows using the kge gupta et al 2009 and nse log oudin et al 2006 as objective functions calculated with the r package hydrogof r core team 2020 zambrano bigiarini 2020 and the python package hydroeval hallouin 2021 for the st charles watershed a sub watershed calibration strategy was implemented meaning that each sub watershed except the st charles sub watershed was calibrated independently the values of the parameters of the nelson des hurons and jaune river being set the final calibration involved the area between the outlets of the subwatersheds and that of the st charles sub watershed using the daily observed stream flows of station 090504 fig 1 for this specific station a water intake was considered in the calibration process and an ecological stream flow 0 33 m3 s needed to be met for the whole period of calibration the b√©cancour watershed was calibrated between january 1st 2004 and december 31st 2015 using daily observed stream flows at station 024014 fig 1 minist√®re de l environnement et la lutte contre les changements climatiques 2021 for this watershed data on water withdrawals which come from underground sources or ecological stream flow were unavailable so they were not accounted for by hydrotel the calibration exercise was deemed satisfactory and characterized by good performance metrics for the different river reaches under study table 1 2 4 sensitivity analysis 2 4 1 vars toolbox theoretical background parameter sensitivity was assessed using the variogram analysis of response surface vars toolbox razavi et al 2019 which is compatible with any model through a connection with ostrich matott 2017 inspired by the variogram techniques that are of common usage in geostatistical analyses vars is a recently developed gsa method where the response surface of the model is considered as a spatially distributed dependent variable it recognizes that there is a spatial and continuous covariance structure in the model response a variogram Œ≥ equation 9 describes this spatial covariance structure for a given stochastic process 9 Œ≥ h 1 2 n h i j n h y x a y x b 2 where h is the variogram scale distance between computational points n h is the number of pairs of points that are h distant y x a and y x b are the model responses in the parametric space at location x a and x b respectively in the context of a gsa the vars method consists of generating a variogram for each parameter thus higher Œ≥ h i values indicate a higher sensitivity in the direction of parameter i razavi and gupta 2016a the sensitivity index associated with the vars method is the integrated variogram ivar equation 10 10 Œ≥ h i 0 h i Œ≥ h i d h i for a scale interval from 0 to h i and for parameter i as suggested by the authors values associated with a 50 interval ivar50 were used in this study the relative sensitivity ivar50n presented throughout the paper is calculated as follows 11 i v a r 50 n i v a r 50 i i n i v a r 50 i 2 4 2 sensitivity analyses of the wetland modules the sa focused on the parameters of the wetland modules as a first step the star based sampling strategy included in the vars toolbox was used to generate the parameter sets according to the lower and upper bounds reported in table 2 this framework generates parameter sets covering all the parametric space and facilitates the computation of sensitivity metrics razavi and gupta 2016b the strategy consists of i randomly generating m points star centers across the factor space and ii aligning equally spaced points along each dimension i e parameters n in the factor space based on a user defined sampling resolution Œ¥h following these steps the final number of parameter sets r is 12 r m n 1 Œ¥ h 1 1 in this study we used 50 stars a sampling resolution of 0 1 and the latin hypercube sampling to generate the parameter sets second for each parameter set we ran the model using the model evaluation program integrated in the parallelized version of ostrich using supercomputers beluga and narval managed by calcul qu√©bec and the digital research alliance of canada the model was run from january 1st 1999 to december 31st 2020 and a 365 day spin up period was removed from the beginning of the resulting time series to minimize initialization errors third to account for sensitivity temporal variability we calculated daily mean sensitivity indices over the 2000 2020 period i e ivar50 using vars and the generalized global sensitivity matrix ggsm in matlab r2018b to assess wetland parameter sensitivity at the hillslope scale as well as the watershed scale we then performed two categories of sas fig 4 first to assess how a variation in the value of parameters affects the outflow of the wetland modules v fout and v ex that is the hillslope hew scale a sa was conducted for specific hews located in the jaune river sub watershed based on the definition of wetland networks suggested by blanchette et al 2022 which is described in terms of specific wetland area and ca criteria four isolated hews and four riparian hews were selected fig 5 for each typology i e isolated and riparian the four wetlands belonged to one of the following networks small wetland with small ca into the small wetlands group pi small wetland with large ca into the small wetlands group pii large wetland with small ca into the large wetlands group piii and large wetland with large ca into the large wetlands group piv the selected wetlands were hydrologically independent from each other then hydrotel was run using 2750 and 2300 parameter sets and ivar50 was computed on v fout and v ex for iws and rws respectively second sas were performed at both the watershed scale and the sub watershed scale using 5000 parameter sets the parameters of both wetland modules were varied simultaneously for this analysis for the st charles river watershed ivar50 was calculated using the simulated outlet flows of the watershed and each sub watershed moreover in line with the calibration strategy for the simulated stream flows at the outlet of the watershed a water withdrawal data provided by quebec city was removed from simulated data and a minimum ecological flow of 0 33 m3 s was enforced for the b√©cancour river watershed ivar50n was calculated on simulated stream flows at station 024014 to account for the impact of wetland location on the variability of wetland parameter sensitivities we divided the wetlands of each study watershed by strahler order the strahler order classification strahler 1957 is used to quantify the structure of a hydrographic network and the relative location of each river reach it can be used as an indicator of stream size hughes et al 2011 the reaches head are assigned a value of 1 which goes up at each branch we identified the strahler order of each river reach and assigned it to the corresponding hillslopes using arcmap v10 6 1 https www esri com environmental systems research institute esri 2018 we used the list of hillslopes to assign a strahler order to each isolated hew and each riparian hew we then created hydrotel projects containing only the wetlands corresponding to specific strahler orders by modifying the files describing wetlands comma separated files listing wetland parameters and hew spatial characteristics for each hillslope or river reach for iws and rws respectively for example in the case of wetlands associated with 1st order river reaches only them were included in the simulation that is wetlands of strahler order 2 or higher were not simulated in the model this resulted in five sa projects for the b√©cancour river watershed all wetlands strahler order 1 to 4 and six projects for the st charles river watershed all wetlands strahler order 1 to 5 all those projects were evaluated with the same list of 5000 parameter sets using the supercomputers 3 results 3 1 parameter sensitivity at the hillslope hew scale the parameter sensitivity at the hillslope hew scale varies for iws and rws for both wetland modules fig 6 the geometry parameters defined by frac iw frac rw wetdnor iw wetdnor rw wetdmax iw and wetdmax rw largely explains the parametric sensitivity of wetland outflow for iws and rws they explain 59 67 and 83 97 of the sensitivity respectively indeed the geometry of wetlands directly affects the volume of water they can store and modulates hillslope hydrology local scale and watershed hydrology jones et al 2018 mclaughlin et al 2014 for iws cev iw and cprod iw explain 6 25 of the sensitivity which indicates the low sensitivity of the geometric parameters for this specific typology soil parameters ksatbs iw ksatbs rw and ksatbk iw account for 15 28 of the sensitivity for iws and 2 17 for rws the contribution of each parameter to the global sensitivity at the outlet of the hews is variable across the wetland spatial configurations and even intra typologies i e iw or rw for iws wetdmax iw has a much higher sensitivity for wetlands with larger cas ivar50n 0 57 and 0 53 for pii and piv respectively suggesting that the outflow from iws hydrologically fed by a large area is closely related to their maximum water depth moreover iws with larger cas are more sensitive to cprod iw contribution of hew to terrestrial flow conversely for iws with smaller cas the outflow is more sensitive to frac iw ivar50n 0 32 and 0 29 for pi and piii respectively and wetdnor iw ivar50n 0 23 and 0 21 for pi and piii respectively two parameters related to normal flow conditions iws with smaller cas highly rely on precipitation input to store water as they cannot rely on runoff from their cas consequently their surface area strongly affects their capacity to store water and the volume of outflows for rws wetdnor rw is more sensitive for small wetlands with small cas pi and large wetlands with large cas piv while wetlands with average spatial characteristics pii and piii are more sensitive to wetdmax rw additionally only large wetlands with large cas are sensitive to ksatbk rw these results highlight the impact of the spatial configuration area ca of a wetland on its hydrological behavior at the hillslope scale 3 2 parameter sensitivity at the watershed scale at the outlet of the st charles watershed 6 wetland cover considering all typologies of wetlands and all strahler orders the most sensitive parameters are frac rw wetdnor rw and ksatbs rw which all belong to the rw module table 3 these dominant parameters are in line with the surface area of rws 3 2 which is 1 4 times more abundant than that of iws 2 5 at watershed scale cas are 13 for both the least sensitive parameters are frac iw cev iw and wetdnor iw on the other hand the proportion of land cover by isolated and riparian hews also clearly drives the b√©cancour sensitivity rankings at the hydrometric station of the b√©cancour river the most sensitive parameters all belong to the iw module wetdnor iw ksatbs iw and cprod iw while the five least sensitive parameters are those of the rw module this reflects a clear correlation with the dominant typology of wetlands at watershed scale where iws 7 5 draining 28 of the watershed are 3 75 times more abundant than rws 2 draining 7 of the watershed for both watersheds ksatbk rw is the least sensitive parameter the contribution of this parameter is limited to a specific case of the iterative scheme fossey et al 2015 it weakens its sensitivity compared to the other parameters 3 3 spatial variability of parameter sensitivity at watershed and sub watershed scales at the outlet of the st charles river fig 7 a when considering the wetlands associated with river reaches of strahler order i wetdmax iw and cprod iw present the highest sensitivities with ivar50n values reaching 0 23 and 0 17 respectively these two parameters become impactful during high precipitation events and or snowmelt season additionally the high sensitivities of those parameters for iws related to headwater streams suggests their wetlands might have a strong impact on mitigating downstream peak flows for wetlands of strahler orders ii iii and v the rw parameters display a substantially high sensitivity with frac rw being the most sensitive parameter with ivar50n values of 0 25 0 28 and 0 25 respectively as mentioned previously frac is a very important parameter for both wetland modules as it connects s a wet m a x to s a wet n o r two variables that interact in the calculation of s a wet at every time step and ultimately to the volume of stored water for strahler order ii wetdnor rw is also among the most sensitive parameters followed by wetdmax rw which highlights the importance of the geometric parameters once more considering strahler order iii wetlands the most sensitive parameters are frac rw 0 28 ksatbs rw 0 21 and wetdnor rw 0 20 first these results reveal that while increasing stream order rw parameters become more sensitive compared to the iw parameters second they also depict that for rws located on stream order iii river flows are less influenced by changes in their maximum capacity to store water defined by wetdmax rw but seem rather driven by parameters associated with average wetdnor rw or low ksatbs rw flow conditions compared to rw located on strahler order ii for strahler order iv the most sensitive parameters are shared between the two wetland typologies ksatbs iw 0 15 wetdmax rw 0 14 and frac iw 0 13 and wetdnor iw 0 13 are ranked in the top three the dominant typology for each strahler order seems to drive the spectrum of sensitivity among parameters of the two modules indeed rws are dominant for strahler orders ii iii and v see total wetland area fig 2 while the ratio of iw to rw areas for strahler order i and iv is close to 1 1 however the ratio of ca is highly dominated by iws which could explain the high sensitivity of iw parameters for these strahler orders for the b√©cancour river watershed fig 7 b parameters related to the iw module are more sensitive among all strahler orders than those of the rw module this is expected considering the higher land cover of iws on this watershed which is always at least twice that of rws for the strahler orders ii and iii with nearly a 2 1 ratio ivar50n indices for rws are slightly higher than those for strahler orders i and iv conversely for strahler iv wetlands there is only 0 03 of rws for 1 85 of iws that is reflected in the values of ivar50n reaching the maximum value 0 29 among all hydrotel projects at watershed scale for wetdnor iw and ksatbs iw finally considering all strahler order projects and for both watersheds the time aggregated value of ksatbk rw relative sensitivity is consistently lower than 0 01 the effect of wetland typology on sensitivity rankings is even more convincing at the sub watershed scale for sub watersheds where there is a clear dominant typology the parameters related to this type of wetlands consistently have higher sensitivities when compared to those of the non dominant typology when ordering the results for each sub watershed strahler order project in ascending order of the ratios between iw and rw areas fig 8 this behavioral relationship becomes even more obvious this representation also highlights a threshold corresponding to a 1 1 ratio above which iws become dominant as do their parameters the results also suggest that although ksatbs rw was not highly sensitive at wetland scale section 3 1 its relative sensitivity metric increases considerably when investigating its impact at the watershed and sub watershed scales these results highlight the impact of location wetland vs watershed scale upstream vs downstream gradient and especially typology on parameter sensitivity 3 4 temporal variability of parameter sensitivity at watershed scale at watershed and sub watershed scales the sensitivity of stream flows to wetland parameters reveals a strong temporal variability which follows the seasonality of the different hydrological processes occurring in hews for the st charles watershed fig 9 while frac iw frac rw ksatbs iw ksatbs rw wetdnor iw and wetdnor rw exhibit high frequency variations daily they also present a substantial decrease in mean sensitivity calculated over the 2000 2020 period during the spring snowmelt season day of year doy 120 where wetdmax iw and wetdmax rw peak although wetdmax iw and wetdmax rw are not in the top three parameters when considering the watershed scale time aggregated sensitivity index wetdmax is ranked 4th and 5th for iw and rw respectively table 3 the daily mean ivar50n shows the strong influence of this parameter during spring in temperate regions during spring snowmelt is the dominant hydrological process during this time of the year wetland storage is generally at capacity and any exceeding inflow leads to wetland overflow that will reach the river network and affect stream flows therefore the maximum water table depth is highly sensitive under these conditions because it directly affects the capacity of the hew to store water this not only confirms the relevance of investigating temporal sensitivity gupta and razavi 2018 razavi and gupta 2019 but it also implies that at the peak of the spring snowmelt the variability in stream flows at the outlet of this watershed highly depends on the capacity of wetlands to store water consequently increasing or reducing this capacity hereby characterized by its maximum depth will influence output flows the peak sensitivity for wetdmax iw is delayed doy 150 compared with the peak sensitivity for wetdmax rw which occurs around doy 125 this suggests that iws may retain water longer than rws the latter being directly connected to the hydrographic network therefore when the water level in a rw reaches a certain threshold water transfers to the river the proximity and connection between rws and the river imply a high reactivity during the spring snowmelt season however this delayed peak in sensitivity does not appear for the b√©cancour river fig 10 for this watershed most of the sensitivity relies on the parameters of the iws which account for 79 of wetland area at watershed scale accordingly wetdmax iw sensitivity peak is much higher than that of wetdmax rw considering hydrogeological parameters ksatbs iw ksatbs rw and ksatbk rw results show that ivar50n remains stable for ksatbs iw and ksatbs rw for the st charles watershed during most of the year except during the spring snowmelt where as mentioned previously wetdmax rw becomes the dominant parameter for the b√©cancour watershed ivar50n ranges from 0 00 to 0 50 for ksatbs iw with slightly higher values during winter and values lower than 0 10 for ksatbs rw for both watersheds ksatbk rw is null throughout the year which confirms that this parameter could be set in the rws module finally looking more precisely at parameters related to the hydrological budget the relative sensitivity of cprod iw increases during spring and fall the relative sensitivity ranges between 0 and 0 30 for cev iw in both watersheds with almost null sensitivity beyond summer in canada 65 of the annual evapotranspiration occurs over three months that is june july and august and in the boreal shield ecozone evapotranspiration peaks in july wang et al 2013 thus during summer substantial loss of water through evapotranspiration affects stream flows while cev iw represents the percentage of evapotranspiration at the rhhu scale varying the value of this parameter directly affects the volume of water lost to the atmosphere at the hew scale v ev which in return has an impact on stream flows at the watershed scale comparing the relative sensitivities between the st charles and the b√©cancour watersheds it becomes evident that the stream flows at the outlet of the st charles river has a higher sensitivity to parameters characterizing high hydrological conditions wetdmax iw and wetdmax rw while stream flows on the b√©cancour seem more sensitive to parameters related to normal frac iw frac rw wetdnor iw and wetdnor rw and low ksatbs iw hydrological conditions aside from their different surface area ratios of iws versus rws this outcome might be explained by an insufficient wetland cover in the st charles river watershed to maintain so called normal wetland hydrological conditions wetlands of this watershed may therefore fill and overflow faster than those of the b√©cancour river consequently wetlands of the st charles watershed are more sensitive to wetdmax repeating a similar methodology on watersheds characterized by a variety of wetland covers could help refine these assumptions observing the sensitivity temporal variability for wetdmax iw specifically along a strahler order str gradient we can see that ivar50n peak occurs during spring decreases from str1 to str4 and disappears completely with str5 fig 11 a wetdmax rw shows the opposite behavior fig 11 b peak sensitivity increases from str1 to str3 and stabilizes for str4 and str5 these results corroborate those of fossey et al fossey et al 2016 regarding wetlands of the b√©cancour river watershed where upstream iws had a greater effect on modulating stream flows while downstream rws connected to the main stream were more efficient 4 discussion understanding how parameters interact in a model and affect outputs is essential to support the interpretation of simulation results not only can it help refine model parameterization but it also provides key insights on the modelled system in this paper we presented the results of a gsa performed on the wetland modules of the hydrological modelling platform physitel hydrotel using two case study watersheds along with the recently developed vars toolbox we implemented a spatio temporal gsa to quantitatively assess how wetland parameters affect simulation outputs and to guide future data acquisition field campaign to improve the representation of wetland related processes in the model our study demonstrated the dominant impact of geometric parameters at both the wetland scale i e hillslope hew scale and the watershed scale these parameters which include frac wetdmax and wetdnor participate in the calculation of the wetland water storage and wetland surface area at every computational time step such findings corroborate those of mclaughlin et al 2014 among others fossey et al 2015 liu et al 2008 who highlighted the importance of wetland geometry on stream flows however our results suggest that the relative sensitivity among these parameters varies with wetland configurations i e wetland extent and ca when investigating parameter sensitivity at the wetland scale in terms of wetland management this raises important questions as wetlands with different spatial configurations could respond differently to similar changes in their areas frac or depth wetdnor and wetdmax although we previously performed a quantitative assessment of how wetland area and ca affect stream flows blanchette et al 2022 performing an exhaustive gsa on scenarios of various wetland spatial configurations could prove to be useful to transfer our conclusions at watershed scale the methodological framework presented in this study also demonstrated that the ratio of surface area of iw to rw strongly affects the ranking of sensitivity among wetland parameters at the watershed scale accordingly in watersheds dominated by iws the sensitivity of stream flows will be mostly attributed to iw parameters while watersheds where the extent of rws exceed iw area they will exhibit higher sensitivity for rw parameters this finding nuances results found in the literature giving more impact to upstream iw compared to rw for mitigating high flows fossey et al 2016 and underlines the importance of wetland hydroconnectivity our results also indicate that wetland hydroconnectivity appears to impact stream flow sensitivity differently along a continuum of strahler orders especially when considering geometric parameters e g wetdmax indeed iws display higher sensitivities upstream low strahler order than downstream high strahler order while rws display the opposite behavior notwithstanding these findings were expected notably considering recent studies performed using hydrotel fossey et al 2015 fossey et al 2016 they are highly relevant in the context where setting wetland conservation and restoration targets at watershed scale remains a challenge for instance protecting iws located upstream constitutes an efficient mean of attenuating high flows and supporting low flows keeping in mind that changing geometrical characteristics of wetlands influences wetland outflows and river flows any wetland management strategy affecting the geometry of a wetland depth area subsurface geometry will impact stream flows more strongly if upstream iws are targeted while changes in iw geometry downstream will have a lesser impact all the above findings are particularly relevant in the context where model improvements rely on field data acquisition knowing that geometric parameters are the most sensitive data acquisition campaign should focus on water level monitoring subsurface delineation and extent mapping under various conditions considering that iws located upstream are more sensitive to their geometric characteristics than downstream iws hydrotel could benefit from field data monitoring targeting iws located on headwater rhhus conversely the geometric parameters of the rw module revealed a higher sensitivity for wetlands adjacent to the main channel str3 thus water level monitoring should focus on downstream sites additionally the high relative sensitivity of wetdmax during the spring snowmelt points towards monitoring water levels at that time of the year especially inversely saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements ksatbs should take place under low hydrological conditions e g summer or winter since this parameter shows higher sensitivity metrics during these seasons other parameters such as frac remain highly sensitive throughout the year since they are involved in the computation of wetland area at every time step this confirms the relevance of having access to high resolution wetland maps nowadays the refinement of remotely sensed technologies has enabled the development of earth imaging with increased precisions for example xi et al 2022 released an ensemble of 28 gridded maps of monthly global regional wetland extents for 1980 2020 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 in combination with water level time series these maps could improve the quantification of frac wetdmax and wetdnor in various landscapes the spatial variability of wetland parameter sensitivity emphasizes the need to reproduce this exercise for any new model implementation nevertheless the extraction of general rules based on the dominant typology and location in the watershed to refine wetland parameter calibration deserves to be explored replicating this method under different geological conditions could help refine our understanding of the spatio temporal variability of the wetland parameters sensitivity nonetheless a total of seven sub watersheds located in two different geological provinces of southeastern canada were considered in this study which represents an excellent starting point to draw conclusions on how wetland characteristics parameters affect stream flows alternatively multivariate statistical methods such as principal component analyses could help comprehend as well which characteristics of a wetlandscape are the most influential on stream flow while we are confident about our findings it is noteworthy they are model specific although we report similar results from the few related studies comparable studies are encouraged to evaluate the model related variability of wetland parameters sensitivity moreover uncertainty associated with input data such as land cover including wetland mapping and hydrometric data model structure and calibration method influence simulated stream flows and wetlands outflows although we achieved good calibration performances of the general parameters of hydrotel table 1 our sensitivity analysis focused on a unique representation of each watershed and a single calibration solution that being mentioned we did not account for the uncertainty associated with the input data because this would have required replicating computationally intensive work although we believe this would be relevant as a future step this was beyond the scope of this paper 5 conclusion in this study we investigated the spatio temporal variability of wetland parameter sensitivities using an experimental design for different configurations and locations of wetlandscapes our findings emphasize the importance of the geometric parameters on outflows of wetlands at both the hillslope hew scale and the watershed scale the gsa results confirmed that the spatial configuration of wetlands has an effect at the wetland and watershed scales as previously discussed by blanchette et al 2022 which seems mainly driven by the ratio between isolated and riparian wetland surface areas e g wetlandscapes dominated by iws display higher sensitivity indices for their parameters our results also depict a higher sensitivity for iws located upstream and for rws located downstream finally we recognize a strong temporal variability in relation with the various processes dominating the hydrological budget of wetlands from daily to seasonal time scales these outcomes can assist model diagnosis and quantitatively investigate the rankings of hydrological processes occurring in wetlands for a given period of the year or specific meteorological events although the temporal variability was expected it is to our knowledge the first time a time varying gsa is performed on the wetland modules of a semi distributed hydrological model knowing that seasonal hydrological processes highly affect wetlands accounting for this temporal variability is essential to further understand the complexity of model behavior our findings will help design field studies where wetland parameters are monitored more intensely during their peak sensitivities for example water level monitoring could focus on the spring snowmelt season to provide a better estimation of wetdmax it is rather important to notice that our study also contributed to enhance modeling practices as it demonstrated that the parameter ksatbk should be set for rw for lack of sensitivity all results will prove useful for land management practices and ever growing wetland conservation programs that require the identification of high value wetlands funding this research was

1737,the joint optimal dispatching of cascade hydropower stations aims to maximize economic benefits while satisfying various constraints however numerous studies have failed to acknowledge the significance of the intrinsic optimization principle and lack discussion on this issue this study started with a mathematical principle analysis of the optimization problem and studied the optimality principle puzzle of the joint optimal dispatching of cascade hydropower stations first a two stage optimization problem was constructed to describe the relationship between the variation in discharge and the incremental function of the total energy generation of the reservoir subsequently the first and second derivatives of the cascade total generating capacity increment to cascade reservoir discharge variation were derived and the existence condition of monotonically decreasing the first derivative was proposed moreover the monotonicity principle was proven through numerical simulations by comparing the optimization results of poa and the monotonicity principle coupled ipoa in the cascade hydropower stations operation of the jinsha river it was found that in terms of power generation and computational efficiency ipoa is superior to poa finally using this optimization principle the optimal operation mode of the two typical cascade reservoirs was analyzed in the case studies the example results show that the proposed optimal principle can theoretically analyze and clarify the optimal operation mode of cascade reservoirs and the operation modes of the two typical cascade reservoirs can provide guidance and reference for the operation modes of cascade reservoirs in real life keywords cascade reservoir joint optimization two stage optimal problem monotonicity principle existing condition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the joint optimal dispatching of cascade reservoirs presents a multifaceted challenge that is characterized by a non convex non linear objective function and strong inter stage constraint correlation no mathematical method can directly obtain the analytical solution of the problem or prove the existence of optimal solutions kuriqi et al 2020 currently the optimal operation for cascade reservoir groups is primarily tackled through numerical methods which encompass the following approaches mathematical programming builds a linear and quadratic objective function of the joint optimal operation problem of cascade reservoirs using linear programming lp windsor 2012 quadratic programming pan et al 2022 wilson 1963 and other mathematical programming methods to solve the optimization problem although the mathematical programming method can obtain the analytical solution of the problem on the premise that the objective function is generalized into linear and quadratic the analytical solution cannot represent the real optimal operation process of the cascade reservoir group owing to the generalization of the objective function the dynamic programming method zhang et al 2013 decomposes the complex constrained optimization problem into multi stage sub problems has no requirements for the mathematical characteristics of the objectives and constraints and ensures global convergence within a certain discrete accuracy ma et al 2021 yakowitz 1982 young 1967 therefore dynamic programming is widely used in the solution of complex constrained optimization problems such as the optimal dispatching of hydropower stations however the dynamic programming method has the problem of dimensional disaster with large computational and time requirements to solve the joint dispatch problem of cascade reservoirs jiang et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 many improved algorithms of dynamic programming have been proposed to solve the dimensional disaster problem for example incremental dynamic programming idp jukna 2014 differential dynamic programming ddp li et al 2014 discrete differential dynamic programming dddp bellman 1957 cheng et al 2014 dynamic programming successive approximation dpsa he et al 2021 and progressive optimal algorithm poa ji et al 2021 zong et al 2003 the algorithms described above offer promising solutions to the issue of dimensionality nevertheless they are also faced with the challenge of local convergence in the feasible region of the joint optimal dispatching problem of reservoir groups the optimal solution of the problem is gradually approached through iterative search using an intelligent search algorithm in recent years numerous intelligent search algorithms have been applied to solve the joint optimal dispatching problem of cascade reservoir groups representative algorithms include the genetic algorithm ga khafagy et al 2022 nguyen et al 2022 differential evolution algorithm de ahmadianfar et al 2021 storn and price 1995 particle swarm optimization pso afshar 2012 and the ant colony algorithm aco okwu and tartibu 2021 intelligent algorithms have proven effective in overcoming the problem of dimensional disaster and conducting a continuous domain search for the joint optimal dispatching of cascade hydropower stations however they still face limitations such as slow search speed and premature convergence when utilizing such algorithms for specific problems it is crucial to design adaptive parameter control and local search strategies to enhance convergence speed and accuracy of the algorithm furthermore various improved dynamic programming algorithms have been proposed to sufficiently address the issue of dimensionality while also enhancing their applicability and accuracy kuriqi and jurasz 2022 among the many improved algorithms for dynamic programming howson and sancho 1975 proposed a poa that decomposes a multi stage problem into multiple two stage problems the poa is widely applied to the joint optimal scheduling problems of cascade reservoirs yielding satisfactory outcomes in terms of solving speed and convergence accuracy while some scholars have demonstrated that poa may possess local convergence in multi dimensional and non convex optimal problems such as with the joint optimal dispatching of cascade reservoir groups zhou et al 2015 zhang et al 2022 the poa algorithm has certain advantages over other algorithms in terms of convergence speed wang et al 2022 when the poa algorithm solves the joint optimal scheduling problem of cascade reservoir groups it decomposes the scheduling problem into multiple two stage optimal problems and optimizes the two stage problem through continuous loop iterations to determine the operation process that optimizes the joint benefits of the cascade reservoir group zhang et al 1990 zhou et al 2010 zhong et al 2012 the two stage optimal problem is to seek an optimal water level state in the feasible region based on the initial water level state of each reservoir to maximize the increase in cascade power generation the traditional poa algorithm generally adopts the uniform corridor technology to determine the optimal water level state li 2019 this is a two sided uniform corridor generated near an initial water level state and the optimal water level is determined through the corridor some studies have shown that the convergence speed and accuracy of the poa algorithm can be further improved using the bidirectional corridor technique the corridor only deviates in one direction of the initial state when optimizing the optimal water level state such indications suggest potential mathematical principles and features underlying the two stage optimal problem created by the poa algorithm which may ultimately enhance the algorithm s retrieval speed zhao et al 2015 evaluates the marginal utility principle for long term hydropower scheduling and determines that saving carry over storage has a higher marginal return than its marginal cost for power generation in the next period in addition some analyses on the two stages hedging rule have proved the conditions for scheduling solutions tu et al 2003 tu et al 2008 however in the process of reservoir operation the objectives of the operation model are diverse and complexed and the constraints are nonlinear and multidimensional although the optimal solution can be found in two stages the optimal solution of the whole period cannot be accurately obtained therefore the discussion and verification of the monotonicity principle can help us get a result closer to the global optimum it is much easier to explore these mathematical characteristics than to analyze the mathematical characteristics the joint optimal operation process of the entire cascade reservoir group therefore we aimed to determine the related mathematical principles characteristics and strategies to improve the search rate and solution effect of the poa algorithm by exploring the process principles and characteristics of the two stage optimal problem exploring the basic mathematical principles of the reservoir joint optimal operation can provide theoretical support for the poa algorithm to solve the optimal operation problem of reservoir groups moreover the two stage optimization problem abstracted from practical engineering problems can be analyzed using the optimization principle which is the issue of innovative research and discussion in this study based on the monotonicity principle the optimal operation mode of the cascade reservoir group can be theoretically analyzed which can provide theoretical support for the joint optimal operation of cascade reservoir groups especially considering practical engineering problems of the joint optimal dispatching of cascade reservoirs kuriqi et al 2019 xu et al 2022 xu et al 2023 for instance constructing the optimal compensatory water supply problem of cascade reservoir groups during the dry season and the combined fluctuation problem of cascade reservoir groups during the drawdown period as two stage optimal problems is similar to the approach used in the poa optimization process as such it is crucial to investigate the optimal principle and mathematical characteristics of these two stage optimal problems to better understand joint operation strategies of cascade reservoir groups doing so would have significant theoretical and practical implications for effectively managing water resources and enhancing the overall operational efficiency of the hydroelectric power system the paper is arranged as follows in section 2 the optimal compensation water supply problem of the cascade reservoir group in the dry season and the combined fluctuation problem in the drawdown period are introduced the practical engineering problem is described as a two stage optimal problem that provides a basis for further exploration and discovery of the optimal principle of the two stage optimal problem in the joint operation of cascade reservoirs in section 3 based on the practical problem and the two stage optimal principle in the poa the two stage optimal problem for the joint dispatching of cascade reservoir groups is constructed and the optimal principle and existence conditions of the two stage optimal problem are deduced in section 4 the two stage optimality principle is deduced and verified in section 5 two case studies are set up to analyze the optimal operation mode of cascade reservoirs in two typical cases using the proposed optimal principle and comparing the calculation results in different scenarios in section 6 we summarize and conclude 2 problem abstraction and description to analyze the optimal principle of the cascade reservoir joint optimal dispatching problem the cascade reservoir joint compensation water supply problem and cascade reservoir joint fluctuation problem mentioned above were abstracted into a two stage optimal problem 2 1 joint compensation water supply problem of cascade reservoir group to study the compensatory water supply characteristics of cascade reservoirs in the dry season the compensatory water supply problem is abstracted as a two stage optimal problem in the dry season the cascade reservoirs maintain high or low water levels in both stages when the downstream of the cascade needs to compensate for the water supply Œ¥ q in period t or t 1 a reasonable compensating water supply mode of the cascade reservoir group is sought in other words the compensation reservoir and amount of water supply should be selected to minimize the loss of the combined power generation benefit of the cascade reservoir group on the premise of meeting the demand for compensation water supply the two stage problem description is presented in fig 1 2 2 the problem of joint drawdown of cascade reservoirs to study the characteristics of the water level drop of the cascade reservoir group during the fall period the pre flood water level fluctuation is abstracted as a two stage optimal problem the initial water level of each cascade of reservoirs the water level during the t period is the initial dropping water level which is generally the normal storage level the final water level the water level during the t 2 period is the flood limit the dropping water level the water level during the t 1 period is the mid term water level which is initially set at the starting water level by analyzing the impact of the water level drop of each cascade reservoir on the total power generation of the cascade hydropower station the characteristics of the water level drop of each cascade reservoir are revealed a schematic of the cascade reservoir combined fluctuation in the two stages is shown in fig 2 if the optimal level of horizontal fluctuation is above the uniform horizontal fluctuation line black dotted line in the figure it indicates delayed horizontal fluctuation if the optimal fluctuation level is below the uniform fluctuation line then the fluctuation is advanced to put it simply the two stage optimal problem in the cascade reservoir group combined fluctuation problem can be described as follows under a certain initial water level of a cascade reservoir the optimal water level of a certain cascade reservoir is sought to maximize the increase in the combined power generation of the cascade reservoir group 3 problem formulation 3 1 model construction of two stage optimal problem of cascade reservoir group the optimal dispatching model for the power generation of cascade reservoirs in a river basin generally aims to maximize power generation or power generation benefits in this study the maximum power generation is considered as the dispatching target and its function expression is shown in eq 1 in addition to guarantee the output of cascade reservoirs a comprehensive benefit term of the guaranteed output is added based on eq 1 and a power generation dispatching model with maximum power generation and guaranteed output of cascade reservoirs is established as shown in eq 2 1 max e t 1 t i 1 m n i t Œ¥ t t t 1 t i 1 m k i t q i t h i t Œ¥ t t 2 max e t 1 t i 1 m k i t q i t h i t Œ¥ t t i 1 m Œ± i n i g n i min where e

the dam site of the upstream power station is located in the backwater area of the downstream power station and the cascade reservoirs have overlapping heads backwater problem the tail water level of

coordination idea liu and zhang 2017 the established multi stage nonlinear constraint optimal problem of the cascade reservoir group is decomposed into multiple two stage optimal problems the specific process is as follows under the influence of the water level regulation of the upstream power station the inflow runoff of the downstream power station changes during the t and t 1 periods and the

the water level its discharge flow is affected by the water level adjustment as well as the downstream power station however the average water head during this period is reduced by its water level adjustment therefore the incremental power generation of the water level regulation power station can be divided into two parts incremental power generation due to flow regulation and incremental power generation due to water level regulation as shown in eq 20 20 Œ¥ e i regulated Œ¥ e i flow Œ¥ e i water level the incremental power generation caused by flow regulation is the same as the calculation method of non regulated power stations namely Œ¥ ei flow Œ¥ ei no regulated based on the above derivation the derivative of Œ¥ ei water level to Œ¥qt is shown in eq 21 and its second derivative is shown in eq 22 21 Œ¥ e i water level Œ¥ q t k z v t 1 i Œ¥ q t Œ¥ t t 2 Œ¥ t t q t i Œ¥ t t q t 1 i Œ¥ t t 1 where v t 1 i is the storage capacity corresponding to the initial water

in general the function z of the water level to storage capacity is a concave function li 2019 thus 2 Œ¥ e i water level Œ¥ q t 2 0 is always established 4 1 2 increment of total power generation of cascade hydropower stations eq 12 can be derived to obtain the first derivative of the total power generation increment of cascade power stations to Œ¥qt as shown in eq 23 23 Œ¥ e total Œ¥ q t Œ¥ e

satisfies eq 24 the first part of eq 24 can be called the monotonicity criterion value of the power station 2 Œ¥ e total Œ¥ q t 2 0 is always established and the function Œ¥ e total Œ¥ q t is a monotonically decreasing function of Œ¥q t 24 j m 2z j down q q z j down q 0 according to the above analysis if eq 24 holds then there exists an optimal solution of Œ¥ e total within the feasible region of Œ¥ q t which is either on the boundary of the feasible region of Œ¥ q t or at Œ¥ e total Œ¥ q t 0 the flowchart of the structure of the methodologies is show in fig 4 which can clearly express the composition of complex derivative terms 4 2 optimality principle verification of the two stage optimal problem the above analysis shows that if the cascade power station satisfies eq 24 the optimal problem 12 can be solved which can be applied to design corresponding search strategies to improve the convergence speed of the algorithm however the above results should be verified in real engineering situations to verify the existence of the above mentioned monotonicity principle we took the cascade reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river as an example to explore the monotonicity of the two stage optimal problem in this study 3 000 common fitting functions were selected for curve fitting using the levenberg marquardt method ma and jiang 2007 finally a fitting function with a higher fitting degree and fewer parameters was selected as shown in eq 25 the results of fitting function parameters fitting degree r and root mean square error rmse of partial reservoir cascade power stations 4 of 22 hydro power stations are shown in table 1 25 z down p 1 p 2 q 0 5 p 3 q p 4 q 1 5 p 5 q 2 p 6 q 2 5 where z down represents the downstream water level q represents the discharge flow p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 and p6 represent the corresponding fitting parameters for each reservoir the fitting function was used to obtain the monotonicity criterion value of each power station in the upper reaches of the yangtze river figs 5 9 the figures show that the monotonicity criterion values are all less than zero satisfying eq 24 furthermore a comparative experiment is conducted on the joint optimization of cascade hydropower stations in the lower reaches of the jinsha river to verify the effectiveness of the monotonicity principle in the two stage problem the presented dispatch model employs a ten day time scale with three representative inbound flow conditions selected corresponding to wet year 1989 normal water year 2009 and dry year 1958 respectively the present study employs the progressive optimization algorithm poa and the improved progressive optimization algorithm ipoa which incorporates the monotonicity principle 100 independent calculations were performed for each algorithm and their respective results are presented in table 3 the main parameters of four large hydropower stations in the jinsha river are shown in table 2 which are utilized for the effect validation of the monotonicity principle during the ipoa calculation process we set the total power generation increment of the reservoir as the objective function utilizing the aforementioned monotonicity principles we optimize and calculate the optimal value for Œ¥ q t which represents the optimal regulated discharge value we then use this optimal solution to calculate the total power generation of the reservoir and compare it with the results obtained using the traditional poa algorithm and the respective results are presented in table 3 the results presented in table 3 demonstrate that ipoa outperforms poa in terms of optimal results for the three water years examined the average power generations of 100 independent calculations for ipoa are higher than those of poa by 10 1 billion kwh 4 5 billion kwh and 2 8 billion kwh for the wet normal and dry years respectively this indicates that ipoa has a larger feasible domain for decision variable optimization problems particularly in abundant water scenarios furthermore the maximum power generation values of ipoa s 100 independent calculations are higher than those of poa by 340 million kwh 270 million kwh and 110 million kwh at each level respectively suggesting that ipoa is closer to the global optimal solution than poa in particular ipoa exhibits a lower standard deviation of power generation for the wet normal and dry years with values less than 0 5 in contrast the standard deviation of poa s 100 independent calculations is considerably larger reaching 4 91 for the wet year moreover ipoa shows much faster convergence rate compared to poa the poa started to converge only after 9600 iterative computations while ipoa converged after 560 computations resulting in a 16 fold increase in convergence speed overall these findings indicate that ipoa is more effective than poa in optimizing power generation for the cascade hydropower stations in the lower reaches of the jinsha river therefore when solving the problem of power generation scheduling of cascade power stations in the upper reaches of the yangtze river this principle can be applied to design corresponding search strategies to improve the convergence speed of the algorithm it s worth mentioning that when spillage occurs in reservoirs the monotonicity principle may be superfluous however this rule can still be used for finding the optimal solution during power generation when spillage occurs it means that water is released from the reservoir during a flood and efficiency of power generation is no longer the primary goal reservoirs must control the rate of flow adjust water levels prevent floods and maintain reservoir safety during spillage the water level in the reservoir is higher than normal water level and the spillway is opened to full capacity in this situation increasing the water level further cannot boost the power generation of the reservoir the monotonicity principle is still valid but loses its significance under these circumstances 5 case study the previous analysis verified the monotonicity principle we further verified the applicability of the monotonic principle of the proposed two stage optimal problem for cascade reservoirs two case studies were conducted case 1 was a cascade reservoir group composed of a reservoir with strong regulation performance and multiple reservoirs with daily regulation performance the aim was to analyze the optimal operation mode of the controlling reservoir in a cascade reservoir group with strong regulation performance and multiple reservoirs with daily regulation case 2 was a controlled reservoir group with multiple annual and seasonal regulation performances the aim of this study was to analyze the changing laws of cascade reservoir groups with multiple controlling reservoirs during the dry season and the drawdown periods the specific settings of the case studies are described in sections 5 1 and 5 2 5 1 case 1 to analyze the relationship between the optimal operation mode of the controlling reservoir and the number and type of downstream reservoirs with daily regulation in a cascade reservoir group composed of reservoirs with strong regulation performance and multiple reservoirs with daily regulation one reservoir with multiyear regulation and three reservoirs with daily regulation were selected to construct the cascade reservoir groups the reservoirs were all virtual reservoirs with relevant parameters shown in table 4 and the characteristics of the three reservoirs with daily regulation were different four different working conditions were designed each of which consisted of one reservoir with multiyear regulation and nine reservoirs with daily regulation as shown in fig 10 the initial state of each reservoir in the above described four working conditions is as follows the initial and final water levels of station1 during periods t and t 1 are set to a level below the normal storage level the initial and final water levels of station2 station3 and station4 during t and t 1 periods are all set to normal storage levels based on the working condition when the downstream of station1 contains different numbers of reservoirs the relationship between the first derivative of the increment Œ¥etotal of the total power generation of the cascade to the regulation flow Œ¥qt of station1 in t period with a change in Œ¥qt is obtained as shown in fig 11 in fig 11 amount 1 represents reservoir station1 with multiyear regulation amount 2 represents reservoir station1 with multiyear regulation and a reservoir with daily regulation connected in series and other reservoirs with daily regulation are gradually added fig 11 shows that there is a linear relationship between Œ¥ e total and Œ¥qt under different working conditions and Œ¥ e total monotonically decreases second the slope of the relationship curve between Œ¥etotal and Œ¥qt decreased with an increase in the number of cascade reservoirs under different working conditions the intersection point of the relationship curve between Œ¥etotal and Œ¥qt and the x axis also gradually moves to the of the x axis Œ¥qt corresponds to the intersection point of the Œ¥etotal and Œ¥qt relationship curves and the x axis is the optimal Œ¥qt that maximizes the incremental power generation of the cascade reservoir groups in addition fig 11 a c show that under the same Œ¥qt Œ¥etotal increases as the number of cascade hydropower stations increases and the variation in each additional reservoir is approximately uniform fig 11 d shows that when different types of reservoirs are added to the cascade reservoirs the variation of Œ¥etotal is not uniform and the variation of Œ¥etotal is related to the type of added reservoir furthermore as shown in fig 11 the variation in Œ¥etotal has a linear relationship with Œ¥q t according to fig 12 a with an increase in the number of downstream power stations of the regulating water level power station the optimal regulating flow Œ¥qt always increases but as shown in fig 12 b the increment shows a gradually decreasing trend and finally tends to a certain stable value it can be seen from fig 13 a that owing to different reservoir types the change in Œ¥etotal and the slope of Œ¥qt are also different as shown in fig 13 b this linear relationship also retains the intersection of the Œ¥etotal and Œ¥qt relationship curves at one point for different types of cascade reservoirs the analysis of the results of case 1 demonstrates that in a cascade reservoir composed of a reservoir with strong regulation performance controlling reservoir and multiple reservoirs with daily regulation the average water head of the cascade reservoirs can be adjusted as the number of reservoirs with daily regulation downstream of the cascade increases in the two stage optimal problem the operating water level at the end of time t is adjusted so that the discharge flow at time t increases by sacrificing the head benefit of the reservoir itself the overall head benefit of the cascade reservoir is increased so that the overall power generation of the cascade reservoir is increased with the difference in the number and type of cascade reservoirs the optimal regulating flow of the controlling reservoirs also differs with the increase in the number of cascade reservoirs the optimal regulation flow of the controlling reservoirs gradually increases and this increase is related to the characteristics of the increased number of reservoirs with daily regulation with an increase in the number of cascade reservoirs the increasing trend of the optimal regulation flow of the controlling reservoirs gradually decreases and stabilizes after reaching a certain level 5 2 case 2 large scale controlled reservoirs are generally built in the upper reaches of the basin to regulate the runoff of the entire basin followed by a series of unregulated reservoirs that can achieve good power generation benefits however in the case of a large basin the proportion of incoming water in the middle and lower reaches is relatively large and an upstream controlling reservoir is not sufficient to regulate the entire basin thus another regulated reservoir will be built somewhere in the middle and lower reaches to achieve good regulation of the runoff of the entire river basin therefore it is of high practical significance to study the joint optimization of cascade reservoirs with multiple regulated reservoirs in this study the principle of optimization was used to analyze the compensatory water supply in the dry season and the fluctuation of the water level in the drawdown period of cascade reservoirs with multiple annual and seasonal regulation performances cascade reservoirs composed of two types of control reservoirs with annual and seasonal regulation performance were selected all reservoirs were virtual reservoirs and relevant parameters are shown in table 5 and ten working conditions were designed based on the different positions of station5 in the cascade reservoir groups as shown in fig 14 according to eq 18 Œ¥ e j no r e g u l a t e d Œ¥ q t is related to the difference between the initial water level of the reservoir during t period and the final water level during t 1 period as well as the lower discharge flow during periods t and t 1 therefore four common initial states were set for each reservoir after considering the above 10 working conditions 1 water level at the beginning and end of periods t and t 1 maintains a high water level operation state 2 water level at the end of period t 1 decreases slightly compared with the initial water level of period t 3 water level at the end of t 1 period decreases significantly compared with the water level at the beginning of t period 4 based on working condition 1 the discharge flow in period t 1 period is increased states 1 and 2 were mainly used to analyze the law of compensating the water supply of cascade reservoirs when the water level is at high or ebb as well as dry season flow states 3 and 4 are mainly used to analyze the cascade reservoirs during the drawdown periods that need to be flushed to the flood limit level before the flood and the fluctuation law of the water level of each cascade reservoir in the fluctuation period when runoff gradually increases between periods t and t 1 for the four initial states the operational characteristics of each cascade reservoir under individual operation were analyzed the operational characteristics of each cascade reservoir were further analyzed under different working conditions and four initial states as shown in fig 15 the relationship curve between the first derivative Œ¥ e i water level Œ¥ q t and Œ¥q of the power generation increment caused by the water level adjustment to the adjusted flow is always below the x axis in different initial states as the total discharge flow of the reservoir increases the intercept of the relationship curve between Œ¥ e i water level Œ¥ q t and Œ¥q and the y axis moves toward negative infinity of the y axis second with the decrease in the final water level of the cascade reservoir at t 1 and the increase in the runoff at t 1 Œ¥ e i water level Œ¥ q t gradually decreases and Œ¥ e i flow Œ¥ q t gradually increases however the magnitude of the decrease in Œ¥ e i water level Œ¥ q t is greater than that of the increase in Œ¥ e i flow Œ¥ q t consequently the relationship curve between the first derivative of the total power generation increment of the reservoir to the adjusted flow Œ¥ e i Œ¥ q t and Œ¥q is always below the x axis as shown in fig 16 the first derivative Œ¥ e i flow Œ¥ q of the power generation increment caused by the flow adjustment to the adjustment flow and the relationship curve Œ¥q shows a linear relationship under different working conditions Œ¥ e i flow Œ¥ q linearly decreases as Œ¥q increases the intercept of the curve and y axis have a significant relationship as the difference between the final water level at t 1 and the initial water level at t and the runoff at t 1 increases the intercept of the curve and y axis moves toward positive infinity of the y axis under state 1 as the position of station5 in the cascade gradually moves downstream the relation curve of Œ¥etotal of station5 and Œ¥q gradually moves in the positive direction of the y axis because in state 1 the increment of power generation of station6 caused by flow regulation is decreased as shown in fig 16 Œ¥etotal increased as the number of station6 downstream of station5 decreases in states 2 3 and 4 the Œ¥ e i flow Œ¥ q caused by the flow regulation of station6 is initially positive and decreases with an increase in Œ¥q in state 2 when a certain station6 is upstream of station5 and there are two stations6 between stations6 the initial dropout priority of station6 is greater than that of station5 in states 2 and 3 when station6 is upstream of station5 and there is station6 between stations6 the initial dropout priority of station6 is greater than that of station5 this phenomenon occurs because the Œ¥ e i flow Œ¥ q of station6 in states 3 and 4 is larger than that in state 2 the above analysis demonstrates that in cascade reservoirs the fluctuation priority of each reservoir is related not only to the operation characteristics of the reservoir but also to the upstream and downstream relationships of the reservoir according to the case 2 analysis of the operation characteristics of cascade reservoirs when cascade reservoirs reduce their operating water head the power generation reduction caused by water level regulation is always greater than the power generation gain caused by flow regulation regardless of dry or drawdown periods therefore from the perspective of optimal operation of the reservoir in the dry season and drawdown period a high water level should be maintained as far as possible to ensure that the water is not abandoned the operation characteristics of case 2 s cascade reservoirs indicate that the order of the water level drawdown during the dry season and drawdown period is affected by both the cascade position and operation characteristics of each reservoir in instances where the power station benefits from water level regulation higher priority is given to compensating for water supply and water loss levels in upstream reservoirs conversely in situations where power generation gains from water level adjustments are inadequate upstream reservoirs have lower priority for replenishing water supplies and reducing water levels furthermore reservoirs with dynamic characteristics similar to positive infinity of the y axis on the curve have a greater priority for compensating water supplies and reducing water levels in the context of practical dispatch our analysis shows that during the dry season increasing power generation via flow regulation yields small incremental gains and may result in losses specifically regulating the flow of a cascade reservoir only generates marginal increases in the total power generation of downstream reservoirs consequently the sequencing of compensatory water supply in cascade reservoirs is determined primarily by their dynamic characteristics during the drawdown period however adjusting the flow leads to an initial gain in power generation with the magnitude of the gain diminishing as the flow is further adjusted the priority of fluctuation can be determined based on the amount of Œ¥etotal of each reservoir with a large Œ¥etotal dropping first and a small Œ¥etotal dropping later 6 conclusions and discussion in this study we present a two stage optimal problem to model the interplay between downstream discharge and total power generation increment in cascade reservoirs we derive the first and second derivatives and establish the two stage optimal principle of joint operation using this principle we analyze the optimal operation modes of two typical cascade reservoirs and draw the following conclusions firstly the existence of an optimality principle of the two stage problem indicates that if all reservoirs meet the proposed criteria an optimal flow rate to maximize the total power generation of the cascade must exist secondly in a cascade reservoir comprising one high stress performance reservoir and several daily regulation reservoirs the optimal operation mode of the control reservoir is influenced by the number and type of power stations downstream we find that a higher level of control by the reservoir leads to a greater willingness to sacrifice its head benefit to improve the overall power generation benefit of the cascade albeit with the characteristic of marginal decline thirdly when operated independently during the dry season and drawdown period the optimal mode is to maintain high water level operations as far as possible whilst ensuring no water abandonment such a mode leads to less energy generation gain due to water level regulation than that due to flow regulation finally in a cascade reservoir with multiple control reservoirs the sequence of compensating the water supply of the cascade reservoirs is mainly determined by the operation characteristics of the cascade reservoirs optimal compensation involves choosing the reservoir with the best operating characteristics among the cascade reservoirs this approach satisfies water supply compensation demands while minimizing the loss of power generation in the cascade reservoir group in a cascade reservoir composed of several control reservoirs the sequence of the cascade reservoir in the drawdown period is determined by the position of the cascade reservoir and the operating characteristics of the reservoir specifically it may be necessary to use the optimal principle mentioned in this article to determine the order of drawdown of each reservoir in the cascade based on a real scenario for the optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations because the monotone function can find the optimal solution in the feasible region the derived monotonic relationship is generally universal and the solutions obtained by using the relationship are optimal in the process of monotonicity deduction we did not simplify the formula for calculation and only assumed the prerequisite that hj loss is a constant value within the range of Œ¥qt at formula 16 so the conclusion of monotonicity derivation is relatively reliable moreover before using the monotonicity principle the poa algorithm has a strong dependence on the initial solution after using the theoretical support of this paper the optimization efficiency and solution effect of the poa algorithm have been greatly improved which is of great significance for the joint operation of cascade reservoirs in addition this paper only solved the numerical solution but did not get the analytic solutions this is because in the process of power generation calculation the relationship between runoff water head and other variables is complex and nonlinear if the analytical solution is used instead of the numerical solution the workload of pretreatment and calculation will be greatly increased at the same time it is necessary to add simplification in the deduction process which will also lead to a lower accuracy of the analytical solution than the numerical solution this is contrary to our original intention to improve the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm however there are limitations to this study although the applicability of this theoretical method for cascade reservoir groups has been proved the applicability and superiority of this method for hybrid linkage reservoir groups with both series and parallel conditions need to be further verified for a multi energy system such as hydro power wind power and solar energy the reasonableness of the optimality principle needs to be further discussed the effect of their application to the method could be the next research prospect funding this study was financially supported by the national key r d program

1737,the joint optimal dispatching of cascade hydropower stations aims to maximize economic benefits while satisfying various constraints however numerous studies have failed to acknowledge the significance of the intrinsic optimization principle and lack discussion on this issue this study started with a mathematical principle analysis of the optimization problem and studied the optimality principle puzzle of the joint optimal dispatching of cascade hydropower stations first a two stage optimization problem was constructed to describe the relationship between the variation in discharge and the incremental function of the total energy generation of the reservoir subsequently the first and second derivatives of the cascade total generating capacity increment to cascade reservoir discharge variation were derived and the existence condition of monotonically decreasing the first derivative was proposed moreover the monotonicity principle was proven through numerical simulations by comparing the optimization results of poa and the monotonicity principle coupled ipoa in the cascade hydropower stations operation of the jinsha river it was found that in terms of power generation and computational efficiency ipoa is superior to poa finally using this optimization principle the optimal operation mode of the two typical cascade reservoirs was analyzed in the case studies the example results show that the proposed optimal principle can theoretically analyze and clarify the optimal operation mode of cascade reservoirs and the operation modes of the two typical cascade reservoirs can provide guidance and reference for the operation modes of cascade reservoirs in real life keywords cascade reservoir joint optimization two stage optimal problem monotonicity principle existing condition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the joint optimal dispatching of cascade reservoirs presents a multifaceted challenge that is characterized by a non convex non linear objective function and strong inter stage constraint correlation no mathematical method can directly obtain the analytical solution of the problem or prove the existence of optimal solutions kuriqi et al 2020 currently the optimal operation for cascade reservoir groups is primarily tackled through numerical methods which encompass the following approaches mathematical programming builds a linear and quadratic objective function of the joint optimal operation problem of cascade reservoirs using linear programming lp windsor 2012 quadratic programming pan et al 2022 wilson 1963 and other mathematical programming methods to solve the optimization problem although the mathematical programming method can obtain the analytical solution of the problem on the premise that the objective function is generalized into linear and quadratic the analytical solution cannot represent the real optimal operation process of the cascade reservoir group owing to the generalization of the objective function the dynamic programming method zhang et al 2013 decomposes the complex constrained optimization problem into multi stage sub problems has no requirements for the mathematical characteristics of the objectives and constraints and ensures global convergence within a certain discrete accuracy ma et al 2021 yakowitz 1982 young 1967 therefore dynamic programming is widely used in the solution of complex constrained optimization problems such as the optimal dispatching of hydropower stations however the dynamic programming method has the problem of dimensional disaster with large computational and time requirements to solve the joint dispatch problem of cascade reservoirs jiang et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 many improved algorithms of dynamic programming have been proposed to solve the dimensional disaster problem for example incremental dynamic programming idp jukna 2014 differential dynamic programming ddp li et al 2014 discrete differential dynamic programming dddp bellman 1957 cheng et al 2014 dynamic programming successive approximation dpsa he et al 2021 and progressive optimal algorithm poa ji et al 2021 zong et al 2003 the algorithms described above offer promising solutions to the issue of dimensionality nevertheless they are also faced with the challenge of local convergence in the feasible region of the joint optimal dispatching problem of reservoir groups the optimal solution of the problem is gradually approached through iterative search using an intelligent search algorithm in recent years numerous intelligent search algorithms have been applied to solve the joint optimal dispatching problem of cascade reservoir groups representative algorithms include the genetic algorithm ga khafagy et al 2022 nguyen et al 2022 differential evolution algorithm de ahmadianfar et al 2021 storn and price 1995 particle swarm optimization pso afshar 2012 and the ant colony algorithm aco okwu and tartibu 2021 intelligent algorithms have proven effective in overcoming the problem of dimensional disaster and conducting a continuous domain search for the joint optimal dispatching of cascade hydropower stations however they still face limitations such as slow search speed and premature convergence when utilizing such algorithms for specific problems it is crucial to design adaptive parameter control and local search strategies to enhance convergence speed and accuracy of the algorithm furthermore various improved dynamic programming algorithms have been proposed to sufficiently address the issue of dimensionality while also enhancing their applicability and accuracy kuriqi and jurasz 2022 among the many improved algorithms for dynamic programming howson and sancho 1975 proposed a poa that decomposes a multi stage problem into multiple two stage problems the poa is widely applied to the joint optimal scheduling problems of cascade reservoirs yielding satisfactory outcomes in terms of solving speed and convergence accuracy while some scholars have demonstrated that poa may possess local convergence in multi dimensional and non convex optimal problems such as with the joint optimal dispatching of cascade reservoir groups zhou et al 2015 zhang et al 2022 the poa algorithm has certain advantages over other algorithms in terms of convergence speed wang et al 2022 when the poa algorithm solves the joint optimal scheduling problem of cascade reservoir groups it decomposes the scheduling problem into multiple two stage optimal problems and optimizes the two stage problem through continuous loop iterations to determine the operation process that optimizes the joint benefits of the cascade reservoir group zhang et al 1990 zhou et al 2010 zhong et al 2012 the two stage optimal problem is to seek an optimal water level state in the feasible region based on the initial water level state of each reservoir to maximize the increase in cascade power generation the traditional poa algorithm generally adopts the uniform corridor technology to determine the optimal water level state li 2019 this is a two sided uniform corridor generated near an initial water level state and the optimal water level is determined through the corridor some studies have shown that the convergence speed and accuracy of the poa algorithm can be further improved using the bidirectional corridor technique the corridor only deviates in one direction of the initial state when optimizing the optimal water level state such indications suggest potential mathematical principles and features underlying the two stage optimal problem created by the poa algorithm which may ultimately enhance the algorithm s retrieval speed zhao et al 2015 evaluates the marginal utility principle for long term hydropower scheduling and determines that saving carry over storage has a higher marginal return than its marginal cost for power generation in the next period in addition some analyses on the two stages hedging rule have proved the conditions for scheduling solutions tu et al 2003 tu et al 2008 however in the process of reservoir operation the objectives of the operation model are diverse and complexed and the constraints are nonlinear and multidimensional although the optimal solution can be found in two stages the optimal solution of the whole period cannot be accurately obtained therefore the discussion and verification of the monotonicity principle can help us get a result closer to the global optimum it is much easier to explore these mathematical characteristics than to analyze the mathematical characteristics the joint optimal operation process of the entire cascade reservoir group therefore we aimed to determine the related mathematical principles characteristics and strategies to improve the search rate and solution effect of the poa algorithm by exploring the process principles and characteristics of the two stage optimal problem exploring the basic mathematical principles of the reservoir joint optimal operation can provide theoretical support for the poa algorithm to solve the optimal operation problem of reservoir groups moreover the two stage optimization problem abstracted from practical engineering problems can be analyzed using the optimization principle which is the issue of innovative research and discussion in this study based on the monotonicity principle the optimal operation mode of the cascade reservoir group can be theoretically analyzed which can provide theoretical support for the joint optimal operation of cascade reservoir groups especially considering practical engineering problems of the joint optimal dispatching of cascade reservoirs kuriqi et al 2019 xu et al 2022 xu et al 2023 for instance constructing the optimal compensatory water supply problem of cascade reservoir groups during the dry season and the combined fluctuation problem of cascade reservoir groups during the drawdown period as two stage optimal problems is similar to the approach used in the poa optimization process as such it is crucial to investigate the optimal principle and mathematical characteristics of these two stage optimal problems to better understand joint operation strategies of cascade reservoir groups doing so would have significant theoretical and practical implications for effectively managing water resources and enhancing the overall operational efficiency of the hydroelectric power system the paper is arranged as follows in section 2 the optimal compensation water supply problem of the cascade reservoir group in the dry season and the combined fluctuation problem in the drawdown period are introduced the practical engineering problem is described as a two stage optimal problem that provides a basis for further exploration and discovery of the optimal principle of the two stage optimal problem in the joint operation of cascade reservoirs in section 3 based on the practical problem and the two stage optimal principle in the poa the two stage optimal problem for the joint dispatching of cascade reservoir groups is constructed and the optimal principle and existence conditions of the two stage optimal problem are deduced in section 4 the two stage optimality principle is deduced and verified in section 5 two case studies are set up to analyze the optimal operation mode of cascade reservoirs in two typical cases using the proposed optimal principle and comparing the calculation results in different scenarios in section 6 we summarize and conclude 2 problem abstraction and description to analyze the optimal principle of the cascade reservoir joint optimal dispatching problem the cascade reservoir joint compensation water supply problem and cascade reservoir joint fluctuation problem mentioned above were abstracted into a two stage optimal problem 2 1 joint compensation water supply problem of cascade reservoir group to study the compensatory water supply characteristics of cascade reservoirs in the dry season the compensatory water supply problem is abstracted as a two stage optimal problem in the dry season the cascade reservoirs maintain high or low water levels in both stages when the downstream of the cascade needs to compensate for the water supply Œ¥ q in period t or t 1 a reasonable compensating water supply mode of the cascade reservoir group is sought in other words the compensation reservoir and amount of water supply should be selected to minimize the loss of the combined power generation benefit of the cascade reservoir group on the premise of meeting the demand for compensation water supply the two stage problem description is presented in fig 1 2 2 the problem of joint drawdown of cascade reservoirs to study the characteristics of the water level drop of the cascade reservoir group during the fall period the pre flood water level fluctuation is abstracted as a two stage optimal problem the initial water level of each cascade of reservoirs the water level during the t period is the initial dropping water level which is generally the normal storage level the final water level the water level during the t 2 period is the flood limit the dropping water level the water level during the t 1 period is the mid term water level which is initially set at the starting water level by analyzing the impact of the water level drop of each cascade reservoir on the total power generation of the cascade hydropower station the characteristics of the water level drop of each cascade reservoir are revealed a schematic of the cascade reservoir combined fluctuation in the two stages is shown in fig 2 if the optimal level of horizontal fluctuation is above the uniform horizontal fluctuation line black dotted line in the figure it indicates delayed horizontal fluctuation if the optimal fluctuation level is below the uniform fluctuation line then the fluctuation is advanced to put it simply the two stage optimal problem in the cascade reservoir group combined fluctuation problem can be described as follows under a certain initial water level of a cascade reservoir the optimal water level of a certain cascade reservoir is sought to maximize the increase in the combined power generation of the cascade reservoir group 3 problem formulation 3 1 model construction of

coordination idea liu and zhang 2017 the established multi stage nonlinear constraint optimal problem of the cascade reservoir group is decomposed into multiple two stage optimal problems the specific process is as follows under the influence of the water level regulation of the upstream power station the inflow runoff of the downstream power station changes during the t and t 1 periods and the increment of power generation of power station j is shown in eq 13 13 Œ¥ e j no r e g u l a t e d Œ¥ e j t no r e g u l a t e d Œ¥ e j t 1 no r e g u a l t e d where Œ¥ ej t no regulated is the

the water level its discharge flow is affected by the water level adjustment as well as the downstream power station however the average water head during this period is reduced by its water level adjustment therefore the incremental power generation of the water level regulation power station can be divided into two parts incremental power generation due to flow regulation and incremental power generation due to water level regulation as shown in eq 20 20 Œ¥ e i regulated Œ¥ e i flow Œ¥ e i water level the incremental power generation caused by flow regulation is the same as the calculation method of non regulated power stations namely Œ¥ ei flow Œ¥ ei no regulated based on the above derivation the derivative of Œ¥ ei water level to Œ¥qt is shown in eq 21 and its second

in general the function z of the water level to storage capacity is a concave function li 2019 thus 2 Œ¥ e i water level Œ¥ q t 2 0 is always established 4 1 2 increment of total power generation of cascade hydropower stations eq 12 can be derived to obtain the first derivative of the total power generation increment of cascade power stations to Œ¥qt as shown in eq 23 23 Œ¥ e total Œ¥ q t Œ¥ e

satisfies eq 24 the first part of eq 24 can be called the monotonicity criterion value of the power station 2 Œ¥ e total Œ¥ q t 2 0 is always established and the function Œ¥ e total Œ¥ q t is a monotonically decreasing function of Œ¥q t 24 j m 2z j down q q z j down q 0 according to the above analysis if eq 24 holds then there exists an optimal solution of Œ¥ e total within the feasible region of Œ¥ q t which is either on the boundary of the feasible region of Œ¥ q t or at Œ¥ e total Œ¥ q t 0 the flowchart of the structure of the methodologies is show in fig 4 which can clearly express the composition of complex derivative terms 4 2 optimality principle verification of the two stage optimal problem the above analysis shows that if the cascade power station satisfies eq 24 the optimal problem 12 can be solved which can be applied to design corresponding search strategies to improve the convergence speed of the algorithm however the above results should be verified in real engineering situations to verify the existence of the above mentioned monotonicity principle we took the cascade reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river as an example to explore the monotonicity of the two stage optimal problem in this study 3 000 common fitting functions were selected for curve fitting using the levenberg marquardt method ma and jiang 2007 finally a fitting function with a higher fitting degree and fewer parameters was selected as shown in eq 25 the results of fitting function parameters fitting degree r and root mean square error rmse of partial reservoir cascade power stations 4 of 22 hydro power stations are shown in table 1 25 z down p 1 p 2 q 0 5 p 3 q p 4 q 1 5 p 5 q 2 p 6 q 2 5 where z down represents the downstream water level q represents the discharge flow p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 and p6 represent the corresponding fitting parameters for each reservoir the fitting function was used to obtain the monotonicity criterion value of each power station in the upper reaches of the yangtze river figs 5 9 the figures show that the monotonicity criterion values are all less than zero satisfying eq 24 furthermore a comparative experiment is conducted on the joint optimization of cascade hydropower stations in the lower reaches of the jinsha river to verify the effectiveness of the monotonicity principle in the two stage problem the presented dispatch model employs a ten day time scale with three representative inbound flow conditions selected corresponding to wet year 1989 normal water year 2009 and dry year 1958 respectively the present study employs the progressive optimization algorithm poa and the improved progressive optimization algorithm ipoa which incorporates the monotonicity principle 100 independent calculations were performed for each algorithm and their respective results are presented in table 3 the main parameters of four large hydropower stations in the jinsha river are shown in table 2 which are utilized for the effect validation of the monotonicity principle during the ipoa calculation process we set the total power generation increment of the reservoir as the objective function utilizing the aforementioned monotonicity principles we optimize and calculate the optimal value for Œ¥ q t which represents the optimal regulated discharge value we then use this optimal solution to calculate the total power generation of the reservoir and compare it with the results obtained using the traditional poa algorithm and the respective results are presented in table 3 the results presented in table 3 demonstrate that ipoa outperforms poa in terms of optimal results for the three water years examined the average power generations of 100 independent calculations for ipoa are higher than those of poa by 10 1 billion kwh 4 5 billion kwh and 2 8 billion kwh for the wet normal and dry years respectively this indicates that ipoa has a larger feasible domain for decision variable optimization problems particularly in abundant water scenarios furthermore the maximum power generation values of ipoa s 100 independent calculations are higher than those of poa by 340 million kwh 270 million kwh and 110 million kwh at each level respectively suggesting that ipoa is closer to the global optimal solution than poa in particular ipoa exhibits a lower standard deviation of power generation for the wet normal and dry years with values less than 0 5 in contrast the standard deviation of poa s 100 independent calculations is considerably larger reaching 4 91 for the wet year moreover ipoa shows much faster convergence rate compared to poa the poa started to converge only after 9600 iterative computations while ipoa converged after 560 computations resulting in a 16 fold increase in convergence speed overall these findings indicate that ipoa is more effective than poa in optimizing power generation for the cascade hydropower stations in the lower reaches of the jinsha river therefore when solving the problem of power generation scheduling of cascade power stations in the upper reaches of the yangtze river this principle can be applied to design corresponding search strategies to improve the convergence speed of the algorithm it s worth mentioning that when spillage occurs in reservoirs the monotonicity principle may be superfluous however this rule can still be used for finding the optimal solution during power generation when spillage occurs it means that water is released from the reservoir during a flood and efficiency of power generation is no longer the primary goal reservoirs must control the rate of flow adjust water levels prevent floods and maintain reservoir safety during spillage the water level in the reservoir is higher than normal water level and the spillway is opened to full capacity in this situation increasing the water level further cannot boost the power generation of the reservoir the monotonicity principle is still valid but loses its significance under these circumstances 5 case study the previous analysis verified the monotonicity principle we further verified the applicability of the monotonic principle of the proposed two stage optimal problem for cascade reservoirs two case studies were conducted case 1 was a cascade reservoir group composed of a reservoir with strong regulation performance and multiple reservoirs with daily regulation performance the aim was to analyze the optimal operation mode of the controlling reservoir in a cascade reservoir group with strong regulation performance and multiple reservoirs with daily regulation case 2 was a controlled reservoir group with multiple annual and seasonal regulation performances the aim of this study was to analyze the changing laws of cascade reservoir groups with multiple controlling reservoirs during the dry season and the drawdown periods the specific settings of the case studies are described in sections 5 1 and 5 2 5 1 case 1 to analyze the relationship between the optimal operation mode of the controlling reservoir and the number and type of downstream reservoirs with daily regulation in a cascade reservoir group composed of reservoirs with strong regulation performance and multiple reservoirs with daily regulation one reservoir with multiyear regulation and three reservoirs with daily regulation were selected to construct the cascade reservoir groups the reservoirs were all virtual reservoirs with relevant parameters shown in table 4 and the characteristics of the three reservoirs with daily regulation were different four different working conditions were designed each of which consisted of one reservoir with multiyear regulation and nine reservoirs with daily regulation as shown in fig 10 the initial state of each reservoir in the above described four working conditions is as follows the initial and final water levels of station1 during periods t and t 1 are set to a level below the normal storage level the initial and final water levels of station2 station3 and station4 during t and t 1 periods are all set to normal storage levels based on the working condition when the downstream of station1 contains different numbers of reservoirs the relationship between the first derivative of the increment Œ¥etotal of the total power generation of the cascade to the regulation flow Œ¥qt of station1 in t period with a change in Œ¥qt is obtained as shown in fig 11 in fig 11 amount 1 represents reservoir station1 with multiyear regulation amount 2 represents reservoir station1 with multiyear regulation and a reservoir with daily regulation connected in series and other reservoirs with daily regulation are gradually added fig 11 shows that there is a linear relationship between Œ¥ e total and Œ¥qt under different working conditions and Œ¥ e total monotonically decreases second the slope of the relationship curve between Œ¥etotal and Œ¥qt decreased with an increase in the number of cascade reservoirs under different working conditions the intersection point of the relationship curve between Œ¥etotal and Œ¥qt and the x axis also gradually moves to the of the x axis Œ¥qt corresponds to the intersection point of the Œ¥etotal and Œ¥qt relationship curves and the x axis is the optimal Œ¥qt that maximizes the incremental power generation of the cascade reservoir groups in addition fig 11 a c show that under the same Œ¥qt Œ¥etotal increases as the number of cascade hydropower stations increases and the variation in each additional reservoir is approximately uniform fig 11 d shows that when different types of reservoirs are added to the cascade reservoirs the variation of Œ¥etotal is not uniform and the variation of Œ¥etotal is related to the type of added reservoir furthermore as shown in fig 11 the variation in Œ¥etotal has a linear relationship with Œ¥q t according to fig 12 a with an increase in the number of downstream power stations of the regulating water level power station the optimal regulating flow Œ¥qt always increases but as shown in fig 12 b the increment shows a gradually decreasing trend and finally tends to a certain stable value it can be seen from fig 13 a that owing to different reservoir types the change in Œ¥etotal and the slope of Œ¥qt are also different as shown in fig 13 b this linear relationship also retains the intersection of the Œ¥etotal and Œ¥qt relationship curves at one point for different types of cascade reservoirs the analysis of the results of case 1 demonstrates that in a cascade reservoir composed of a reservoir with strong regulation performance controlling reservoir and multiple reservoirs with daily regulation the average water head of the cascade reservoirs can be adjusted as the number of reservoirs with daily regulation downstream of the cascade increases in the two stage optimal problem the operating water level at the end of time t is adjusted so that the discharge flow at time t increases by sacrificing the head benefit of the reservoir itself the overall head benefit of the cascade reservoir is increased so that the overall power generation of the cascade reservoir is increased with the difference in the number and type of cascade reservoirs the optimal regulating flow of the controlling reservoirs also differs with the increase in the number of cascade reservoirs the optimal regulation flow of the controlling reservoirs gradually increases and this increase is related to the characteristics of the increased number of reservoirs with daily regulation with an increase in the number of cascade reservoirs the increasing trend of the optimal regulation flow of the controlling reservoirs gradually decreases and stabilizes after reaching a certain level 5 2 case 2 large scale controlled reservoirs are generally built in the upper reaches of the basin to regulate the runoff of the entire basin followed by a series of unregulated reservoirs that can achieve good power generation benefits however in the case of a large basin the proportion of incoming water in the middle and lower reaches is relatively large and an upstream controlling reservoir is not sufficient to regulate the entire basin thus another regulated reservoir will be built somewhere in the middle and lower reaches to achieve good regulation of the runoff of the entire river basin therefore it is of high practical significance to study the joint optimization of cascade reservoirs with multiple regulated reservoirs in this study the principle of optimization was used to analyze the compensatory water supply in the dry season and the fluctuation of the water level in the drawdown period of cascade reservoirs with multiple annual and seasonal regulation performances cascade reservoirs composed of two types of control reservoirs with annual and seasonal regulation performance were selected all reservoirs were virtual reservoirs and relevant parameters are shown in table 5 and ten working conditions were designed based on the different positions of station5 in the cascade reservoir groups as shown in fig 14 according to eq 18 Œ¥ e j no r e g u l a t e d Œ¥ q t is related to the difference between the initial water level of the reservoir during t period and the final water level during t 1 period as well as the lower discharge flow during periods t and t 1 therefore four common initial states were set for each reservoir after considering the above 10 working conditions 1 water level at the beginning and end of periods t and t 1 maintains a high water level operation state 2 water level at the end of period t 1 decreases slightly compared with the initial water level of period t 3 water level at the end of t 1 period decreases significantly compared with the water level at the beginning of t period 4 based on working condition 1 the discharge flow in period t 1 period is increased states 1 and 2 were mainly used to analyze the law of compensating the water supply of cascade reservoirs when the water level is at high or ebb as well as dry season flow states 3 and 4 are mainly used to analyze the cascade reservoirs during the drawdown periods that need to be flushed to the flood limit level before the flood and the fluctuation law of the water level of each cascade reservoir in the fluctuation period when runoff gradually increases between periods t and t 1 for the four initial states the operational characteristics of each cascade reservoir under individual operation were analyzed the operational characteristics of each cascade reservoir were further analyzed under different working conditions and four initial states as shown in fig 15 the relationship curve between the first derivative Œ¥ e i water level Œ¥ q t and Œ¥q of the power generation increment caused by the water level adjustment to the adjusted flow is always below the x axis in different initial states as the total discharge flow of the reservoir increases the intercept of the relationship curve between Œ¥ e i water level Œ¥ q t and Œ¥q and the y axis moves toward negative infinity of the y axis second with the decrease in the final water level of the cascade reservoir at t 1 and the increase in the runoff at t 1 Œ¥ e i water level Œ¥ q t gradually decreases and Œ¥ e i flow Œ¥ q t gradually increases however the magnitude of the decrease in Œ¥ e i water level Œ¥ q t is greater than that of the increase in Œ¥ e i flow Œ¥ q t consequently the relationship curve between the first derivative of the total power generation increment of the reservoir to the adjusted flow Œ¥ e i Œ¥ q t and Œ¥q is always below the x axis as shown in fig 16 the first derivative Œ¥ e i flow Œ¥ q of the power generation increment caused by the flow adjustment to the adjustment flow and the relationship curve Œ¥q shows a linear relationship under different working conditions Œ¥ e i flow Œ¥ q linearly decreases as Œ¥q increases the intercept of the curve and y axis have a significant relationship as the difference between the final water level at t 1 and the initial water level at t and the runoff at t 1 increases the intercept of the curve and y axis moves toward positive infinity of the y axis under state 1 as the position of station5 in the cascade gradually moves downstream the relation curve of Œ¥etotal of station5 and Œ¥q gradually moves in the positive direction of the y axis because in state 1 the increment of power generation of station6 caused by flow regulation is decreased as shown in fig 16 Œ¥etotal increased as the number of station6 downstream of station5 decreases in states 2 3 and 4 the Œ¥ e i flow Œ¥ q caused by the flow regulation of station6 is initially positive and decreases with an increase in Œ¥q in state 2 when a certain station6 is upstream of station5 and there are two stations6 between stations6 the initial dropout priority of station6 is greater than that of station5 in states 2 and 3 when station6 is upstream of station5 and there is station6 between stations6 the initial dropout priority of station6 is greater than that of station5 this phenomenon occurs because the Œ¥ e i flow Œ¥ q of station6 in states 3 and 4 is larger than that in state 2 the above analysis demonstrates that in cascade reservoirs the fluctuation priority of each reservoir is related not only to the operation characteristics of the reservoir but also to the upstream and downstream relationships of the reservoir according to the case 2 analysis of the operation characteristics of cascade reservoirs when cascade reservoirs reduce their operating water head the power generation reduction caused by water level regulation is always greater than the power generation gain caused by flow regulation regardless of dry or drawdown periods therefore from the perspective of optimal operation of the reservoir in the dry season and drawdown period a high water level should be maintained as far as possible to ensure that the water is not abandoned the operation characteristics of case 2 s cascade reservoirs indicate that the order of the water level drawdown during the dry season and drawdown period is affected by both the cascade position and operation characteristics of each reservoir in instances where the power station benefits from water level regulation higher priority is given to compensating for water supply and water loss levels in upstream reservoirs conversely in situations where power generation gains from water level adjustments are inadequate upstream reservoirs have lower priority for replenishing water supplies and reducing water levels furthermore reservoirs with dynamic characteristics similar to positive infinity of the y axis on the curve have a greater priority for compensating water supplies and reducing water levels in the context of practical dispatch our analysis shows that during the dry season increasing power generation via flow regulation yields small incremental gains and may result in losses specifically regulating the flow of a cascade reservoir only generates marginal increases in the total power generation of downstream reservoirs consequently the sequencing of compensatory water supply in cascade reservoirs is determined primarily by their dynamic characteristics during the drawdown period however adjusting the flow leads to an initial gain in power generation with the magnitude of the gain diminishing as the flow is further adjusted the priority of fluctuation can be determined based on the amount of Œ¥etotal of each reservoir with a large Œ¥etotal dropping first and a small Œ¥etotal dropping later 6 conclusions and discussion in this study we present a two stage optimal problem to model the interplay between downstream discharge and total power generation increment in cascade reservoirs we derive the first and second derivatives and establish the two stage optimal principle of joint operation using this principle we analyze the optimal operation modes of two typical cascade reservoirs and draw the following conclusions firstly the existence of an optimality principle of the two stage problem indicates that if all reservoirs meet the proposed criteria an optimal flow rate to maximize the total power generation of the cascade must exist secondly in a cascade reservoir comprising one high stress performance reservoir and several daily regulation reservoirs the optimal operation mode of the control reservoir is influenced by the number and type of power stations downstream we find that a higher level of control by the reservoir leads to a greater willingness to sacrifice its head benefit to improve the overall power generation benefit of the cascade albeit with the characteristic of marginal decline thirdly when operated independently during the dry season and drawdown period the optimal mode is to maintain high water level operations as far as possible whilst ensuring no water abandonment such a mode leads to less energy generation gain due to water level regulation than that due to flow regulation finally in a cascade reservoir with multiple control reservoirs the sequence of compensating the water supply of the cascade reservoirs is mainly determined by the operation characteristics of the cascade reservoirs optimal compensation involves choosing the reservoir with the best operating characteristics among the cascade reservoirs this approach satisfies water supply compensation demands while minimizing the loss of power generation in the cascade reservoir group in a cascade reservoir composed of several control reservoirs the sequence of the cascade reservoir in the drawdown period is determined by the position of the cascade reservoir and the operating characteristics of the reservoir specifically it may be necessary to use the optimal principle mentioned in this article to determine the order of drawdown of each reservoir in the cascade based on a real scenario for the optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations because the monotone function can find the optimal solution in the feasible region the derived monotonic relationship is generally universal and the solutions obtained by using the relationship are optimal in the process of monotonicity deduction we did not simplify the formula for calculation and only assumed the prerequisite that hj loss is a constant value within the range of Œ¥qt at formula 16 so the conclusion of monotonicity derivation is relatively reliable moreover before using the monotonicity principle the poa algorithm has a strong dependence on the initial solution after using the theoretical support of this paper the optimization efficiency and solution effect of the poa algorithm have been greatly improved which is of great significance for the joint operation of cascade reservoirs in addition this paper only solved the numerical solution but did not get the analytic solutions this is because in the process of power generation calculation the relationship between runoff water head and other variables is complex and nonlinear if the analytical solution is used instead of the numerical solution the workload of pretreatment and calculation will be greatly increased at the same time it is necessary to add simplification in the deduction process which will also lead to a lower accuracy of the analytical solution than the numerical solution this is contrary to our original intention to improve the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm however there are limitations to this study although the applicability of this theoretical method for cascade reservoir groups has been proved the applicability and superiority of this method for hybrid linkage reservoir groups with both series and parallel conditions need to be further verified for a multi energy system such as hydro power wind power and solar energy the reasonableness of the optimality principle needs to be further discussed the effect of their application to the method could be the next research prospect funding this study was financially supported by the national key r d program

1738,in arid and semi arid regions the depth of water table has a significant effect on evaporation the soil in these regions is unsaturated and the transport of liquid water and water vapor is accompanied by variation of the water table depth in this study we designed a laboratory experimental apparatus to conduct evaporation experiments of soil under shallow and deep water table conditions through continuous monitoring of water content and temperature variation in the vadose zone a numerical model was used to simulate the coupled transport of liquid water water vapor and heat in the vadose zone under two different water table elevations the experimental and numerical results were in good agreement liquid water and water vapor fluxes driven by pressure head and temperature gradient were calculated and analyzed to illustrate the distribution of the water content both isothermal liquid flux and thermal vapor flux dominates the variation of water content by determining the location of the evaporation front and analyzing its dynamic variation we found that the evaporation front ranged from the surface to a depth of 2 5 cm under a shallow water table for a deep water table the evaporation front was nearly at a constant depth of 15 cm keywords vadose zone evaporation front water table liquid water and vapor flow data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in arid and semi arid regions evaporation is the main factor of water movement and energy exchange in the shallow subsurface van de griend and owe 1994 bittelli et al 2008 novak 2010 smits et al 2011 in the vadose zone the depth of the water table has a significant effect on evaporation many experimental and numerical studies illustrated the dependency of evaporation on water table depth gardner and fireman 1958 sadeghi et al 2012 han et al 2014 shokri kuehni et al 2020 changes to water table depth usually leads to different evaporation processes shokri and salvucci 2011 assouline et al 2013 kamai and assouline 2018 zhang et al 2018 when the water table is shallow the evaporative demand is supplied by liquid water flow from the water table and vaporization takes place at the surface while for a deep water table liquid water flow cannot reach the surface and vaporization takes place at the evaporation front milly 1986 zarei and homaee 2019 shokri kuehni et al 2020 an evaporation front is known as a plane where phase transformation occurs and it is a liquid vapor discontinuity plane between the soil surface and the water table rose et al 2005 gowing et al 2006 menenti 1984 defined the evaporation front based on moisture diffusivity when soil moisture decreases liquid diffusivity decreases which in turn causes vapor diffusivity to increase once the water content decreases to a certain value the moisture diffusivity will have a local minimum value and the location of the evaporation front is where the water content reaches the certain value when evaporative demand is greater than the ability of the soil to conduct liquid water an evaporation front is formed above the evaporation front water vapor flow is the dominant form of water movement and less liquid water flow exists below the evaporation front liquid water flow contributes more to the change of soil moisture although water vapor flow exists in this area rose et al 2005 il ichev and shargatov 2013 shargatov et al 2015 the position of the evaporation front can reflect how evaporation progresses in the subsurface and the evaporation front has three stages during the progression of evaporation when the soil is sufficiently moist the evaporation front is at the surface and the evaporation occurs at the surface as evaporation progresses the water content near the surface decreases and water supplied from the lower part of the vadose zone through capillary rise cannot meet the evaporative demand thus causing the evaporation front to progressively move downward during the last stage evaporation is equal to the capillary water contribution and the depth of the evaporation front remains constant rose et al 2005 the position of the evaporation is often determined by the water content of soil based on its definition rose 1963 menenti 1984 bastiaanssen et al 1989 konukcu et al 2004 however the movement of liquid water and water vapor on both sides of the evaporation front has not been well analyzed based on the theory of moisture movement in the vadose zone which will not account for the accuracy of determining the position of the evaporation front by water content in addition the variation of the evaporation front occurs above the water table in the vadose zone which is variably saturated thus the study of evaporation fronts requires consideration for the coupled transport of liquid water water vapor and heat richard s equation is used to describe variably saturated water flow in porous media but it only considers liquid water flow driven by the total hydraulic head gradient philip and de vries 1957 provided a mathematical model pdv model to describe the coupled transport of liquid water and water vapor driven by both pressure head and temperature gradients based on the pdv model many experimental and numerical studies were conducted to study the coupled transport of liquid water water vapor and heat in the vadose zone under various boundary conditions grifoll et al 2005 saito et al 2006 simunek and van genuchten 2008 sakai et al 2009 gran et al 2011 wang and zheng 2017 wen et al 2020 lai et al 2021 for example nassar and horton 1992 improved the pdv model by considering the effect of osmotic potential gradient on the coupled transport of water heat and solute in soils simunek et al 1998 developed a hydrus 1d code to simulate the movement of water heat and multiple solutes in the vadose zone which has been widely used successfully in many studies pang and simunek 2006 saito et al 2006 simunek et al 2008 deb et al 2011 zeng et al 2011 provided a two phase heat and mass flow model to describe the dependence of evaporation on soil air pressure gradient and advective effect on evaporation smits et al 2011 developed a theory for water vapor flow under varying temperature gradients that allowed for nonequilibrium liquid and gas phase change with gas phase vapor diffusion however these studies did not focus on the coupled influence of various boundary conditions on the movement of liquid water water vapor and heat the boundary effects such as evaporation and variation of water table have a great influence on the transport of liquid water water vapor and heat in the vadose zone therefore studies on coupled transport of liquid water water vapor and heat which consider the influence of evaporation under various water tables are needed in this study a laboratory experimental apparatus is designed to conduct evaporation experiments of soil under shallow and deep water table conditions which can study the coupled transport of liquid water water vapor and heat in the vadose zone under joint influence of evaporation and water table soil moisture temperature and atmospheric data were continuously observed and recorded during the experiment a numerical model was used to simulate the coupled transport of liquid water water vapor and heat which considered the influence of evaporation and various water table elevations in the vadose zone the numerical model was tested with measured volumetric water content and temperature data moreover liquid water and water vapor fluxes on both sides of the evaporation front were calculated to calibrate the position of evaporation front determined by water content the objectives of this study are 1 to develop a laboratory experimental apparatus that can dynamically adjust the water table to conduct evaporation experiments of soil in the vadose zone under shallow and deep water table conditions 2 to analyze water and heat transport in the vadose zone by variation of liquid water and water vapor due to pressure head and temperature gradients 3 to locate the evaporation front and describe its variation during the evaporation progression and 4 to investigate the different evaporation mechanisms under shallow and deep water table conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials silica sand xiamen iso standard sand corp xiamen china was sieved

campbell scientific for data storage an infrared lamp 275 w hung over the soil column supplied heat for water evaporation rubber and plastic insulation materials were wrapped around the outer side of the column to minimize heat exchange between the column and the ambient environment as well as to provide approximately a one dimensional temperature distribution within the sand a lifting system with two reservoirs was used to control the water table within the soil column a manometer was set at the bottom of the column to observe the water table 2 3 experimental approach two evaporation experiments under shallow and deep water table configurations were conducted in this study for the two experiments the water table elevation was fixed at a depth of 55 cm and 85 cm below the sand surface prior to the experiment the top of the column was covered with a plastic wrap to prevent evaporation the sand was initially saturated from the bottom to the top of the column through a water supply system and then drained to a maintain water table at an elevation of 55 cm a fixed water table elevation in the sand column was maintained by a reservoir on the lifting system via a piezometric pump model bt100 3 j longer pump through a water supply system when the water content in the sand reached steady state a stable variably saturated zone in the sand above the water table was formed at the start of the experiment the plastic wrap was removed from the column and the infrared lamp was turned on to induce evaporation throughout the experiment air temperature and relative humidity near the soil surface were continuously monitored shown in fig 4 air flow above the column was considered to be stagnant and the ambient temperature was maintained at a constant air temperature of 25 in the laboratory water content and temperature were continuously monitored every 15 min the experiment with a shallow water table lasted 144 h until both water content and temperature reached approximately constant values fig 4 upon completion of the first experiment the column was saturated again from the bottom and then drained to reach an equilibrium with a water table elevation maintained at a depth of 85 cm measured from the top of the sand for the second experiment the above experimental and data acquisition procedures were repeated lasting over a period of 20 h when both water content and temperature data remained constant in the column fig 4 2 4 numerical model 2 4 1 liquid water and water vapor flow the governing equation for one dimensional liquid water and water

time step is 0 01 h the maximum time step is 1 h and the minimum time step is 0 0001 h the simulation time is 144 h and 20 h under shallow and deep water table cases respectively the sand profile was divided into 550 and 850 finite elements under shallow water table and deep water table conditions respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal variation of soil water content and temperature profiles fig 6 presents the simulated and observed soil water profiles during the experiments under shallow and deep water table conditions the water content of the sand below the surface reveals a non monotonic decline during the experiment under the presence of a shallow water table the degree of water content reduction decreases with depth which is 0 012 0 013 0 0134 at depths of 5 cm 15 cm and 25 cm respectively the reduction rate of the soil water content above the depth of 25 cm is more than 5 and between 0 4 88 below the depth of 35 cm the reduction rate obviously decreases with depth for a deep water table the water content of the sand decreases obviously at the top 5 cm between the depth of 5 cm and 15 cm the decrease of water content is minimal in contrast the water content of sand shows a significant decrease at a depth range of 25 55 cm the reduction of water content begins to increase at 25 cm and the maximum reduction occurs at about 45 cm comparing the two profiles the variation of water content at a depth ranging from 25 45 cm under a deep water table is similar to the profile below the surface under a shallow water table the water content decreases significantly during the experiments at a depth ranging from 0 45 cm under a shallow water table and 25 45 cm under a deep water table fig 7 shows the observed and simulated temperature profiles during the experiment under shallow and deep water table conditions the temperature profiles exhibit nonlinear distribution within the sand due to the difference between the thermal properties caused by water redistribution at different depths prunty and horton 1994 another reason for the nonlinear distribution is heat loss which is mainly caused by the phase transition of liquid water into water vapor smits et al 2011 at the beginning of the experiment evaporation at the soil surface occurs at a very fast rate and causes a sharp rise in temperature this heat loss is considered as the transfer of latent heat in the numerical model the latent heat fluxes are high when evaporation commences and results in a high temperature gradient as the water content decreases the latent heat fluxes become smaller which is shown in the profiles as the temperature gradient decreases with time and the temperature profile approaches a linear distribution comparing these two profiles soil temperature increases rapidly near the surface when evaporation occurs the temperature increment at the surface is 13 62 k and 19 17 k under shallow and deep water table conditions respectively the lower increment under a shallow water table is due to the higher water content because of the shallow water table the temperature in the soil reaches a nearly constant state at the end of the experiment 3 2 liquid water and water vapor fluxes temporal variation of four water and vapor flux components are calculated based on the numerical model and depicted in fig 8 the variations of four water and vapor flux components are closely associated with the variation of water content at different depths of the sand and demonstrate how the water content distribution is formed water and vapor fluxes of four different depths from the surface are described in more detail in the following sections 3 2 1 shallow water table condition in fig 8a d under a shallow water table the isothermal liquid water flux q lh is always in the upward direction which is a positive value indicating that soil above the water table continued to evaporate during the experiment water loss because of evaporation at the upper layer causes a decrease in water content and the matric potential liquid water from the water table moves upward due to the matric potential gradient and provides moisture for evaporation fig 8a d show that q lh at the surface reaches a peak of q lh 0 02722 c m h within the first two hours then decreases rapidly and maintains at a low value of approximately 0 00125 cm h until the end of the experiment in fig 8a the rapid increase of q lh is mainly caused by a rapid increase in matric potential at the sand surface which is caused by water loss due to evaporation fig 8 shows the rapid increase in q lh results in an increase in q vt in the opposite direction liquid water converts into water vapor and vapor moves downward because of the negative temperature gradient the q vh is closely associated with the evaporation rate and the sum of q vh and q lh constitutes the water loss caused by evaporation in fig 8 because of the strong evaporation taking place at the sand surface water content decreases rapidly and a large upward matric potential gradient is generated which causes an obvious peak of isothermal vapor flux q vh in the first two hours at this stage the water content at the surface decreases rapidly to the residual water content fig 6 most of the liquid water converts to water vapor at the surface a part of vapor moves downward as a thermal vapor flux q vt under a temperature gradient but the net vapor flux is upward because of a large upward isothermal vapor flux q vh which serves as a source of water for evaporation from the surface to the atmosphere fig 8 shows the isothermal water vapor flux q vh has a significant value only at the soil surface fig 8a while the flux is close to zero at other soil depths fig 8b d in fig 8b d at depths of 15 cm 25 cm and 35 cm the thermal vapor flux q vt increases during the early stage of the experiment and approaches a constant value as the experiment progresses in fig 8d the thermal vapor flux q vt decreases with depth and it is nearly zero at depth of 35 cm between the depth of 5 cm and 35 cm the isothermal liquid water flux q lh is the main flux which illustrates that the liquid water flow is the major component of water content change under a shallow water table in fig 8a d the obvious upward isothermal liquid water flux q lh and a downward thermal vapor flux q vt indicates that the soil above the water table is in a state of continuous evaporation during the experiment fig 8a d show that the thermal liquid water flux q lt is close to zero throughout the entire sand profile this flux is always negligible during the experiment because the effect of temperature on the movement of liquid water is insignificant 3 2 2 deep water table condition the temporal variation of water fluxes under a deep water table is different from that under a shallow water table for example fig 8e h shows that the isothermal liquid water flux q lh does not have a such steep peak at the soil surface as the shallow water table case fig 8a d due to the smaller water content at the soil surface in fig 8e it increases first and then decreases slowly to a constant value fig 8e h show that the vapor flux through the sand consists of downward thermal vapor flux q vt and upward isothermal vapor flux q vh and the net flux is upward in fig 8f upward isothermal liquid water flux q lh and downward thermal vapor flux q vt show a similar value at a depth of 15 cm which results in a nearly zero net water flux the zero net water flux causes a subtle change in water content this variation is consistent with the variation in water content in fig 6 fig 8e h show the thermal vapor flux q vt profile is similar to the one for the shallow water table case which decreases with depth but the value of flux is larger compared to the shallow water table case this shows that vapor plays an equally important role in affecting the water content change as the liquid flow when the moisture of the soil is at a drier state above the depth of 25 cm which is different compared to the shallow water table case fig 8e h also show that the thermal liquid water flux q lt is also close to zero during the experiment while the isothermal vapor flux q vh is only obvious at the near surface area fig 8e 3 3 location and variation of the evaporation front the location of the evaporation front is often determined by the water content Œ∏ e of the sand based on experimental and theoretical studies the Œ∏ e is 0 05 for fine sand menenti 1984 bastiaanssen et al 1989 konukcu et al 2004 the region between the evaporation front and where vapor occurs is often considered as the transition zone and the water content of this transition zone has been found to be in the range of 0 05 0 14 konukcu et al 2004 in this study the location of the evaporation front is determined by the distribution of water content calculated by the numerical model fig 9 shows the variation of evaporation front under shallow and deep water table conditions the variation of the evaporation front with time shown on fig 9a reveals a typical progression of the evaporation front for a shallow water table case and the progression can be divided into three stages during the first stages the evaporation front is at the surface of the soil at the beginning of the experiment and evaporation occurs at the soil surface and the moisture in the soil is sufficient for evaporation during the second stage the evaporation front moves downwards in the soil because the evaporation demand is greater than upward flow from the water table and the upper soil becomes very dry as the depth of evaporation front increases progressively when the evaporation front reaches the third stage it remains nearly at a constant depth of 2 5 cm as the evaporation demand is equal to groundwater contribution in contrast the variation of the evaporation front does not exhibit the three stages for the deep water table case fig 9b because of the low water content at the upper portion of the soil column the connectivity of liquid water is limited which results in a deeper evaporation front between the soil surface and water table at the beginning of the experiment based on the definition of the evaporation front liquid water flux is equal to water vapor flux which corresponds to the calculated fluxes in fig 8e h this shows that it is feasible to determine the position of the evaporation front according to water content the location of the evaporation front for a shallow water table ranges from 0 to 2 5 cm during the experiment which shows that the connectivity between soil surface and water table is good thus liquid water can supply water continuously which contributes to evaporation however the movement of vapor contributes to water movement at the top part of the sand column for the deep water table case because of its larger depth the water content of the transition zone ranges from 0 05 to 0 14 from the water content profiles in fig 6 the lower boundary of the transition zone under shallow and deep water table is 25 cm and 55 cm respectively temporal thermal vapor fluxes are calculated by the numerical model to analyze the variation of q vt at both sides of the transition zone interface fig 10 shows the profiles of the thermal vapor fluxes under shallow and deep water table conditions the variation of thermal vapor fluxes q vt is similar under both shallow and deep water table conditions specifically thermal vapor flux q vt decreases with depth and the depth of where q vt occurs increases with time in fig 10 the deepest locations where q vt occur are 25 cm and 55 cm under shallow and deep water table conditions respectively the deepest locations correspond to the lower boundaries of the transition zone which is determined by water content the thermal vapor flux q vt under a deep water table is larger compared to a shallow water table above 15 cm which indicates that vapor movement is stronger in drier soil and contributes more to moisture movement the thermal vapor flux q vt increases first then decreases within the top 10 cm region under both shallow and deep water table conditions this is because the temperature gradient in this region increases at the beginning of the experiment and then decreases as time progresses above the evaporation front there is a region where the water content is equal to the residual water content the interface of this region is defined as drying front menenti 1984 the drying front is another interface associated with evaporation almost all the liquid water converts to the water vapor at the drying front the isothermal vapor flux q vh is always negligible in the water movement because the influence of matric potential on water vapor is extremely small however when the matric potential gradient is extremely large when the water content varies near the residual water content the value of isothermal vapor fluxes will be in the same order of other fluxes components and cannot be neglected based on this feature the location of the drying front can be determined by the isothermal vapor flux q vh fig 11 shows the profiles of isothermal vapor flux under shallow and deep water table conditions the isothermal vapor flux is only evident at the top 0 3 cm during the experiment which shows that the drying front is very near the sand column surface and almost unchanged during the experiment 4 summary and conclusions evaporation in vadose zone under shallow and deep water table conditions was investigated in this study using laboratory experimental and numerical analyses the simulated results are in good agreement with experimental results the results show the dependency of evaporation on water table depths the distribution of water content variation of liquid water and water vapor flux and the location of evaporation fronts vary under shallow and deep water table conditions under a shallow water table water content above the water table continued to decrease and did not reach a minimum value during the experiment when the water table was deeper a very low water content area existed below the surface and water content of the soil below this region decreased with time for the shallow water table isothermal vapor flux which served as the main flux for evaporation has a steep peak at the top of the column at the beginning of experiment isothermal liquid water flux dominates the change of water content below the top of the column thermal vapor flux increases sequentially from top to bottom with time when the water table is deeper isothermal vapor flux does not have a steep peak during the experiment which increases first and then decreases to an almost constant value at the depth of 5 25 cm both isothermal liquid flux and thermal vapor flux dominates the change in water content the variation of thermal vapor flux is same as that in shallow water table case the position and variation of evaporation front were different under shallow and deep water table cases for a shallow water table the position of evaporation front moved downwards from the soil surface to the lower portion and remains nearly at a constant depth of 2 5 cm during the experiment for a deep water table the evaporation front is at the depth of 15 cm at the beginning and stays unchanged during the experiment the isothermal vapor fluxes are used to determine the location of drying front and the drying front is at the top 0 3 cm under two water table cases declaration of competing interest the authors declare

1738,in arid and semi arid regions the depth of water table has a significant effect on evaporation the soil in these regions is unsaturated and the transport of liquid water and water vapor is accompanied by variation of the water table depth in this study we designed a laboratory experimental apparatus to conduct evaporation experiments of soil under shallow and deep water table conditions through continuous monitoring of water content and temperature variation in the vadose zone a numerical model was used to simulate the coupled transport of liquid water water vapor and heat in the vadose zone under two different water table elevations the experimental and numerical results were in good agreement liquid water and water vapor fluxes driven by pressure head and temperature gradient were calculated and analyzed to illustrate the distribution of the water content both isothermal liquid flux and thermal vapor flux dominates the variation of water content by determining the location of the evaporation front and analyzing its dynamic variation we found that the evaporation front ranged from the surface to a depth of 2 5 cm under a shallow water table for a deep water table the evaporation front was nearly at a constant depth of 15 cm keywords vadose zone evaporation front water table liquid water and vapor flow data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in arid and semi arid regions evaporation is the main factor of water movement and energy exchange in the shallow subsurface van de griend and owe 1994 bittelli et al 2008 novak 2010 smits et al 2011 in the vadose zone the depth of the water table has a significant effect on evaporation many experimental and numerical studies illustrated the dependency of evaporation on water table depth gardner and fireman 1958 sadeghi et al 2012 han et al 2014 shokri kuehni et al 2020 changes to water table depth usually leads to different evaporation processes shokri and salvucci 2011 assouline et al 2013 kamai and assouline 2018 zhang et al 2018 when the water table is shallow the evaporative demand is supplied by liquid water flow from the water table and vaporization takes place at the surface while for a deep water table liquid water flow cannot reach the surface and vaporization takes place at the evaporation front milly 1986 zarei and homaee 2019 shokri kuehni et al 2020 an evaporation front is known as a plane where phase transformation occurs and it is a liquid vapor discontinuity plane between the soil surface and the water table rose et al 2005 gowing et al 2006 menenti 1984 defined the evaporation front based on moisture diffusivity when soil moisture decreases liquid diffusivity decreases which in turn causes vapor diffusivity to increase once the water content decreases to a certain value the moisture diffusivity will have a local minimum value and the location of the evaporation front is where the water content reaches the certain value when evaporative demand is greater than the ability of the soil to conduct liquid water an evaporation front is formed above the evaporation front water vapor flow is the dominant form of water movement and less liquid water flow exists below the evaporation front liquid water flow contributes more to the change of soil moisture although water vapor flow exists in this area rose et al 2005 il ichev and shargatov 2013 shargatov et al 2015 the position of the evaporation front can reflect how evaporation progresses in the subsurface and the evaporation front has three stages during the progression of evaporation when the soil is sufficiently moist the evaporation front is at the surface and the evaporation occurs at the surface as evaporation progresses the water content near the surface decreases and water supplied from the lower part of the vadose zone through capillary rise cannot meet the evaporative demand thus causing the evaporation front to progressively move downward during the last stage evaporation is equal to the capillary water contribution and the depth of the evaporation front remains constant rose et al 2005 the position of the evaporation is often determined by the water content of soil based on its definition rose 1963 menenti 1984 bastiaanssen et al 1989 konukcu et al 2004 however the movement of liquid water and water vapor on both sides of the evaporation front has not been well analyzed based on the theory of moisture movement in the vadose zone which will not account for the accuracy of determining the position of the evaporation front by water content in addition the variation of the evaporation front occurs above the water table in the vadose zone which is variably saturated thus the study of evaporation fronts requires consideration for the coupled transport of liquid water water vapor and heat richard s equation is used to describe variably saturated water flow in porous media but it only considers liquid water flow driven by the total hydraulic head gradient philip and de vries 1957 provided a mathematical model pdv model to describe the coupled transport of liquid water and water vapor driven by both pressure head and temperature gradients based on the pdv model many experimental and numerical studies were conducted to study the coupled transport of liquid water water vapor and heat in the vadose zone under various boundary conditions grifoll et al 2005 saito et al 2006 simunek and van genuchten 2008 sakai et al 2009 gran et al 2011 wang and zheng 2017 wen et al 2020 lai et al 2021 for example nassar and horton 1992 improved the pdv model by considering the effect of osmotic potential gradient on the coupled transport of water heat and solute in soils simunek et al 1998 developed a hydrus 1d code to simulate the movement of water heat and multiple solutes in the vadose zone which has been widely used successfully in many studies pang and simunek 2006 saito et al 2006 simunek et al 2008 deb et al 2011 zeng et al 2011 provided a two phase heat and mass flow model to describe the dependence of evaporation on soil air pressure gradient and advective effect on evaporation smits et al 2011 developed a theory for water vapor flow under varying temperature gradients that allowed for nonequilibrium liquid and gas phase change with gas phase vapor diffusion however these studies did not focus on the coupled influence of various boundary conditions on the movement of liquid water water vapor and heat the boundary effects such as evaporation and variation of water table have a great influence on the transport of liquid water water vapor and heat in the vadose zone therefore studies on coupled transport of liquid water water vapor and heat which consider the influence of evaporation under various water tables are needed in this study a laboratory experimental apparatus is designed to conduct evaporation experiments of soil under shallow and deep water table conditions which can study the coupled transport of liquid water water vapor and heat in the vadose zone under joint influence of evaporation and water table soil moisture temperature and atmospheric data were continuously observed and recorded during the experiment a numerical model was used to simulate the coupled transport of liquid water water vapor and heat which considered the influence of evaporation and various water table elevations in the vadose zone the numerical model was tested with measured volumetric water content and temperature data moreover liquid water and water vapor fluxes on both sides of the evaporation front were calculated to calibrate the position of evaporation front determined by water content the objectives of this study are 1 to develop a laboratory experimental apparatus that can dynamically adjust the water table to conduct evaporation experiments of soil in the vadose zone under shallow and deep water table conditions 2 to analyze water and heat transport in the vadose zone by variation of liquid water and water vapor due to pressure head and temperature gradients 3 to locate the evaporation front and describe its variation during the evaporation progression and 4 to investigate the different evaporation mechanisms under shallow and deep water table conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials silica sand xiamen iso standard sand corp xiamen china was sieved

campbell scientific for data storage an infrared lamp 275 w hung over the soil column supplied heat for water evaporation rubber and plastic insulation materials were wrapped around the outer side of the column to minimize heat exchange between the column and the ambient environment as well as to provide approximately a one dimensional temperature distribution within the sand a lifting system with two reservoirs was used to control the water table within the soil column a manometer was set at the bottom of the column to observe the water table 2 3 experimental approach two evaporation experiments under shallow and deep water table configurations were conducted in this study for the two experiments the water table elevation was fixed at a depth of 55 cm and 85 cm below the sand surface prior to the experiment the top of the column was covered with a plastic wrap to prevent evaporation the sand was initially saturated from the bottom to the top of the column through a water supply system and then drained to a maintain water table at an elevation of 55 cm a fixed water table elevation in the sand column was maintained by a reservoir on the lifting system via a piezometric pump model bt100 3 j longer pump through a water supply system when the water content in the sand reached steady state a stable variably saturated zone in the sand above the water table was formed at the start of the experiment the plastic wrap was removed from the column and the infrared lamp was turned on to induce evaporation throughout the experiment air temperature and relative humidity near the soil surface were continuously monitored shown in fig 4 air flow above the column was considered to be stagnant and the ambient temperature was maintained at a constant air temperature of 25 in the laboratory water content and temperature were continuously monitored every 15 min the experiment with a shallow water table lasted 144 h until both water content and temperature reached approximately constant values fig 4 upon completion of the first experiment the column was saturated again from the bottom and then drained to reach an equilibrium with a water table elevation maintained at a depth of 85 cm measured from the top of the sand for the second experiment the above experimental and data acquisition procedures were repeated lasting over a period of 20 h when both water content and temperature data remained constant in the column fig 4 2 4 numerical model 2 4 1 liquid water and water vapor flow the governing equation for one dimensional liquid water and water

divided into 550 and 850 finite elements under shallow water table and deep water table conditions respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal variation of soil water content and temperature profiles fig 6 presents the simulated and observed soil water profiles during the experiments under shallow and deep water table conditions the water content of the sand below the surface reveals a non monotonic decline during the experiment under the presence of a shallow water table the degree of water content reduction decreases with depth which is 0 012 0 013 0 0134 at depths of 5 cm 15 cm and 25 cm respectively the reduction rate of the soil water content above the depth of 25 cm is more than 5 and between 0 4 88 below the depth of 35 cm the reduction rate obviously decreases with depth for a deep water table the water content of the sand decreases obviously at the top 5 cm between the depth of 5 cm and 15 cm the decrease of water content is minimal in contrast the water content of sand shows a significant decrease at a depth range of 25 55 cm the reduction of water content begins to increase at 25 cm and the maximum reduction occurs at about 45 cm comparing the two profiles the variation of water content at a depth ranging from 25 45 cm under a deep water table is similar to the profile below the surface under a shallow water table the water content decreases significantly during the experiments at a depth ranging from 0 45 cm under a shallow water table and 25 45 cm under a deep water table fig 7 shows the observed and simulated temperature profiles during the experiment under shallow and deep water table conditions the temperature profiles exhibit nonlinear distribution within the sand due to the difference between the thermal properties caused by water redistribution at different depths prunty and horton 1994 another reason for the nonlinear distribution is heat loss which is mainly caused by the phase transition of liquid water into water vapor smits et al 2011 at the beginning of the experiment evaporation at the soil surface occurs at a very fast rate and causes a sharp rise in temperature this heat loss is considered as the transfer of latent heat in the numerical model the latent heat fluxes are high when evaporation commences and results in a high temperature gradient as the water content decreases the latent heat fluxes become smaller which is shown in the profiles as the temperature gradient decreases with time and the temperature profile approaches a linear distribution comparing these two profiles soil temperature increases rapidly near the surface when evaporation occurs the temperature increment at the surface is 13 62 k and 19 17 k under shallow and deep water table conditions respectively the lower increment under a shallow water table is due to the higher water content because of the shallow water table the temperature in the soil reaches a nearly constant state at the end of the experiment 3 2 liquid water and water vapor fluxes temporal variation of four water and vapor flux components are calculated based on the numerical model and depicted in fig 8 the variations of four water and vapor flux components are closely associated with the variation of water content at different depths of the sand and demonstrate how the water content distribution is formed water and vapor fluxes of four different depths from the surface are described in more detail in the following sections 3 2 1 shallow water table condition in fig 8a d under a shallow water table the isothermal liquid water flux q lh is always in the upward direction which is a positive value indicating that soil above the water table continued to evaporate during the experiment water loss because of evaporation at the upper layer causes a decrease in water content and the matric potential liquid water from the water table moves upward due to the matric potential gradient and provides moisture for evaporation fig 8a d show that q lh at the surface reaches a peak of q lh 0 02722 c m h within the first two hours then decreases rapidly and maintains at a low value of approximately 0 00125 cm h until the end of the experiment in fig 8a the rapid increase of q lh is mainly caused by a rapid increase in matric potential at the sand surface which is caused by water loss due to evaporation fig 8 shows the rapid increase in q lh results in an increase in q vt in the opposite direction liquid water converts into water vapor and vapor moves downward because of the negative temperature gradient the q vh is closely associated with the evaporation rate and the sum of q vh and q lh constitutes the water loss caused by evaporation in fig 8 because of the strong evaporation taking place at the sand surface water content decreases rapidly and a large upward matric potential gradient is generated which causes an obvious peak of isothermal vapor flux q vh in the first two hours at this stage the water content at the surface decreases rapidly to the residual water content fig 6 most of the liquid water converts to water vapor at the surface a part of vapor moves downward as a thermal vapor flux q vt under a temperature gradient but the net vapor flux is upward because of a large upward isothermal vapor flux q vh which serves as a source of water for evaporation from the surface to the atmosphere fig 8 shows the isothermal water vapor flux q vh has a significant value only at the soil surface fig 8a while the flux is close to zero at other soil depths fig 8b d in fig 8b d at depths of 15 cm 25 cm and 35 cm the thermal vapor flux q vt increases during the early stage of the experiment and approaches a constant value as the experiment progresses in fig 8d the thermal vapor flux q vt decreases with depth and it is nearly zero at depth of 35 cm between the depth of 5 cm and 35 cm the isothermal liquid water flux q lh is the main flux which illustrates that the liquid water flow is the major component of water content change under a shallow water table in fig 8a d the obvious upward isothermal liquid water flux q lh and a downward thermal vapor flux q vt indicates that the soil above the water table is in a state of continuous evaporation during the experiment fig 8a d show that the thermal liquid water flux q lt is close to zero throughout the entire sand profile this flux is always negligible during the experiment because the effect of temperature on the movement of liquid water is insignificant 3 2 2 deep water table condition the temporal variation of water fluxes under a deep water table is different from that under a shallow water table for example fig 8e h shows that the isothermal liquid water flux q lh does not have a such steep peak at the soil surface as the shallow water table case fig 8a d due to the smaller water content at the soil surface in fig 8e it increases first and then decreases slowly to a constant value fig 8e h show that the vapor flux through the sand consists of downward thermal vapor flux q vt and upward isothermal vapor flux q vh and the net flux is upward in fig 8f upward isothermal liquid water flux q lh and downward thermal vapor flux q vt show a similar value at a depth of 15 cm which results in a nearly zero net water flux the zero net water flux causes a subtle change in water content this variation is consistent with the variation in water content in fig 6 fig 8e h show the thermal vapor flux q vt profile is similar to the one for the shallow water table case which decreases with depth but the value of flux is larger compared to the shallow water table case this shows that vapor plays an equally important role in affecting the water content change as the liquid flow when the moisture of the soil is at a drier state above the depth of 25 cm which is different compared to the shallow water table case fig 8e h also show that the thermal liquid water flux q lt is also close to zero during the experiment while the isothermal vapor flux q vh is only obvious at the near surface area fig 8e 3 3 location and variation of the evaporation front the location of the evaporation front is often determined by the water content Œ∏ e of the sand based on experimental and theoretical studies the Œ∏ e is 0 05 for fine sand menenti 1984 bastiaanssen et al 1989 konukcu et al 2004 the region between the evaporation front and where vapor occurs is often considered as the transition zone and the water content of this transition zone has been found to be in the range of 0 05 0 14 konukcu et al 2004 in this study the location of the evaporation front is determined by the distribution of water content calculated by the numerical model fig 9 shows the variation of evaporation front under shallow and deep water table conditions the variation of the evaporation front with time shown on fig 9a reveals a typical progression of the evaporation front for a shallow water table case and the progression can be divided into three stages during the first stages the evaporation front is at the surface of the soil at the beginning of the experiment and evaporation occurs at the soil surface and the moisture in the soil is sufficient for evaporation during the second stage the evaporation front moves downwards in the soil because the evaporation demand is greater than upward flow from the water table and the upper soil becomes very dry as the depth of evaporation front increases progressively when the evaporation front reaches the third stage it remains nearly at a constant depth of 2 5 cm as the evaporation demand is equal to groundwater contribution in contrast the variation of the evaporation front does not exhibit the three stages for the deep water table case fig 9b because of the low water content at the upper portion of the soil column the connectivity of liquid water is limited which results in a deeper evaporation front between the soil surface and water table at the beginning of the experiment based on the definition of the evaporation front liquid water flux is equal to water vapor flux which corresponds to the calculated fluxes in fig 8e h this shows that it is feasible to determine the position of the evaporation front according to water content the location of the evaporation front for a shallow water table ranges from 0 to 2 5 cm during the experiment which shows that the connectivity between soil surface and water table is good thus liquid water can supply water continuously which contributes to evaporation however the movement of vapor contributes to water movement at the top part of the sand column for the deep water table case because of its larger depth the water content of the transition zone ranges from 0 05 to 0 14 from the water content profiles in fig 6 the lower boundary of the transition zone under shallow and deep water table is 25 cm and 55 cm respectively temporal thermal vapor fluxes are calculated by the numerical model to analyze the variation of q vt at both sides of the transition zone interface fig 10 shows the profiles of the thermal vapor fluxes under shallow and deep water table conditions the variation of thermal vapor fluxes q vt is similar under both shallow and deep water table conditions specifically thermal vapor flux q vt decreases with depth and the depth of where q vt occurs increases with time in fig 10 the deepest locations where q vt occur are 25 cm and 55 cm under shallow and deep water table conditions respectively the deepest locations correspond to the lower boundaries of the transition zone which is determined by water content the thermal vapor flux q vt under a deep water table is larger compared to a shallow water table above 15 cm which indicates that vapor movement is stronger in drier soil and contributes more to moisture movement the thermal vapor flux q vt increases first then decreases within the top 10 cm region under both shallow and deep water table conditions this is because the temperature gradient in this region increases at the beginning of the experiment and then decreases as time progresses above the evaporation front there is a region where the water content is equal to the residual water content the interface of this region is defined as drying front menenti 1984 the drying front is another interface associated with evaporation almost all the liquid water converts to the water vapor at the drying front the isothermal vapor flux q vh is always negligible in the water movement because the influence of matric potential on water vapor is extremely small however when the matric potential gradient is extremely large when the water content varies near the residual water content the value of isothermal vapor fluxes will be in the same order of other fluxes components and cannot be neglected based on this feature the location of the drying front can be determined by the isothermal vapor flux q vh fig 11 shows the profiles of isothermal vapor flux under shallow and deep water table conditions the isothermal vapor flux is only evident at the top 0 3 cm during the experiment which shows that the drying front is very near the sand column surface and almost unchanged during the experiment 4 summary and conclusions evaporation in vadose zone under shallow and deep water table conditions was investigated in this study using laboratory experimental and numerical analyses the simulated results are in good agreement with experimental results the results show the dependency of evaporation on water table depths the distribution of water content variation of liquid water and water vapor flux and the location of evaporation fronts vary under shallow and deep water table conditions under a shallow water table water content above the water table continued to decrease and did not reach a minimum value during the experiment when the water table was deeper a very low water content area existed below the surface and water content of the soil below this region decreased with time for the shallow water table isothermal vapor flux which served as the main flux for evaporation has a steep peak at the top of the column at the beginning of experiment isothermal liquid water flux dominates the change of water content below the top of the column thermal vapor flux increases sequentially from top to bottom with time when the water table is deeper isothermal vapor flux does not have a steep peak during the experiment which increases first and then decreases to an almost constant value at the depth of 5 25 cm both isothermal liquid flux and thermal vapor flux dominates the change in water content the variation of thermal vapor flux is same as that in shallow water table case the position and variation of evaporation front were different under shallow and deep water table cases for a shallow water table the position of evaporation front moved downwards from the soil surface to the lower portion and remains nearly at a constant depth of 2 5 cm during the experiment for a deep water table the evaporation front is at the depth of 15 cm at the beginning and stays unchanged during the experiment the isothermal vapor fluxes are used to determine the location of drying front and the drying front is at the top 0 3 cm under two water table cases declaration of competing interest the authors declare

1739,understanding the hydrology of large catchments has always been a major challenge due to the spatial heterogeneity of climate geology topography soils and land use however precise knowledge of water cycling storage and losses across large scale catchments is required to sustainably meet growing water demands and adjust water management strategies this study used four large scale seasonal synoptic surveys in 2021 to characterize the spatio temporal patterns of water isotopes stable water isotopes and radioisotope tritium at natural abundance to better understand the complex hydrology of the intensively managed 10 000 km2 catchment of the river spree in germany apart from the upper headwaters the hydrology of the spree is heavily regulated by reservoir releases pumped minewater discharges extensive wetlands and lakes water abstractions and urban drainage moreover the catchment is drought sensitive with potential evapotranspiration 800 mm a year often exceeding annual rainfall 600 mm this is reflected in the isotopic composition of river water in the steeper upper headwaters the river has a flashy rainfall runoff response with isotopes plotting close to the global meteoric water line gmwl consistent with dominant groundwater sources but showing more influence by rainfall in winter however flows in the midstream parts are complex due to artificially enhanced baseflows and attenuated high flows from extensive reservoir releases and pumped groundwater releases from dewatering of mines the reservoir waters are isotopically heavier and reflect the effects of open water evaporation fractionation effects strengthen downstream as managed wetland areas in the spreewald and natural lakes further enhance evaporation and attenuate flows water abstractions for drinking water and to sustain the oder spree canal reduce flows further in berlin sources of urban runoff and waste water discharges reduce the effects of fractionation though samples still plot below the meteoric water line seasonally the effects of evaporation in the lower river network are strongest in summer and autumn though they remain in winter and spring indicating a large memory effect due to long mean travel times within the river system tritium variability along the river reflects inputs of younger and older water in different parts of the river system though the influence of pumped groundwater means that the mean age of stream water i e time elapsed since rainfall in the lower river is likely to be 50 years climate change together with increased population and economic growth in berlin is likely to increase pressures on the spree system in future in the coming years the anticipated termination of the lignite mining will lead to a reduction in artificial inputs into surface water which in turn may exacerbate water stress we demonstrated that longer term synoptic isotope studies are valuable in better understanding the hydrology of such complex large scale heavily modified river systems in terms of insights into water sources and mixing processes thus providing an evidence base for more sustainable management in the future keywords catchment hydrology stable isotopes water balance water sources tracer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water stable isotopes Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h are ideal natural tracers for understanding the

tracing the flow paths that generate streamflow is important to correctly determine how this relates to storage dynamics water ages and the time taken to flush nutrients and other pollutants that can potentially impair surface water quality good et al 2015 stieglitz et al 2003 tetzlaff et al 2018 however to date most catchment based isotope studies have been focused on smaller 10 km2 experimental catchments with relatively limited human impacts dewalle et al 1997 soulsby et al 2000 von freyberg et al 2022 the heterogeneous characteristics of large catchments usually make assessments of water fluxes both complicated and challenging resulting in limited studies at larger scales cervi et al 2019 chen et al 2020 nan et al 2021 ogrinc et al 2008 thus there is limited information on how tracer dynamics evolve in larger catchments and how the relative importance of landscape controls changes as lowland landscape features become more important associated groundwater inputs increase land becomes increasingly cultivated climatic contrasts are enhanced and river engineering increases previous large scale catchment studies have shown how variations in climate and landscape characteristics have a major influence on isotope dynamics runoff generation and aggregation of impacts over larger scales al mukhtar et al 2014 ala aho et al 2018 li et al 2020 marchina et al 2015 n√©grel et al 2016 rodgers et al 2005 besides larger catchments almost inevitably have greater levels of human impacts through urban areas agriculture industrial activities and water management infrastructure e g reservoirs abstractions etc that can affect both hydrology and isotope dynamics soulsby et al 2014 thus water isotopes have potential to enhance our understanding of large scale hydrology but so far that potential is largely unrealized fang et al 2022 gibson et al 2002 stadnyk and holmes 2023 vitvar et al 2005 yang et al 2023 the current growth of urbanisation accelerating climatic anomalies with increasing frequency of drought and water conflicts between different sectors are leading to growing concern about future water sustainability today many countries are facing considerable challenges to meet both human demands and sustain ecological needs leading to the overexploitation of local water resources getirana et al 2021 salehi 2022 large lowland catchments where human impacts are usually the greatest are particularly important as they provide groundwater recharge and drinking water supply filippini et al 2015 kalvƒÅns et al 2020 kleine et al 2021 trinh et al 2020 viviroli et al 2020 consequently the complexity of large lowland catchments with heterogeneity in climate land cover distribution subsurface flow paths and recharge conditions produce heterogeneity in natural hydrology leading to difficulties in constraining water fluxes mcgrane et al 2014 there is considerable potential in using tracers such as water stable isotopes in such large lowland catchments to understand how these complex hydrological processes and management interventions interact through such an approach we can gain a deeper understanding of the heterogeneity in dominant flow paths and the significance of specific hydrological fluxes and storage dynamics in different parts of the landscape tetzlaff et al 2011 van engelenburg et al 2018 this includes natural

potential of tracers to understand a large heavily managed lowland catchment of the 10 000 km2 river spree in north east germany the spree catchment is characterized by mining activities intensive agriculture commercial forestry and urbanisation all of which result in potentially competing pressure on water resources jahn 1998 lischeid 2010 this is significant as the spree contributes a

e g water sports and angling gerstengarbe et al 2003 limberg et al 2007 m√∂ller and burgschweiger 2008 pohle et al 2019 moreover the implications of climate change are also potentially severe with increases in air temperature and potential evapotranspiration since the 1960s g√§deke et al 2017 a better understanding of the hydrological function of the spree system is needed to inform future planning and management the specific objectives of our study were to i characterise the spatial and temporal variations in isotopes in the surface water of the spree catchment ii assess the large scale controls on isotopic variations in stream water iii use isotopes to gain a preliminary assessment of the effect of open water evaporation on the water balance 2 study area the river spree s catchment covers an area of 10 105 km2 draining a 380 km long channel in eastern germany which traverses several large cities including the german capital berlin fig 1 a within the catchment the highest elevation is 480 m asl and is close to the source near bautzen in the lusatian highlands the lowest is 30 m asl at the confluence of the river with the havel in western berlin fig 1 b apart from the southern headwaters the catchment has a flat lowland topography with an average slope of 1 along the main channel fig 1 b resulting from pleistocene glaciation landesamt f√ºr bergbau and geologie rohstoffe brandenburg lbgr 2010 the catchment experiences a sub continental climate with relatively low annual precipitation and hot and dry summers long term mean annual air temperature is 10 1 c and annual precipitation averages 598 mm 2011 2021 cf dwd on average it is estimated that 80 of annual precipitation may be lost through actual evapotranspiration aet pusch et al 2009 thus the water balance is usually strongly in deficit schoenheinz et al 2011 particularly from april to september due to this limited water availability and multiple withdraws of its water the spree is seen as especially water stressed and susceptible to climate change apart from the southern headwaters where sandstone outcrops and coal measures are close to the surface much of the solid geology is covered by quaternary glacial and post glacial drift deposits stackebrandt and manhenke 2010 the superficial geology throughout the catchment is dominated by sandy deposits with more peat silt and clay in mid northern subareas limberg et al 2007 especially around the spreewald fig 1 c loamy sand characterizes much of the catchment soils fig 1 e leading to a predominance of high vertical hydraulic conductivity agriculture and forestry are the main land uses covering 80 of the catchment while urban areas and open water bodies account for 14 and 3 of the catchment respectively many open water bodies are distributed sporadically along the river course with two major dams distributed at bautzen and spremberg in the south and two large lakes schwielochsee and m√ºggelsee in the north along the main stem of the river fig 1 d the downstream is located in the city of berlin and 60 of berlin is covered by buildings and roads senate department for the environment 2018 of which around 34 are impermeable senate department for urban development and housing 2017 the general flow direction of the spree is northwest the spree shows typical hydrological features of a lowland river of the lowland north european plain which is groundwater dominated and characterised by low runoff coefficients smith et al 2021 smith et al 2022 however the hydrological regime has undergone severe transformations due to reservoir regulation groundwater pumping from the mining of brown coal lignite abstractions for drinking water irrigation and offtakes for the oder spree canal pusch et al 2009 mining in particular historically resulted in a high proportion of flows being derived from pumped groundwater that was associated with de watering of coal measures gr√ºnewald 2001 after the sharp decrease in lignite production in the early 1990s hydrological conditions have profoundly changed former inputs of pumped groundwater to the river have declined and the river has been sustained mainly by reservoir releases or groundwater which is associated with mining related water quality problems e g high sulphate concentrations from the dissolution of pyrite in flooded mine workings g√§deke et al 2014 koch et al 2006 koch et al 2012 for analysis in this study we divided the river into five subsections fig 1 a section 1 is the upstream section and dominated by agricultural landuse where the river has been dammed to create the bautzen reservoir marked as yellow in fig 1 d the upper midstream section 2 is a transition zone from uplands to lowlands and another reservoir spremberg is located here fig 1 d special characteristics of section 2 include extensive areas of current lignite mining coupled with a legacy of large areas of former mines many of them have been flooded now as lakes or been restored though land reclamation is still ongoing the river slope decreases from 5 to 0 09 reaching a minimum in the lower middle spree section 3 here due to the low slope and historic channelisation the river forms a unique network of anastomosing channels with a total length of 1300 km within the extensive wetland area of the spreewald biosphere reserve the flow regime gradually changes to a slow flowing lowland river in the downstream catchment section 4 about 20 km of this river course is also utilised as the route of the oder spree canal as the spree reaches the urban area of berlin section 5 the urban impact on discharge and nutrients becomes significant due to the impervious areas high population 3 570 000 residents and linked wastewater treatment plants just upstream of berlin the river flows through two major lakes schwielochsee and m√ºggelsee fig 1 d 3 materials and methods 3 1 external data sources hydrometeorological and hydrometric data sets including air temperature relative humidity precipitation river discharge and groundwater levels were collated from various sources table 1 the monthly data of the climate variables were obtained from nine weather stations labelled w1 9 see table s2 and figure s1 operated by the german weather service dwd all distributed throughout the spree catchment discharge and groundwater level were obtained from discharge stations and exemplar wells monitored by local authorities including lfu saxony stations ds 1 4 gw1 lfu brandenburg stations ds 5 9 gw2 and senuvk stations ds 10 12 gw3 fig 1 and figure s1 the details about weather stations discharge stations and exemplar wells are also given in table s2 daily discharge and daily groundwater level of each station were available throughout the study period of 2021 3 2 sample collection and water isotope analysis four seasonal spatially distributed synoptic sampling campaigns were undertaken across the entire spree catchment over the course of one calendar year on 22th march 30th june 7th october and 6th december 2021 during each campaign stream water samples were taken at 20 core sites s01 s20 distributed along the stream network from the catchment source to the outlet fig 1 b the sampling sites located in sections 1 2 3 4 and 5 were labelled as s01 04 s05 08 s09 s14 s15 s17 and s18 s20 respectively twice a year i e the surveys of march and december more spatially extensive sampling was conducted at 68 sites figure s2 the 20 core sampling sites together with sub catchment characteristics are shown in table 2 in addition groundwater samples were collected from wells in the demnitzer mill creek catchment in section 4 a long term study site of the igb leibniz institute of freshwater ecology inland fisheries see figure s1 with no surface water influence as general comparators for surface waters kleine et al 2021 all samples were membrane filtered 0 2 Œºm cellulose acetate into 1 5 ml vials llg labware and were then analysed for 18o h2o and 2h h2o by cavity ring down spectroscopy crds using a picarro l2130 i isotopic water analyzer analysed values were linearly corrected with four lab standards and calibrated with reference to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow from the international atomic energy agency iaea after quality checking the averaged results for each sample were expressed in Œ¥ notation analytical precision was 0 04 standard deviation sd for Œ¥18o and 0 14 for Œ¥2h all data analyses and plotting used origin version 2021 in the december survey additional water samples 300 ml for tritium analysis were taken water samples were distilled and tritium was electrolytically enriched the tritium concentration was measured by low background liquid scintillation counting tricarb 3170 tr with a detection limit of about 0 7 tu all tritium analyses were conducted at the federal institute of hydrology bfg in koblenz germany 3 3 estimating evaporation losses heavy isotope 2h 18o enrichment during evaporation can be used in the well known craig gordon c g model for estimating evaporative losses craig and gordon 1965 this is based on how the stable isotope compositions of liquid water and vapour change during progressive evaporation in response to ambient conditions under steady state conditions in which a water body is constantly rlenished by inflowing water and the evaporative losses from surface water are compensated by inflow the ratio of evaporation over inflow e i was calculated using the following reformulated equation e g mayr et al 2007 e i is the fraction of inflowing water evaporated from a water pool 1 e i Œ¥ l Œ¥ p Œ¥ Œ¥ l m where Œ¥p denotes inflowing water Œ¥l represents water discharged from the water pool Œ¥ is the limiting isotope enrichment factor as given in gat and levy 1978 gat and gonfiantini 1981 and m is the enrichment slope as defined previously allison and leaney 1982 welhan and fritz 1977 which depends on air temperature relative humidity and precipitation isotopes a water body isolated from the groundwater table is generally considered to be in a non steady state when the volume and stable isotope composition of the water changes only due to evaporation progresses in this scenario the evaporative loss fraction of the pool f can be calculated using the original equation gonfiantini 1986 as presented eq 2 2 f 1 Œ¥ l Œ¥ Œ¥ p Œ¥ 1 m for our study a first approximation of seasonal evaporation in three of the five sections was estimated for both steady state and non steady conditions as it is impossible to identify the exact conditions resulting from the dynamic influences of groundwater or tributary flows we did not apply this method to sections 1 and 2 as both do not have reservoirs or lakes and are affected by the mine discharge with an isotopically different signature resulting from precipitation fallen a long time ago for the other three section the inputs Œ¥p and Œ¥l were defined as the isotopic compositions of the stream water sampling sites at the beginning and the end of each section respectively annual estimations were conducted under steady state condition as the river was well mixed and roughly in a steady state hydrology over one year the air temperature and relative humidity used to calculate Œ¥ and m were averaged across the weather stations distributed across each section we recognise that these estimates will be very rough but offer at least a first step that can improved with future data for the precipitation isotopes required in the calculation we used the simulated values for each section calculated by piso ai which allowed calculation of isotope time series at monthly resolution nelson et al 2021 this predictive model relies on xgboost a tree based machine learning methodology using gradient boosting to simulate precipitation isotopes from statistical relationships between measured values and variables such as latitude elevation or air temperature nelson et al 2021 compared with the available monitored values at two of the sections simulated precipitation values fitted moderate with r2 of 0 41 and 0 82 for sections 4 and 5 respectively 4 results 4 1 dynamics in hydroclimate stable water isotopes in precipitation discharge and groundwater levels during the study period of 2021 daily air temperatures were highest in june 20 c and lowest in february 10 c and the annual means were generally slightly higher downstream mean 10 5 c than midstream mean 9 9 c and upstream mean 8 1 c fig 2 a precipitation throughout the catchment showed marked seasonal variations with frequent but relatively low amounts of daily precipitation totals in autumn winter and less frequent but more intensive convectional rainstorms in spring summer fig 2 a the annual total p amounts in 2021 were higher in the higher altitude headwaters 757 mm areas than in midstream 538 mm and downstream 532 mm lowlands which were slightly lower than long term averages of 560 mm in section 5 kuhlemann et al 2022 modelled monthly variations in the precipitation water isotopes in the five subsections followed an expected seasonal pattern being more depleted in heavier isotopes in winter and more enriched in summer fig 3 similar to general seasonal distributions of the two gnip global network of isotopes in precipitation stations and the direct measurements in the study year at the two precipitation collection sites in the mid and lower catchment figure s3 however spatial variability was probably substantial particularly systematic differences between the most upstream section 1 and the most downstream areas section 5 regardless of seasons precipitation was most depleted in heavier isotopes in the higher elevation l headwaters section 1 compared to the downstream parts close to berlin section 5 the seasonal pattern of precipitation isotopes differed from seasonality in precipitation amount but was more related to the changing temperatures of dominant air mass rainfall sources through the year see also fig 2 indicating the dominant effect of temperature on precipitation isotopes flows in the steeper headwaters were most responsive to storm events especially in spring and summer fig 2 b discharge in the midstream sections showed more modest responses to large precipitation events but higher baseflows due to reservoir regulation and pumped minewater released into the streams in the downstream sections discharge was strongly damped with some daily but little seasonal variability reflecting the abstraction effects of canals and lakes the average annual discharge was in the order of the midstream 12 37 m3 s upstream 6 44 m3 s downstream 4 77 m3 s parts fig 4 shows discharge at the 12 river gauging stations distributed along the main stem of the spree stations ds 1 12 see fig 1 and the stream water isotopes collected near the stations in 2021 the lowest discharge rates were at station ds 1 which was located in the catchment headwaters with a catchment area of 24 km2 discharge at stations ds 1 5 was strongly influenced by episodic winter rainfall events particularly in the first half year of 2021 fig 4 spremberg reservoir is located between ds 5 and 6 so summer flows at ds 6 were attenuated due to storage by reservoir the downstream stations showed a less marked response to precipitation events with higher baseflows incl the water releases ds 7 9 during warmer summer months the high evaporation in the spreewald biosphere reserve where the river is distributed through numerous extensive small channels networks and wetlands along with small water abstraction and transfers to canals caused dramatic attenuation of flows and a sharp reduction in discharge ds 7 9 the spree river is also crossed by the oder spree canal near ds 9 where the river is completely intercepted by the canal therefore flows towards the m√ºggelsee the largest lake in berlin are affected by the outlet of the canal with sharp declining discharge rates at ds 10 water evaporation storage and abstraction via groundwater pumping from the m√ºggelsee results in discharge fluctuating significantly at the outlet of the lake ds 11 the highest discharge was at ds 12 where winter flows were highest but seasonality was modulated by weirs and ship locks effluent from wastewater water treatment plants and water abstraction for municipal use in addition higher runoff due to impermeable surfaces in the built environment also increased discharge at this station groundwater levels located outside any groundwater depression cones from mining were relatively close to the ground surface throughout the whole study period with means of 2 3 3 and 3 5 m below the ground surface in the upstream midstream and downstream sections respectively fig 2 c groundwater depth was deeper in the midstream and downstream sections than upstream generally water tables were also deeper in summer and shallower in winter and spring when groundwater recharge was highest 4 2 dynamics in stream water isotopes the synoptic surveys of surface water isotopes need to be understood in the context of the flow variations fig 4 some smaller rainfall events before the first survey in march increased discharge at most sites similarly a wet period in june preceding the summer survey resulted in some of the highest flows of the year in the upper parts though these showed a two week lag in the middle catchment october and december samples were collected after late summer and autumn rainfall increased flows again at most sites especially in the lower catchment compared to precipitation isotopes the seasonality in stream water isotopes was much more damped fig 4 though still evident with the largest seasonal increase of 1 60 for Œ¥18o compared to that of 5 75 for precipitation fig 3 stream water at most sites was enriched in heavier isotopes in june october and depleted in december march fig 4 exhibiting notable lags compared to precipitation isotope signals plotting data from all seasonal sampling campaigns in dual isotope space fig 5 a emphasised these distinct isotopic differences between seasons indicating evaporative fractionation effects isotopic signatures of major surface water sample sites were most depleted in march 2021 with mean Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h of 8 2 and 59 2 respectively in contrast the most enriched isotopic compositions were observed during the warm dry periods of june october with mean values 7 25 7 28 and 53 44 53 73 for Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h respectively fig 5a table 3 reflecting the continued influence of evaporative fractionation during the summer through to the autumn in december the majority of samples became more depleted again and the mean values were intermediate between march and june october december samples also showed the greatest range of isotopic values across the river network even when standardised across common sampling sites indicative groundwater samples in the mid and lower catchment were also shown as referenced isotopic values of the groundwater system independent from surface processes like fractionation fig 5 groundwater isotopic compositions were depleted and closer to the gmwl compared to most stream water samples spatially most of the stream water samples plotted below the gmwl except the samples of section 1 in march october and december fig 5 b e this implies that the occurrence of evaporation effects on stream water was most marked in the middle and downstream reaches of the spree river isotopes in section 1 were also more variable and more dispersed while they were more damped in the downstream sections indicating the mixing of rainfall snowmelt with stored water within the landscape as it traverses the sampled catchment throughout the year stream water isotopes were remarkably enriched downstream along the river course with Œ¥18o ranging from 10 0 to 4 2 and Œ¥2h ranging from 69 1 to 35 9 table s3 sites in upper sections were usually more depleted with mean values of 8 for Œ¥18o especially in march and december fig 6 a during those periods the isotopic differences between commonly sampled upper sites and downstream sites were most evident however in june and october changes in isotopic compositions were more limited downstream of the mid catchment fig 6 a isotopic signatures became particularly more enriched in the spreewald at section 3 showing strong evidence of fractionation fig 6 a deuterium excess d excess further illustrated the role of seasonality in the spatial variation in isotopes as an indicator of evaporation fig 6 b the spatial pattern in march was similar to that in december however the values of d excess near the outlet were not as low similar spatial patterns were also observed in june and october with lower d excess values in the upper reaches in june the lower values of d excess in june and october than in march and december indicated more pronounced evaporation in dry and warm months likewise d excess was lower in the downstream reaches than in the headwater reflecting more pronounced evaporation in the more urbanised and regulated areas the most fractionated water in midstream reaches e g the spreewald biosphere reserve decreased d excess downstream tritium concentrations show marked variations between sample sites along the river fig 7 highest concentrations were observed at sites s02 s03 s09 s17 and s19 s20 lowest values were found between s05 s08 s10 s15 and s18 set in a longer term context tritium concentrations in the spree have been in decline since the 1960s as tritium was released to the atmosphere via nuclear bomb tests schmidt et al 2020 since then tritium content in precipitation has declined to levels comparable to pre bomb levels fig 7 the variation along the spree shows the legacy effects at sites where concentrations are high and either influences of much older water e g pumped mine waters or younger waters e g in lakes where concentrations were low 4 3 evaporative losses based on isotope mass balance the first approximations of seasonal evaporation loss ratios e i or f in sections 3 to 5 are compared in fig 8 b evaporation losses of stream water peaked in october section 3 or december section 4 and section 5 reflecting the accumulation of evaporation from summer to autumn the e i or f in sections 4 and 5 were always 15 over all seasons while the highest e i in section 3 was up to 60 in october based on Œ¥18o seasonal and annual e i or f values of section 3 were significantly higher than that of the other sections indicating the influence of the spreewald with extensive wetlands canals and open waters on evaporation in addition the lowest slope of section 3 table 4 could also lengthen residence times of river water enhancing the opportunity for evaporative losses from the exposed water surface taking the whole spree catchment as a water body our results suggest a rough annual estimate of open water evaporative losses accounting for up to 13 75 Œ¥18o and 18 52 Œ¥2h with an average of 16 14 table 4 the obtained values of e i changes can be explained partly by the dynamics in stream water isotopes fig 8 a for sections 3 and 5 stream water isotopes at the most downstream sampling sites were significantly higher than at their first inflow sites fig 8 a leading to higher estimates on e i as in equation 1 this was not the case for section 4 which showed limited isotopic variability and subsequent lower evaporative losses this could be attributed to isotopically depleted water sources such as local groundwater offsetting isotopic enrichment caused by evaporation in stream water and causing underestimates 5 discussion 5 1 stream water sources inferred by spatial isotope variability in a large scale catchment isotope data from synoptic surveys can be used in conjunction with hydroclimatic records to examine how different water sources and hydrological processes influence the evolution of streamflow generation downstream in large catchments some studies gibson et al 2020 smith et al 2015 have shown systematic changes along natural rivers as basin characteristics change and lowland tributaries and groundwater contribute to streamflow in a heavily managed catchment like the spree such changes are obscured by effects of reservoir operations minewater management and evaporation from lakes and the large managed spreewald wetland making the quantification of controlling processes and their effects difficult combining precipitation and streamflow monitoring the variability in flow regimes and interannual isotopic analyses can elicit some understanding of primary source components i e groundwater snowmelt surface runoff contributing to the spree river the streamflow in section 1 exhibited rapid responses to precipitation events fig 2 and fig 4 particularly during storm periods which indicated more direct runoff links between precipitation and streamflow the dominant low permeability silt loam soils in section 1 promote lateral near surface flows in response to precipitation which was probably enhanced by agricultural drainage in this area with intensive arable farming this underlined the important influence of soil properties on runoff generation klaus et al 2015 slattery et al 2006 additionally section 1 was isotopically more depleted with larger temporal variability compared to the mid downstream areas fig 5 b e this was likely related to the more isotopically depleted precipitation at higher altitudes fig 3 the depletion in stream water in this section can also be attributed to contributions from more depleted shallower groundwater in upland areas reflecting higher recharge from winter rainfall but also the influence of winter rainfall and linked surface and near surface runoff processes an influence of shallower groundwater would also explain the elevated tritium in the upper catchment discharge in section 2 and section 3 i e the midstream sections also responded significantly to the storm events during autumn winter showing a marked runoff response to rainfall the increased baseflow in the mid catchment can be explained by the influence of pumped minewater over 250 km2 of the catchment is still affected by dewatering of coal measures in active open mines which can be 150 m deep the extensive wetlands distributed through section 3 have previously been identified as an area of high evaporative losses reflected in sharply decreased discharge during summer strongly enriched stream water isotopes and negative d excess fig 6 the downstream parts section 4 have the least variable discharges with consistently low values fig 2 despite high rainfall recorded from july to november the flow downstream did not respond significantly to such events reflecting the dominant role of reservoir weirs as well as longer term storage attenuation in lakes moreover many smaller lowland tributaries have become increasingly characterised as intermittent streams since the 2018 drought and thus did not add incrementally to summer baseflows downstream kuhlemann et al 2021 these factors as well as abstractions particularly to the oder spree canal result in a dominant effect of evaporative fraction on the isotopic composition of the stream with also isotopes inferring only limited contributions from lowland tributaries and aquifers in the most downstream areas section 5 i e berlin the effects of wastewater and urbanized tributaries are evident in the stream hydrograph kuhlemann et al 2022 kuhlemann et al 2020 but the isotopic signal remains strongly fractionated with the most enriched values fig 5 b e masking the isotopic depletion induced by wastewater and urban stream also although contributions to streamflow are mainly from groundwater fed tributaries lower rainfall high terrestrial evapotranspiration and low recharge rates 100 mm and leakage to deeper regional aquifers dictate that these inputs are relatively low contributions to flows in the lower catchment that was particularly the case in the study year which was affected by an ongoing drought since 2018 consequently the water isotope signatures reflected the complexity of the spree catchment including a variety of water sources management operations and hydrological processes along the river course with such a dataset we can help fill the gap between understanding gained from isotope studies in small or less heterogeneous catchments klaus et al 2015 sidle et al 2000 to better understand runoff generation and water sources in large scale catchments with heavily management and extensive wetland lakes although only one tritium survey was conducted it also clearly shows marked spatial differences in the concentrations with elevated levels in the catchment headwaters and reduced levels in the area of pumped mine waters throughout brandenburg tritium helium data from previous studies shows that groundwater is decadal in age in the upper aquifer and likely millennial at depths of 100 m bednorz and brose 2017 thus pumped minewater is likely to be very old 100 years and supress tritium levels downstream this influence is evident in the long term tritium data collected on the spree at fuerstenwalde located in section 4 and berlin section 5 schmidt et al 2020 some simple age modelling applications using this published long term tritium data in precipitation shows that recovery of tritium levels in the river over the past few decades gives ages of 100 years at the former site and 50 years at the latter fig 7 the younger ages in berlin likely reflect the increased influence of younger urban runoff from the metropolitan area marx et al 2021 although only a first approximation such old water dominance underlines the complex hydrology of the spree and the ongoing influence of flow regulation by pumped minewater which is complicated further by reservoir operation and evaporation through lakes and wetlands this makes the catchment somewhat different from less disturbed catchments which show a much lower influence of older groundwater and a dominance of young water jasechko et al 2016 5 2 the effect of open water evaporation on the water balance high levels of evaporation from the spree network and its associated reservoirs lakes and wetlands are reflected by high degree of isotopic enrichment and negative d excess values isotopic enrichment is most evident in june and october with the river network becoming more depleted during march and december figs 5 and 6 in particular the large area of open water and wetlands in the spreewald biosphere reserve section 3 created additional storage that enhanced evaporation and decreased discharges thus providing increased isotopic enrichment downstream figs 5 and 6 and resulting in the largest estimation of evaporative losses in section 3 fig 8 previous work has found similar isotopic enrichment and used it to estimate evaporation rates from lakes or entire catchments gibson 2001 skrzypek et al 2015 vystavna et al 2021 the continued enrichment in stream water isotopes in section 4 and section 5 together with the low annual runoff shows that evaporation in section 3 strongly influenced the runoff dynamics downstream however given the limited data collected so far the c g model based on isotope mass balance provides only a rough and likely conservative approximation of the evaporative losses relative to observed large scale variation in stream water isotope ratios in our study area especially in sections 4 and 5 which showed anomalously low evaporation rates compared to other large scale catchments gibson and edwards 2002 skrzypek et al 2015 zhu et al 2021 in section 4 large amounts of water abstracted into the canal may also have an impact on the e i ratio because the fractionation signals are lost the wastewater and urban runoff comprise an increasing source of streamflow in section 5 i e berlin previous work has shown that the urban tributaries of the spree in berlin are isotopically depleted due to waste water effluents kuhlemann et al 2022 in these cases the isotopes of outflows were lighter than expected which in turn would lead to reduction of derived evaporation estimates in addition the heavy rainfall in july 2021 fig 2 b instigated a flow response across the catchment which likely off set the fractionation effects from early summer evaporation and resulted in low estimates knowledge about such evaporation fractionation processes within catchments is critical for understanding and constraining regional water balances bennett et al 2008 gibson and edwards 2002 gibson and reid 2014 and can help calibrate benchmark rainfall runoff models anderton et al 2002 birkel et al 2014 however in highly managed lowland catchments like the spree the e i ratio can vary due to the influence of groundwater isokangas et al 2015 seasonal floods brock et al 2009 extensive wetland gibson 2002 or chains of lakes gibson and reid 2014 in these cases e i ratios may have been under over estimated due to the isotopic dilution enrichment induced by the inflow or outflow hence these evaporation assessments should be regarded as a conservative first approximation though with ongoing sampling and further investigation the spatial and temporal variability of these estimates will be better constrained 5 3 wider implications water availability in the spree catchment one of the major rivers in berlin is strongly impacted by climate dynamics and anthropogenic activities the recent warmer temperatures and extended dry periods such as the 2018 drought point towards more severe climate warming in the future gerstengarbe et al 2003 lotze campen et al 2009 along with growing water demands the long history of complex management and the cessation of lignite mining activities planned in 2038 these developments contribute to a potentially fragile water resource situation and raise the prospect for potential water supply problems in berlin therefore the complex hydrology of the spree river needs to be better understood and insights from isotopes can be invaluable in terms of quantifying sources of runoff and age distributions the observed high annual evaporative losses 10 especially in the midstream sections indicated that the evaporation of the surface water is an important driver in the reduction of stream discharge throughout the spree catchment hence water management strategies need be adjusted or developed in future to avoid the river intermittency and to maintain the ecological and hydrological functions of the spreewald biosphere reserve although our approach i e spatially synoptic surveys covered contrasting seasons the dictations on temporal variabilities in hydrology and water sources were partially limited by the coarse temporal resolution of the sampling obviously higher resolution sampling especially with synchronous precipitation groundwater sampling e g von freyberg et al 2017 over longer time periods will likely reveal more complex dynamics than what were observed in our study therefore this is a preliminary study but can be used as a learning framework guiding future sampling which will aim to be more frequent i e monthly or weekly such improved monitoring will improve hydrological models through the integration of water isotopes in hydrological modelling across larger spatial scales and time periods which have been shown to constrain parameters and reduce uncertainty in model predictions dunn et al 2008 fenicia et al 2008 soulsby et al 2015 in addition such models will crucially need to interface with water resource assessment tools to capture the integrated effect of the control rules for the various managed releases and abstractions that dominate in some parts of the spree catchment cf pohle et al 2019 6 conclusions our study has demonstrated the potential of combining tracers with hydroclimatic records to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the hydrology to clarify the spatial controls thereon and to indicate the degree of evaporative losses in large river systems offering new insights into water resources management in water stressed rapidly growing urban areas like berlin overall spatial variation in river stable isotope composition reflects that of precipitation and groundwater recharge being depleted in heavy isotopes in the catchment headwaters and becoming more enriched downstream however the effects of evaporative fractionation are evident below the reservoirs near cottbus and then become accentuated through the spreewald and lowland lakes where evaporative losses are high and streamflow attenuation is marked inflows in the lower catchment moderate these fractionation effects though only slightly artificial pumping of older groundwater impacts tritium concentrations and results in streamflow being dominated by older water i e 100 years in the lower catchment while younger water became more influential in the urban parts of berlin dominated by urban runoff the current hydrology of the spree river is complex and reflects the long term evolution of water management this management will likely need to rapidly adapt to the impacts of climate change and increased economic pressures on the catchment water resources isotopes have an important role in providing an evidence base for decision making focused on water security in such a complex catchment hence synoptic surveys are continuing for both stable isotopes and tritium at the spree in order to better constrain the current spatial and temporal dynamics of water sources and ages and assist projections on how they may change under future climate and management credit

1739,understanding the hydrology of large catchments has always been a major challenge due to the spatial heterogeneity of climate geology topography soils and land use however precise knowledge of water cycling storage and losses across large scale catchments is required to sustainably meet growing water demands and adjust water management strategies this study used four large scale seasonal synoptic surveys in 2021 to characterize the spatio temporal patterns of water isotopes stable water isotopes and radioisotope tritium at natural abundance to better understand the complex hydrology of the intensively managed 10 000 km2 catchment of the river spree in germany apart from the upper headwaters the hydrology of the spree is heavily regulated by reservoir releases pumped minewater discharges extensive wetlands and lakes water abstractions and urban drainage moreover the catchment is drought sensitive with potential evapotranspiration 800 mm a year often exceeding annual rainfall 600 mm this is reflected in the isotopic composition of river water in the steeper upper headwaters the river has a flashy rainfall runoff response with isotopes plotting close to the global meteoric water line gmwl consistent with dominant groundwater sources but showing more influence by rainfall in winter however flows in the midstream parts are complex due to artificially enhanced baseflows and attenuated high flows from extensive reservoir releases and pumped groundwater releases from dewatering of mines the reservoir waters are isotopically heavier and reflect the effects of open water evaporation fractionation effects strengthen downstream as managed wetland areas in the spreewald and natural lakes further enhance evaporation and attenuate flows water abstractions for drinking water and to sustain the oder spree canal reduce flows further in berlin sources of urban runoff and waste water discharges reduce the effects of fractionation though samples still plot below the meteoric water line seasonally the effects of evaporation in the lower river network are strongest in summer and autumn though they remain in winter and spring indicating a large memory effect due to long mean travel times within the river system tritium variability along the river reflects inputs of younger and older water in different parts of the river system though the influence of pumped groundwater means that the mean age of stream water i e time elapsed since rainfall in the lower river is likely to be 50 years climate change together with increased population and economic growth in berlin is likely to increase pressures on the spree system in future in the coming years the anticipated termination of the lignite mining will lead to a reduction in artificial inputs into surface water which in turn may exacerbate water stress we demonstrated that longer term synoptic isotope studies are valuable in better understanding the hydrology of such complex large scale heavily modified river systems in terms of insights into water sources and mixing processes thus providing an evidence base for more sustainable management in the future keywords catchment hydrology stable isotopes water balance water sources tracer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water stable isotopes Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h are ideal natural tracers for understanding the water cycle and related hydrological processes such as mixing and evaporation gat 2010 gibson et al 2021 henderson and shuman 2010 kendall and mcdonnell 2012 meredith et al 2009 schmidt et al 2011 tracing the flow paths that generate streamflow is important to correctly determine how this relates to storage dynamics water ages and the time taken to flush nutrients and other pollutants that can potentially impair surface water quality good et al 2015 stieglitz et al 2003 tetzlaff et al 2018 however to date most catchment based isotope studies have been focused on smaller 10 km2 experimental catchments with relatively limited human impacts dewalle et al 1997 soulsby et al 2000 von freyberg et al 2022 the heterogeneous characteristics of large catchments usually make assessments of water fluxes both complicated and challenging resulting in limited studies at larger scales cervi et al 2019 chen et al 2020 nan et al 2021 ogrinc et al 2008 thus there is limited information on how tracer dynamics evolve in larger catchments and how the relative importance of landscape controls changes as lowland landscape features become more important associated groundwater inputs increase land becomes increasingly cultivated climatic contrasts are enhanced and river engineering increases previous large scale catchment studies have shown how variations in climate and landscape characteristics have a major influence on isotope dynamics runoff generation and aggregation of impacts over larger scales al mukhtar et al 2014 ala aho et al 2018 li et al 2020 marchina et al 2015 n√©grel et al 2016 rodgers et al 2005 besides larger catchments almost inevitably have greater levels of human impacts through urban areas agriculture industrial activities and water management infrastructure e g reservoirs abstractions etc that can affect both hydrology and isotope dynamics soulsby et al 2014 thus water isotopes have potential to enhance our understanding of large scale hydrology but so far that potential is largely unrealized fang et al 2022 gibson et al 2002 stadnyk and holmes 2023 vitvar et al 2005 yang et al 2023 the current growth of urbanisation accelerating climatic anomalies with increasing frequency of drought and water conflicts between different sectors are leading to growing concern about future water sustainability today many countries are facing considerable challenges to meet both human demands and sustain ecological needs leading to the overexploitation of local water resources getirana et al 2021 salehi 2022 large lowland catchments where human impacts are usually the greatest are particularly important as they provide groundwater recharge and drinking water supply filippini et al 2015 kalvƒÅns et al 2020 kleine et al 2021 trinh et al 2020 viviroli et al 2020 consequently the complexity of large lowland catchments with heterogeneity in climate land cover distribution subsurface flow paths and recharge conditions produce heterogeneity in natural hydrology leading to difficulties in constraining water fluxes mcgrane et al 2014 there is considerable potential in using tracers such as water stable isotopes in such large lowland catchments to understand how these complex hydrological processes and management interventions interact through such an approach we can gain a deeper understanding of the heterogeneity in dominant flow paths and the significance of specific hydrological fluxes and storage dynamics in different parts of the landscape tetzlaff et al 2011 van engelenburg et al 2018 this includes natural hydrological influences on isotopic variability e g the spatial heterogeneity of rainfall inputs and evaporation effects haiyan et al 2018 jeelani et al 2013 ohlanders et al 2013 simpson and herczeg 1991 stevenson et al 2022 but also the effects of human activity such as regulation irrigation and effluent influences kuhlemann et al 2021 marx et al 2021 xia et al 2020 here we leverage this potential of tracers to understand a large heavily managed lowland catchment of the 10 000 km2 river spree in north east germany the spree catchment is characterized by mining activities intensive agriculture commercial forestry and urbanisation all of which result in potentially competing pressure on water resources jahn 1998 lischeid 2010 this is significant as the spree contributes a substantial component of berlin s drinking water supplies sustains internationally important wetlands in the spreewald biosphere reserve and has a network of lakes that are heavily used for recreation e g water sports and angling gerstengarbe et al 2003 limberg et al 2007 m√∂ller and burgschweiger 2008 pohle et al 2019 moreover the implications of climate change are also potentially severe with increases in air temperature and potential evapotranspiration since the 1960s g√§deke et al 2017 a better understanding of the hydrological function of the spree system is needed to inform future planning and management the specific objectives of our study were to i characterise the spatial and temporal variations in isotopes in the surface water of the spree catchment ii assess the large scale controls on isotopic variations in stream water iii use isotopes to gain a preliminary assessment of the effect of open water evaporation on the water balance 2 study area the river spree s catchment covers an area of 10 105 km2 draining a 380 km long channel in eastern germany which traverses several large cities including the german capital berlin fig 1 a within the catchment the highest elevation is 480 m asl and is close to the source near bautzen in the lusatian highlands the lowest is 30 m asl at the confluence of the river with the havel in western berlin fig 1 b apart from the southern headwaters the catchment has a flat lowland topography with an average slope of 1 along the main channel fig 1 b resulting from pleistocene glaciation landesamt f√ºr bergbau and geologie rohstoffe brandenburg lbgr 2010 the catchment experiences a sub continental climate with relatively low annual precipitation and hot and dry summers long term mean annual air temperature is 10 1 c and annual precipitation averages 598 mm 2011 2021 cf dwd on average it is estimated that 80 of annual precipitation may be lost through actual evapotranspiration aet pusch et al 2009 thus the water balance is usually strongly in deficit schoenheinz et al 2011 particularly from april to september due to this limited water availability and multiple withdraws of its water the spree is seen as especially water stressed and susceptible to climate change apart from the southern headwaters where sandstone outcrops and coal measures are close to the surface much of the solid geology is covered by quaternary glacial and post glacial drift deposits stackebrandt and manhenke 2010 the superficial geology throughout the catchment is dominated by sandy deposits with more peat silt and clay in mid northern subareas limberg et al 2007 especially around the spreewald fig 1 c loamy sand characterizes much of the catchment soils fig 1 e leading to a predominance of high vertical hydraulic conductivity agriculture and forestry are the main land uses covering 80 of the catchment while urban areas and open water bodies account for 14 and 3 of the catchment respectively many open water bodies are distributed sporadically along the river course with two major dams distributed at bautzen and spremberg in the south and two large lakes schwielochsee and m√ºggelsee in the north along the main stem of the river fig 1 d the downstream is located in the city of berlin and 60 of berlin is covered by buildings and roads senate department for the environment 2018 of which around 34 are impermeable senate department for urban development and housing 2017 the general flow direction of the spree is northwest the spree shows typical hydrological features of a lowland river of the lowland north european plain which is groundwater dominated and characterised by low runoff coefficients smith et al 2021 smith et al 2022 however the hydrological regime has undergone severe transformations due to reservoir regulation groundwater pumping from the mining of brown coal lignite abstractions for drinking water irrigation and offtakes for the oder spree canal pusch et al 2009 mining in particular historically resulted in a high proportion of flows being derived from pumped groundwater that was associated with de watering of coal measures gr√ºnewald 2001 after the sharp decrease in lignite production in the early 1990s hydrological conditions have profoundly changed former inputs of pumped groundwater to the river have declined and the river has been sustained mainly by reservoir releases or groundwater which is associated with mining related water quality problems e g high sulphate concentrations from the dissolution of pyrite in flooded mine workings g√§deke et al 2014 koch et al 2006 koch et al 2012 for analysis in this study we divided the river into five subsections fig 1 a section 1 is the upstream section and dominated by agricultural landuse where the river has been dammed to create the bautzen reservoir marked as yellow in fig 1 d the upper midstream section 2 is a transition zone from uplands to lowlands and another reservoir spremberg is located here fig 1 d special characteristics of section 2 include extensive areas of current lignite mining coupled with a legacy of large areas of former mines many of them have been flooded now as lakes or been restored though land reclamation is still ongoing the river slope decreases from 5 to 0 09 reaching a minimum in the lower middle spree section 3 here due to the low slope and historic channelisation the river forms a unique network of anastomosing channels with a total length of 1300 km within the extensive wetland area of the spreewald biosphere reserve the flow regime gradually changes to a slow flowing lowland river in the downstream catchment section 4 about 20 km of this river course is also utilised as the route of the oder spree canal as the spree reaches the urban area of berlin section 5 the urban impact on discharge and nutrients becomes significant due to the impervious areas high population 3 570 000 residents and linked wastewater treatment plants just upstream of berlin the river flows through two major lakes schwielochsee and m√ºggelsee fig 1 d 3 materials and methods 3 1 external data sources hydrometeorological and hydrometric data sets including air temperature relative humidity precipitation river discharge and groundwater levels were collated from various sources table 1 the monthly data of the climate variables were obtained from nine weather stations labelled w1 9 see table s2 and figure s1 operated by the german weather service dwd all distributed throughout the spree catchment discharge and groundwater level were obtained from discharge

about weather stations discharge stations and exemplar wells are also given in table s2 daily discharge and daily groundwater level of each station were available throughout the study period of 2021 3 2 sample collection and water isotope analysis four seasonal spatially distributed synoptic sampling campaigns were undertaken across the entire spree catchment over the course of one calendar year on 22th march 30th june 7th october and 6th december 2021 during each campaign stream water samples were taken at 20 core sites s01 s20 distributed along the stream network from the catchment source to the outlet fig 1 b the sampling sites located in sections 1 2 3 4 and 5 were labelled as s01 04 s05 08 s09 s14 s15 s17 and s18 s20 respectively twice a year i e the surveys of march and december more spatially extensive sampling was conducted at 68 sites figure s2 the 20 core sampling sites together with sub catchment characteristics are shown in table 2 in addition groundwater samples were collected from wells in the demnitzer mill creek catchment in section 4 a long term study site of the igb leibniz institute of freshwater ecology inland fisheries see figure s1 with no surface water influence as general comparators for surface waters kleine et al 2021 all samples were membrane filtered 0 2 Œºm cellulose acetate into 1 5 ml vials llg labware and were then analysed for 18o h2o and 2h h2o by cavity ring down spectroscopy crds using a picarro l2130 i isotopic water analyzer analysed values were linearly corrected with four lab standards and calibrated with reference to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow from the international atomic energy agency iaea after quality checking the averaged results for each sample were expressed in Œ¥ notation analytical precision was 0 04 standard deviation sd for Œ¥18o and 0 14 for Œ¥2h all data analyses and plotting used origin version 2021 in the december survey additional water samples 300 ml for tritium analysis were taken water samples were distilled and tritium was electrolytically enriched the tritium concentration was measured by low background liquid scintillation counting tricarb 3170 tr with a detection limit of about 0 7 tu all tritium analyses were conducted at the federal institute of hydrology bfg in koblenz germany 3 3 estimating evaporation losses heavy isotope 2h 18o enrichment during evaporation can be used in the well known craig gordon c g model for estimating evaporative losses craig and gordon 1965 this is based on how the stable isotope compositions of liquid water and vapour change during progressive evaporation in response to ambient conditions under steady state conditions in which a water body is constantly rlenished by inflowing water and the evaporative losses from surface water are compensated by inflow the ratio of evaporation over inflow e i was calculated using the following reformulated equation e g mayr et al 2007 e i is the fraction of inflowing water evaporated from a water pool 1 e i Œ¥ l Œ¥ p Œ¥ Œ¥ l m where Œ¥p denotes inflowing water Œ¥l represents water discharged from the water pool Œ¥ is the limiting isotope enrichment factor as given in gat and levy 1978 gat and gonfiantini 1981 and m is the enrichment slope as defined previously allison and leaney 1982 welhan and fritz 1977 which depends on air temperature relative humidity and precipitation isotopes a water body isolated from the groundwater table is generally considered to be in a non steady state when the volume and stable isotope composition of the water changes only due to evaporation progresses in this scenario the evaporative loss fraction of the pool f can be calculated using the original equation gonfiantini 1986 as presented eq 2 2 f 1 Œ¥ l Œ¥ Œ¥ p Œ¥ 1 m for our study a first approximation of seasonal evaporation in three of the five sections was estimated for both steady state and non steady conditions as it is impossible to identify the exact conditions resulting from the dynamic influences of groundwater or tributary flows we did not apply this method to sections 1 and 2 as both do not have reservoirs or lakes and are affected by the mine discharge with an isotopically different signature resulting from precipitation fallen a long time ago for the other three section the inputs Œ¥p and Œ¥l were defined as the isotopic compositions of the stream water sampling sites at the beginning and the end of each section respectively annual estimations were conducted under steady state condition as the river was well mixed and roughly in a steady state hydrology over one year the air temperature and relative humidity used to calculate Œ¥ and m were averaged across the weather stations distributed across each section we recognise that these estimates will be very rough but offer at least a first step that can improved with future data for the precipitation isotopes required in the calculation we used the simulated values for each section calculated by piso ai which allowed calculation of isotope time series at monthly resolution nelson et al 2021 this predictive model relies on xgboost a tree based machine learning methodology using gradient boosting to simulate precipitation isotopes from statistical relationships between measured values and variables such as latitude elevation or air temperature nelson et al 2021 compared with the available monitored values at two of the sections simulated precipitation values fitted moderate with r2 of 0 41 and 0 82 for sections 4 and 5 respectively 4 results 4 1 dynamics in hydroclimate stable water isotopes in precipitation discharge and groundwater levels during the study period of 2021 daily air temperatures were highest in june 20 c and lowest in february 10 c and the annual means were generally slightly higher downstream mean 10 5 c than midstream mean 9 9 c and upstream mean 8 1 c fig 2 a precipitation throughout the catchment showed marked seasonal variations with frequent but relatively low amounts of daily precipitation totals in autumn winter and less frequent but more intensive convectional rainstorms in spring summer fig 2 a the annual total p amounts in 2021 were higher in the higher altitude headwaters 757 mm areas than in midstream 538 mm and downstream 532 mm lowlands which were slightly lower than long term averages of 560 mm in section 5 kuhlemann et al 2022 modelled monthly variations in the precipitation water isotopes in the five subsections followed an expected seasonal pattern being more depleted in heavier isotopes in winter and more enriched in summer fig 3 similar to general seasonal distributions of the two gnip global network of isotopes in precipitation stations and the direct measurements in the study year at the two precipitation collection sites in the mid and lower catchment figure s3 however spatial variability was probably substantial particularly systematic differences between the most upstream section 1 and the most downstream areas section 5 regardless of seasons precipitation was most depleted in heavier isotopes in the higher elevation l headwaters section 1 compared to the downstream parts close to berlin section 5 the seasonal pattern of precipitation isotopes differed from seasonality in precipitation amount but was more related to the changing temperatures of dominant air mass rainfall sources through the year see also fig 2 indicating the dominant effect of temperature on precipitation isotopes flows in the steeper headwaters were most responsive to storm events especially in spring and summer fig 2 b discharge in the midstream sections showed more modest responses to large precipitation events but higher baseflows due to reservoir regulation and pumped minewater released into the streams in the downstream sections discharge was strongly damped with some daily but little seasonal variability reflecting the abstraction effects of canals and lakes the average annual discharge was in the order of the midstream 12 37 m3 s upstream 6 44 m3 s downstream 4 77 m3 s parts fig 4 shows discharge at the 12 river gauging stations distributed along the main stem of the spree stations ds 1 12 see fig 1 and the stream water isotopes collected near the stations in 2021 the lowest discharge rates were at station ds 1 which was located in the catchment headwaters with a catchment area of 24 km2 discharge at stations ds 1 5 was strongly influenced by episodic winter rainfall events particularly in the first half year of 2021 fig 4 spremberg reservoir is located between ds 5 and 6 so summer flows at ds 6 were attenuated due to storage by reservoir the downstream stations showed a less marked response to precipitation events with higher baseflows incl the water releases ds 7 9 during warmer summer months the high evaporation in the spreewald biosphere reserve where the river is distributed through numerous extensive small channels networks and wetlands along with small water abstraction and transfers to canals caused dramatic attenuation of flows and a sharp reduction in discharge ds 7 9 the spree river is also crossed by the oder spree canal near ds 9 where the river is completely intercepted by the canal therefore flows towards the m√ºggelsee the largest lake in berlin are affected by the outlet of the canal with sharp declining discharge rates at ds 10 water evaporation storage and abstraction via groundwater pumping from the m√ºggelsee results in discharge fluctuating significantly at the outlet of the lake ds 11 the highest discharge was at ds 12 where winter flows were highest but seasonality was modulated by weirs and ship locks effluent from wastewater water treatment plants and water abstraction for municipal use in addition higher runoff due to impermeable surfaces in the built environment also increased discharge at this station groundwater levels located outside any groundwater depression cones from mining were relatively close to the ground surface throughout the whole study period with means of 2 3 3 and 3 5 m below the ground surface in the upstream midstream and downstream sections respectively fig 2 c groundwater depth was deeper in the midstream and downstream sections than upstream generally water tables were also deeper in summer and shallower in winter and spring when groundwater recharge was highest 4 2 dynamics in stream water isotopes the synoptic surveys of surface water isotopes need to be understood in the context of the flow variations fig 4 some smaller rainfall events before the first survey in march increased discharge at most sites similarly a wet period in june preceding the summer survey resulted in some of the highest flows of the year in the upper parts though these showed a two week lag in the middle catchment october and december samples were collected after late summer and autumn rainfall increased flows again at most sites especially in the lower catchment compared to precipitation isotopes the seasonality in stream water isotopes was much more damped fig 4 though still evident with the largest seasonal increase of 1 60 for Œ¥18o compared to that of 5 75 for precipitation fig 3 stream water at most sites was enriched in heavier isotopes in june october and depleted in december march fig 4 exhibiting notable lags compared to precipitation isotope signals plotting data from all seasonal sampling campaigns in dual isotope space fig 5 a emphasised these distinct isotopic differences between seasons indicating evaporative fractionation effects isotopic signatures of major surface water sample sites were most depleted in march 2021 with mean Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h of 8 2 and 59 2 respectively in contrast the most enriched isotopic compositions were observed during the warm dry periods of june october with mean values 7 25 7 28 and 53 44 53 73 for Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h respectively fig 5a table 3 reflecting the continued influence of evaporative fractionation during the summer through to the autumn in december the majority of samples became more depleted again and the mean values were intermediate between march and june october december samples also showed the greatest range of isotopic values across the river network even when standardised across common sampling sites indicative groundwater samples in the mid and lower catchment were also shown as referenced isotopic values of the groundwater system independent from surface processes like fractionation fig 5 groundwater isotopic compositions were depleted and closer to the gmwl compared to most stream water samples spatially most of the stream water samples plotted below the gmwl except the samples of section 1 in march october and december fig 5 b e this implies that the occurrence of evaporation effects on stream water was most marked in the middle and downstream reaches of the spree river isotopes in section 1 were also more variable and more dispersed while they were more damped in the downstream sections indicating the mixing of rainfall snowmelt with stored water within the landscape as it traverses the sampled catchment throughout the year stream water isotopes were remarkably enriched downstream along the river course with Œ¥18o ranging from 10 0 to 4 2 and Œ¥2h ranging from 69 1 to 35 9 table s3 sites in upper sections were usually more depleted with mean values of 8 for Œ¥18o especially in march and december fig 6 a during those periods the isotopic differences between commonly sampled upper sites and downstream sites were most evident however in june and october changes in isotopic compositions were more limited downstream of the mid catchment fig 6 a isotopic signatures became particularly more enriched in the spreewald at section 3 showing strong evidence of fractionation fig 6 a deuterium excess d excess further illustrated the role of seasonality in the spatial variation in isotopes as an indicator of evaporation fig 6 b the spatial pattern in march was similar to that in december however the values of d excess near the outlet were not as low similar spatial patterns were also observed in june and october with lower d excess values in the upper reaches in june the lower values of d excess in june and october than in march and december indicated more pronounced evaporation in dry and warm months likewise d excess was lower in the downstream reaches than in the headwater reflecting more pronounced evaporation in the more urbanised and regulated areas the most fractionated water in midstream reaches e g the spreewald biosphere reserve decreased d excess downstream tritium concentrations show marked variations between sample sites along the river fig 7 highest concentrations were observed at sites s02 s03 s09 s17 and s19 s20 lowest values were found between s05 s08 s10 s15 and s18 set in a longer term context tritium concentrations in the spree have been in decline since the 1960s as tritium was released to the atmosphere via nuclear bomb tests schmidt et al 2020 since then tritium content in precipitation has declined to levels comparable to pre bomb levels fig 7 the variation along the spree shows the legacy effects at sites where concentrations are high and either influences of much older water e g pumped mine waters or younger waters e g in lakes where concentrations were low 4 3 evaporative losses based on isotope mass balance the first approximations of seasonal evaporation loss ratios e i or f in sections 3 to 5 are compared in fig 8 b evaporation losses of stream water peaked in october section 3 or december section 4 and section 5 reflecting the accumulation of evaporation from summer to autumn the e i or f in sections 4 and 5 were always 15 over all seasons while the highest e i in section 3 was up to 60 in october based on Œ¥18o seasonal and annual e i or f values of section 3 were significantly higher than that of the other sections indicating the influence of the spreewald with extensive wetlands canals and open waters on evaporation in addition the lowest slope of section 3 table 4 could also lengthen residence times of river water enhancing the opportunity for evaporative losses from the exposed water surface taking the whole spree catchment as a water body our results suggest a rough annual estimate of open water evaporative losses accounting for up to 13 75 Œ¥18o and 18 52 Œ¥2h with an average of 16 14 table 4 the obtained values of e i changes can be explained partly by the dynamics in stream water isotopes fig 8 a for sections 3 and 5 stream water isotopes at the most downstream sampling sites were significantly higher than at their first inflow sites fig 8 a leading to higher estimates on e i as in equation 1 this was not the case for section 4 which showed limited isotopic variability and subsequent lower evaporative losses this could be attributed to isotopically depleted water sources such as local groundwater offsetting isotopic enrichment caused by evaporation in stream water and causing underestimates 5 discussion 5 1 stream water sources inferred by spatial isotope variability in a large scale catchment isotope data from synoptic surveys can be used in conjunction with hydroclimatic records to examine how different water sources and hydrological processes influence the evolution of streamflow generation downstream in large catchments some studies gibson et al 2020 smith et al 2015 have shown systematic changes along natural rivers as basin characteristics change and lowland tributaries and groundwater contribute to streamflow in a heavily managed catchment like the spree such changes are obscured by effects of reservoir operations minewater management and evaporation from lakes and the large managed spreewald wetland making the quantification of controlling processes and their effects difficult combining precipitation and streamflow monitoring the variability in flow regimes and interannual isotopic analyses can elicit some understanding of primary source components i e groundwater snowmelt surface runoff contributing to the spree river the streamflow in section 1 exhibited rapid responses to precipitation events fig 2 and fig 4 particularly during storm periods which indicated more direct runoff links between precipitation and streamflow the dominant low permeability silt loam soils in section 1 promote lateral near surface flows in response to precipitation which was probably enhanced by agricultural drainage in this area with intensive arable farming this underlined the important influence of soil properties on runoff generation klaus et al 2015 slattery et al 2006 additionally section 1 was isotopically more depleted with larger temporal variability compared to the mid downstream areas fig 5 b e this was likely related to the more isotopically depleted precipitation at higher altitudes fig 3 the depletion in stream water in this section can also be attributed to contributions from more depleted shallower groundwater in upland areas reflecting higher recharge from winter rainfall but also the influence of winter rainfall and linked surface and near surface runoff processes an influence of shallower groundwater would also explain the elevated tritium in the upper catchment discharge in section 2 and section 3 i e the midstream sections also responded significantly to the storm events during autumn winter showing a marked runoff response to rainfall the increased baseflow in the mid catchment can be explained by the influence of pumped minewater over 250 km2 of the catchment is still affected by dewatering of coal measures in active open mines which can be 150 m deep the extensive wetlands distributed through section 3 have previously been identified as an area of high evaporative losses reflected in sharply decreased discharge during summer strongly enriched stream water isotopes and negative d excess fig 6 the downstream parts section 4 have the least variable discharges with consistently low values fig 2 despite high rainfall recorded from july to november the flow downstream did not respond significantly to such events reflecting the dominant role of reservoir weirs as well as longer term storage attenuation in lakes moreover many smaller lowland tributaries have become increasingly characterised as intermittent streams since the 2018 drought and thus did not add incrementally to summer baseflows downstream kuhlemann et al 2021 these factors as well as abstractions particularly to the oder spree canal result in a dominant effect of evaporative fraction on the isotopic composition of the stream with also isotopes inferring only limited contributions from lowland tributaries and aquifers in the most downstream areas section 5 i e berlin the effects of wastewater and urbanized tributaries are evident in the stream hydrograph kuhlemann et al 2022 kuhlemann et al 2020 but the isotopic signal remains strongly fractionated with the most enriched values fig 5 b e masking the isotopic depletion induced by wastewater and urban stream also although contributions to streamflow are mainly from groundwater fed tributaries lower rainfall high terrestrial evapotranspiration and low recharge rates 100 mm and leakage to deeper regional aquifers dictate that these inputs are relatively low contributions to flows in the lower catchment that was particularly the case in the study year which was affected by an ongoing drought since 2018 consequently the water isotope signatures reflected the complexity of the spree catchment including a variety of water sources management operations and hydrological processes along the river course with such a dataset we can help fill the gap between understanding gained from isotope studies in small or less heterogeneous catchments klaus et al 2015 sidle et al 2000 to better understand runoff generation and water sources in large scale catchments with heavily management and extensive wetland lakes although only one tritium survey was conducted it also clearly shows marked spatial differences in the concentrations with elevated levels in the catchment headwaters and reduced levels in the area of pumped mine waters throughout brandenburg tritium helium data from previous studies shows that groundwater is decadal in age in the upper aquifer and likely millennial at depths of 100 m bednorz and brose 2017 thus pumped minewater is likely to be very old 100 years and supress tritium levels downstream this influence is evident in the long term tritium data collected on the spree at fuerstenwalde located in section 4 and berlin section 5 schmidt et al 2020 some simple age modelling applications using this published long term tritium data in precipitation shows that recovery of tritium levels in the river over the past few decades gives ages of 100 years at the former site and 50 years at the latter fig 7 the younger ages in berlin likely reflect the increased influence of younger urban runoff from the metropolitan area marx et al 2021 although only a first approximation such old water dominance underlines the complex hydrology of the spree and the ongoing influence of flow regulation by pumped minewater which is complicated further by reservoir operation and evaporation through lakes and wetlands this makes the catchment somewhat different from less disturbed catchments which show a much lower influence of older groundwater and a dominance of young water jasechko et al 2016 5 2 the effect of open water evaporation on the water balance high levels of evaporation from the spree network and its associated reservoirs lakes and wetlands are reflected by high degree of isotopic enrichment and negative d excess values isotopic enrichment is most evident in june and october with the river network becoming more depleted during march and december figs 5 and 6 in particular the large area of open water and wetlands in the spreewald biosphere reserve section 3 created additional storage that enhanced evaporation and decreased discharges thus providing increased isotopic enrichment downstream figs 5 and 6 and resulting in the largest estimation of evaporative losses in section 3 fig 8 previous work has found similar isotopic enrichment and used it to estimate evaporation rates from lakes or entire catchments gibson 2001 skrzypek et al 2015 vystavna et al 2021 the continued enrichment in stream water isotopes in section 4 and section 5 together with the low annual runoff shows that evaporation in section 3 strongly influenced the runoff dynamics downstream however given the limited data collected so far the c g model based on isotope mass balance provides only a rough and likely conservative approximation of the evaporative losses relative to observed large scale variation in stream water isotope ratios in our study area especially in sections 4 and 5 which showed anomalously low evaporation rates compared to other large scale catchments gibson and edwards 2002 skrzypek et al 2015 zhu et al 2021 in section 4 large amounts of water abstracted into the canal may also have an impact on the e i ratio because the fractionation signals are lost the wastewater and urban runoff comprise an increasing source of streamflow in section 5 i e berlin previous work has shown that the urban tributaries of the spree in berlin are isotopically depleted due to waste water effluents kuhlemann et al 2022 in these cases the isotopes of outflows were lighter than expected which in turn would lead to reduction of derived evaporation estimates in addition the heavy rainfall in july 2021 fig 2 b instigated a flow response across the catchment which likely off set the fractionation effects from early summer evaporation and resulted in low estimates knowledge about such evaporation fractionation processes within catchments is critical for understanding and constraining regional water balances bennett et al 2008 gibson and edwards 2002 gibson and reid 2014 and can help calibrate benchmark rainfall runoff models anderton et al 2002 birkel et al 2014 however in highly managed lowland catchments like the spree the e i ratio can vary due to the influence of groundwater isokangas et al 2015 seasonal floods brock et al 2009 extensive wetland gibson 2002 or chains of lakes gibson and reid 2014 in these cases e i ratios may have been under over estimated due to the isotopic dilution enrichment induced by the inflow or outflow hence these evaporation assessments should be regarded as a conservative first approximation though with ongoing sampling and further investigation the spatial and temporal variability of these estimates will be better constrained 5 3 wider implications water availability in the spree catchment one of the major rivers in berlin is strongly impacted by climate dynamics and anthropogenic activities the recent warmer temperatures and extended dry periods such as the 2018 drought point towards more severe climate warming in the future gerstengarbe et al 2003 lotze campen et al 2009 along with growing water demands the long history of complex management and the cessation of lignite mining activities planned in 2038 these developments contribute to a potentially fragile water resource situation and raise the prospect for potential water supply problems in berlin therefore the complex hydrology of the spree river needs to be better understood and insights from isotopes can be invaluable in terms of quantifying sources of runoff and age distributions the observed high annual evaporative losses 10 especially in the midstream sections indicated that the evaporation of the surface water is an important driver in the reduction of stream discharge throughout the spree catchment hence water management strategies need be adjusted or developed in future to avoid the river intermittency and to maintain the ecological and hydrological functions of the spreewald biosphere reserve although our approach i e spatially synoptic surveys covered contrasting seasons the dictations on temporal variabilities in hydrology and water sources were partially limited by the coarse temporal resolution of the sampling obviously higher resolution sampling especially with synchronous precipitation groundwater sampling e g von freyberg et al 2017 over longer time periods will likely reveal more complex dynamics than what were observed in our study therefore this is a preliminary study but can be used as a learning framework guiding future sampling which will aim to be more frequent i e monthly or weekly such improved monitoring will improve hydrological models through the integration of water isotopes in hydrological modelling across larger spatial scales and time periods which have been shown to constrain parameters and reduce uncertainty in model predictions dunn et al 2008 fenicia et al 2008 soulsby et al 2015 in addition such models will crucially need to interface with water resource assessment tools to capture the integrated effect of the control rules for the various managed releases and abstractions that dominate in some parts of the spree catchment cf pohle et al 2019 6 conclusions our study has demonstrated the potential of combining tracers with hydroclimatic records to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the hydrology to clarify the spatial controls thereon and to indicate the degree of evaporative losses in large river systems offering new insights into water resources management in water stressed rapidly growing urban areas like berlin overall spatial variation in river stable isotope composition reflects that of precipitation and groundwater recharge being depleted in heavy isotopes in the catchment headwaters and becoming more enriched downstream however the effects of evaporative fractionation are evident below the reservoirs near cottbus and then become accentuated through the spreewald and lowland lakes where evaporative losses are high and streamflow attenuation is marked inflows in the lower catchment moderate these fractionation effects though only slightly artificial pumping of older groundwater impacts tritium concentrations and results in streamflow being dominated by older water i e 100 years in the lower catchment while younger water became more influential in the urban parts of berlin dominated by urban runoff the current hydrology of the spree river is complex and reflects the long term evolution of water management this management will likely need to rapidly adapt to the impacts of climate change and increased economic pressures on the catchment water resources isotopes have an important role in providing an evidence base for decision making focused on water security in such a complex catchment hence synoptic surveys are continuing for both stable isotopes and tritium at the spree in order to better constrain the current spatial and temporal dynamics of water sources and ages and assist projections on how they may change under future climate and management credit
