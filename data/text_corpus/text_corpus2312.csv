11560,the gradual increase in the amount of land and water resources affected by salt in arid and semi arid regions requires strategies to optimize the use of these marginal quality resources recent field and greenhouse experiments have demonstrated the potential of growing certain pre selected varieties of alfalfa in highly saline conditions a greenhouse study was conducted to determine the impact of irrigation with saline groundwater on alfalfa growth and production in saline sodic soils the sustainability of the system in terms of forage yield and quality was also evaluated the study included three varieties of alfalfa medicago sativa vars sw8421s pgi908s and wl656hq planted in pots filled with saline sodic soil calcic haplosalids collected on the island of lanzarote spain and irrigated for 18 months with increasingly saline water although the yield of the alfalfa varieties was reduced by an average of 7 20 31 and 46 as the salinity of the irrigation water increased from 0 4 ds m 1 to 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 ds m 1 respectively their relative salt tolerance based on the average electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract ece was much higher than those established in the literature based on their nutritional quality all alfalfa varieties are categorized as supreme quality with metabolizable energy me values in excess of 10 mj kg 1 moreover no detriment to quality was observed at the higher levels of irrigation water salinity mineral composition analysis revealed s k and b levels near or above the established maximum tolerable levels mtls suggesting that this forage could only be safely consumed by ruminants over the long term if combined with other forages with lower mineral content keywords medicago sativa biosaline agriculture saline groundwater salinity tolerance forage quality 1 introduction the gradual reduction in the quantity and quality of conventional water resources for agricultural use in arid and semi arid regions representing 40 of the world s 270 million irrigated hectares smedema and shiati 2002 has necessitated the supplementation of new water resources obtained from the desalination of saline groundwater and seawater díaz et al 2013a b martínez alvarez et al 2017 in both cases salt removal by reversible electrodialysis or reverse osmosis entails high energy costs with a correspondingly high co2 footprint that prevents the extensive use of this water for irrigation irrigation with such water is economically feasible only for high value agricultural crops beltran and koo oshima 2006 moreover even if desalinized water of this type is considered high quality water by farmers initial experiences with desalinated water have not proven totally positive yermiyahu et al 2007 ben gal et al 2009 in addition desalination processes generate considerable amounts of brine which can negatively impact the quality of surface and groundwater sources and marine biological communities that develop naturally under saline conditions riera et al 2012 along with desalination processes for providing additional water resources alternative agricultural practices that rely on the use of marginal soil and water resources affected by salinity are needed rozema and flowers 2008 az et al 2013a b díaz et al 2013b biosaline agriculture i e economically sustainable crop production using irrigation water and soils with a wide range of salinity levels has gained popularity in recent years in arid and semiarid regions in various parts of the world due primarily to the limited supply of good quality irrigation water masters et al 2007 this type of farming based on plants capable of growing in saline conditions can lead to an economically viable market for salt tolerant crops while also expanding crop production into marginal lands thus alleviating pressure on conventional water resources díaz and grattan 2009 potential benefits range from the production of food for human consumption renewable energy bioethanol and biodiesel and materials for industrial use fibre and oil to a series of applications in revegetation soil rehabilitation and carbon fixation projects grattan et al 2008 az et al 2013a b díaz et al 2013b one of the main potential benefits of biosaline agriculture is the production of forage for livestock masters et al 2007 the production of forage in biosaline agriculture however is not problem free the most important problems include 1 the salinisation of the soils 2 imbalances in the mineral composition of the forage and 3 the accumulation of trace elements in forage tissue to levels that can be toxic for livestock díaz and grattan 2009 grattan et al 2004a the first of these problems requires control and application of management techniques particularly adequate leaching to prevent the continued accumulation of salt in the soil in order to address nutritional imbalances and toxicity it is important to control the mineral composition of the forages choosing those that are not only tolerant to salinity but which also minimise the accumulation of toxic elements and offer a more balanced composition moreover most potential nutritional disorders caused by biosaline agriculture forages can be avoided by using the latter only as a supplement to the overall animal diet never as the sole forage robinson et al 2004 the present study evaluates the use of saline soils and saline groundwater to grow different varieties of alfalfa medicago sativa l which is one of the most important forages in arid and semi arid regions across the world djilianov et al 2003 alfalfa has historically been classified as moderately sensitive to saline conditions with significant yield declines as the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil paste extract ece exceeds 2 ds m 1 ayers and westcott 1985 however a series of recent studies have shown that some pre selected alfalfa varieties can thrive in much higher salt concentrations both in soil and in irrigation water without significant negative effects on productivity putnam et al 2017 given the potential interest of these results for arid and semi arid regions it is important to confirm these findings in a broader range of soils and environmental conditions in addition although alfalfa is one of the most important forage crops regarding its high protein content digestibility palatability and milk production qualities very few studies provide information concerning the effects of salinity on the nutritional quality of the crop ferreira et al 2015 the present greenhouse study used saline sodic soils and saline groundwater both of which are common in arid and semi arid parts of the canary islands to grow varieties of alfalfa marketed as tolerant to salinity the primary objective was to determine the impact of different saline conditions on biomass production nutritional quality and mineral composition of the selected varieties and to evaluate the evolution of the soil salinity under the study conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design a two way factorial experiment with four replications per treatment 3 alfalfa varieties 5 irrigation water qualities 1 soil type 4 replications n 60 was conducted using mesocosms soils placed in containers 40 cm in diameter and 50 cm in height with an apparent soil bulk density of approximately 1 2 g cm 3 pots were arranged using a completely randomized design the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse belonging to the canarian institute for agricultural research on the island of tenerife spain where the air temperature during the study period november 2014 april 2016 ranged from 9 to 47 c average 21 5 c and relative humidity from 17 to 94 average 68 4 five water quality treatments with salinity levels eciw of 0 4 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 ds m 1 were applied the water with salinity of 0 4 ds m 1 corresponding to seawater desalinated using reverse osmosis was used as the control treatment the other treatments simulated the quality of sodic chloride dominated groundwater typically found in coastal wells on the islands of lanzarote and fuerteventura spain with the eciw adjusted to between 2 5 and 10 ds m 1 the salinity range frequently found in coastal groundwaters in the canary islands the boron concentration was set at 2 5 mg l 1 for all treatments representing the maximum concentration found in the groundwaters of these areas the simulation of the irrigation waters was conducted using desalinated seawater with nacl mgso4 caso4 na2so4 kno3 nahco3 and h3bo3 added in proper proportions to reflect the composition of the reference groundwater the different irrigation waters were analysed fortnightly to ensure salt concentration targets were met the following parameters were tested ph

four pressure compensating emitters per container each with a flow of 2 l h 1 water distribution uniformity was evaluated periodically using the low quarter distribution uniformity method dulq burt et al 1997 and values were consistently 0 98 monitoring of volumetric water content with ec 5 sensors decagon devices allowed calculation of the required irrigation dosages to maintain the soils close to pot capacity comparable to field capacity throughout the whole study period table 1 shows the average chemical composition of the waters used for irrigation during the experiment as can be seen the salinity obtained with the different treatments ec differed slightly from the target concentrations ec target the ph of the waters obtained was slightly alkaline varying between 7 8 and 8 7 as is common in the sodic chloride dominated waters of coastal parts of the canary islands the soil used was a calcic haplosalids from the island of lanzarote soil survey staff 2006 physicochemical characterisation of the soil was performed prior to application of fertilisers and irrigation in accordance with standard methods soil survey staff 1996 the following parameters were analysed texture

the b adsorption isotherm shows that retention of this element was moderate data not shown the soil had very low organic matter and nitrogen content as is common of soils in arid regions the low nutrient content necessitated the use of basal fertilisation 300 g of fertiliser npk 21 10 10 30 g gypsum and 500 g goat manure per container to prevent masking the salinity effects with any nutritional deficiencies the chemical parameters analysed at the beginning of the experiment were re analysed at its conclusion to evaluate the impact of the application of the irrigation treatments the bottom of each pot contained a 3 cm gravel layer to facilitate drainage three non dormant cultivars of alfalfa medicago sativa were selected varieties wl656hq sw8421s pgi908s based on their reported salt tolerance during germination and or forage production pgi908s has been classified as salt tolerant during germination and forage production sw8421s as salt tolerant only during forage production and wl656hq as tolerant only during germination nafa 2016 in order to reduce the salinity of this highly saline soil near the surface of the pot 2 liters of desalinated seawater were added to each pot daily for 10 days prior to sowing this provided a low saline environment for the germinating seeds after this minor reclamation of the surface soil a total of 60 seeds were planted per container to foster germination and crop establishment only irrigation with desalinated seawater was applied to all pots in the first stage of the experiment following this initial period 60 days post seeding the number of plants were thinned to approximately 28 plants per pot and the application of the treatments which lasted for 430 days commenced 2 2 analysis of plant material a total of 15 harvests also referred to as cuttings were performed on forages throughout the treatment period to determine the total production of dry matter dm harvest times were established when the control treatment plants reached approximately 10 flowering the cutting height was established at 5 6 cm above the soil surface the collected plant material was weighed oven dried at 60 c for 72 h and weighed again to determine dry matter production expressed in grams per square meter the cumulative biomass production of each of the treatments was calculated as the sum of the material obtained from the different cuts the relative yield was expressed as the relationship between the biomass produced under the different treatments to that obtained under the control treatment lowest salinity these relative yields were used as an indicator of salinity tolerance díaz and grattan 2009 once dry the plant material collected from each cut was finely ground to analyse the mineral composition and nutritional quality from this three combined samples were obtained by combining the plant material from every 5 consecutive cuts thus the first sample was comprised of plant material from cuts 1 5 corresponding to the first 124 days from the commencement of the treatment application the second sample was comprised of combined cuts 6 10 corresponding to days 124 269 from commencement and the third sample consisted of combined cuts 11 15 corresponding to days 269 430 the nutritional potential of the forages was evaluated on the basis of ash content neutral detergent fibre ndf acid

quality and alfalfa variety on biomass production shoot mineral composition and forage quality 3 results 3 1 impact of irrigation on soil chemical properties the salinity exchangeable cation content nutrients and trace elements in the soils after 430 days of application of the different treatments are shown in table 2 soil ece decreased significantly compared to the initial soil regardless of the treatment applied based on the stationary model described by ayers and westcot 1985 for the relationships between eciw irrigation water salinity and ece our data indicate that the leaching fraction obtained was approximately 4 for the control treatment 0 4 ds m 1 gradually increasing to 12 for the most saline treatments 10 0 ds m 1 levels of exchangeable na and espc increased slightly compared to the initial soil in the saline treatments above 2 5 ds m 1 in general there was a significant reduction in the levels of exchangeable k compared to the initial soil and an increase in the ca2 and mg2 cations a significant increase was also found in carbonate content for all treatments compared to the initial soil accumulation of extractable b in the soils was greater under the least saline treatments 0 4 and 2 5 ds m 1 regarding nutrients significant increases in available p at the end of the experiment compared to the initial soil were observed for the least saline treatments slight increases were also seen in organic c and tn micronutrient levels did not undergo significant changes with respect to initial levels except for zn which increased compared to the initial soil regardless of the treatment applied table 2 3 2 biomass production the cumulative production of biomass for the various alfalfa varieties under the different irrigation treatments is shown in fig 1 statistical analysis reveals that production was affected by the treatment variety and duration of the study period broadly speaking the variety with the lowest production was wl656hq with an average of 1478 g m 2 per period compared to the 1550 and 1575 g m 2 obtained with varieties sw8421s and pgi908s respectively increased irrigation water salinity led to a significant decline in biomass production for all varieties the average across all the varieties for the control treatment 0 4 ds m 1 was 1938 38 g m 2 compared to 1800 85 1558 98 1327 41 and 1048 37 g m 2 for the 2 5 5 9 7 5 and 10 0 ds m 1 treatments respectively plant age also significantly influenced production with the third study period presenting higher biomass levels than the previous two 1773 g m 2 compared to 1443 and 1386 g m 2 for periods 1 and 2 the highest production rate expressed as kilogrammes of dry matter per hectare per day kg dm ha 1 d 1 was 137 treatment 0 4 ds m 1 var pgi908s while the lowest was 70 treatment 10 ds m 1 var wl656hq the relative yield relationship between the biomass produced under the different salinity treatments and the control treatment according to the irrigation water salinity and soil salinity are presented in figs 2 and 3 respectively these data indicate that as irrigation water salinity increased i e 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 ds m 1 alfalfa yield was reduced by 7 20 31 and 46 respectively fig 2 statistical analysis indicates that this reduction is significant from 5 0 ds m 1 as listed in table 2 the treatments of 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 ds m 1 in the irrigation water produced average soil salinity ece of 12 6 16 8 19 1 and 19 3 ds m 1 respectively at the end of the study period according to the equation shown in fig 3 the one that best describes our data those ece levels produced a decline in production by 12 1 23 6 31 6 and 32 3 respectively 3 3 forage quality the change in forage ash content ndf adf cp rfv and me during the study period for the different alfalfa varieties under the different water quality treatments are illustrated in figs 4 and 5 cp varied between 24 8 and 32 9 dm and was significantly affected by irrigation water salinity and the study period but not by the variety or the interaction of the three factors fig 4 the highest cp content was mostly found in the 7 5 5 0 and 2 5 ds m 1 treatments which were significantly higher than the control 0 4 ds m 1 and the highest salinity 10 ds m 1 treatments cp levels varied over time with a significant increase seen in the last period mean 30 2 dm as compared to the two previous ones mean 29 7 and 27 7 dm for periods 1 and 2 respectively ndf and adf were significantly affected by the age of the plants fig 4 significant increases were seen between the first period and periods 2 and 3 for example the average adf value for all the varieties was 15 1 in period 1 compared to 18 0 and 18 2 for periods 2 and 3 respectively the effect of the variety of alfalfa was significant only for ndf with sw8421s presenting the lowest average value for the entire study period 26 2 dm and wl656hq the highest 27 1 dm only adf was significantly influenced by the level of irrigation water salinity in general the 5 and 7 5 ds m 1 treatments showed the lowest adf levels mean 16 6 and 16 7 dm respectively which were significantly lower than those of the least saline treatments 17 6 and 17 4 dm for 0 4 and 2 5 ds m 1 respectively ash content ranged from 10 4 to 16 2 dm throughout the study period and did not differ significantly between varieties although it was affected by the salinity of the irrigation water and the age of the plant fig 5 in general the highest values were found in plants under the control treatment mean 13 3 dm and the lowest in the 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 ds m 1 treatments mean 12 6 dm older plants had significantly less ash content decreasing from an average of 14 4 dm in the first period to 12 4 dm in the last relative feed value rfv ranged from 213 to 367 and was significantly affected by the alfalfa variety and time of sampling although not by the saline treatments fig 5 the variety with the highest value was sw8421s 271 31 compared to wl656hq which had the lowest 262 30 the youngest plants first sample had an average value of 303 which was significantly higher than those from the later sampling periods 245 and 251 for periods 2 and 3 respectively metabolisable energy me the energy potential of the forage varied between 9 9 and 10 8 mj kg 1 dm fig 5 in general me did not differ significantly between the varieties studied nor did it change significantly over time however it was affected by the saline treatments the highest values were found under intermediate salinities of 5 and 7 5 ds m 1 mean 10 5 mj kg 1 dm while the control plants averaged 10 3 mj kg 1 dm 3 4 forage mineral composition table 3 lists mean values for macronutrients and na in the collected plant material for the three varieties under the different water quality treatments and for the three study periods statistical analysis shows that the concentrations of all elements except p were affected by salinity and by the degree of maturity of the plants although no significant differences were observed between the varieties of alfalfa levels of n ranged between 23 9 and 54 2 g kg 1 with significant differences only between plants treated with 7 5 ds m 1 water and those in the control treatment mean 46 4 and 44 1 g kg 1 respectively the lowest values were found in period 2 mean 43 2 g kg 1 compared to 46 1 and 46 4 g kg 1 for periods 1 and 3 respectively average p concentration in sampled forage during the study period was 4 5 g kg 1 and was significantly lower in period 2 mean 4 2 g kg 1 than in periods 1 and 3 mean 4 5 and 4 7 g kg 1 respectively concentrations of k in the forage decreased gradually with increased salinity of the irrigation water falling from an average of 37 8 g kg 1 in plants from the control treatment to 27 1 g kg 1 in plants from the 10 ds m 1 treatment a decrease in forage k content with increased plant age was also observed the mean of 38 5 g kg 1 for period 1 falling to 29 9 g kg 1 in period 3 likewise k ca in the forage decreased gradually with increased salinity control treatment mean 19 8 g kg 1 vs 10 ds m 1 treatment mean 12 7 g kg 1 and with plant age period 1 mean 20 8 g kg 1 vs period 3 mean 12 9 g kg 1 conversely the mg content in the forage increased with salinity averaging 4 0 g kg 1 in plants from the control treatment and 5 0 g kg 1 from those in the 10 ds m 1 treatment and mg content also rose slightly with plant age concentrations of s increased with the salinity of the irrigation water 4 5 vs 5 6 g kg 1 in the control treatment and most saline treatment respectively and decreased with plant age 5 9 vs 4 8 g kg 1 in periods 1 and 3 respectively plant tissue na increased by a factor of 7 0 between the control treatment and the most saline treatment 10 ds m 1 and by a factor of 2 4 between the first and last study periods the mean micronutrient and cl concentrations in the collected plant material under the different irrigation water qualities and for the three periods are presented in table 4 statistical analysis of the data indicates that with the exception of zn the concentrations of all micronutrients were affected by the salinity treatment and by the degree of plant maturity but no significant differences were found among the varieties tested levels of mn and cu in the forage increased with the increases in irrigation water salinity whereas the fe b and cl content decreased table 4 mn increased by a factor of 1 3 between the control and most saline treatments with cu increasing by a factor of 1 1 levels of fe fell from 101 5 mg kg 1 dm in the control treatment to 92 4 in the 10 ds m 1 treatment in the case of b the greatest differences in forage concentration were found between the control treatment mean 158 4 mg kg 1 and the treatment with 7 5 ds m 1 salinity mean 99 7 mg kg 1 forage cl concentration was interesting in that all samples regardless of treatment or time of sampling contained high levels i e 1 4 2 7 dw however the only significant differences in forage concentration that were observed was between plants from the 2 5 ds m 1 treatment mean of 22 2 g cl kg 1 and those from the 7 5 and 10 ds m 1 treatments mean of 19 0 g cl kg 1 with regard to the study period the concentration of all micronutrients except b decreased significantly with plant age for example average fe concentration in period 1 was 108 2 mg kg 1 compared to 88 6 mg kg 1 in the last period for the most part average b levels were lowest in period 1 mean 96 7 mg kg 1 and increased to 135 1 and 126 mg kg 1 in the later periods 4 discussion 4 1 impact of irrigation on soil chemical properties leaching fractions obtained in this experiment coincide with the concept of evapotranspiration soil salinity leaching fraction interactions developed by others letey et al 1985 that is for the same quantity of water applied when the irrigation water salinity increases growth decreases evapotranspiration decreases and the leaching fraction increases leading to a reduction in soil salinity larger accumulation of extractable b in the soils under the least saline treatments was possibly a result of the greater use of water by the plants under these treatments which translated to lower leaching fractions díaz and grattan 2009 the observed increase in exchangeable na levels were likely a result of the saline sodic nature of the irrigation water an increase in some nutrients i e ca mg p n zn may have been due to the addition of manure and fertiliser at the beginning of the experiment uptake and leaching of zn could occur to a lesser extent than with other micronutrients likely due to fixation sorption on calcium carbonate alloway 2008 4 2 biomass production the production rate for the alfalfa varieties in our experiment 70 137 kg dm ha 1 d 1 were similar or slightly higher than those reported by others in similar studies conducted with saline tolerant varieties of alfalfa for variety sw8421s cornacchione and suarez 2015 obtained 99 and 69 kg dm ha 1 d 1 with irrigation water ec of 3 and 12 ds m 1 respectively other authors record rates of 74 kg dm ha 1 d 1 for var salado and 86 kg dm ha 1 d 1 for var sw9720 with irrigation water ec of 15 ds m 1 grattan et al 2004b these differences in productivity may be due to differences in the environmental conditions temperature humidity and to different soil conditions physical characteristics availability of nutrients and water etc cornacchione and suarez 2015 found no significant effect of salinity on the reduction in biomass production up to 12 ds m 1 ec in the irrigation water reduction of 25 while in this experiment reduction is significant from 5 0 ds m 1 these differences are due to the different types of substrate used in each case cornacchione and suarez 2015 used a sand tank system with high irrigation frequency with leaching fractions approaching 100 such that the irrigation water salinity was comparable to the soil water salinity since the salinity of the soil solution is about twice that of the saturated soil extract their 12 ds m 1 irrigation treatment is equivalent to an ece of about 6 ds m 1 in our study the high water holding capacity of the fine textured soil facilitates salt accumulation including where high leaching fractions are applied alfalfa traditionally classified as moderately sensitive to salinity is reported to tolerate up to 2 ds m 1 ece but suffers a productivity decline of approximately 7 3 for each unit increase in ece above this threshold value maas and grattan 1999 using the current guidelines the theoretical reduction in production would be 77 4 for the lowest salinity 12 6 ds m 1 and 100 for ece above 16 ds m 1 significantly higher than those obtained in our experiment these results confirm that some varieties of alfalfa can grow at much higher salinity than the guidelines indicate without exhibiting significant yield declines for example the ece50 value using the guidelines is 8 8 ds m 1 while the ece50 based on this study is 23 5 ds m 1 similar results have been reported by other authors including putnam et al 2017 who following a 3 year field study in a clay loam soil with applications of 5 7 ds m 1 eciw obtained alfalfa production levels similar to those obtained with non saline water in the same type of soil irrigation using water with 8 10 ds m 1 eciw caused yield declines of 10 15 compared to the control treatment although economically acceptable production was still achieved the observed increase in biomass production with plant age was likely a result of the progressive reduction in soil salinity due to the very high initial ece along the experimental period results also confirm a lower salt tolerance of variety wl656hq in forage production with respect to the other two assessed cultivars 4 3 forage quality generally speaking forage quality increases as cp rfv and me increase and ndf adf and ash content decrease suyama et al 2007a the levels of cp found coincide largely with those reported by other authors for varieties of alfalfa grown in saline conditions suyama et al 2007a ferreira et al 2015 however some studies report an increase in cp when irrigation water salinity increases ferreira et al 2015 this rise is attributed to a salinity induced increase in the leaf stem ratio al khatib et al 1992 leaves are richer in photosynthetic components with high n content whereas the stems present more structural components with low n content in our case no uniform behaviour was observed the increase in cp content at greater salinity was observed only in the first sampling period fig 4 during subsequent periods a significant decrease in cp content at the highest level of salinity 10 0 ds m 1 was found isotopic n content δ15n analyses carried out as part of this study but addressed separately in a companion paper currently in preparation indicate that salinity negatively affected atmospheric nitrogen fixation which may account for the decrease in cp observed under the most saline treatments the percentages of fibre found in the present study 19 9 32 3 ndf and 17 1 23 6 adf were slightly lower than those reported for variety sw8421s under treatments of 12 7 24 0 ds m 1 ferreira et al 2015 but similar to those reported by robinson et al 2004 for salado and sw9720 using waters with 15 and 25 ds m 1 22 34 ndf to irrigate alfalfa in sand tanks equivalent to those used later by cornacchione and suarez 2015 in both cases the authors observed a reduction in fibre content with increased irrigation water salinity such a reduction observed by others in other types of forage ben ghedalia et al 2001 and which can reach 12 2 in ndf compared to the control treatments is also attributed to an increase in the leaf stem ratio with higher irrigation water salinity ferreira et al 2015 in our case a gradual reduction in adf content at higher salinity was observed only in the first period fig 4 with a difference of approximately 2 between the control plants and those in the most saline treatments however this trend disappeared in subsequent periods and in general a slight decrease 1 was noted only up to salinity of 7 5 ds m 1 with an increase once again at 10 ds m 1 fig 4 in the present experiment the most saline treatments could have negatively affected leaf production for example through a low atmospheric nitrogen fixation and lower water use efficiency thus decreasing the leaf stem ratio textural differences between the substrates used sand tanks vs clay soil and differences in the experimental conditions i e amount and frequency of irrigation are key factors that account for discrepancies between the two studies plant age is one of the most important factors influencing fibre content and a significant increase was observed over time as reported also by other authors for the same varieties stefanon et al 1996 robinson et al 2004 ferreira et al 2015 robinson et al 2004 for instance found an increase in ndf from 18 6 to 42 6 between the first and fifth cut of alfalfa irrigated with saline water a reduction in ash content with increased irrigation water salinity has been reported by others for different forages under greenhouse conditions ben ghedalia et al 2001 robinson et al 2004 suyama et al 2007a for example suyama et al 2007a found a reduction of 2 between alfalfa irrigated with non saline 0 8 ds m 1 and highly saline water 18 0 ds m 1 however the reduction in ash content over time observed in this experiment is not consistent with data obtained by cao et al 2012 who noted an increase in ash content over time in irrigated alfalfa in saline soils in our case the high initial salinity of the soils 54 ds m 1 which was reduced substantially by the irrigations applied before treatments were imposed may have led to a greater accumulation of salt in the young plants and indeed this was found tissue cl for example was 2 3 2 7 dw regardless of treatment in plants composited from the first series of cuts the concentrations decreased below 2 0 for all treatments in subsequent sampling periods it is likely that excessive salt was absorbed by plants in this saline soil at early times while soil saline below the soil surface was still very high as plants were later stressed growth and consequently et was reduced allowing for high leaching of this highly saline soil this may explain why tissue cl decreased with increased salinity treatment plant age appears to be the main factor influencing rfv indicating that the plants nutritional value declines slightly as they become older old plants are mainly associated with increased fibre content as much of the biomass is comprised of woody stems rfv levels also suggest that variety wl656hq is slightly lower in quality than the other two analysed values obtained here were slightly higher than those reported for alfalfas irrigated with saline water by ferreira et al 2015 who observed a significant increase in rfv 5 2 when the irrigation water salinity increased from 12 7 to 18 4 ds m 1 eciw similarly suyama et al 2007a found me values of 9 2 10 0 and 10 3 mj kg 1 dm in young alfalfa irrigated using water with 0 8 11 and 18 ds m 1 eciw respectively and attributed the increase in me with salinity to the fact that the plants under saline treatments were less mature than their control treatment counterparts at the time of cutting in contrast to those studies no clear positive association was observed here between nutritional quality and the level of salinity in the irrigation water however an increase in quality was seen up to 5 and 7 5 ds m 1 eciw compared to the control treatments but not at higher salinities these dissimilarities could be explained by differences in the substrates used in our case we used heavy textured soils that could potentially reduce soil physical conditions which would impose other abiotic or biotic stresses that limit crop development under high salinity sodicity conditions based on the quality parameters analysed and regardless of the irrigation water quality all the varieties can be classed as supreme quality putnam et al 2008 adequate for dairy livestock and for producing fast growing calves suyama et al 2007b a reflection of their very high nutritional content 4 4 forage mineral composition the mineral composition of crops can be affected by salinity which causes nutritional imbalances due to its effects on nutrient availability competitive absorption transport and compartmentation in the tissues grattan and grieve 1999 accordingly the mineral composition of plant tissue in the aerial part of forage plants grown under saline conditions needs to be monitored over time here the concentrations of the different elements analysed were compared with the established maximum tolerable levels mtls in order to evaluate the potential impact on mineral nutrition in ruminants nrc 2005 of the elements studied in the forages obtained only k s and b showed concentrations above the values considered adequate nrc 2005 putnam et al 2008 potential problems associated with consumption of these forages may include i hypomagnesemia a metabolic disorder in ruminants affecting the bioavailability of magnesium in the rumen high concentrations of k in the forage reduce mg absorption and can trigger this condition mcdowell and valle 2000 the maximum tolerable level for k has been set at 20 000 mg k kg 1 dm nrc 2005 this might be considered conservative given that some research suggests that ruminants can tolerate levels of between 30 000 50 000 mg k kg 1 dm in their diet without manifesting adverse effects nrc 2005 the alfalfa varieties studied here exceeded this value averaging between 20 000 and 44 000 mg k kg 1 dm table 3 the fact that k levels generally decrease with increases in irrigation water salinity makes k toxicity caused by alfalfa grown in saline conditions unlikely ii polioencephalomalacia pem a high concentration of s in forage can prove toxic to ruminants manifesting as failures in the central nervous system and brain lesions gould 2000 a further problem associated with high s concentrations is cu deficiency spears 2003 cu availability decreases as concentrations of s and mo increase in the rumen due to the formation of complexes such as thiomolybdates that are not readily absorbed by the animal spears 2003 an increase from 0 2 to 0 4 of s in the diet can cause cu absorption to fall by 50 to avoid these problems the mtl has been set at 0 30 and 0 50 s dm for diets with 85 and 40 forage respectively nrc 2005 concentrations of this element in the alfalfa varieties studied here were near or above the mtl mean 0 30 0 61 dm table 3 and were generally higher with higher irrigation water salinity accordingly s accumulation could represent a constraint on the use of these forages iii b toxicity b is considered relatively non toxic and most animals tolerate it well even if some research suggests that toxicity may occur in animals that consume high amounts of b nrc 2005 findings which have led the mtl to be set at 135 mg b kg 1 dm for livestock nrc 2005 in our study b concentrations generally decreased with increased irrigation water salinity an effect already observed by various authors in different crops yermiyahu et al 2008 díaz and grattan 2009 the mtl was exceeded only slightly in the least saline treatments 0 4 and 2 5 ds m 1 these results suggest the existence of interactions that increase b tolerance under saline conditions one possible reason for this could be the reduction in plant water uptake under higher salinity levels which reduces tissue accumulation of b yermiyahu et al 2008 other authors attribute the reduction in b to interactions with so4 2 and cl grattan et al 2004c high levels of k s and b close to or above mtls have been reported for alfalfa by other authors who used saline water for irrigation grattan et al 2004a suyama et al 2007b 5 conclusions the results obtained in this experiment confirm some recent findings concerning the salt tolerance of certain varieties of alfalfa which suggest that the tolerance guidelines set in the literature for this crop should be reassessed our study confirms that alfalfa traditionally considered moderately sensitive to salinity can grow in conditions of high soil and irrigation water salinity e g ece 10 ds m 1 eciw 5 ds m 1 without suffering large reductions in biomass compared to non saline conditions these results are particularly important for arid regions including the easternmost canary islands which lack quality water but do have an abundance of salt affected water and soils as well as a high demand for livestock feed one of the main economic activities in these areas the forages obtained were of good quality for dairy goat diets falling into the high category from the standpoint of nutritional quality based on usda quality guidelines in terms of mineral nutrition for ruminants concentrations of k b and s in particular would require monitoring to determine if forages are approaching maximum tolerable concentrations above which animals exclusively consuming this forage over extended periods could face potential toxicity should this occur the forages could still be used as a dietary supplement in

11560,the gradual increase in the amount of land and water resources affected by salt in arid and semi arid regions requires strategies to optimize the use of these marginal quality resources recent field and greenhouse experiments have demonstrated the potential of growing certain pre selected varieties of alfalfa in highly saline conditions a greenhouse study was conducted to determine the impact of irrigation with saline groundwater on alfalfa growth and production in saline sodic soils the sustainability of the system in terms of forage yield and quality was also evaluated the study included three varieties of alfalfa medicago sativa vars sw8421s pgi908s and wl656hq planted in pots filled with saline sodic soil calcic haplosalids collected on the island of lanzarote spain and irrigated for 18 months with increasingly saline water although the yield of the alfalfa varieties was reduced by an average of 7 20 31 and 46 as the salinity of the irrigation water increased from 0 4 ds m 1 to 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 ds m 1 respectively their relative salt tolerance based on the average electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract ece was much higher than those established in the literature based on their nutritional quality all alfalfa varieties are categorized as supreme quality with metabolizable energy me values in excess of 10 mj kg 1 moreover no detriment to quality was observed at the higher levels of irrigation water salinity mineral composition analysis revealed s k and b levels near or above the established maximum tolerable levels mtls suggesting that this forage could only be safely consumed by ruminants over the long term if combined with other forages with lower mineral content keywords medicago sativa biosaline agriculture saline groundwater salinity tolerance forage quality 1 introduction the gradual reduction in the quantity and quality of conventional water resources for agricultural use in arid and semi arid regions representing 40 of the world s 270 million irrigated hectares smedema and shiati 2002 has necessitated the supplementation of new water resources obtained from the desalination of saline groundwater and seawater díaz et al 2013a b martínez alvarez et al 2017 in both cases salt removal by reversible electrodialysis or reverse osmosis entails high energy costs with a correspondingly high co2 footprint that prevents the extensive use of this water for irrigation irrigation with such water is economically feasible only for high value agricultural crops beltran and koo oshima 2006 moreover even if desalinized water of this type is considered high quality water by farmers initial experiences with desalinated water have not proven totally positive yermiyahu et al 2007 ben gal et al 2009 in addition desalination processes generate considerable amounts of brine which can negatively impact the quality of surface and groundwater sources and marine biological communities that develop naturally under saline conditions riera et al 2012 along with desalination processes for providing additional water resources alternative agricultural practices that rely on the use of marginal soil and water resources affected by salinity are needed rozema and flowers 2008 az et al 2013a b díaz et al 2013b biosaline agriculture i e economically sustainable crop production using irrigation water and soils with a wide range of salinity levels has gained popularity in recent years in arid and semiarid regions in various parts of the world due primarily to the limited supply of good quality irrigation water masters et al 2007 this type of farming based on plants capable of growing in saline conditions can lead to an economically viable market for salt tolerant crops while also expanding crop production into marginal lands thus alleviating pressure on conventional water resources díaz and grattan 2009 potential benefits range from the production of food for human consumption renewable energy bioethanol and biodiesel and materials for industrial use fibre and oil to a series of applications in revegetation soil rehabilitation and carbon fixation projects grattan et al 2008 az et al 2013a b díaz et al 2013b one of the main potential benefits of biosaline agriculture is the production of forage for livestock masters et al 2007 the production of forage in biosaline agriculture however is not problem free the most important problems include 1 the salinisation of the soils 2 imbalances in the mineral composition of the forage and 3 the accumulation of trace elements in forage tissue to levels that can be toxic for livestock díaz and grattan 2009 grattan et al 2004a the first of these problems requires control and application of management techniques particularly adequate leaching to prevent the continued accumulation of salt in the soil in order to address nutritional imbalances and toxicity it is important to control the mineral composition of the forages choosing those that are not only tolerant to salinity but which also minimise the accumulation of toxic elements and offer a more balanced composition moreover most potential nutritional disorders caused by biosaline agriculture forages can be avoided by using the latter only as a supplement to the overall animal diet never as the sole forage robinson et al 2004 the present study evaluates the use of saline soils and saline groundwater to grow different varieties of alfalfa medicago sativa l which is one of the most important forages in arid and semi arid regions across the world djilianov et al 2003 alfalfa has historically been classified as moderately sensitive to saline conditions with significant yield declines as the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil paste extract ece exceeds 2 ds m 1 ayers and westcott 1985 however a series of recent studies have shown that some pre selected alfalfa varieties can thrive in much higher salt concentrations both in soil and in irrigation water without significant negative effects on productivity putnam et al 2017 given the potential interest of these results for arid and semi arid regions it is important to confirm these findings in a broader range of soils and environmental conditions in addition although alfalfa is one of the most important forage crops regarding its high protein content digestibility palatability and milk production qualities very few studies provide information concerning the effects of salinity on the nutritional quality of the crop ferreira et al 2015 the present greenhouse study used saline sodic soils and saline groundwater both of which are common in arid and semi arid parts of the canary islands to grow varieties of alfalfa marketed as tolerant to salinity the primary objective was to determine the impact of different saline conditions on biomass production nutritional quality and mineral composition of the selected varieties and to evaluate the evolution of the soil salinity under the study conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design a two way factorial experiment with four replications per treatment 3 alfalfa varieties 5 irrigation water qualities 1 soil type 4 replications n 60 was conducted using mesocosms soils placed in containers 40 cm in diameter and 50 cm in height with an apparent soil bulk density of approximately 1 2 g cm 3 pots were arranged using a completely randomized design the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse belonging to the canarian institute for agricultural research on the island of tenerife spain where the air temperature during the study period november 2014 april 2016 ranged from 9 to 47 c average 21 5 c and relative humidity from 17 to 94 average 68 4 five water quality treatments with salinity levels eciw of 0 4 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 ds m 1 were applied the water with salinity of 0 4 ds m 1 corresponding to seawater desalinated using reverse osmosis was used as the control treatment the other treatments simulated the quality of sodic chloride dominated groundwater typically found in coastal wells on the islands of lanzarote and fuerteventura spain with the eciw adjusted to between 2 5 and 10 ds m 1 the salinity range frequently found in coastal groundwaters in the canary islands the boron concentration was set at 2 5 mg l 1 for all treatments representing the maximum concentration found in the groundwaters of these areas the simulation of the irrigation waters was conducted using desalinated seawater with nacl mgso4 caso4 na2so4 kno3 nahco3 and h3bo3 added in proper proportions to reflect the composition of the reference groundwater the different irrigation waters were analysed fortnightly to ensure salt concentration targets were met the following parameters were tested ph

al 1997 and values were consistently 0 98 monitoring of volumetric water content with ec 5 sensors decagon devices allowed calculation of the required irrigation dosages to maintain the soils close to pot capacity comparable to field capacity throughout the whole study period table 1 shows the average chemical composition of the waters used for irrigation during the experiment as can be seen the salinity obtained with the different treatments ec differed slightly from the target concentrations ec target the ph of the waters obtained was slightly alkaline varying between 7 8 and 8 7 as is common in the sodic chloride dominated waters of coastal parts of the canary islands the soil used was a calcic haplosalids from the island of lanzarote soil survey staff 2006 physicochemical

the b adsorption isotherm shows that retention of this element was moderate data not shown the soil had very low organic matter and nitrogen content as is common of soils in arid regions the low nutrient content necessitated the use of basal fertilisation 300 g of fertiliser npk 21 10 10 30 g gypsum and 500 g goat manure per container to prevent masking the salinity effects with any nutritional deficiencies the chemical parameters analysed at the beginning of the experiment were re analysed at its conclusion to evaluate the impact of the application of the irrigation treatments the bottom of each pot contained a 3 cm gravel layer to facilitate drainage three non dormant cultivars of alfalfa medicago sativa were selected varieties wl656hq sw8421s pgi908s based on their reported salt tolerance during germination and or forage production pgi908s has been classified as salt tolerant during germination and forage production sw8421s as salt tolerant only during forage production and wl656hq as tolerant only during germination nafa 2016 in order to reduce the salinity of this highly saline soil near the surface of the pot 2 liters of desalinated seawater were added to each pot daily for 10 days prior to sowing this provided a low saline environment for the germinating seeds after this minor reclamation of the surface soil a total of 60 seeds were planted per container to foster germination and crop establishment only irrigation with desalinated seawater was applied to all pots in the first stage of the experiment following this initial period 60 days post seeding the number of plants were thinned to approximately 28 plants per pot and the application of the treatments which lasted for 430 days commenced 2 2 analysis of plant material a total of 15 harvests also referred to as cuttings were performed on forages throughout the treatment period to determine the total production of dry matter dm harvest times were established when the control treatment plants reached approximately 10 flowering the cutting height was established at 5 6 cm above the soil surface the collected plant material was weighed oven dried at 60 c for 72 h and weighed again to determine dry matter production expressed in grams per square meter the cumulative biomass production of each of the treatments was calculated as the sum of the material obtained from the different cuts the relative yield was expressed as the relationship between the biomass produced under the different treatments to that obtained under the control treatment lowest salinity these relative yields were used as an indicator of salinity tolerance díaz and grattan 2009 once dry the plant material collected from each cut was finely ground to analyse the mineral composition and nutritional quality from this three combined samples were obtained by combining the plant material from every 5 consecutive cuts thus the first sample was comprised of plant material from cuts 1 5 corresponding to the first 124 days from the commencement of the treatment application the second sample was comprised of combined cuts 6 10 corresponding to days 124 269 from commencement and the

nutrients and trace elements in the soils after 430 days of application of the different treatments are shown in table 2 soil ece decreased significantly compared to the initial soil regardless of the treatment applied based on the stationary model described by ayers and westcot 1985 for the relationships between eciw irrigation water salinity and ece our data indicate that the leaching fraction obtained was approximately 4 for the control treatment 0 4 ds m 1 gradually increasing to 12 for the most saline treatments 10 0 ds m 1 levels of exchangeable na and espc increased slightly compared to the initial soil in the saline treatments above 2 5 ds m 1 in general there was a significant reduction in the levels of exchangeable k compared to the initial soil and an increase in the ca2 and mg2 cations a significant increase was also found in carbonate content for all treatments compared to the initial soil accumulation of extractable b in the soils was greater under the least saline treatments 0 4 and 2 5 ds m 1 regarding nutrients significant increases in available p at the end of the experiment compared to the initial soil were observed for the least saline treatments slight increases were also seen in organic c and tn micronutrient levels did not undergo significant changes with respect to initial levels except for zn which increased compared to the initial soil regardless of the treatment applied table 2 3 2 biomass production the cumulative production of biomass for the various alfalfa varieties under the different irrigation treatments is shown in fig 1 statistical analysis reveals that production was affected by the treatment variety and duration of the study period broadly speaking the variety with the lowest production was wl656hq with an average of 1478 g m 2 per period compared to the 1550 and 1575 g m 2 obtained with varieties sw8421s and pgi908s respectively increased irrigation water salinity led to a significant decline in biomass production for all varieties the average across all the varieties for the control treatment 0 4 ds m 1 was 1938 38 g m 2 compared to 1800 85 1558 98 1327 41 and 1048 37 g m 2 for the 2 5 5 9 7 5 and 10 0 ds m 1 treatments respectively plant age also significantly influenced production with the third study period presenting higher biomass levels than the previous two 1773 g m 2 compared to 1443 and 1386 g m 2 for periods 1 and 2 the highest production rate expressed as kilogrammes of dry matter per hectare per day kg dm ha 1 d 1 was 137 treatment 0 4 ds m 1 var pgi908s while the lowest was 70 treatment 10 ds m 1 var wl656hq the relative yield relationship between the biomass produced under the different salinity treatments and the control treatment according to the irrigation water salinity and soil salinity are presented in figs 2 and 3 respectively these data indicate that as irrigation water salinity increased i e 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 ds m 1 alfalfa yield was reduced by 7 20 31 and 46 respectively fig 2 statistical analysis indicates that this reduction is significant from 5 0 ds m 1 as listed in table 2 the treatments of 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 ds m 1 in the irrigation water produced average soil salinity ece of 12 6 16 8 19 1 and 19 3 ds m 1 respectively at the end of the study period according to the equation shown in fig 3 the one that best describes our data those ece levels produced a decline in production by 12 1 23 6 31 6 and 32 3 respectively 3 3 forage quality the change in forage ash content ndf adf cp rfv and me during the study period for the different alfalfa varieties under the different water quality treatments are illustrated in figs 4 and 5 cp varied between 24 8 and 32 9 dm and was significantly affected by irrigation water salinity and the study period but not by the variety or the interaction of the three factors fig 4 the highest cp content was mostly found in the 7 5 5 0 and 2 5 ds m 1 treatments which were significantly higher than the control 0 4 ds m 1 and the highest salinity 10 ds m 1 treatments cp levels varied over time with a significant increase seen in the last period mean 30 2 dm as compared to the two previous ones mean 29 7 and 27 7 dm for periods 1 and 2 respectively ndf and adf were significantly affected by the age of the plants fig 4 significant increases were seen between the first period and periods 2 and 3 for example the average adf value for all the varieties was 15 1 in period 1 compared to 18 0 and 18 2 for periods 2 and 3 respectively the effect of the variety of alfalfa was significant only for ndf with sw8421s presenting the lowest average value for the entire study period 26 2 dm and wl656hq the highest 27 1 dm only adf was significantly influenced by the level of irrigation water salinity in general the 5 and 7 5 ds m 1 treatments showed the lowest adf levels mean 16 6 and 16 7 dm respectively which were significantly lower than those of the least saline treatments 17 6 and 17 4 dm for 0 4 and 2 5 ds m 1 respectively ash content ranged from 10 4 to 16 2 dm throughout the study period and did not differ significantly between varieties although it was affected by the salinity of the irrigation water and the age of the plant fig 5 in general the highest values were found in plants under the control treatment mean 13 3 dm and the lowest in the 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 ds m 1 treatments mean 12 6 dm older plants had significantly less ash content decreasing from an average of 14 4 dm in the first period to 12 4 dm in the last relative feed value rfv ranged from 213 to 367 and was significantly affected by the alfalfa variety and time of sampling although not by the saline treatments fig 5 the variety with the highest value was sw8421s 271 31 compared to wl656hq which had the lowest 262 30 the youngest plants first sample had an average value of 303 which was significantly higher than those from the later sampling periods 245 and 251 for periods 2 and 3 respectively metabolisable energy me the energy potential of the forage varied between 9 9 and 10 8 mj kg 1 dm fig 5 in general me did not differ significantly between the varieties studied nor did it change significantly over time however it was affected by the saline treatments the highest values were found under intermediate salinities of 5 and 7 5 ds m 1 mean 10 5 mj kg 1 dm while the control plants averaged 10 3 mj kg 1 dm 3 4 forage mineral composition table 3 lists mean values for macronutrients and na in the collected plant material for the three varieties under the different water quality treatments and for the three study periods statistical analysis shows that the concentrations of all elements except p were affected by salinity and by the degree of maturity of the plants although no significant differences were observed between the varieties of alfalfa levels of n ranged between 23 9 and 54 2 g kg 1 with significant differences only between plants treated with 7 5 ds m 1 water and those in the control treatment mean 46 4 and 44 1 g kg 1 respectively the lowest values were found in period 2 mean 43 2 g kg 1 compared to 46 1 and 46 4 g kg 1 for periods 1 and 3 respectively average p concentration in sampled forage during the study period was 4 5 g kg 1 and was significantly lower in period 2 mean 4 2 g kg 1 than in periods 1 and 3 mean 4 5 and 4 7 g kg 1 respectively concentrations of k in the forage decreased gradually with increased salinity of the irrigation water falling from an average of 37 8 g kg 1 in plants from the control treatment to 27 1 g kg 1 in plants from the 10 ds m 1 treatment a decrease in forage k content with increased plant age was also observed the mean of 38 5 g kg 1 for period 1 falling to 29 9 g kg 1 in period 3 likewise k ca in the forage decreased gradually with increased salinity control treatment mean 19 8 g kg 1 vs 10 ds m 1 treatment mean 12 7 g kg 1 and with plant age period 1 mean 20 8 g kg 1 vs period 3 mean 12 9 g kg 1 conversely the mg content in the forage increased with salinity averaging 4 0 g kg 1 in plants from the control treatment and 5 0 g kg 1 from those in the 10 ds m 1 treatment and mg content also rose slightly with plant age concentrations of s increased with the salinity of the irrigation water 4 5 vs 5 6 g kg 1 in the control treatment and most saline treatment respectively and decreased with plant age 5 9 vs 4 8 g kg 1 in periods 1 and 3 respectively plant tissue na increased by a factor of 7 0 between the control treatment and the most saline treatment 10 ds m 1 and by a factor of 2 4 between the first and last study periods the mean micronutrient and cl concentrations in the collected plant material under the different irrigation water qualities and for the three periods are presented in table 4 statistical analysis of the data indicates that with the exception of zn the concentrations of all micronutrients were affected by the salinity treatment and by the degree of plant maturity but no significant differences were found among the varieties tested levels of mn and cu in the forage increased with the increases in irrigation water salinity whereas the fe b and cl content decreased table 4 mn increased by a factor of 1 3 between the control and most saline treatments with cu increasing by a factor of 1 1 levels of fe fell from 101 5 mg kg 1 dm in the control treatment to 92 4 in the 10 ds m 1 treatment in the case of b the greatest differences in forage concentration were found between the control treatment mean 158 4 mg kg 1 and the treatment with 7 5 ds m 1 salinity mean 99 7 mg kg 1 forage cl concentration was interesting in that all samples regardless of treatment or time of sampling contained high levels i e 1 4 2 7 dw however the only significant differences in forage concentration that were observed was between plants from the 2 5 ds m 1 treatment mean of 22 2 g cl kg 1 and those from the 7 5 and 10 ds m 1 treatments mean of 19 0 g cl kg 1 with regard to the study period the concentration of all micronutrients except b decreased significantly with plant age for example average fe concentration in period 1 was 108 2 mg kg 1 compared to 88 6 mg kg 1 in the last period for the most part average b levels were lowest in period 1 mean 96 7 mg kg 1 and increased to 135 1 and 126 mg kg 1 in the later periods 4 discussion 4 1 impact of irrigation on soil chemical properties leaching fractions obtained in this experiment coincide with the concept of evapotranspiration soil salinity leaching fraction interactions developed by others letey et al 1985 that is for the same quantity of water applied when the irrigation water salinity increases growth decreases evapotranspiration decreases and the leaching fraction increases leading to a reduction in soil salinity larger accumulation of extractable b in the soils under the least saline treatments was possibly a result of the greater use of water by the plants under these treatments which translated to lower leaching fractions díaz and grattan 2009 the observed increase in exchangeable na levels were likely a result of the saline sodic nature of the irrigation water an increase in some nutrients i e ca mg p n zn may have been due to the addition of manure and fertiliser at the beginning of the experiment uptake and leaching of zn could occur to a lesser extent than with other micronutrients likely due to fixation sorption on calcium carbonate alloway 2008 4 2 biomass production the production rate for the alfalfa varieties in our experiment 70 137 kg dm ha 1 d 1 were similar or slightly higher than those reported by others in similar studies conducted with saline tolerant varieties of alfalfa for variety sw8421s cornacchione and suarez 2015 obtained 99 and 69 kg dm ha 1 d 1 with irrigation water ec of 3 and 12 ds m 1 respectively other authors record rates of 74 kg dm ha 1 d 1 for var salado and 86 kg dm ha 1 d 1 for var sw9720 with irrigation water ec of 15 ds m 1 grattan et al 2004b these differences in productivity may be due to differences in the environmental conditions temperature humidity and to different soil conditions physical characteristics availability of nutrients and water etc cornacchione and suarez 2015 found no significant effect of salinity on the reduction in biomass production up to 12 ds m 1 ec in the irrigation water reduction of 25 while in this experiment reduction is significant from 5 0 ds m 1 these differences are due to the different types of substrate used in each case cornacchione and suarez 2015 used a sand tank system with high irrigation frequency with leaching fractions approaching 100 such that the irrigation water salinity was comparable to the soil water salinity since the salinity of the soil solution is about twice that of the saturated soil extract their 12 ds m 1 irrigation treatment is equivalent to an ece of about 6 ds m 1 in our study the high water holding capacity of the fine textured soil facilitates salt accumulation including where high leaching fractions are applied alfalfa traditionally classified as moderately sensitive to salinity is reported to tolerate up to 2 ds m 1 ece but suffers a productivity decline of approximately 7 3 for each unit increase in ece above this threshold value maas and grattan 1999 using the current guidelines the theoretical reduction in production would be 77 4 for the lowest salinity 12 6 ds m 1 and 100 for ece above 16 ds m 1 significantly higher than those obtained in our experiment these results confirm that some varieties of alfalfa can grow at much higher salinity than the guidelines indicate without exhibiting significant yield declines for example the ece50 value using the guidelines is 8 8 ds m 1 while the ece50 based on this study is 23 5 ds m 1 similar results have been reported by other authors including putnam et al 2017 who following a 3 year field study in a clay loam soil with applications of 5 7 ds m 1 eciw obtained alfalfa production levels similar to those obtained with non saline water in the same type of soil irrigation using water with 8 10 ds m 1 eciw caused yield declines of 10 15 compared to the control treatment although economically acceptable production was still achieved the observed increase in biomass production with plant age was likely a result of the progressive reduction in soil salinity due to the very high initial ece along the experimental period results also confirm a lower salt tolerance of variety wl656hq in forage production with respect to the other two assessed cultivars 4 3 forage quality generally speaking forage quality increases as cp rfv and me increase and ndf adf and ash content decrease suyama et al 2007a the levels of cp found coincide largely with those reported by other authors for varieties of alfalfa grown in saline conditions suyama et al 2007a ferreira et al 2015 however some studies report an increase in cp when irrigation water salinity increases ferreira et al 2015 this rise is attributed to a salinity induced increase in the leaf stem ratio al khatib et al 1992 leaves are richer in photosynthetic components with high n content whereas the stems present more structural components with low n content in our case no uniform behaviour was observed the increase in cp content at greater salinity was observed only in the first sampling period fig 4 during subsequent periods a significant decrease in cp content at the highest level of salinity 10 0 ds m 1 was found isotopic n content δ15n analyses carried out as part of this study but addressed separately in a companion paper currently in preparation indicate that salinity negatively affected atmospheric nitrogen fixation which may account for the decrease in cp observed under the most saline treatments the percentages of fibre found in the present study 19 9 32 3 ndf and 17 1 23 6 adf were slightly lower than those reported for variety sw8421s under treatments of 12 7 24 0 ds m 1 ferreira et al 2015 but similar to those reported by robinson et al 2004 for salado and sw9720 using waters with 15 and 25 ds m 1 22 34 ndf to irrigate alfalfa in sand tanks equivalent to those used later by cornacchione and suarez 2015 in both cases the authors observed a reduction in fibre content with increased irrigation water salinity such a reduction observed by others in other types of forage ben ghedalia et al 2001 and which can reach 12 2 in ndf compared to the control treatments is also attributed to an increase in the leaf stem ratio with higher irrigation water salinity ferreira et al 2015 in our case a gradual reduction in adf content at higher salinity was observed only in the first period fig 4 with a difference of approximately 2 between the control plants and those in the most saline treatments however this trend disappeared in subsequent periods and in general a slight decrease 1 was noted only up to salinity of 7 5 ds m 1 with an increase once again at 10 ds m 1 fig 4 in the present experiment the most saline treatments could have negatively affected leaf production for example through a low atmospheric nitrogen fixation and lower water use efficiency thus decreasing the leaf stem ratio textural differences between the substrates used sand tanks vs clay soil and differences in the experimental conditions i e amount and frequency of irrigation are key factors that account for discrepancies between the two studies plant age is one of the most important factors influencing fibre content and a significant increase was observed over time as reported also by other authors for the same varieties stefanon et al 1996 robinson et al 2004 ferreira et al 2015 robinson et al 2004 for instance found an increase in ndf from 18 6 to 42 6 between the first and fifth cut of alfalfa irrigated with saline water a reduction in ash content with increased irrigation water salinity has been reported by others for different forages under greenhouse conditions ben ghedalia et al 2001 robinson et al 2004 suyama et al 2007a for example suyama et al 2007a found a reduction of 2 between alfalfa irrigated with non saline 0 8 ds m 1 and highly saline water 18 0 ds m 1 however the reduction in ash content over time observed in this experiment is not consistent with data obtained by cao et al 2012 who noted an increase in ash content over time in irrigated alfalfa in saline soils in our case the high initial salinity of the soils 54 ds m 1 which was reduced substantially by the irrigations applied before treatments were imposed may have led to a greater accumulation of salt in the young plants and indeed this was found tissue cl for example was 2 3 2 7 dw regardless of treatment in plants composited from the first series of cuts the concentrations decreased below 2 0 for all treatments in subsequent sampling periods it is likely that excessive salt was absorbed by plants in this saline soil at early times while soil saline below the soil surface was still very high as plants were later stressed growth and consequently et was reduced allowing for high leaching of this highly saline soil this may explain why tissue cl decreased with increased salinity treatment plant age appears to be the main factor influencing rfv indicating that the plants nutritional value declines slightly as they become older old plants are mainly associated with increased fibre content as much of the biomass is comprised of woody stems rfv levels also suggest that variety wl656hq is slightly lower in quality than the other two analysed values obtained here were slightly higher than those reported for alfalfas irrigated with saline water by ferreira et al 2015 who observed a significant increase in rfv 5 2 when the irrigation water salinity increased from 12 7 to 18 4 ds m 1 eciw similarly suyama et al 2007a found me values of 9 2 10 0 and 10 3 mj kg 1 dm in young alfalfa irrigated using water with 0 8 11 and 18 ds m 1 eciw respectively and attributed the increase in me with salinity to the fact that the plants under saline treatments were less mature than their control treatment counterparts at the time of cutting in contrast to those studies no clear positive association was observed here between nutritional quality and the level of salinity in the irrigation water however an increase in quality was seen up to 5 and 7 5 ds m 1 eciw compared to the control treatments but not at higher salinities these dissimilarities could be explained by differences in the substrates used in our case we used heavy textured soils that could potentially reduce soil physical conditions which would impose other abiotic or biotic stresses that limit crop development under high salinity sodicity conditions based on the quality parameters analysed and regardless of the irrigation water quality all the varieties can be classed as supreme quality putnam et al 2008 adequate for dairy livestock and for producing fast growing calves suyama et al 2007b a reflection of their very high nutritional content 4 4 forage mineral composition the mineral composition of crops can be affected by salinity which causes nutritional imbalances due to its effects on nutrient availability competitive absorption transport and compartmentation in the tissues grattan and grieve 1999 accordingly the mineral composition of plant tissue in the aerial part of forage plants grown under saline conditions needs to be monitored over time here the concentrations of the different elements analysed were compared with the established maximum tolerable levels mtls in order to evaluate the potential impact on mineral nutrition in ruminants nrc 2005 of the elements studied in the forages obtained only k s and b showed concentrations above the values considered adequate nrc 2005 putnam et al 2008 potential problems associated with consumption of these forages may include i hypomagnesemia a metabolic disorder in ruminants affecting the bioavailability of magnesium in the rumen high concentrations of k in the forage reduce mg absorption and can trigger this condition mcdowell and valle 2000 the maximum tolerable level for k has been set at 20 000 mg k kg 1 dm nrc 2005 this might be considered conservative given that some research suggests that ruminants can tolerate levels of between 30 000 50 000 mg k kg 1 dm in their diet without manifesting adverse effects nrc 2005 the alfalfa varieties studied here exceeded this value averaging between 20 000 and 44 000 mg k kg 1 dm table 3 the fact that k levels generally decrease with increases in irrigation water salinity makes k toxicity caused by alfalfa grown in saline conditions unlikely ii polioencephalomalacia pem a high concentration of s in forage can prove toxic to ruminants manifesting as failures in the central nervous system and brain lesions gould 2000 a further problem associated with high s concentrations is cu deficiency spears 2003 cu availability decreases as concentrations of s and mo increase in the rumen due to the formation of complexes such as thiomolybdates that are not readily absorbed by the animal spears 2003 an increase from 0 2 to 0 4 of s in the diet can cause cu absorption to fall by 50 to avoid these problems the mtl has been set at 0 30 and 0 50 s dm for diets with 85 and 40 forage respectively nrc 2005 concentrations of this element in the alfalfa varieties studied here were near or above the mtl mean 0 30 0 61 dm table 3 and were generally higher with higher irrigation water salinity accordingly s accumulation could represent a constraint on the use of these forages iii b toxicity b is considered relatively non toxic and most animals tolerate it well even if some research suggests that toxicity may occur in animals that consume high amounts of b nrc 2005 findings which have led the mtl to be set at 135 mg b kg 1 dm for livestock nrc 2005 in our study b concentrations generally decreased with increased irrigation water salinity an effect already observed by various authors in different crops yermiyahu et al 2008 díaz and grattan 2009 the mtl was exceeded only slightly in the least saline treatments 0 4 and 2 5 ds m 1 these results suggest the existence of interactions that increase b tolerance under saline conditions one possible reason for this could be the reduction in plant water uptake under higher salinity levels which reduces tissue accumulation of b yermiyahu et al 2008 other authors attribute the reduction in b to interactions with so4 2 and cl grattan et al 2004c high levels of k s and b close to or above mtls have been reported for alfalfa by other authors who used saline water for irrigation grattan et al 2004a suyama et al 2007b 5 conclusions the results obtained in this experiment confirm some recent findings concerning the salt tolerance of certain varieties of alfalfa which suggest that the tolerance guidelines set in the literature for this crop should be reassessed our study confirms that alfalfa traditionally considered moderately sensitive to salinity can grow in conditions of high soil and irrigation water salinity e g ece 10 ds m 1 eciw 5 ds m 1 without suffering large reductions in biomass compared to non saline conditions these results are particularly important for arid regions including the easternmost canary islands which lack quality water but do have an abundance of salt affected water and soils as well as a high demand for livestock feed one of the main economic activities in these areas the forages obtained were of good quality for dairy goat diets falling into the high category from the standpoint of nutritional quality based on usda quality guidelines in terms of mineral nutrition for ruminants concentrations of k b and s in particular would require monitoring to determine if forages are approaching maximum tolerable concentrations above which animals exclusively consuming this forage over extended periods could face potential toxicity should this occur the forages could still be used as a dietary supplement in

11561,although atmospheric evaporative demand is increasingly recognized as significant roles in coupling water transport and carbon acquisition potentials to reduce irrigation demand and improve photosynthesis performance via regulating evaporative demands is highly uncertain to bridge this gap plant water status in combination with photosynthetic carbon acquisition under contrasting evaporative demand was examined in two cultivars of tomato solanum lycopersicum l experiments were conducted from may to august in 2016 evaporative demand gradients were achieved via regulating vapor pressure deficit vpd at two adjacent greenhouses of similar characteristics high vpd was maintained in natural greenhouse condition without environmental regulation control moderate vpd was achieved by artificially humidification when evaporative demand exceeded optimal ranges humidification vpd regulation by humidification reduced the excessive driving force for water flow which efficiently prevented the declines in plant water potential and alleviated hydraulic limitation transpiration rate and irrigation demand over experimental period were substantially reduced via reducing

at long term scales fruit yield was increased by 14 6 and 16 7 for two cultivars whole plant biomass was increased by 22 6 and 16 9 for two cultivars plants irrigation amount in humidification treatment over the experimental period was significantly saved by 16 9 and 17 4 for two cultivars taken together vpd regulation had great potentials to reduce irrigation demand and improve photosynthetic capacity via reducing water driving force and sustaining stomatal function the present study provided novel information to improve photosynthetic and reduce irrigation demand for sustainable crop production keywords greenhouse vapour pressure deficit stomatal conductance hydraulic conductance photosynthesis irrigation efficiency 1 introduction photosynthesis is the driving mechanism for plant growth and yield production which is affected by various environmental factors during photosynthesis the pathway for co2 uptake from the bulk atmosphere to fixation site is determined by a series of diffusion resistance among which stomatal pores provided a major resistance stomata are the gatekeepers responsible for all gaseous diffusion they adjust to external environmental stimuli governing co2 uptake and water loss lawson and blatt 2014 a large body of literature has been published that acquisition and utilization efficiency of co2 is modified by various environmental conditions such as soil water status pazzagli et al 2016 light soares et al 2008 temperature and so on environmental fluctuation is thought to impact on guard cells of stomatal pores which profoundly affect the exchange of water loss and co2 uptake stomatal closure in response to plant water deficit in vascular plants was believed to be a passive process driven by reduction in turgor of the guard cells buckley 2005 since turgor pressure was directly linked to plant water status processes of water transport and loss can impact co2 diffusion resistance via manipulating the physical and physiological characteristics of guard cells the process of water movement through soil plant atmosphere continuum spac determined plant water status and thereby affect stomatal function for photosynthesis water movement is a passive process driven by the free energy gradient between soil and atmosphere fricke 2017 soil water status has long been recognized as key elements to maintain optimum water driving force and sustain stomatal function water saving irrigation techniques such as controlled alternate partial root zone irrigation and deficit irrigation were widely applied for crop production due to the reduced water supply without significant limitation in stomatal function and photosynthesis chen et al 2014 chen et al 2013 ma et al 2007 in natural condition soil moisture varies much less than leaf atmosphere flux which fluctuates in response to high frequency evaporative demand caldeira et al 2014 manzoni et al 2011 high evaporative demand is a major determination for excessive irrigation consumption and photosynthesis limitation especially for the semi arid zones which is characterized by meteorological drought excessive water flux can cause disrupt in water balance between liquid water supply and vapour loss consequently induce plant water deficit and physiological disorders grange and hand 1987 the plant water stress under excessive evaporative demand condition would inhibit photosynthesis and plant growth via limiting stomatal function brodribb and holbrook 2003 while evaporative demand limited stomatal function and photosynthetic carbon gain via regulating water driving force and affecting plant water status the evaporative demand regulation received far less attention by growers one possible reason is the difficulty in environmental regulation for field grown crop the technology of protected horticulture a new facility to grow plants and facilitates evaporative demand regulation is growing at an ever increasing rate giacomelli et al 2007 atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd is a good indicator of evaporative demand which can be used to identify healthy air moisture conditions for plant production while taking into account different temperature levels bouchabk et al 2006 medina and gilbert 2016 parent et al 2010 prenger and ling 2001 it has been suggested that effect of humidity is best given in terms of vpd between the leaf and bulk air which is a more appropriate variable for describing plant physiological responses to air moisture peak and mott 2010 in greenhouse production the increasing sophistication of mechanical devices and computer programs can be applied for greenhouse atmospheric moisture regulation mechanical systems of heating ventilation heat pumps and air circulation could be applied for increasing vpd evaporative cooling methods such as pad and fan and fogging systems facilitated vpd decreasing katsoulas et al 2009 leyva et al 2015 max et al 2009 romero aranda et al 2002 large evidence was provided that optimal control of vpd improved plant growth and increased yield of horticultural crop in greenhouse production zhang et al 2015 although vpd mediated stomatal function for water and co2 exchange the potentials to reduce irrigation demand and improve photosynthesis through regulating vpd was highly uncertain vpd control was hypothesized to perform significant roles in reducing irrigation demand moderating plant water stress and thereby sustaining stomatal function for co2 utilization in the present study the purpose of this research was to identify the potential mechanisms linking vpd regulation to irrigation demand and photosynthetic capacity from a hydraulic perspective considering the spatial and temporal variation in carbon and water balance two main components were highlighted in the present study plant productivity process photosynthesis plant growth biomass and yield production water transport process stomatal and hydraulic regulation transpiration and irrigation demand plant water status and stomatal function were exemplified as the central elements in coupling and balancing two processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant

cumulative irrigation amount potted plants were used for transpiration and irrigation estimation soil surface was covered with circular polythene sheet to prevent soil water evaporative plant

about 0800h daily plant transpiration was estimated as the difference of pot weightings daily water loss due to transpiration was replenished by adding an exact amount of water to bring back the moisture content to the desired target irrigation amount during the whole growing season was estimated from the sum of the daily transpiration 2 4 measurements of leaf gas exchange leaf gas exchange

during measurement environmental conditions in the leaf chamber were set close to condition in open field condition in greenhouse measurements were repeated with 8 plants in each treatment and a total of three readings per plant were performed after steady state and equilibration two photosynthesis systems were used to enable simultaneous gas exchange measurements after inducing steady state gas exchange photosynthetic rate pn at various intercellular co2 concentration ci pn ci curve were performed to determine the photosynthetic capacity of leaves under high and moderate vpd conditions ambient co2 concentration ca was lowered stepwise from 400μmolmol 1 to 50μmolmol 1 and then returned to 400μmolmol 1 to re establish the initial steady state gas exchange ca was increased stepwise

same level the vpd was set at 2 5 kpa and 1 kpa for the high and moderate vpd treatment respectively carboxylation efficiency ce was calculated by linear regression of the data points when the reference chamber co2 concentration was 200μmolmol 1 as described in a previous research sun et al 2016 rubisco carboxylation capacity vcmax and maximum electron transport capacity jmax were

temperature and light intensity varied in similar patterns over the diurnal course fig 1 a and b air relative humidity was substantially increased by the humidification treatment especially around midday fig 1c correspondingly the vpd around midday was substantially reduced in the humidification treatment fig 1d the meteorological data over the whole growing seasons was described in detail the supplementary table s1 no significant differences in predawn ψleaf between two treatments were observed fig 2 implying that plants grown at a homogeneous soil water status with atmospheric evaporative

materials ψleaf experienced a dramatic midday drawdown for both two cultivars fig 2 midday depression in ψleaf was efficiently moderated by humidification for both two cultivars fig 2 water potential drawdown at leaf atmosphere boundary was much greater than at soil leaf pathway for both cultivars whereas this large passive driving force was substantially reduced by 54mpa and 56mpa for cv1 and cv2 by humidification respectively fig s1 in the supplementary materials over the whole growing seasons minor variations in predawn ψleaf were observed for both two cultivars fig 3 a b implying that soil water content was maintained at a steady state midday ψleaf increased initially and achieved maximum value and then decreased with leaf senescence fig 3c d midday ψleaf was less negative in humidification plants over the growing seasons except the stages of leaf initiation and senescence fig 3c d similar trends were observed in both leaf hydraulic conductance and whole plant hydraulic conductance fig 4 reduction in large evaporative demand by humidification efficiently mitigated hydraulic limitation for water transport both leaf and whole plant hydraulic conductance showed peaking patterns over the growing seasons which were significantly increased by humidification treatments fig 4 3 2 effect of vpd regulation on photosynthesis vpd regulation by humidification substantially influenced leaf gas exchange process stomatal conductance showed a typical peaking pattern stomatal conductance increased with leaf growth and then declined after fully expand fig 5 a b stomatal conductance was significantly increased by humidification treatments and this enhancement was more pronounced in cv1 than cv2 fig 5a b similar trends were observed in net photosynthesis rate which were substantially improved in humidification plants fig 5c d unlike the positive effects described for stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis rate leaf transpiration rate was significantly reduced by humidification treatment fig 5e f photosynthetic rate increased over a range of low intercellular co2 concentration and reached a plateau at a range of 600 800μmolmol 1 in a similar manner regardless of vpd treatment fig 6 however maximum steady state photosynthesis rate were higher in humidification than control plants for both two cultivars fig 6 similar trends were observed in carboxylation efficiency ce maximum carboxylation rate vcmax and maximum electron transport rate jmax all of these traits were significantly increased by humidification treatments fig 7 3 3 effect of vpd regulation on plant growth and productivity vpd regulation affected plant organizational growth humidification caused enhancements in leaf length and stem diameter with corresponding faster leaf elongation rate and stem radial expansions rate fig s2 in the supplementary materials the enhancement in leaf and stem expansion were greater in top truss than basal truss fig s2 in the supplementary materials enhancement in organizational growth by humidification contributed to a substantial improvement in dry biomass production of leaf stem fruits and root in cv1 supplementary table s3 whereas humidification had minor effect on dry biomass of stem and root in cv2 supplementary table s3 the corresponding growth parameters in response to vpd control were analyzed and shown in fig 8 humidification treatment significantly enhanced relative growth rate rgr p 0 05 fig 8a b and the net assimilation rate nar p 0 05 fig 8c d for both cv1 and cv2 leaf area ratio lar responded

11561,although atmospheric evaporative demand is increasingly recognized as significant roles in coupling water transport and carbon acquisition potentials to reduce irrigation demand and improve photosynthesis performance via regulating evaporative demands is highly uncertain to bridge this gap plant water status in combination with photosynthetic carbon acquisition under contrasting evaporative demand was examined in two cultivars of tomato solanum lycopersicum l experiments were conducted from may to august in 2016 evaporative demand gradients were achieved via regulating vapor pressure deficit vpd at two adjacent greenhouses of similar characteristics high vpd was maintained in natural greenhouse condition without environmental regulation control moderate vpd was achieved by artificially humidification when evaporative demand exceeded optimal ranges humidification vpd regulation by humidification reduced the excessive driving force for water flow which efficiently

sustainable crop production keywords greenhouse vapour pressure deficit stomatal conductance hydraulic conductance photosynthesis irrigation efficiency 1 introduction photosynthesis is the driving mechanism for plant growth and yield production which is affected by various environmental factors during photosynthesis the pathway for co2 uptake from the bulk atmosphere to fixation site is determined by a series of diffusion resistance among which stomatal pores provided a major resistance stomata are the gatekeepers responsible for all gaseous diffusion they adjust to external environmental stimuli governing co2 uptake and water loss lawson and blatt 2014 a large body of literature has been published that acquisition and utilization efficiency of co2 is modified by various environmental conditions such as soil water status pazzagli et al 2016 light soares et al 2008 temperature and so on environmental fluctuation is thought to impact on guard cells of stomatal pores which profoundly affect the exchange of water loss and co2 uptake stomatal closure in response to plant water deficit in vascular plants was believed to be a passive process driven by reduction in turgor of the guard cells buckley 2005 since turgor pressure was directly linked to plant water status processes of water transport and loss can impact co2 diffusion resistance via manipulating the physical and physiological characteristics of guard cells the process of water movement through soil plant atmosphere continuum spac determined plant water status and thereby affect stomatal function for photosynthesis water movement is a passive process driven by the free energy gradient between soil and atmosphere fricke 2017 soil water status has long been recognized as key elements to maintain optimum water driving force and sustain stomatal function water saving irrigation techniques such as controlled alternate partial root zone irrigation and deficit irrigation were widely applied for crop production due to the reduced water supply without significant limitation in stomatal function and photosynthesis chen et al 2014 chen et al 2013 ma et al 2007 in natural condition soil moisture varies much less than leaf atmosphere flux which fluctuates in response to high frequency evaporative demand caldeira et al 2014 manzoni et al 2011 high evaporative demand is a major determination for excessive irrigation consumption and photosynthesis limitation especially for the semi arid zones which is characterized by meteorological drought excessive water flux can cause disrupt in water balance between liquid water supply and vapour loss consequently induce plant water deficit and physiological disorders grange and hand 1987 the plant water stress under excessive evaporative demand condition would inhibit photosynthesis and plant growth via limiting stomatal function brodribb and holbrook 2003 while evaporative demand limited stomatal function and photosynthetic carbon gain via regulating water driving force and affecting plant water status the evaporative demand regulation received far less attention by growers one possible reason is the difficulty in environmental regulation for field grown crop the technology of protected horticulture a new facility to grow plants and facilitates evaporative demand regulation is growing at an ever increasing rate giacomelli et al 2007 atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd is a good indicator of evaporative demand which can be used to identify healthy air moisture conditions for plant production while taking into account different temperature levels bouchabk et al 2006 medina and gilbert 2016 parent et al 2010 prenger and ling 2001 it has been suggested that effect of humidity is best given in terms of vpd between the leaf and bulk air which is a more appropriate variable for describing plant physiological responses to air moisture peak and mott 2010 in greenhouse production the increasing sophistication of mechanical devices and computer programs can be applied for greenhouse atmospheric moisture regulation mechanical systems of heating ventilation heat pumps and air circulation could be applied for increasing vpd evaporative cooling methods such as pad and fan and fogging systems facilitated vpd decreasing katsoulas et al 2009 leyva et al 2015 max et al 2009 romero aranda et al 2002 large evidence was provided that optimal control of vpd improved plant growth and increased yield of horticultural crop in greenhouse production zhang et al 2015 although vpd mediated stomatal function for water and co2 exchange the potentials to reduce irrigation demand and improve photosynthesis through regulating vpd was highly uncertain vpd control was hypothesized to perform significant roles in reducing irrigation demand moderating plant water stress and thereby sustaining stomatal function for co2 utilization in the present study the purpose of this research was to identify the potential mechanisms linking vpd regulation to irrigation demand and photosynthetic capacity from a hydraulic perspective considering the spatial and temporal variation in carbon and water balance two main

11562,this study uses data from water auctions conducted by the traditional irrigation community of vélez blanco water prices are comprehensively compared and statically correlated with local precipitation data on different temporal scales the data analyzed reach back to 1967 the local prevailing mediterranean climate is characterized by a mean annual precipitation amount of 419mm while effective rainfall 1mm occurs averagely at 37days per year the rainfall distribution data used were of daily seasonal and annual resolution and are assessed on their influence on the local water price formation the results were validated with information about local agricultural practices and subjective perceptions of the vega s status gained from interviews with local farmers results show that high correlation coefficients are achieved when water prices and precipitation data are correlated on a monthly scale the highest correlation coefficients are achieved with a temporal offset of one month throughout the spring and summer season interestingly neither short term water surplus nor long term water deficit consecutive drought years are clearly reflected based on the given data base annual rainfall distribution has proven to be a significant factor that influences water price formation in the vega of vélez blanco keywords traditional water management mediterranean climate interviews with local farmers water auctions aquifer 1 introduction within europe the country of spain is a prime example to study traditional water management with a long history throughout history the water management schemes and cultures of roman moorish iberian and other mediterranean civilizations influenced the technical advancement and administrational management of irrigation on the iberian peninsula brunhes 1902 fröhling 1965 glick 1970 kress 1968 ostrom 1990 especially in the dry sub humid south of the country traditional water management structures and irrigation governance systems date back to medieval times and most likely originate from moorish cultures who conquered spain in the 8th century bce in general modern spanish water law defines water as a public good meaning that it has no monetary value at all only costs for its distribution administration and the maintenance of regulation infrastructure can be charged for arriaza et al 2002 therefore in the following the term water price always refers to the costs of water allocation at present the agricultural sector is the largest water consumer in spain its water consumption for irrigation totals annually 14 535hm3 which is about 75 of the national available water resources ine 2015 overall 3 6 million hectares of spain s agricultural land is equipped for irrigation of which 1 3 million hectares 47 are supplied by groundwater while 2 3 million hectares 63 are irrigated by surface water fao 2017 these numbers demonstrate that groundwater irrigation is vitally important for agricultural production and hence an important factor for the local regional and national economy thinking of the significance of water at these various levels the question always arises what does the water cost the restriction of water costs and the social equity of different water pricing methods is a frequently discussed issue to which there is no universal answer gleick 1997 johansson et al 2002 molle and berkoff 2007 worldwide numerous studies on the pricing of water used for irrigation agriculture are available johansson et al 2002 molle and berkoff 2007 abu zeid 2001 the wide variety of water pricing implementations encompasses volumetric non volumetric and quote systems as well as market based and user based mechanisms in which water is distributed by e g quotas applications or water auctions johansson et al 2002 historically water auctioning was a well known instrument for several irrigation communities in south eastern spain to locally organize the allocation of irrigation water in modern times most of these systems have been abolished e g the huerta de lorca where water was auctioned until its abandonment in 1960 capel 1968 hence the operating water sharing system of vélez blanco presented in this study is a rarity in this study water prices originating from the water auctions of the irrigation community of vélez blanco and daily precipitation records from the local weather station are used to evaluate the influence of rainfall distribution on the water requirements for irrigation agriculture on different temporal scales based on the isolation of the local water sharing system it is locally possible to carry out an independent analysis of the local water market and with this of the formation of water prices data from the water auctions used in this study show that there is a certain willingness of the local landowners to pay high prices for irrigation water this leads to the following central research question what impact does the local rainfall distribution have on the local water requirements and irrigation schemes hence this study tests the statistical significance of correlations between precipitation patterns and archived local water prices on a daily seasonal and annual scale the results are interpreted in the context of irrigation schemes historical events and socio economic conditions 2 the vega of vélez blanco embedded in the mountainous landscape of the sierra de maría situated at a height of 1070m a s l the town of vélez blanco and its vicinity is a fertile spot of intensive agricultural cultivation the irrigated agricultural terraces are located east of the town adjacent to the municipal boundaries locally this area is called vega based on information about similarly structured systems in the region of south eastern spain it is assumed that the water management structures that can be found in the vega of vélez blanco date back to at least the muslim period 8th cent bce whereas written evidences only exist for the last 500 years approximately roth 2015 roth et al 2015 today cultivation within the vega of vélez blanco is dominated by almond and olive groves fruit orchards vegetable gardening and grain farming almond trees which are predominantly cultivated in the upper part of the vega are rarely irrigated whereas vegetable gardening practiced all over the vega has a significantly higher water demand that necessitates irrigation particularly during spring and autumn olive groves are also occasionally irrigated during summer months 2 1 irrigation structures the technical water management facilities that are deployed within the vega of vélez blanco predominantly include traditional structures such as concrete channels acequias to transport sluice gates to divert and reservoirs balsas to store the irrigation water within the parcels of land maintained by the individual landowners traditional techniques like furrow irrigation still dominate while modern irrigation installations such as drip irrigation systems are becoming increasingly important the administration of the water allocation is traditionally managed by the local irrigation community that consists of farmers elected during the general assembly of all farmers owing irrigated land in the vega of vélez blanco the task of the irrigation community is to maintain the irrigation network to organize and execute the irrigation rotations and to host the regular water auctions at the alporchón the term alporchón is defined as a traditional law body that has existed in vélez blanco since time immemorial it is responsible for the local regulation of water sharing and observation of the hydrological regime 1 1 alporchón una entidad jurídico consuetudinaria e inmemorial de base corporative en material de aguas y de regimen hidráulico navarro sánchez 2010 navarro sánchez 2010 roth et al 2015 in principle the water allocation between owners of irrigated land within the vega of vélez blanco is organized in a mixed system of irrigation rotations and water auctions navarro sánchez 2010 the rotational system is based on the subdivision of the irrigated land into irrigation units that are usually named after the respective water source spring river reservoir or channel the five largest of these subunits are balsa alara hila de la unión hilas de conceje hilas de turruquena and río de argan 2 2 hila plural hilas the terms hila hilo or fila are defined as an abstract unit that represents a share of the entirety of available irrigation water from a river spring or canal glick 1970 fig 1 within those systems quantities of irrigation water are measured in volumetric units or units of time depending on the respective subsystem systems carrying the term hila span for the temporal measurement of water units in their name measure irrigation volume in units of time hours and minutes in all other systems the water quantities are measured in volumetric units of arrobes 1 arrobes 48m3 and granos 1 grano 6m3 which is a traditional spanish measurement unit rarely used today navarro sánchez 2010 roth 2015 irrigation water is distributed during daytime 6 a m to 6 p m while during nighttime water refills the respective reservoirs the subsystems rotation intervals range from 20days in the subsystem of hilas de la unión to 282days within those of the balsa alara navarro sánchez 2010 in the course of a rotation each landowner receives a share of irrigation water that corresponds to the size of his or her property in addition the local irrigation community also obtains shares of irrigation water out of the rotations that they sell in rations of exactly 12h of irrigation water to the highest bidder during regular water auctions tyrakowski 2001 for the water auctions quantities of irrigation water are always measured in units of time independent from the initial system the revenue from the auctions are used to cover personnel expenses for the staff of the irrigation community and the costs associated with the maintenance of the technical infrastructure see also isselhorst et al in press handwritten records of these water auctions are stored in the archive of the alporchón covering the last hundred years 2 2 environmental setting due to its favorable location adjacent to the orce maría aquifer at the southern edge of the baetic system the town of vélez blanco and the irrigated agricultural fields in its vega benefit from a perennial fresh water supply in this mountainous area the orce maría aquifer functions as the region s water tower fig 1 geologically the orce maría aquifer is mainly composed of jurassic dolomite and limestone that crop out to form a mountain chain running west east between the towns of cúllar and vélez blanco about 70 of the aquifer is located in the guadalquivir catchment while the remaining 30 belong to the segura drainage basin gonzález ramón et al 2016 the aquifer is characterized by recharge rates of approximately one third of the annual received precipitation which corresponds to the recharge rates of other carbonate aquifers within the baetic system which vary between 33 and 55 moreno calvillo et al 1983 the groundwater flow is oriented towards the aquifer s eastern and western borders where the main discharge points are located in the form of tapped springs andreo et al 2008 vélez blanco is located at the eastern edge of the aquifer the main spring water level is situated above the village on the eastern slope of the mount maimón at the western edge of the aquifer the main discharge points are located near the town of orce draining into the guadalquivir basin in between springs of minor importance occur on the northern slopes of the sierra de maría whereas on the southern slopes discharge points are rare in addition to the natural discharge of the aquifer groundwater extraction by deep well pumping threatens the natural water balance of the orce maría aquifer the intensification of groundwater extraction for agricultural production since the late 1940s has led to imbalances between groundwater recharge rates and water extraction volumes all over spain especially the technical revolution of deep well pumps between 1950 and 1970 greatly increased groundwater abstraction llamas et al 2015 2 3 climate in most parts of southern spain the climate is classified as mediterranean with a pronounced dry period throughout the summer months and a rainy season from autumn to spring most of the precipitation events occur during autumn while winter and spring show a higher variability in rainfall geiger 1970 rodrigo et al 2000 due to the complex topography of southern spain local climate characteristics show a wide variation in temporal and spatial distribution local climates can be classified into coastal inland and mountainous climates pita lópez 2003 in general average annual amounts of precipitation decline from the mountainous climate region of the baetic system with annual precipitation amounts of up to 1300mm in the sierra de maría down to the coastal areas where precipitation amounts of less than 150mm are characteristic for the vicinity of cabo de gata pulido calvo et al 2012 pita lópez 2003 the local climate in vélez blanco shows a pronounced seasonality of precipitation events and annual variations in temperature the annual precipitation averages of 419mm and predominantly falls from september to may while rainfall is most reliable in autumn between september and november fig 2 in contrast the summer months from june to august are characterized by high temperatures and low amounts of precipitation with the least rainfall and highest temperatures in july throughout the year monthly average temperature drops constantly from august to december and starts to rise again in february with a constant increase until july with an annual average of 12 1c see also isselhorst et al in press especially during the winter months december and january frost periods occur 3 material and methods daily precipitation data and hand written records of regular water auctions from the irrigation community in vélez blanco are used to investigate causal relationships between natural water availability and agricultural demand of irrigation water on different temporal scales for the analyses of climatic data the temperature and precipitation data were statistically treated to reveal short term events daily precipitation mid term or seasonal patterns monthly aggraded data and long term trends annually aggregated data and values for the standardized precipitation index spi a widely used drought index fig 3 the results of the statistical analysis were compared to results from structured interviews with local farmers from the vega of vélez blanco 3 1 water prices the archive of water auction data includes 7735 handwritten records of individual water auctions that took place between january 1929 and september 2012 for the sake of comparability a subset of 40 years defined by the temporal coverage of the climate data 1967 2006 was used for the analysis the data set is subdivided according to the five subsystems of the local water distribution system of the vega of vélez blanco which are named after their respective water reservoir balsa alara hilas de turruquena hilas de conceje hila de la unión and río de argan the water prices given in spanish pesetas were converted to euros using the official exchange rate given by the european central bank 1 166 386 esp european central bank 2017 to enable an inter annual comparability a historical set of annual inflation values for spain provided by de motes 2013 were used for inflation adjustment of the water auction data 3 2 climate data for event based analysis daily precipitation measurements 1967 2006 recorded at the weather station in vélez blanco 37 41 n 2 05 w and daily temperature data from the nearby station in maría 37 42 n 2 09 w were analyzed with standard statistical methods to characterize the local climate and for the correlation analyzes on a daily monthly and annual scale aemet 2014 3 3 statistical data analysis standard descriptive statistics were calculated on a short daily and event based mid monthly and seasonally and long term annually scale for precipitation data and water prices from 1967 to 2006 the calculation of minimum min maximum max and mean mean precipitation sums and water prices 0 25 quartile q1 0 75 quartile q3 variance var standard deviation std the software package spss 19 was used for the analysis a test for normal distribution was applied to all datasets used in this study to determine the most appropriate method for the correlation analysis the application of the shapiro wilk normality test indicated that climate data and water prices both show a non normal distribution hence a rank based spearman s correlation was applied to analyze potential relationships between water auction data and water prices on multiple scales from daily to annual values the non normal distribution also necessitates a definition of extreme values based on the datasets interquartile range where the lowermost boundary is defined by the 0 25 quartile and the uppermost boundary is specified by the 0 75 quartile all values outside of this range are treated as potential outliers correlation analyses were only conducted with initial data hence missing data were not substituted by long term average values the software packages used for the analyses were r spss 19 and microsoft excel 3 4 mid and long term climate analysis and standardized precipitation index spi calculation the calculation of the spi as developed by mckee et al 1995 was applied on an annual and seasonal temporal scale to identify the variability of the local climate within the time period from 1967 to 2006 the index is widely used as an effective indicator for the quantification of rainfall deficits or surpluses that can be applied on several scales from months to years mckee et al 1995 machado et al 2011 vicente serrano 2006 ji and peters 2003 classification of spi values was applied as suggested by mckee et al 1995 according to mckee 1993 a spi value of 1 or less indicates a drought the start of the respective drought is then set to the first occurrence of negative spi values and continues until the first positive value is recorded again in addition for each drought period defined an associated value for the drought magnitude was calculated to evaluate drought intensity for the definition of humid phases this classification was inverted consequently humid phases are indicated every time the spi reaches values above 1 ji and peters 2003 have shown that a 3 months spi shows the highest correlation with vegetation patterns due to the time lag between the occurrence of a rainfall event and the response of vegetation hence the 3 months spi seems a suitable indicator for agricultural droughts in contrast the 12 months spi or more is often used to determine hydrological droughts because of its ruggedness against intra annual variations vicente serrano and cuadrat 2002 in this study the 12 months spi was calculated for the definition of large scale drought events while the 3 months spi was used to characterize and compare seasonal variations for the four main periods september to november december to february march to may june to august 3 5 interviews with local farmers a total of 30 interviews with randomly selected famers from the vega of vélez blanco were conducted during spring 2016 the interviews comprised 31 questions of open semi open and closed character to obtain the farmers subjective perception of the vega s current status and to determine their individual methods of cultivation 4 results 4 1 short term statistics the 3805 individual water prices achieved at individual auctions and assigned to the period between 1967 and 2003 range from 0 41 to 559 61 table 1 all prices refer to twelve hours of irrigation most water auctions were conducted for the subsystem of the balsa alara n 851 whilst the least sales were carried out for the subsystem río de argan n 654 overall the price for twelve hours of irrigation water averages 62 90 n 3805 the lowest mean prices for irrigation water was achieved for the subsystem río de argan 44 29 n 654 and the highest average water fees were for the area of the balsa alara where the water price averages 90 88 n 851 the maximum water prices within the different subsystems range from 264 90 to 559 61 with the maximum water price in the subsystem hilas de turruquena n 833 being twice as high as for the system río de argan out of the 13 799days for which precipitation was recorded 1967 2003 only at 1466days the rainfall was higher than 1mm 10 of the days with precipitation while daily sums of 0 1 1mm precipitation were recorded in 90 of all cases the average daily precipitation amount of c 10mm per event as well as the values for the 25 quartile q1 2 4 mm and 75 quartile q3 13 0 mm highlight that the average local rainfall event in vélez blanco is characterized by low intensities the maximum event reaching 181mm of precipitation 19 october 1973 also indicates that extreme weather events occasionally occur 4 2 correlation analysis for event based short term data weak correlation coefficients were found for the relationship between daily precipitation values and water prices the significant correlation ρ 0 001 is to be handled with care since the high sample size n 2973 easily produces such an interrelation table 2 the same also applies to the differentiated analysis of precipitation data and water prices for the spring and summer season march to august revealing a rs value of 0 09 n 1688 4 3 mid term statistics the monthly mean water price for twelve hours of irrigation averages 56 76 n 417 table 3 a maximum in monthly mean water prices occurs during the spring season from march to may 559 61 n 1057 while the highest average monthly prices are achieved during summer from june to august 79 31 this period of time is characterized by the lowest amounts of average monthly precipitation 50 6 mm n 34 ranging from complete lack of rainfall to 189 1mm n 34 the most humid season is autumn with mean monthly precipitation sums of 145 66mm n 896 and maximum sums of 404 9 mm overall monthly precipitations sums average about 35mm n 480 4 4 correlation analysis for mid term data within the mid term correlation analyses monthly precipitation values revealed the highest correlation coefficients when correlated with the mean and maximum water prices from the following month the months march to july reveal rs values 5 the maximum rs value occurs when correlating march precipitation with july water prices totaling rs 0 6 table 4 precipitation conditions in march and april have the highest influence on water pricing throughout the year this pattern also occurs on the seasonal scale where the highest correlations appear between precipitation values of the spring march may and water prices of the summer season june august 4 5 spi seasonality between 1976 and 2006 a total of nine drought phases of different intensities occurred in vélez blanco ranging from 7 months up to 4 years table 5 the most intense drought is recorded for the period from september 1993 to july 1997 with highest spi values during winter 1994 and spring 1995 fig 4 b this drought period was characterized by summers with extremely low precipitation and a marked absence of rainfall from autumn to spring fig 4c e f the only winter drought period occurred from 1970 to 1971 as shown in fig 4b the time period from 1967 to 1977 was dominated by rather humid climatic conditions it was only interrupted by the dry phase of the winter season 1970 71 the most extensive and intense wet period occurred between summer 1971 and autumn 1975 with a duration of 53 consecutive months with positive spi values table 6 in contrast the subsequent time period from 1978 to 1997 was characterized by long lasting droughts that were primarily marked by extremely dry springs seasons and moderately dry summers fig 4e and f the only exception to this general pattern occurred during the extensive humid phase from april 1989 until november 1990 the years between 1997 and 2006 are of rather mixed character during this time extreme events are of lower intensity and moderate duration severe dry summers were recorded in 2000 and 2001 4 6 long term statistics the annual mean water price for irrigation water averages 57 83 and ranges between 15 91 to 109 56 during the analyzed time period n 40 table 7 the standard deviation value of 24 2 n 40 indicates a relatively low spreading of the average annual water price in contrast the annual sums of precipitation show a higher variability that is characterized by a high variance value 22 885 and a standard deviation of 24 2 n 30 the annual sums range from 198 6mm to 782 5mm and average 421 2 mm 4 7 correlation analysis of long term trends the correlation analysis of annual precipitation sums and annual mean water prices shows best correlations on the long term scale rs 0 42 n 40 table 8 weak but still significant correlations significance level 0 05 are achieved by correlating annual precipitation sums with annual maximum water prices rs 0 38 n 40 the isolated correlation of precipitation sums and the mean and maximum water prices of years that where classified as drought years due to their spi values did not reveal significant correlations rs 0 32 n 23 rs 0 23 n 23 4 8 irrigation requirements the direct comparison of monthly precipitation agricultural water demand and average costs of irrigation water from the water auctions shows that especially during the hot and dry summer months there is an increased water demand that results in increased water prices maximum water prices are obtained in august which is the final month of the regular dry season which starts in june fig 5 during this time of the year monthly precipitation sums are usually very low while water requirements for cultivated vegetables and olive trees are still high in contrast prices for irrigation water are at their lowest in december when agricultural water demand is also at its lowest throughout spring a second peak of water prices can be observed for april 4 9 interviews the individuals interviewed comprise 27 male and 3 female farmers with an average age of 58 years ranging from 38 to 83 years except in one case all farmers have held their arable land since more than 25 years over 90 of the landowners hold arable land that is larger than 1ha in size half of the farmers interviewed pursue the agricultural production within the vega of vélez blanco on a full time basis while the other half use it for additional income or subsistence farming over 80 sell their products on local markets while only one of the interview partners stated that they produce for the supraregional market the analysis of the interviews shows that more than 50 of the farmers interviewed regularly take part in the water auctions fig 6 a from these more than 56 rely on additional irrigation water fig 6b and 25 frequently succeed in the auctions fig 6c in general half of the farmers interviewed stated that they think that water prices are too high in the vega of vélez blanco more than 50 of the farmer s state that they have suffered harvest failure several times within a period of the past five years another 30 were affected annually by crop failure while just 17 suffered losses only once in a period of five years fig 7 a nearly all respondents clearly identified the local climate conditions as a cause more precisely heat and drought throughout the summer months and frost during the winter over 90 of the interview partners stated that global climate change is a problem for local agricultural productivity about one third of the farmers use their share of irrigation water for direct irrigation without any kind of storage prior storing is only practiced by another third of the respondents while the rest carry out a mixed type where the irrigation water is only partly stored in private reservoirs balsas fig 7b in total 86 7 of the landholders stated that they practice traditional cultivation methods since the costs associated with modernization are too high for them only one of the famers considered his cultivation techniques as very modern fig 7c 5 discussion our results suggest a weak to relatively high influence of the local climate conditions on the water prices the spearman s rank correlation tests produced negative correlation values between precipitation data and water prices in all cases this tendency of the spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs thus either refers to higher amounts of rainfall correlating with lower prices or lower amounts of rainfall correlating with higher prices the analysis also revealed that there is no overall dependency of water prices on precipitation a large proportion of the water prices paid and the irrigation needs are most probably due to the prevailing socio economic conditions 5 1 impact of natural water availability on water pricing the correlation analysis shows the strongest interrelationship between monthly based data from spring and summer months when high water prices coincide with low precipitation averages during the summer season high temperatures and low precipitation amounts periodically cause increased water requirements for most of the crops cultivated the work by isselhorst et al in press shows that the main growing period and hence increased water demand of most of the cultivated goods in the area coincide with this period the time delayed reaction of cultivated plants to the occurrence of precipitation events is caused by a complex interaction of natural environmental factors such as air temperature evapotranspiration rates rainfall intensity and soil parameters which impact runoff behavior soil moisture and infiltration rates and hence water availability overall berking et al 2016 pereira et al 2002 the highest interrelationship appears with a calculation offset of one month as already stated by numerous authors agricultural water demand is expected to increase during droughts hook 1994 wilhite and glantz 1985 hence we originally assumed that the isolated analysis of water prices and precipitation during drought periods would result in the highest correlation coefficients however the results of our analysis show only moderate correlations for water prices achieved during drought periods this may be related to the classification method which includes months with near normal precipitation conditions in a drought period if they are followed by months with particularly low spi values mckee 1993 consequently the water prices from months with a sufficient amount of precipitation are classified as months of prevailing drought based on only one parameter the spi is nevertheless a frequently used and robust index known for its straightforward application that gives reliable results for the identification of droughts on several timescales hayes et al 1999 in addition no significant correlation between precipitation and water prices was found for the winter season this is mainly due to the prevailing humid weather conditions during this period and the fact that winter is the agricultural off season corresponding to dormancy when only a few crops are grown during this time water demand for irrigation is at its lowest the conversations with local farmers also revealed an appreciable seasonality in the discharge volume from the springs with the annual dry season frequently characterized by noticeably lower discharge rates this indicates seasonal fluctuations within the aquifer s water table 5 2 socio economic influence on water pricing due to the almost enclosed character of the irrigation network and its traditional administrational structures the water market within the vega of vélez blanco can be classified as autonomous but even within this closed system diffused trading structures and unregulated water withdrawal lead to a high internal complexity today water trade between neighboring landowners is mostly tolerated while historically water rights were inseparably bound to a parcel of land syrian system butzer et al 1985 this enables landowners nowadays to sell their legal water shares independently of the irrigation community s water market consequently there is a high estimated number of unrecorded water sales resulting in a certain degree of independence from the water auctions for some of the farmers this also applies to farmers who operate deep well water pumping within the vega farmers who cultivate goods that fetch high market prices are more willing and able to invest in additional irrigation water to improve harvests or prevent crop failure especially during extremely dry periods smallholder farmers who primarily practice subsistence farming are often not able to compete with large scale farmers and their cash crop production consequently the choice of the crop cultivated and the dimension of the agricultural production and with this the limits of possible revenue is of great importance for investment decisions regarding additional irrigation water moreover for the surplus irrigation of cash crops such as olives fruits and vegetables the current market conditions on all scales local regional and global probably play a fundamental role arriaza et al 2002 berbel and gómez limón 2000 fig 8 this study also reveals a difference in water pricing within the five subsystems of the water sharing system of the vega of vélez blanco a major reason for this uneven water pricing is the different irrigation rotation intervals within the five subsystems the longest rotation is the one of the balsa alara where landholders only receive regular irrigation water every 282days navarro sánchez 2010 this means that every landowner who holds legally irrigated land only receives his or her share of water once or twice a year and always during a different season thus there is an increased water demand within this subsystem that results in higher water prices on average in contrast the subsystems of the río de argan and the hila de la unión which have rotation durations of 26 and 20days respectively show the lowest water prices overall that total only about half of the average annual water price of the balsa alara navarro sánchez 2010 the large variation in rotation durations among the subsystems hence reflects an uneven distribution of supply and demand within the respective subsystems this also proves that the size of the area under irrigation the total number of farmers that receive shares of water and the hydraulic infrastructure influence the formation of water prices it is also difficult to differentiate between primarily climate driven water price fluctuations and those that are triggered by other events or processes these might include increasing mechanization of agriculture government supported reforestation projects as well as state supported or subsidized cultivation of almond and olive orchards hence our study can only propose that most probably other aspects must have been of high importance such as the development of economic markets demographic decline e g the ongoing rural exodus which has taken place in vélez blanco since the early 20th century price and subsidy policies and the entry of spain into the european union in contrast the analysis of the water auction data older than 1967 shows that in times of political disturbances such as the spanish civil war 1936 1939 exceptionally high water prices occurred maximum 1 752 48 april 1st 1939 balsa alara these transformations of the local social and economic structures had only minor influences on this otherwise continually working irrigation system however natural water availability has proven to have a most significant influence on water pricing 6 conclusions the study presented reveals a significant impact of different rainfall patterns at various scales on irrigation water requirements this is traceable mainly for the spring and summer periods through significant fluctuations in water prices recorded from regular water auctions in vélez blanco we conclude from this that i cultivated crops show a time delayed reaction to rainfall events causing a significant causal relationship between precipitation sums and water prices on a monthly scale with a temporal offset of one month ii the reliability of precipitation events occurring between march and june are of great importance to meet the irrigation water requirements of cultivated crops during the annual dry summer period iii investment decisions about whether to purchase expensive irrigation water during the regular water auctions are often a matter of economic viability iv the relationship between numbers of stakeholders and water demand is vitally important in water pricing within the water market of vélez blanco v an effect of historical events and socio economic developments is ascertained however the strength of these influence on the local water pricing is

11562,this study uses data from water auctions conducted by the traditional irrigation community of vélez blanco water prices are comprehensively compared and statically correlated with local precipitation data on different temporal scales the data analyzed reach back to 1967 the local prevailing mediterranean climate is characterized by a mean annual precipitation amount of 419mm while effective rainfall 1mm occurs averagely at 37days per year the rainfall distribution data used were of daily seasonal and annual resolution and are assessed on their influence on the local water price formation the results were validated with information about local agricultural practices and subjective perceptions of the vega s status gained from interviews with local farmers results show that high correlation coefficients are achieved when water prices and precipitation data are correlated on a monthly scale the highest correlation coefficients are achieved with a temporal offset of one month throughout the spring and summer season interestingly neither short term water surplus nor long term water deficit consecutive drought years are clearly reflected based on the given data base annual rainfall distribution has proven to be a significant factor that influences water price formation in the vega of vélez blanco keywords traditional water management mediterranean climate interviews with local farmers water auctions aquifer 1 introduction within europe the country of spain is a prime example to study traditional water management with a long history throughout history the water management schemes and cultures of roman moorish iberian and other mediterranean civilizations influenced the technical advancement and administrational management of irrigation on the iberian peninsula brunhes 1902 fröhling 1965 glick 1970 kress 1968 ostrom 1990 especially in the dry sub humid south of the country traditional water management structures and irrigation governance systems date back to medieval times and most likely originate from moorish cultures who conquered spain in the 8th century bce in general modern spanish water law defines water as a public good meaning that it has no monetary value at all only costs for its distribution administration and the maintenance of regulation infrastructure can be charged for arriaza et al 2002 therefore in the following the term water price always refers to the costs of water allocation at present the agricultural sector is the largest water consumer in spain its water consumption for irrigation totals annually 14 535hm3 which is about 75 of the national available water resources ine 2015 overall 3 6 million hectares of spain s agricultural land is equipped for irrigation of which 1 3 million hectares 47 are supplied by groundwater while 2 3 million hectares 63 are irrigated by surface water fao 2017 these numbers demonstrate that groundwater irrigation is vitally important for agricultural production and hence an important factor for the local regional and national economy thinking of the significance of water at these various levels the question always arises what does the water cost the restriction of water costs and the social equity of different water pricing methods is a frequently discussed issue to which there is no universal answer gleick 1997 johansson et al 2002 molle and berkoff 2007 worldwide numerous studies on the pricing of water used for irrigation agriculture are available johansson et al 2002 molle and berkoff 2007 abu zeid 2001 the wide variety of water pricing implementations encompasses volumetric non volumetric and quote systems as well as market based and user based mechanisms in which water is distributed by e g quotas applications or water auctions johansson et al 2002 historically water auctioning was a well known instrument for several irrigation communities in south eastern spain to locally organize the allocation of irrigation water in modern times most of these systems have been abolished e g the huerta de lorca where water was auctioned until its abandonment in 1960 capel 1968 hence the operating water sharing system of vélez blanco presented in this study is a rarity in this study water prices originating from the water auctions of the irrigation community of vélez blanco and daily precipitation records from the local weather station are used to evaluate the influence of rainfall distribution on the water requirements for irrigation agriculture on different temporal scales based on the isolation of the local water sharing system it is locally possible to carry out an independent analysis of the local water market and with this of the formation of water prices data from the water auctions used in this study show that there is a certain willingness of the local landowners to pay high prices for irrigation water this leads to the following central research question what impact does the local rainfall distribution have on the local water requirements and irrigation schemes hence this study tests the statistical significance of correlations between precipitation patterns and archived local water prices on a daily seasonal and annual scale the results are interpreted in the context of irrigation schemes historical events and socio economic conditions 2 the vega of vélez blanco embedded in the mountainous landscape of the sierra de maría situated at a height of 1070m a s l the town of vélez blanco and its vicinity is a fertile spot of intensive agricultural cultivation the irrigated agricultural terraces are located east of the town adjacent to the municipal boundaries locally this area is called vega based on information about similarly structured systems in the region of south eastern spain it is assumed that the water management structures that can be found in the vega of vélez blanco date back to at least the muslim period 8th cent bce whereas written evidences only exist for the last 500 years approximately roth 2015 roth et al 2015 today cultivation within the vega of vélez blanco is dominated by almond and olive groves fruit orchards vegetable gardening and grain farming almond trees which are predominantly cultivated in the upper part of the vega are rarely irrigated whereas vegetable gardening practiced all over the vega has a significantly higher water demand that necessitates irrigation particularly during spring and autumn olive groves are also occasionally irrigated during summer months 2 1 irrigation structures the technical water management facilities that are deployed within the vega of vélez blanco predominantly include traditional structures such as concrete channels acequias to transport sluice gates to divert and reservoirs balsas to store the irrigation water within the parcels of land maintained by the individual landowners traditional techniques like furrow irrigation still dominate while modern irrigation installations such as drip irrigation systems are becoming increasingly important the administration of the water allocation is traditionally managed by the local irrigation community that consists of farmers elected during the general assembly of all farmers owing irrigated land in the vega of vélez blanco the task of the irrigation community is to maintain the irrigation network to organize and execute the irrigation rotations and to host the regular water auctions at the alporchón the term alporchón is defined as a traditional law body that has existed in vélez blanco since time immemorial it is responsible for the local regulation of water sharing and observation of the hydrological regime 1 1 alporchón una entidad jurídico consuetudinaria e inmemorial de base corporative en material de aguas y de regimen hidráulico navarro sánchez 2010 navarro sánchez 2010 roth et al 2015 in principle the water allocation between owners of irrigated land within the vega of vélez blanco is organized in a mixed system of irrigation rotations and water auctions navarro sánchez 2010 the rotational system is based on the subdivision of the irrigated land into irrigation units that are usually named after the respective water source spring river reservoir or channel the five largest of these subunits are balsa alara hila de la unión hilas de conceje hilas de turruquena and río de argan 2 2 hila plural hilas the terms hila hilo or fila are defined as an abstract unit that represents a share of the entirety of available irrigation water from a river spring or canal glick 1970 fig 1 within those systems quantities of irrigation water are measured in volumetric units or units of time depending on the respective subsystem systems carrying the term hila span for the temporal measurement of water units in their name measure irrigation volume in units of time hours and minutes in all other systems the water quantities are measured in volumetric units of arrobes 1 arrobes 48m3 and granos 1 grano 6m3 which is a traditional spanish measurement unit rarely used today navarro sánchez 2010 roth 2015 irrigation water is distributed during daytime 6 a m to 6 p m while during nighttime water refills the respective reservoirs the subsystems rotation intervals range from 20days in the subsystem of hilas de la unión to 282days within those of the balsa alara navarro sánchez 2010 in the course of a rotation each landowner receives a share of irrigation water that corresponds to the size of his or her property in addition the local irrigation community also obtains shares of irrigation water out of the rotations that they sell in rations of exactly 12h of irrigation water to the highest bidder during regular water auctions tyrakowski 2001 for the water auctions quantities of irrigation water are always measured in units of time independent from the initial system the revenue from the auctions are used to cover personnel expenses for the staff of the irrigation community and the costs associated with the maintenance of the technical infrastructure see also isselhorst et al in press handwritten records of these water auctions are stored in the archive of the alporchón covering the last hundred years 2 2 environmental setting due to its favorable location adjacent to the orce maría aquifer at the southern edge of the baetic system the town of vélez blanco and the irrigated agricultural fields in its vega benefit from a perennial fresh water supply in this mountainous area the orce maría aquifer functions as the region s water tower fig 1 geologically the orce maría aquifer is mainly composed of jurassic dolomite and limestone that crop out to form a mountain chain running west east between the towns of cúllar and vélez blanco about 70 of the aquifer is located in the guadalquivir catchment while the remaining 30 belong to the segura drainage basin gonzález ramón et al 2016 the aquifer is characterized by recharge rates of approximately one third of the annual received precipitation which corresponds to the recharge rates of other carbonate aquifers within the baetic system which vary between 33 and 55 moreno calvillo et al 1983 the groundwater flow is oriented towards the aquifer s eastern and western borders where the main discharge points are located in the form of tapped springs andreo et al 2008 vélez blanco is located at the eastern edge of the aquifer the main spring water level is situated above the village on the eastern slope of the mount maimón at the western edge of the aquifer the main discharge points are located near the town of orce draining into the guadalquivir basin in between springs of minor importance occur on the northern slopes of the sierra de maría whereas on the southern slopes discharge points are rare in addition to the natural discharge of the aquifer groundwater extraction by deep well pumping threatens the natural water balance of the orce maría aquifer the intensification of groundwater extraction for agricultural production since the late 1940s has led to imbalances between groundwater recharge rates and water extraction volumes all over spain especially the technical revolution of deep well pumps between 1950 and 1970 greatly increased groundwater abstraction llamas et al 2015 2 3 climate in most parts of southern spain the climate is classified as mediterranean with a pronounced dry period throughout the summer months and a rainy season from autumn to spring most of the precipitation events occur during autumn while winter and spring show a higher variability in rainfall geiger 1970 rodrigo et al 2000 due to the complex topography of southern spain local climate characteristics show a wide variation in temporal and spatial distribution local climates can be classified into coastal inland and mountainous climates pita lópez 2003 in general average annual amounts of precipitation decline from the mountainous climate region of the baetic system with annual precipitation amounts of up to 1300mm in the sierra de maría down to the coastal areas where precipitation amounts of less than 150mm are characteristic for the vicinity of cabo de gata pulido calvo et al 2012 pita lópez 2003 the local climate in vélez blanco shows a pronounced seasonality of precipitation events and annual variations in temperature the annual precipitation averages of 419mm and predominantly falls from september to may while rainfall is most reliable in autumn between september and november fig 2 in contrast the summer months from june to august are characterized by high temperatures and low amounts of precipitation with the least rainfall and highest temperatures in july throughout the year monthly average temperature drops constantly from august to december and starts to rise again in february with a constant increase until july with an annual average of 12 1c see also isselhorst et al in press especially during the winter months december and january frost periods occur 3 material and methods daily precipitation data and hand written records of regular water auctions from the irrigation community in vélez blanco are used to investigate causal relationships between natural water availability and agricultural demand of irrigation water on different temporal scales for the analyses of climatic data the temperature and precipitation data were statistically treated to reveal short term events daily precipitation mid term or seasonal patterns monthly aggraded data and long term trends annually aggregated data and values for the standardized precipitation index spi a widely used drought index fig 3 the results of the statistical analysis were compared to results from structured interviews with local farmers from the vega of vélez blanco 3 1 water prices the archive of water auction data includes 7735 handwritten records of individual water auctions that took place between january 1929 and september 2012 for the sake of comparability a subset of 40 years defined by the temporal coverage of the climate data 1967 2006 was used for the analysis the data set is subdivided according to the five subsystems of the local water distribution system of the vega of vélez blanco which are named after their respective water reservoir balsa alara hilas de turruquena hilas de conceje hila de la unión and río de argan the water prices given in spanish pesetas were converted to euros using the official exchange rate given by the european central bank 1 166 386 esp european central bank 2017 to enable an inter annual comparability a historical set of annual inflation values for spain provided by de motes 2013 were used for inflation adjustment of the water auction data 3 2 climate data for event based analysis daily precipitation measurements 1967 2006 recorded at the weather station in vélez blanco 37 41 n 2 05 w and daily temperature data from the nearby station in maría 37 42 n 2 09 w were analyzed with standard statistical methods to characterize the local climate and for the correlation analyzes on a daily monthly and annual scale aemet 2014 3 3 statistical data analysis standard descriptive statistics were calculated on a short daily and event based mid monthly and seasonally and long term annually scale for precipitation data and water prices from 1967 to 2006 the calculation of minimum min maximum max and mean mean precipitation sums and water prices 0 25 quartile q1 0 75 quartile q3 variance var standard deviation std the software package spss 19 was used for the analysis a test for normal distribution was applied to all datasets used in this study to determine the most appropriate method for the correlation analysis the application of the shapiro wilk normality test indicated that climate data and water prices both show a non normal distribution hence a rank based spearman s correlation was applied to analyze potential relationships between water auction data and water prices on multiple scales from daily to annual values the non normal distribution also necessitates a definition of extreme values based on the datasets interquartile range where the lowermost boundary is defined by the 0 25 quartile and the uppermost boundary is specified by the 0 75 quartile all values outside of this range are treated as potential outliers correlation analyses were only conducted with initial data hence missing data were not substituted by long term average values the software packages used for the analyses were r spss 19 and microsoft excel 3 4 mid and long term climate analysis and standardized precipitation index spi calculation the calculation of the spi as developed by mckee et al 1995 was applied on an annual and seasonal temporal scale to identify the variability of the local climate within the time period from 1967 to 2006 the index is widely used as an effective indicator for the quantification of rainfall deficits or surpluses that can be applied on several scales from months to years mckee et al 1995 machado et al 2011 vicente serrano 2006 ji and peters 2003 classification of spi values was applied as suggested by mckee et al 1995 according to mckee 1993 a spi value of 1 or less indicates a drought the start of the respective drought is then set to the first occurrence of negative spi values and continues until the first positive value is recorded again in addition for each drought period defined an associated value for the drought magnitude was calculated to evaluate drought intensity for the definition of humid phases this classification was inverted consequently humid phases are indicated every time the spi reaches values above 1 ji and peters 2003 have shown that a 3 months spi shows the highest correlation with vegetation patterns due to the time lag between the occurrence of a rainfall event and the response of vegetation hence the 3 months spi seems a suitable indicator for agricultural droughts in contrast the 12 months spi or more is often used to determine hydrological droughts because of its ruggedness against intra annual variations vicente serrano and cuadrat 2002 in this study the 12 months spi was calculated for the definition of large scale drought events while the 3 months spi was used to characterize and compare seasonal variations for the four main periods september to november december to february march to may june to august 3 5 interviews with local farmers a total of 30 interviews with randomly selected famers from the vega of vélez blanco were conducted during spring 2016 the interviews comprised 31 questions of open semi open and closed character to obtain the farmers subjective perception of the vega s current status and to determine their individual methods of cultivation 4 results 4 1 short term statistics the 3805 individual water prices achieved at individual auctions and assigned to the period between 1967 and 2003 range from 0 41 to 559 61 table 1 all prices refer to twelve hours of irrigation most water auctions were conducted for the subsystem of the balsa alara n 851 whilst the least sales were carried out for the subsystem río de argan n 654 overall the price for twelve hours of irrigation water averages 62 90 n 3805 the lowest mean prices for irrigation water was achieved for the subsystem río de argan 44 29 n 654 and the highest average water fees were for the area of the balsa alara where the water price averages 90 88 n 851 the maximum water prices within the different subsystems range from 264 90 to 559 61 with the maximum water price in the subsystem hilas de turruquena n 833 being twice as high as for the system río de argan out of the 13 799days for which precipitation was recorded 1967 2003 only at 1466days the rainfall was higher than 1mm 10 of the days with precipitation while daily sums of 0 1 1mm precipitation were recorded in 90 of all cases the average daily precipitation amount of c 10mm per event as well as the values for the 25 quartile q1 2 4 mm and 75 quartile q3 13 0 mm highlight that the average local rainfall event in vélez blanco is characterized by low intensities the maximum event reaching 181mm of precipitation 19 october 1973 also indicates that extreme weather events occasionally occur 4 2 correlation analysis for event based short term data weak correlation coefficients were found for the relationship between daily precipitation values and water prices the significant correlation ρ 0 001 is to be handled with care since the high sample size n 2973 easily produces such an interrelation table 2 the same also applies to the differentiated analysis of precipitation data and water prices for the spring and summer season march to august revealing a rs value of 0 09 n 1688 4 3 mid term statistics the monthly mean water price for twelve hours of irrigation averages 56 76 n 417 table 3 a maximum in monthly mean water prices occurs during the spring season from march to may 559 61 n 1057 while the highest average monthly prices are achieved during summer from june to august 79 31 this period of time is characterized by the lowest amounts of average monthly precipitation 50 6 mm n 34 ranging from complete lack of rainfall to 189 1mm n 34 the most humid season is autumn with mean monthly precipitation sums of 145 66mm n 896 and maximum sums of 404 9 mm overall monthly precipitations sums average about 35mm n 480 4 4 correlation analysis for mid term data within the mid term correlation analyses monthly precipitation values revealed the highest correlation coefficients when correlated with the mean and maximum water prices from the following month the months march to july reveal rs values 5 the maximum rs value occurs when correlating march precipitation with july water prices totaling rs 0 6 table 4 precipitation conditions in march and april have the highest influence on water pricing throughout the year this pattern also occurs on the seasonal scale where the highest correlations appear between precipitation values of the spring march may and water prices of the summer season june august 4 5 spi seasonality between 1976 and 2006 a total of nine drought phases of different intensities occurred in vélez blanco ranging from 7 months up to 4 years table 5 the most intense drought is recorded for the period from september 1993 to july 1997 with highest spi values during winter 1994 and spring 1995 fig 4 b this drought period was characterized by summers with extremely low precipitation and a marked absence of rainfall from autumn to spring fig 4c e f the only winter drought period occurred from 1970 to 1971 as shown in fig 4b the time period from 1967 to 1977 was dominated by rather humid climatic conditions it was only interrupted by the dry phase of the winter season 1970 71 the most extensive and intense wet period occurred between summer 1971 and autumn 1975 with a duration of 53 consecutive months with positive spi values table 6 in contrast the subsequent time period from 1978 to 1997 was characterized by long lasting droughts that were primarily marked by extremely dry springs seasons and moderately dry summers fig 4e and f the only exception to this general pattern occurred during the extensive humid phase from april 1989 until november 1990 the years between 1997 and 2006 are of rather mixed character during this time extreme events are of lower intensity and moderate duration severe dry summers were recorded in 2000 and 2001 4 6 long term statistics the annual mean water price for irrigation water averages 57 83 and ranges between 15 91 to 109 56 during the analyzed time period n 40 table 7 the standard deviation value of 24 2 n 40 indicates a relatively low spreading of the average annual water price in contrast the annual sums of precipitation show a higher variability that is characterized by a high variance value 22 885 and a standard deviation of 24 2 n 30 the annual sums range from 198 6mm to 782 5mm and average 421 2 mm 4 7 correlation analysis of long term trends the correlation analysis of annual precipitation sums and annual mean water prices shows best correlations on the long term scale rs 0 42 n 40 table 8 weak but still significant correlations significance level 0 05 are achieved by correlating annual precipitation sums with annual maximum water prices rs 0 38 n 40 the isolated correlation of precipitation sums and the mean and maximum water prices of years that where classified as drought years due to their spi values did not reveal significant correlations rs 0 32 n 23 rs 0 23 n 23 4 8 irrigation requirements the direct comparison of monthly precipitation agricultural water demand and average costs of irrigation water from the water auctions shows that especially during the hot and dry summer months there is an increased water demand that results in increased water prices maximum water prices are obtained in august which is the final month of the regular dry season which starts in june fig 5 during this time of the year monthly precipitation sums are usually very low while water requirements for cultivated vegetables and olive trees are still high in contrast prices for irrigation water are at their lowest in december when agricultural water demand is also at its lowest throughout spring a second peak of water prices can be observed for april 4 9 interviews the individuals interviewed comprise 27 male and 3 female farmers with an average age of 58 years ranging from 38 to 83 years except in one case all farmers have held their arable land since more than 25 years over 90 of the landowners hold arable land that is larger than 1ha in size half of the farmers interviewed pursue the agricultural production within the vega of vélez blanco on a full time basis while the other half use it for additional income or subsistence farming over 80 sell their products on local markets while only one of the interview partners stated that they produce for the supraregional market the analysis of the interviews shows that more than 50 of the farmers interviewed regularly take part in the water auctions fig 6 a from these more than 56 rely on additional irrigation water fig 6b and 25 frequently succeed in the auctions fig 6c in general half of the farmers interviewed stated that they think that water prices are too high in the vega of vélez blanco more than 50 of the farmer s state that they have suffered harvest failure several times within a period of the past five years another 30 were affected annually by crop failure while just 17 suffered losses only once in a period of five years fig 7 a nearly all respondents clearly identified the local climate conditions as a cause more precisely heat and drought throughout the summer months and frost during the winter over 90 of the interview partners stated that global climate change is a problem for local agricultural productivity about one third of the farmers use their share of irrigation water for direct irrigation without any kind of storage prior storing is only practiced by another third of the respondents while the rest carry out a mixed type where the irrigation water is only partly stored in private reservoirs balsas fig 7b in total 86 7 of the landholders stated that they practice traditional cultivation methods since the costs associated with modernization are too high for them only one of the famers considered his cultivation techniques as very modern fig 7c 5 discussion our results suggest a weak to relatively high influence of the local climate conditions on the water prices the spearman s rank correlation tests produced negative correlation values between precipitation data and water prices in all cases this tendency of the spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs thus either refers to higher amounts of rainfall correlating with lower prices or lower amounts of rainfall correlating with higher prices the analysis also revealed that there is no overall dependency of water prices on precipitation a large proportion of the water prices paid and the irrigation needs are most probably due to the prevailing socio economic conditions 5 1 impact of natural water availability on water pricing the correlation analysis shows the strongest interrelationship between monthly based data from spring and summer months when high water prices coincide with low precipitation averages during the summer season high temperatures and low precipitation amounts periodically cause increased water requirements for most of the crops cultivated the work by isselhorst et al in press shows that the main growing period and hence increased water demand of most of the cultivated goods in the area coincide with this period the time delayed reaction of cultivated plants to the occurrence of precipitation events is caused by a complex interaction of natural environmental factors such as air temperature evapotranspiration rates rainfall intensity and soil parameters which impact runoff behavior soil moisture and infiltration rates and hence water availability overall berking et al 2016 pereira et al 2002 the highest interrelationship appears with a calculation offset of one month as already stated by numerous authors agricultural water demand is expected to increase during droughts hook 1994 wilhite and glantz 1985 hence we originally assumed that the isolated analysis of water prices and precipitation during drought periods would result in the highest correlation coefficients however the results of our analysis show only moderate correlations for water prices achieved during drought periods this may be related to the classification method which includes months with near normal precipitation conditions in a drought period if they are followed by months with particularly low spi values mckee 1993 consequently the water prices from months with a sufficient amount of precipitation are classified as months of prevailing drought based on only one parameter the spi is nevertheless a frequently used and robust index known for its straightforward application that gives reliable results for the identification of droughts on several timescales hayes et al 1999 in addition no significant correlation between precipitation and water prices was found for the winter season this is mainly due to the prevailing humid weather conditions during this period and the fact that winter is the agricultural off season corresponding to dormancy when only a few crops are grown during this time water demand for irrigation is at its lowest the conversations with local farmers also revealed an appreciable seasonality in the discharge volume from the springs with the annual dry season frequently characterized by noticeably lower discharge rates this indicates seasonal fluctuations within the aquifer s water table 5 2 socio economic influence on water pricing due to the almost enclosed character of the irrigation network and its traditional administrational structures the water market within the vega of vélez blanco can be classified as autonomous but even within this closed system diffused trading structures and unregulated water withdrawal lead to a high internal complexity today water trade between neighboring landowners is mostly tolerated while historically water rights were inseparably bound to a parcel of land syrian system butzer et al 1985 this enables landowners nowadays to sell their legal water shares independently of the irrigation community s water market consequently there is a high estimated number of unrecorded water sales resulting in a certain degree of independence from the water auctions for some of the farmers this also applies to farmers who operate deep well water pumping within the vega farmers who cultivate goods that fetch high market prices are more willing and able to invest in additional irrigation water to improve harvests or prevent crop failure especially during extremely dry periods smallholder farmers who primarily practice subsistence farming are often not able to compete with large scale farmers and their cash crop production consequently the choice of the crop cultivated and the dimension of the agricultural production and with this the limits of possible revenue is of great importance for investment decisions regarding additional irrigation water moreover for the surplus irrigation of cash crops such as olives fruits and vegetables the current market conditions on all scales local regional and global probably play a fundamental role arriaza et al 2002 berbel and gómez limón 2000 fig 8 this study also reveals a difference in water pricing within the five subsystems of the water sharing system of the vega of vélez blanco a major reason for this uneven water pricing is the different irrigation rotation intervals within the five subsystems the longest rotation is the one of the balsa alara where landholders only receive regular irrigation water every 282days navarro sánchez 2010 this means that every landowner who holds legally irrigated land only receives his or her share of water once or twice a year and always during a different season thus there is an increased water demand within this subsystem that results in higher water prices on average in contrast the subsystems of the río de argan and the hila de la unión which have rotation durations of 26 and 20days respectively show the lowest water prices overall that total only about half of the average annual water price of the balsa alara navarro sánchez 2010 the large variation in rotation durations among the subsystems hence reflects an uneven distribution of supply and demand within the respective subsystems this also proves that the size of the area under irrigation the total number of farmers that receive shares of water and the hydraulic infrastructure influence the formation of water prices it is also difficult to differentiate between primarily climate driven water price fluctuations and those that are triggered by other events or processes these might include increasing mechanization of agriculture government supported reforestation projects as well as state supported or subsidized cultivation of almond and olive orchards hence our study can only propose that most probably other aspects must have been of high importance such as the development of economic markets demographic decline e g the ongoing rural exodus which has taken place in vélez blanco since the early 20th century price and subsidy policies and the entry of spain into the european union in contrast the analysis of the water auction data older than 1967 shows that in times of political disturbances such as the spanish civil war 1936 1939 exceptionally high water prices occurred maximum 1 752 48 april 1st 1939 balsa alara these transformations of the local social and economic structures had only minor influences on this otherwise continually working irrigation system however natural water availability has proven to have a most significant influence on water pricing 6 conclusions the study presented reveals a significant impact of different rainfall patterns at various scales on irrigation water requirements this is traceable mainly for the spring and summer periods through significant fluctuations in water prices recorded from regular water auctions in vélez blanco we conclude from this that i cultivated crops show a time delayed reaction to rainfall events causing a significant causal relationship between precipitation sums and water prices on a monthly scale with a temporal offset of one month ii the reliability of precipitation events occurring between march and june are of great importance to meet the irrigation water requirements of cultivated crops during the annual dry summer period iii investment decisions about whether to purchase expensive irrigation water during the regular water auctions are often a matter of economic viability iv the relationship between numbers of stakeholders and water demand is vitally important in water pricing within the water market of vélez blanco v an effect of historical events and socio economic developments is ascertained however the strength of these influence on the local water pricing is hard to determine acknowledgements this study is part of the cluster of excellence topoi exc 264 the formation and transformation of space and knowledge in ancient civilizations the meteorological

11563,according to the research performed the agricultural sector is the major water consumer therefore reducing the demand and the use of water in this sector has an effective role in solving the problems related to water scarcity in this study a hybrid topsis agent based model has been developed to find a solution for this problem in the six management regions of doroudzan irrigation and drainage network in fars province iran two main groups of agents consisting of the government and stakeholders were considered all farmers who lived in the same village assumed as an agricultural agent some influential parameters such as neighbors impacts training penalties and incentives were considered in the agent based model abm in some previous abm models the same coefficients applied for all agents however without considering the stakeholders characteristics and conditions of each agent and region there might be the threat of making unfeasible theoretical decisions therefore in this study the topsis method was linked to abm to determine the uniqueness of these coefficients for each agent the abm coefficients were determined by topsis method through the use of the demographic social economic and cultural variables and expert s viewpoints water demand requested by farmers was calculated based on the existing cropping pattern and the reduction of that was determined by the developed model in different climatic conditions wet normal and drought the results showed that the water requested by the farmers before applying the abm were 7 6 18 2 and 45 and after that they were 1 37 3 5 and 1 09 more than the allocatable water in wet normal and drought conditions respectively in order to reduce the water demand requested by farmers and maintain the effect of management tools

the biggest environmental threats in many countries is a deficiency or lack of access to clean drinking water and sanitation giupponi and paz 2015 water resources are influenced by land uses cropping patterns and industrial developments there should be a balance in the ecosystem of the basin the region s natural hydrology and the rate of water consumption therefore it is important that different sections in a country including agriculture energy industry fisheries tourism and the government have appropriate planning in water resource management so that they bring this balance mugagga and nabaasa 2016 management of common pool resources is a complex process and this is because of the lack of a clear understanding of stakeholders behavioral characteristics van oel et al 2010 non cooperative decision making on the basis of a personal belief and vanity because of the lack of knowledge and trust in stakeholders can result in catastrophic performances without a clear understanding of the reaction of decision makers even regulatory institutions can t sustain natural common pool resources although modeling can help understand the complex interaction between human and nature the previous studies have not been able to simulate this system precisely due to 1 lake of suitable mathematical models for analysis of systems with self optimizing stakeholders and 2 lack of information about the properties and behavior of the stakeholders in common pool resource systems due to the absence of the detailed regulatory system pierce 2013 pierce and madani 2014 in recent years top down approaches are being replaced by bottom up approaches in water resources management and tried to address the first limitation by using agent based models abms abms have widely been used in recent years to analyze complex systems such as water allocation and management investigating the community and farmers behaviors and decision making process akhbari and grigg 2013 ding et al 2016 farhadi et al 2016 feuillette et al 2003 holtz and pahl wostl 2012 kent 2014 mohan and kumar 2009 mulligan et al 2014 ng et al 2011 quanli et al 2015 reeves and zellner 2010 schmidt et al 2011 vegesana and mckenzie 2015 yang et al 2009 some studies have shown that the use of abm as a decision support tool has better results compared to the classic models barreteau et al 2003 these researchers provide different optimal water allocation scenarios that have the ability to be accepted and applied by different sectors with regards to the views interests and aspirations of stakeholders these models define the space in which agents interact with each other and also indicate how agents grow move or reproduce reeves and zellner 2010 akhbari and grigg 2013 proposed a framework to manage the existing conflicts in water resources in california s san joaquin river watershed recently farhadi et al 2016 have developed the akhbari and grigg s abm to find a sustainable groundwater management solution in thirteen management sub regions in daryan aquifer fars province iran so far no abm study has been conducted to reduce the stakeholders requested water and optimize the cropping patterns through a focus on the agents characteristics today the largest volume of freshwater in the world is consumed by the agricultural sector sepaskhah and ahmadi 2012 optimizing the cropping pattern is one of the main strategies for reducing the water demand in the agricultural sector that has widely been considered by researchers ghasemi et al 2016 montazar et al 2010 on the other hand an improved allocation of water in irrigation and drainage networks aims at different factors that among them maximizing the farmers income is one of the most important ones daneshvar kakhki and shahnoushi froshani 2009 karamouz et al 2009 malekian et al 2012 singh et al 2001 srivastava and singh 2015 wang and zhou 2004 there are also some investigations considering the social rani and rao 2012 shreedhar et al 2015 and environmental aspects daneshvar kakhki and shahnoushi froshani 2009 srivastava and singh 2015 of optimizing the cropping pattern in different regions in the previous studies the best cropping pattern was determined according to the considered objective functions and constraints using the several optimization approaches including linear programming malekian et al 2012 rani and rao 2012 shreedhar et al 2015 singh et al 2001 nonlinear programming ghahraman and sepaskhah 2002 sadati et al 2014 dynamic programming kipkorir et al 2002 and evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga ghahraman and sepaskhah 1999 karamouz et al 2009 sadati et al 2014 furthermore deficit irrigation is one of the best strategies for promoting the water productivity rabiee 2010 sarwar and perry 2002 and widely used by many researchers chai et al 2016 chaves et al 2007 chuanjie et al 2015 fereres and soriano 2006 fernández et al 2006 fernández et al 2013 geerts and raes 2009 rinaldi et al 2014 talebnejad and sepaskhah 2016 however a more accurate investigation reveals that most of these proposed patterns have not considered the stakeholders conditions and they have remained at the theory level without being acceptable and applicable by farmers the development of some new methods such as agent based modeling in which the conditions and behavioral functions of the stakeholders are considered as a common source could be the solution to this problem that brings the research results in to the real world and materializes them in this paper a hybrid topsis agent based modeling is used for estimating the water demands requested by the farmers therefore the abm presented by akhbari and grigg 2013 that further extended by farhadi et al 2016 is used for six management regions of doroudzan irrigation and drainage network in fars province iran in practice considering all farmers agents and their conditions in optimization modeling is a difficult task and it is almost impossible in the large scale such as an irrigation and drainage network with a large number of farmers to do so therefore one of the innovative strategies in this research was considering all farmers that inhabit in the same village as a single agricultural agent together with their social cultural and economic conditions thus 67 agents in the agricultural sector as demanding agents and the government are the main agents in this study akhbari and grigg 2013 and farhadi et al 2016 considered the same coefficients for all agricultural agents in the abm without paying attention to their differences and conditions therefore in this study the topsis decision making method is linked to the akhbari and grigg s abm and the abm coefficients were determined specially for each agent these coefficients are determined according to demographic social cultural and economic properties of each agricultural agent and experts viewpoints the water requested by the agricultural agents before and after applying the abm is calculated and the effect of abm on the reduction of water demand requested by farmers in different climatic conditions wet normal and drought is evaluated finally an optimization model with the goal of maximizing profit and considering deficit irrigation for six management regions in different climatic conditions wet normal and drought is developed this model is solved using ga in matlab software for optimization of cropping pattern and for maintaining the stability of the reduced water demand and increased farmers satisfaction 2 methodology the main goal of this study is determining the reduction of water demand requested in the agricultural sector considering the social conditions of farmers the present framework has been created based on akhbari and grigg s abm after gathering the required data in the first step the stakeholders were divided into two main sectors including farmers and the state government in the second step water demand requested by each agricultural agent was determined according to the existing cropping pattern then in the third step according to the amount of allocatable water to each agent the cooperative and non cooperative agents were determined at the next step the new water demand of each agent was computed based on akhbari and grigg s abm a multi criteria decision making method topsis was used to determine the abm required coefficients after determining the new water demand for each agent the cropping pattern optimization model was developed to maximize the net income and to consider deficit irrigation it was then implemented using the ga optimization algorithm step 4 and the optimized cropping pattern was obtained for the investigated region the algorithm of the proposed methodology is shown in fig 1 2 1 agent based model abm the abm model that proposed by akhbari and grigg 2013 has different steps as indicated below step 1 identifying consumer agent behavior if the allocatable water for agent i is more than the water demand requested by this agent the behavior of this agent is cooperative otherwise the behavior of this agent is non cooperative step 2 investigating the government plans to control over consumption of water or water demand in that region if any it is assumed that if the government has a plan the water demand requested by agents will be reduced by optimum allocatable water step 3 considering social characteristics of agents and the environment and use of policy mechanisms to reduce water demand requested by them step 4 determining new water demands for each farmer agent fig 2 indicates the flowchart of the abm used in this study to determine water demands requested by agents with regard to their social conditions it is necessary to identify the agents before applying the abm in this model two main groups of stakeholders are defined the state government and diversions farmers in the present study all the farmers living in the same village have been considered as a single consumer agent in akhbari and grigg s framework among the influencing parameters on agents behavior policy mechanisms and social factors such as neighbors impacts training penalties and incentives were considered they provided the following equations and relations to determine the effect of these parameters on the type of the cooperative or non cooperative behaviors of each agent akhbari and grigg 2013 1 u i max u i c c a v i c f m u i c n c b v i n c 2 u i max u i n c c c v i c f m u i n c n c d v i n c where u i c c and u i c nc are the utility of agent i that is a cooperative agent and will remain and change this behavior to non cooperative respectively u i nc nc and u i nc c are the utility of agent i that is a non cooperative agent and will remain and change this behavior to cooperative respectively v i c and v i nc are the fraction of cooperative and non cooperative neighbors for agent i respectively akhbari and grigg 2013 and farhadi et al 2016 assumed a d 0 7 and b c 0 3 based on edwards et al 2005 if the agent has cooperative behavior the government may use incentives and training facilities to keep this behavior in the future the judicial system will be force the non cooperative agents d max i γq opt i to cooperate i e nd max i q opt i q opt i and d max i are the optimum and maximum water demands for agent i in terms of government respectively f m is the correction factor and farhadi et al 2016 proposed eqs 3 and 4 for the cooperative and non cooperative agents respectively to indicate the influences of incentives training and penalties 3 f m 1 a α i t r a i n 1 α q o p t i d max i q o p t i 2 4 f m 1 b β i t r a i n 1 β d max i q o p t i γ q o p t i 2 in these equations i train is the training impact of agent s knowledge and education on the utility of the agent i to cooperate α and β are local coefficients which determine the fraction of incentives and training on a cooperative agent and penalty and training impacts on a non cooperative agent respectively γ is a regional coefficient that force some agents to accept water allocations farhadi et al 2016 assumed α β and γ equal to 0 7 0 6 and 1 2 respectively these assumptions were based on the experts views however they believed these coefficients must be defined based on social studies on agents behavior finally the new water demand requested by agent i whit cooperative and non cooperative behaviors are calculated with eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 n d max i q o p t i d max i q o p t i 1 u i 6 n d max i q o p t i more details and information about this model could be found in akhbari 2012 akhbari and grigg 2013 2015 and farhadi et al 2016 as the individual features facilities social and economic conditions of each agent are different from the others it s essential that the policy mechanism and managerial tools in akhbari and grigg s model be computed and applied specifically for each agent however in the research and studies by akhbari and grigg 2013 and farhadi et al 2016 this point was not considered and they applied the same coefficient for all agricultural agents in the abm in the present study some of the economic cultural social and demographic variables which affect on the way of decision making and impressibility of agents were selected according to the experts views and previous research studies in the region they were used for determining the training reward and punishment coefficients of each agent by the use of topsis method that is employed to develop a hybrid topsis agent based model with akhbari and grigg s abm finally the amounts of α β γ and i train coefficients were calculated for each agent and applied in abm the flowchart of the proposed hybrid topsis agent based model is presented in fig 2 2 2 the topsis decision making method the topsis technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution method in 1981 is presented by hwang and yoon in this method the selected alternatives have the maximum distance from the negative ideal solution and the minimum distance from the positive ideal solution the steps of this method described below behzadian et al 2012 step zero create a decision matrix with q criteria and f alternatives step 1 calculate the normalized decision matrix using the normalization method 7 r k k x k k x k z 2 f o r k 1 f z 1 q where x kz and r kz are original and normalized score of decision matrix respectively step 2 calculate the weighted normalized decision matrix 8 v k z w z r k z where w z is the weight

doorenbos and kassam 1979 have been developed many crop water production functions cwpfs also rao et al 1988 extended doorenbos and kassam cwpf for different growth stages each of these cwpfs has some weaknesses and strengths but the investigation of saleh and wardlaw 2009 showed that with using the existing crop yield coefficients the results of all functions are approximately the same in literature the jensen function and doorenbos and kassam function and extended form of this equation are more popular ganji and shekarriz fard 2010 georgiou and papamichail 2008 ghahraman and sepaskhah 2002 ghahraman and sepaskhah 1999 ghahraman and sepaskhah 2004 lalehzari et al 2015 sadati et al 2014 varzi 2016 the values of yield response factors of doorenbos and kassam function were specified for approximately 33 crops by doorenbos and kassam 1979 but there are only some scattered and limited reports on yield response factor of jensen equation ghahraman and sepaskhah 2004 in this study the extended form of doorenbos and kassam 1979 function rao et al 1988 has been used 14 y a y p j 1 n 1 k y j 1 e t a e t p j where y a and y p are the actual and maximum yield kg ha 1 and eta and etp are actual and maximum evapotranspiration mm respectively for determining the optimal cropping pattern an optimization model has been used to maximize the total farm income and to apply deficit irrigation during the crop growth based on meyer et al 1993 and montazar et al 2010 et a et p w a w p w a and w p are the water used and the potential water demand respectively therefore the objective function of this optimization model is as follows 15 t n i j 1 n a j y p j p c j 1 k y j d c o j p w j 1 n i r j 1 d a j where tni is total net income n is the number of crops j is the crop index p c is crop

m 3 and ir is total irrigation water m3 ha 1 in this objective function a and d are variable parameters the constraints and assumptions in the objective function are defined based on ghahraman and

that the soil moisture in the beginning of the irrigation season for all summer and winter crops and soils are equal to field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp respectively the effective root depth depends on some environmental factors types of crops and soils as well as irrigation scheduling in this study borg and grimes 1986 sigmoid curve was used for estimation of effective root

the doroudzan dam in fars province in southwest of iran 29 50 n 51 53 e 30 15 n 52 22 e rezaeianzadeh et al 2016 doroudzan dam has been located on the kor river in bakhtegan basin and it is one of the largest reservoirs in fars province with a storage capacity of 960 mcm sadati et al 2014 doroudzan dam provides water for 114 500 ha of farmland under six traditional and modern irrigation and drainage networks the doroudzan irrigation and drainage network with 56 000 ha of irrigated areas and six regions including main canal region 1 left canal region 2 ordibehesht canal region 3 hamoon canal region 4 along the left canal region 5 along the hamoon canal region 6 is the most famous networks there the location of doroudzan irrigation and drainage network and the properties of each region and the amount of allocatable water from the doroudzan dam to each region are presented in fig 3 and table 1 respectively in this study the data on existing cropping patterns and water requirements for the six management regions in different climatic conditions were extracted these cropping patterns are shown in table 2 in this research the selection of the crops for the optimized cropping pattern was based on some factors including the approved cropping pattern of the province national and regional policies constraints of water resources and the experiences and interests of the farmers on the other hand selecting some crops such as wheat as strategic crops for food security is essential finally seven types of crops including wheat barley canola sugar beet grain maize silage maize and rice were selected for cropping pattern optimization there are some other concerns for example rice can only be cultivated in wet conditions and in 14 3 of the lands according to the regional policies fars regional water organization 2012 cultivating in a smaller area for all types of crops were determined by a comparison between existing cropping pattern table 2 proposed cropping pattern of fars regional water agency and provincial culture council crop pattern the total area used for crops with same growing periods must be equal or less than the total available area the amount of water required for cultivating crops in each region in any climatic conditions can t be more than the allocatable water to that region table 1 the lower bound of deficit irrigation for all crops assumed to be zero and upper bounds were determined based on previous studies the critical information and data about selected crops have been presented in table 3 in this study in order to determine the criteria for classification of the farmers all farmers living in a village were considered as an agent of the agricultural sector so all the villages located in the doroudzan irrigation and drainage network were identified table 4 then the water requirements of the farmers in each village under the different climatic conditions were calculated according to the gathered information table 2 and location of each village in the six regions of doroudzan irrigation and drainage network based on previous studies in the study area some parameters such as age education level family size the size of the agricultural lands and the cultivated area had a direct and positive relation with farmers attitudes toward participation in water management azizi khalkheili and zamani 2014 ghareghani and hayati 2012 education level attending in training courses and the amount of agricultural lands had a meaningful relation with presence of environmental behaviors mennatizadeh and zamani 2013 also in other studies a series of demographic variables social and cultural variables and economic variables have been referred to as effective variables on farmer behavior and reaction in accepting innovations and changes in the management of doroudzan irrigation and drainage network fars regional water organization 2012 therefore in this study with regard to the available facilities and data and research methodology which is using the documentary research method and expert opinions some demographic economic cultural and social variables are shown in fig 4 have been selected for determining the abm coefficients itrain α β and γ based on topsis method 2 4 1 demographic variables in this study some demographic variables including population education level family size the sex ratio and immigration were selected and their values for each agent village were extracted the details about these demographic variables are described below 2 4 1 1 population the rural population growth of the research area in three 10 year periods 1976 2006 was 4 8 1 and 1 1 respectively the negative population growth in the second and third decades are due to immigration drought changes in government policies development of public health services family planning policies and increasing the education level of people among the surveyed villages fath abad village b13 with a population of 4688 persons maghsod abad village b5 with a population of 650 persons had the highest and lowest number of population respectively the total population of surveyed villages was 53210 persons fars regional water organization 2012 in this study this variable has directly and positively affected on determining the abm coefficients such as the impressionability of each agent from training reward and punishment therefore it has been assumed that villages with the highest number of population are in a better and more ideal situation in terms of employment economy and infrastructure and as a result they are more keen and impressionable in accepting new patterns trainings and rewards thus make it possible to implement stricter laws and penalties 2 4 1 2 family size in an advanced industrial society the average members of households are less because of the education and health costs bear on families downey 1995 patrinos and psacharopoulos 1997 the rural community under investigation is in a transition from big or joint families to nuclear families the main reasons for this situation are increasing education level especially among women expansion of family planning programs improving the health conditions increasing the household income and sending more children to schools family size changed from 5 9 in 1986 to 4 3 in 2009 fars regional water organization 2012 in this study the negative and direct effects for family size are considered 2 4 1 3 the sex ratio in a population the sex ratio is the ratio of males to females immigration is the main factor about the differences between sex ratio of the agents in the study area the sex ratio is below 100 in 21 villages more than 105 in 22 villages between 100 and 105 in 24 villages and in the whole study area it is 103 9 ahmad abad village b7 with the sex ratio of 141 3 and ebrahim abad village d2 with the sex ratio 82 9 had the highest and lowest the sex ratios in the study area respectively the direct and positive effect of sex ratio was investigated in this research 2 4 1 4 education level the literacy rate for males is 53 6 and for females is 46 4 in the study area badaki village b11 and maghsod abad village b5 have the highest and lowest literacy rates respectively fars regional water organization 2012 the education level variable was therefore considered to have a positive and direct effect in this research 2 4 1 5 immigration the immigration from rural areas has been remarkable in recent years so that in five years 2004 2009 834 persons in 244 households and 47 individual persons have migrated from the villages the permanent migration of this area in five years is estimated to be about 3 6 86 of males and 14 of females were immigrants marriage and education are the most important factors for female migration and males have mostly migrated to find jobs and education high migration rates in this area indicate undesirable economic conditions in the region fars regional water organization 2012 the migration variable had a negative direct effect on the study 2 4 2 economic variables in this study per capita cultivated acreage of each agent was selected as an economic power index the fath abad village b13 with 2539 ha and chahmilk village a2 with 28 ha have the highest and lowest irrigated area the total net irrigated area is equal to 30 356 ha the direct and positive effect of economic variables was investigated in this research 2 4 3 cultural variables from cultural point of view three variables including language religion and ethnicity are considered all residents in the study area are muslim many tribes such as turks lors qashqai live together while maintaining some of their characteristics and cultural traditions in the selected villages however they have created family bonds through marriage over the years and the same religion led to decreasing the ethnic conflicts communication with neighboring cities such as shiraz and marvdasht and locating in the isfahan shiraz main road led to the gradual integration of urban and rural costumes increasing the level of literacy and development of mass media led to reducing the inter ethnic conflicts fars regional water organization 2012 2 4 4 social variables the scope of the area of the study was determined in terms of social structures and the sociological and psychological dimensions the history and background of agriculture and human settlement in a specific area dates back to the third millennium bc the constructions of dams on local rivers such as kor and sivand in the past are examples of old structures for agricultural uses of water fars regional water organization 2012 residents in the villages of the study area were divided into two main groups active villagers and passive villagers the active villagers included farmers and non farmers some farmers were the owners of farmlands and didn t the non farmers were either employees in organizations and companies or they had other jobs such as business salesman etc 3 results in the first step the abm coefficients of each agent are determined considering the same fixed coefficients for training incentives and penalties for the agents with different conditions may lead to the undesirable results or even the lack of cooperation among the agents in addition the impressionability of each agent from management tools is affected by different parameters however it is not possible to consider all of them as affecting factors also in the region under study there was no specific program by the government for reducing water consumption therfore all agents were ranked according to their demographic social cultural and economic properties through topsis decision making method it is assumed that some management tools such as implementing the training programs rewards or punishments cash penalties reducing the share of water and legal pressures could be effective in this regard this ranking revealed that the village that got the higher rank is the most developed one with higher economic strength also the agent with higher rank in topsis method has higher impressionability of management tools and bigger abm coefficients also for the agent with the highest rank if water demand requested by the agent is equal to or less than 120 of the allocatable water by the government for the agent γ 1 2 no penalty is considered for them based on farhadi et al 2016 for other agents with lower ranks these bounds were assumed between 1 2 1 4 1 2 γ 1 4 these results for each agent presented in fig 5 the values of α β b γ 1 b and i train coefficients were obtained in a scope of 0 1 depending on the properties and conditions of each agent and experts views after determining the required coefficients for each agent the new water demand for each of them in different climatic conditions are calculated comparisons between water demand requested by agents before and after the application of the agent based model as an example for two regions 1 and 4 are presented in figs 6 and 7 respectively if the initial water requested by agent i is equal to or less than allocatable water of that the cooperative agent new water requested by agent i that calculated from eqs 1 and 5 will be equal to the initial water requested fig 7a if the initial water requested by agent i is greater than allocatable water of the agent the non cooperative agent and less than γ q opt i a kind of penalty e g more tax will be imposed on him based on farhadi et al 2016 and the new water requested is calculated by applying the agent based model and eqs 2 and 6 figs 6a and b and 7b if the agent s water requested is more than γ q opt i the judicial system will be obliged to cooperate based on farhadi et al 2016 and finally nd max i q opt i figs 6c and 7c a comparison of the total amount of water demand of agents before and after applying the abm in six regions of doroudzan irrigation and drainage network in different climatic conditions is shown in fig 8 finally for each region in different climatic conditions an optimal crop pattern was presented the optimization model was solved using a ga in the matlab software the various value of population size crossover the number of generations and mutation probabilities were used to fix the ga parameters the appropriate parameters for the population size crossover and the number of generations for six regions are 150 0 3 and 1000 respectively the results for wet normal and drought conditions have been shown in tables 5 7 respectively in table 5 the results of the optimization model for wet conditions are presented the cultivation area about 5422 5 1662 4 897 8 4318 1948 8 and 1169 8 ha increased in regions 1 6 respectively then the total cultivation area of optimal patterns in all regions were more than the existing patterns the optimization model placed all 7 selected crops in optimal cropping pattern in normal conditions based on regional policies the rice was not considered in the optimization model table 6 optimal cropping pattern for regions 1 4 included six crops wheat barley canola sugar beet grain maize and silage maize and for regions 5 and 6 they included these crops except grain maize as shown in table 7 in drought conditions except for the rice that is not considered in the model based on regional policies the cultivation area under grain maize is zero optimal cropping pattern for regions 1 3 include wheat barley canola sugar beet and silage maize and for regions 4 6 include wheat barley canola and silage maize 4 discussion in summary in this study it was assumed that using some management strategies could be effective to reduce the farmers requested water demands to achieve this goal topsis method was used to rank all agents i e farmers in terms of the aforementioned criteria and abm coefficients were obtained in a scope of 0 1 fig 5 as a result of these analyses farmers living in fath abad village agent number 29 held the top spot in the ranking the results also showed that this agent is highly affected by management tools hence more rigid rules can be set to deal with it using the proposed methodology helped reduce fath abad s requested water demand from 24 21 22 68 and 21 3 mcm to 24 06 20 44 and 14 89 mcm in wet normal and drought conditions respectively the results showed that applying abm and monitoring the farmers behavior greatly reduce their requested water demand and water consumption up to the optimum allocatable water to agriculture figs 6a and b and 7a and b the farmers total requested water before applying abm were 27 65 52 77 and 105 45 mcm more than the allocatable water in wet normal and drought conditions respectively after applying abm these values were 4 98 10 21 and 2 55 mcm more than the allocatable water in wet normal and drought conditions respectively a cropping pattern optimization model was designed to maximize the agents income and maintain or increase their benefits while reducing water demands in wet conditions the cultivated area in regions 1 6 increased about 15 419 ha for the optimal cropping pattern in normal conditions table 6 the total cultivation area of optimal cropping patterns in all regions except for region 2 were about 25 168 ha more than the existing patterns this increase in the cultivation area was because of allocating more water to winter crops such as wheat and limiting the major water consuming crops such as rice in wet condition or removing them in normal condition to optimize cropping patterns however given the current condition of the study area rice is one of the first choices of farmers for economic reasons moreover in drought conditions the total cultivation area of optimal cropping patterns in all regions except for region 3 were about 4169 ha more than the existing patterns increasing the cultivation area led to an increase in the employment and stability of the proposed optimal cropping patterns for the study area for region 2 in normal conditions and region 3 in drought conditions some management policies such as decreasing the tax must be established to support farmers and verify the proposed model for optimal cropping patterns 5 conclusions this study estimated the amount of water demand reduction by the farmers in the six management regions of doroudzan irrigation and drainage network in fars province in iran the results showed that by considering the properties of each agent and using management tools such as penalties incentives training and neighbors impacts social norming and sometimes executive and judicial systems we can reduce the water demand requested by agents by optimum allocatable water defined by the government a key point that should be considered at this stage is proposing an approach for maximizing farmers income to sustain the reduction of water demand by agents for this purpose an optimization cropping pattern model was carried with regard to the deficit irrigation the results of optimization model showed that total cultivated areas in most regions have increased compared to the current patterns in the regions thereby increasing the net income and employment in the study area in practice for the accurate predictions and understanding of the reactions of farmers in each area it is necessary to determine their behavioral functions and mental maps in various issues and dynamic models for multiple time step should be executed however a static model is presented here and this matter is not addressed our goal is to provide a methodology for determining the amount of water demand reduction from farmers when the government uses the management tools and considers individual properties and conditions of each agent for determining the penalties incentives and influence of training 
11563,according to the research performed the agricultural sector is the major water consumer therefore reducing the demand and the use of water in this sector has an effective role in solving the problems related to water scarcity in this study a hybrid topsis agent based model has been developed to find a solution for this problem in the six management regions of doroudzan irrigation and drainage network in fars province iran two main groups of agents consisting of the government and stakeholders were considered all farmers who lived in the same village assumed as an agricultural agent some influential parameters such as neighbors impacts training penalties and incentives were considered in the agent based model abm in some previous abm models the same coefficients applied for all agents however without considering the stakeholders characteristics and conditions of each agent and region there might be the threat of making unfeasible theoretical decisions therefore in this study the topsis method was linked to abm to determine the uniqueness of these coefficients for each agent the abm coefficients were determined by topsis method through the use of the demographic social economic and cultural variables and expert s viewpoints water demand requested by farmers was calculated based on the existing cropping pattern and the reduction of that was determined by the developed model in different climatic conditions wet normal and drought the results showed that the water requested by the farmers before applying the abm were 7 6 18 2 and 45 and after that they were 1 37 3 5 and 1 09 more than the allocatable water in wet normal and drought conditions respectively in order to reduce the water demand requested by farmers and maintain the effect of management tools training penalties and incentives a cropping pattern optimization model with regard to deficit irrigation was developed keywords agent based model deficit irrigation expert s viewpoint farmers income

the biggest environmental threats in many countries is a deficiency or lack of access to clean drinking water and sanitation giupponi and paz 2015 water resources are influenced by land uses cropping patterns and industrial developments there should be a balance in the ecosystem of the basin the region s natural hydrology and the rate of water consumption therefore it is important that different sections in a country including agriculture energy industry fisheries tourism and the government have appropriate planning in water resource management so that they bring this balance mugagga and nabaasa 2016 management of common pool resources is a complex process and this is because of the lack of a clear understanding of stakeholders behavioral characteristics van oel et al 2010 non cooperative decision making on the basis of a personal belief and vanity because of the lack of knowledge and trust in stakeholders can result in catastrophic performances without a clear understanding of the reaction of decision makers even regulatory institutions can t sustain natural common pool resources although modeling can help understand the complex interaction between human and nature the previous studies have not been able to simulate this system precisely due to 1 lake of suitable mathematical models for analysis of systems with self optimizing stakeholders and 2 lack of information about the properties and behavior of the stakeholders in common pool resource systems due to the absence of the detailed regulatory system pierce 2013 pierce and madani 2014 in recent years top down approaches are being replaced by bottom up approaches in water resources management and tried to address the first limitation by using agent based models abms abms have widely been used in recent years to analyze complex systems such as water allocation and management investigating the community and farmers behaviors and decision making process akhbari and grigg 2013 ding et al 2016 farhadi et al 2016 feuillette et al 2003 holtz and pahl wostl 2012 kent 2014 mohan and kumar 2009 mulligan et al 2014 ng et al 2011 quanli et al 2015 reeves and zellner 2010 schmidt et al 2011 vegesana and mckenzie 2015 yang et al 2009 some studies have shown that the use of abm as a decision support tool has better results compared to the classic models barreteau et al 2003 these researchers provide different optimal water allocation scenarios that have the ability to be accepted and applied by different sectors with regards to the views interests and aspirations of stakeholders these models define the space in which agents interact with each other and also indicate how agents grow move or reproduce reeves and zellner 2010 akhbari and grigg 2013 proposed a framework to manage the existing conflicts in water resources in california s san joaquin river watershed recently farhadi et al 2016 have developed the akhbari and grigg s abm to find a sustainable groundwater management solution in thirteen management sub regions in daryan aquifer fars province iran so far no abm study has been conducted to reduce the stakeholders requested water and optimize the cropping patterns through a focus on the agents characteristics today the largest volume of freshwater in the world is consumed by the agricultural sector sepaskhah and ahmadi 2012 optimizing the cropping pattern is one of the main strategies for reducing the water demand in the agricultural sector that has widely been considered by researchers ghasemi et al 2016 montazar et al 2010 on the other hand an improved allocation of water in irrigation and drainage networks aims at different factors that among them maximizing the farmers income is one of the most important ones daneshvar kakhki and shahnoushi froshani 2009 karamouz et al 2009 malekian et al 2012 singh et al 2001 srivastava and singh 2015 wang and zhou 2004 there are also some investigations considering the social rani and rao 2012 shreedhar et al 2015 and environmental aspects daneshvar kakhki and shahnoushi froshani 2009 srivastava and singh 2015 of optimizing the cropping pattern in different regions in the previous studies the best cropping pattern was determined according to the considered objective functions and constraints using the several optimization approaches including linear programming malekian et al 2012 rani and rao 2012 shreedhar et al 2015 singh et al 2001 nonlinear programming ghahraman and sepaskhah 2002 sadati et al 2014 dynamic programming kipkorir et al 2002 and evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga ghahraman and sepaskhah 1999 karamouz et al 2009 sadati et al 2014 furthermore deficit irrigation is one of the best strategies for promoting the water productivity rabiee 2010 sarwar and perry 2002 and widely used by many researchers chai et al 2016 chaves et al 2007 chuanjie et al 2015 fereres and soriano 2006 fernández et al 2006 fernández et al 2013 geerts and raes 2009 rinaldi et al 2014 talebnejad and sepaskhah 2016 however a more accurate investigation reveals that most of these proposed patterns have not considered the stakeholders conditions and they have remained at the theory level without being acceptable and applicable by farmers the development of some new methods such as agent based modeling in which the conditions and behavioral functions of the stakeholders are considered as a common source could be the solution to this problem that brings the research results in to the real world and materializes them in this paper a hybrid topsis agent based modeling is used for estimating the water demands requested by the farmers therefore the abm presented by akhbari and grigg 2013 that further extended by farhadi et al 2016 is used for six management regions of doroudzan irrigation and drainage network in fars province iran in practice considering all farmers agents and their conditions in optimization modeling is a difficult task and it is almost impossible in the large scale such as an irrigation and drainage network with a large number of farmers to do so therefore one of the innovative strategies in this research was considering all farmers that inhabit in the same village as a single agricultural agent together with their social cultural and economic conditions thus 67 agents in the agricultural sector as demanding agents and the government are the main agents in this study akhbari and grigg 2013 and farhadi et al 2016 considered the same coefficients for all agricultural agents in the abm without paying attention to their differences and conditions therefore in this study the topsis decision making method is linked to the akhbari and grigg s abm and the abm coefficients were determined specially for each agent these coefficients are determined according to demographic social cultural and economic properties of each agricultural agent and experts viewpoints the water requested by the agricultural agents before and after applying the abm is calculated and the effect of abm on the reduction of water demand requested by farmers in different climatic conditions wet normal and drought is evaluated finally an optimization model with the goal of maximizing profit and considering deficit irrigation for six management regions in different climatic conditions wet normal and drought is developed this model is solved using ga in matlab software for optimization of cropping pattern and for maintaining the stability of the reduced water demand and increased farmers satisfaction 2 methodology the main goal of this study is determining the reduction of water demand requested in the agricultural sector considering the social conditions of farmers the present framework has been created based on akhbari and grigg s abm after gathering the required data in the first step the stakeholders were divided into two main sectors including farmers and the state government in the second step water demand requested by each agricultural agent was determined according to the existing cropping pattern then in the third step according to the amount of allocatable water to each agent the cooperative and non cooperative agents were determined at the next step the new water demand of each agent was computed based on akhbari and grigg s abm a multi criteria decision making method topsis was used to determine the abm required coefficients after determining the new water demand for each agent the cropping pattern optimization model was developed to maximize the net income and to consider deficit irrigation it was then implemented using the ga optimization algorithm step 4 and the optimized cropping pattern was obtained for the investigated region the algorithm of the proposed methodology is shown in fig 1 2 1 agent based model abm the abm model that proposed by akhbari and grigg 2013 has different steps as indicated below step 1 identifying consumer agent behavior if the allocatable water for agent i is more than the water demand requested by this agent the behavior of this agent is cooperative otherwise the behavior of this agent is non cooperative step 2 investigating the government plans to control over consumption of water or water demand in that region if any it is assumed that if the government has a plan the water demand requested by agents will be reduced by optimum allocatable water step 3 considering social characteristics of agents and the environment and use of policy mechanisms to reduce water demand requested by them step 4 determining new water demands for each farmer agent fig 2 indicates the flowchart of the abm used in this study to determine water demands requested by agents with regard to their social conditions it is necessary to identify the agents before applying the abm in this model two main groups of stakeholders are defined the state government and diversions farmers in the present study all the farmers living in the same village have been considered as a single consumer agent in akhbari and grigg s framework among the influencing parameters on agents behavior policy mechanisms and social factors such as neighbors impacts training penalties and incentives were considered they provided the following equations and relations to determine the effect of these parameters on the type of the cooperative or non cooperative behaviors of each agent akhbari and grigg 2013 1 u i max u i c c a v i c f m u i c n c b v i n c 2 u i max u i n c c c v i c f m u i n c n c d v i n c where u i c c and u i c nc are the utility of agent i that is a cooperative agent and will remain and change this behavior to non cooperative respectively u i nc nc and u i nc c are the utility of agent i that is a non cooperative agent and will remain and change this behavior to cooperative respectively v i c and v i nc are the fraction of cooperative and non cooperative neighbors for agent i respectively akhbari and grigg 2013 and farhadi et al 2016 assumed a d 0 7 and b c 0 3 based on edwards et al 2005 if the agent has cooperative behavior the government may use incentives and training facilities to keep this behavior in the future the judicial system will be force the non cooperative agents d max i γq opt i to cooperate i e nd max i q opt i q opt i and d max i are the optimum and maximum water demands for agent i in terms of government respectively f m is the correction factor and farhadi et al 2016 proposed eqs 3 and 4 for the cooperative and non cooperative agents respectively to indicate the influences of incentives training and penalties 3 f m 1 a α i t r a i n 1 α q o p t i d max i q o p t i 2 4 f m 1 b β i t r a i n 1 β d max i q o p t i γ q o p t i 2 in these equations i train is the training impact of agent s knowledge and education on the utility of the agent i to cooperate α and β are local coefficients which determine the fraction of incentives and training on a cooperative agent and penalty and training impacts on a non cooperative agent respectively γ is a regional coefficient that force some agents to accept water allocations farhadi et al 2016 assumed α β and γ equal to 0 7 0 6 and 1 2 respectively these assumptions were based on the experts views however they believed these coefficients must be defined based on social studies on agents behavior finally the new water demand requested by agent i whit cooperative and non cooperative behaviors are calculated with eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 n d max i q o p t i d max i q o p t i 1 u i 6 n d max i q o p t i more details and information about this model could be found in akhbari 2012 akhbari and grigg 2013 2015 and farhadi et al 2016 as the individual features facilities social and economic conditions of each agent are different from the others it s essential that the policy mechanism and managerial tools in akhbari and grigg s model be computed and applied specifically for each agent however in the research and studies by akhbari and grigg 2013 and farhadi et al 2016 this point was not considered and they applied the same coefficient for all agricultural agents in the abm in the present study some of the economic cultural social and demographic variables which affect on the way of decision making and impressibility of agents were selected according to the experts views and previous research studies in the region they were used for determining the training reward and punishment coefficients of each agent by the use of topsis method that is employed to develop a hybrid topsis agent based model with akhbari and grigg s abm finally the amounts of α β γ and i train coefficients were calculated for each agent and applied in abm the flowchart of the proposed hybrid topsis agent based model is presented in fig 2 2 2 the topsis decision making method the topsis technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution method in 1981 is presented by hwang and yoon in this method the selected alternatives have the maximum distance from the negative ideal solution and the minimum distance from the positive ideal solution the steps of this method described below behzadian et al 2012 step zero create a decision matrix with q criteria and f alternatives step 1 calculate the normalized decision matrix using the normalization method 7 r k k x k k x k z 2 f o r k 1 f z 1 q where x kz and r kz are original and normalized score of decision matrix respectively step 2 calculate the weighted normalized decision matrix 8 v k z w z r k z where w z is the weight

doorenbos and kassam 1979 have been developed many crop water production functions cwpfs also rao et al 1988 extended doorenbos and kassam cwpf for different growth stages each of these cwpfs has some weaknesses and strengths but the investigation of saleh and wardlaw 2009 showed that with using the existing crop yield coefficients the results of all functions are approximately the same in literature the jensen function and doorenbos and kassam function and extended form of this equation are more popular ganji and shekarriz fard 2010 georgiou and papamichail 2008 ghahraman and sepaskhah 2002 ghahraman and sepaskhah 1999 ghahraman and sepaskhah 2004 lalehzari et al 2015 sadati et al 2014 varzi 2016 the values of yield response factors of doorenbos and kassam function were specified for approximately 33 crops by doorenbos and kassam 1979 but there are only some scattered and limited reports on yield response factor of jensen equation ghahraman and sepaskhah 2004 in this study the extended form of doorenbos and kassam 1979 function rao et al 1988 has been used 14 y a y p j 1 n 1 k y j 1 e t a e t p j where y a and y p are the actual and maximum yield kg ha 1 and eta and etp are actual and maximum evapotranspiration mm respectively for determining the optimal cropping pattern an optimization model has been used to maximize the total farm income and to apply deficit irrigation during the crop growth based on meyer et al 1993 and montazar et al 2010 et a et p w a w p w a and w p are the water used and the potential water demand respectively therefore the objective function of this optimization model is as follows 15 t n i j 1 n a j y p j p c j 1 k y j d c o j p w j 1 n i r j 1 d a j where tni is total net income n is the number of crops j is the crop index p c is crop

m 3 and ir is total irrigation water m3 ha 1 in this objective function a and d are variable parameters the constraints and assumptions in the objective function are defined based on ghahraman and

that the soil moisture in the beginning of the irrigation season for all summer and winter crops and soils are equal to field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp respectively the effective root depth depends on some environmental factors types of crops and soils as well as irrigation scheduling in this study borg and grimes 1986 sigmoid curve was used for estimation of effective root

the doroudzan dam in fars province in southwest of iran 29 50 n 51 53 e 30 15 n 52 22 e rezaeianzadeh et al 2016 doroudzan dam has been located on the kor river in bakhtegan basin and it is one of the largest reservoirs in fars province with a storage capacity of 960 mcm sadati et al 2014 doroudzan dam provides water for 114 500 ha of farmland under six traditional and modern irrigation and drainage networks the doroudzan irrigation and drainage network with 56 000 ha of irrigated areas and six regions including main canal region 1 left canal region 2 ordibehesht canal region 3 hamoon canal region 4 along the left canal region 5 along the hamoon canal region 6 is the most famous networks there the location of doroudzan irrigation and drainage network and the properties of each region and the amount of allocatable water from the doroudzan dam to each region are presented in fig 3 and table 1 respectively in this study the data on existing cropping patterns and water requirements for the six management regions in different climatic conditions were extracted these cropping patterns are shown in table 2 in this research the selection of the crops for the optimized cropping pattern was based on some factors including the approved cropping pattern of the province national and regional policies constraints of water resources and the experiences and interests of the farmers on the other hand selecting some crops such as wheat as strategic crops for food security is essential finally seven types of crops including wheat barley canola sugar beet grain maize silage maize and rice were selected for cropping pattern optimization there are some other concerns for example rice can only be cultivated in wet conditions and in 14 3 of the lands according to the regional policies fars regional water organization 2012 cultivating in a smaller area for all types of crops were determined by a comparison between existing cropping pattern table 2 proposed cropping pattern of fars regional water agency and provincial culture council crop pattern the total area used for crops with same growing periods must be equal or less than the total available area the amount of water required for cultivating crops in each region in any climatic conditions can t be more than the allocatable water to that region table 1 the lower bound of deficit irrigation for all crops assumed to be zero and upper bounds were determined based on previous studies the critical information and data about selected crops have been presented in table 3 in this study in order to determine the criteria for classification of the farmers all farmers living in a village were considered as an agent of the agricultural sector so all the villages located in the doroudzan irrigation and drainage network were identified table 4 then the water requirements of the farmers in each village under the different climatic conditions were calculated according to the gathered information table 2 and location of each village in the six regions of doroudzan irrigation and drainage network based on previous studies in the study area some parameters such as age education level family size the size of the agricultural lands and the cultivated area had a direct and positive relation with farmers attitudes toward participation in water management azizi khalkheili and zamani 2014 ghareghani and hayati 2012 education level attending in training courses and the amount of agricultural lands had a meaningful relation with presence of environmental behaviors mennatizadeh and zamani 2013 also in other studies a series of demographic variables social and cultural variables and economic variables have been referred to as effective variables on farmer behavior and reaction in accepting innovations and changes in the management of doroudzan irrigation and drainage network fars regional water organization 2012 therefore in this study with regard to the available facilities and data and research methodology which is using the documentary research method and expert opinions some demographic economic cultural and social variables are shown in fig 4 have been selected for determining the abm coefficients itrain α β and γ based on topsis method 2 4 1 demographic variables in this study some demographic variables including population education level family size the sex ratio and immigration were selected and their values for each agent village were extracted the details about these demographic variables are described below 2 4 1 1 population the rural population growth of the research area in three 10 year periods 1976 2006 was 4 8 1 and 1 1 respectively the negative population growth in the second and third decades are due to immigration drought changes in government policies development of public health services family planning policies and increasing the education level of people among the surveyed villages fath abad village b13 with a population of 4688 persons maghsod abad village b5 with a population of 650 persons had the highest and lowest number of population respectively the total population of surveyed villages was 53210 persons fars regional water organization 2012 in this study this variable has directly and positively affected on determining the abm coefficients such as the impressionability of each agent from training reward and punishment therefore it has been assumed that villages with the highest number of population are in a better and more ideal situation in terms of employment economy and infrastructure and as a result they are more keen and impressionable in accepting new patterns trainings and rewards thus make it possible to implement stricter laws and penalties 2 4 1 2 family size in an advanced industrial society the average members of households are less because of the education and health costs bear on families downey 1995 patrinos and psacharopoulos 1997 the rural community under investigation is in a transition from big or joint families to nuclear families the main reasons for this situation are increasing education level especially among women expansion of family planning programs improving the health conditions increasing the household income and sending more children to schools family size changed from 5 9 in 1986 to 4 3 in 2009 fars regional water organization 2012 in this study the negative and direct effects for family size are considered 2 4 1 3 the sex ratio in a population the sex ratio is the ratio of males to females immigration is the main factor about the differences between sex ratio of the agents in the study area the sex ratio is below 100 in 21 villages more than 105 in 22 villages between 100 and 105 in 24 villages and in the whole study area it is 103 9 ahmad abad village b7 with the sex ratio of 141 3 and ebrahim abad village d2 with the sex ratio 82 9 had the highest and lowest the sex ratios in the study area respectively the direct and positive effect of sex ratio was investigated in this research 2 4 1 4 education level the literacy rate for males is 53 6 and for females is 46 4 in the study area badaki village b11 and maghsod abad village b5 have the highest and lowest literacy rates respectively fars regional water organization 2012 the education level variable was therefore considered to have a positive and direct effect in this research 2 4 1 5 immigration the immigration from rural areas has been remarkable in recent years so that in five years 2004 2009 834 persons in 244 households and 47 individual persons have migrated from the villages the permanent migration of this area in five years is estimated to be about 3 6 86 of males and 14 of females were immigrants marriage and education are the most important factors for female migration and males have mostly migrated to find jobs and education high migration rates in this area indicate undesirable economic conditions in the region fars regional water organization 2012 the migration variable had a negative direct effect on the study 2 4 2 economic variables in this study per capita cultivated acreage of each agent was selected as an economic power index the fath abad village b13 with 2539 ha and chahmilk village a2 with 28 ha have the highest and lowest irrigated area the total net irrigated area is equal to 30 356 ha the direct and positive effect of economic variables was investigated in this research 2 4 3 cultural variables from cultural point of view three variables including language religion and ethnicity are considered all residents in the study area are muslim many tribes such as turks lors qashqai live together while maintaining some of their characteristics and cultural traditions in the selected villages however they have created family bonds through marriage over the years and the same religion led to decreasing the ethnic conflicts communication with neighboring cities such as shiraz and marvdasht and locating in the isfahan shiraz main road led to the gradual integration of urban and rural costumes increasing the level of literacy and development of mass media led to reducing the inter ethnic conflicts fars regional water organization 2012 2 4 4 social variables the scope of the area of the study was determined in terms of social structures and the sociological and psychological dimensions the history and background of agriculture and human settlement in a specific area dates back to the third millennium bc the constructions of dams on local rivers such as kor and sivand in the past are examples of old structures for agricultural uses of water fars regional water organization 2012 residents in the villages of the study area were divided into two main groups active villagers and passive villagers the active villagers included farmers and non farmers some farmers were the owners of farmlands and didn t the non farmers were either employees in organizations and companies or they had other jobs such as business salesman etc 3 results in the first step the abm coefficients of each agent are determined considering the same fixed coefficients for training incentives and penalties for the agents with different conditions may lead to the undesirable results or even the lack of cooperation among the agents in addition the impressionability of each agent from management tools is affected by different parameters however it is not possible to consider all of them as affecting factors also in the region under study there was no specific program by the government for reducing water consumption therfore all agents were ranked according to their demographic social cultural and economic properties through topsis decision making method it is assumed that some management tools such as implementing the training programs rewards or punishments cash penalties reducing the share of water and legal pressures could be effective in this regard this ranking revealed that the village that got the higher rank is the most developed one with higher economic strength also the agent with higher rank in topsis method has higher impressionability of management tools and bigger abm coefficients also for the agent with the highest rank if water demand requested by the agent is equal to or less than 120 of the allocatable water by the government for the agent γ 1 2 no penalty is considered for them based on farhadi et al 2016 for other agents with lower ranks these bounds were assumed between 1 2 1 4 1 2 γ 1 4 these results for each agent presented in fig 5 the values of α β b γ 1 b and i train coefficients were obtained in a scope of 0 1 depending on the properties and conditions of each agent and experts views after determining the required coefficients for each agent the new water demand for each of them in different climatic conditions are calculated comparisons between water demand requested by agents before and after the application of the agent based model as an example for two regions 1 and 4 are presented in figs 6 and 7 respectively if the initial water requested by agent i is equal to or less than allocatable water of that the cooperative agent new water requested by agent i that calculated from eqs 1 and 5 will be equal to the initial water requested fig 7a if the initial water requested by agent i is greater than allocatable water of the agent the non cooperative agent and less than γ q opt i a kind of penalty e g more tax will be imposed on him based on farhadi et al 2016 and the new water requested is calculated by applying the agent based model and eqs 2 and 6 figs 6a and b and 7b if the agent s water requested is more than γ q opt i the judicial system will be obliged to cooperate based on farhadi et al 2016 and finally nd max i q opt i figs 6c and 7c a comparison of the total amount of water demand of agents before and after applying the abm in six regions of doroudzan irrigation and drainage network in different climatic conditions is shown in fig 8 finally for each region in different climatic conditions an optimal crop pattern was presented the optimization model was solved using a ga in the matlab software the various value of population size crossover the number of generations and mutation probabilities were used to fix the ga parameters the appropriate parameters for the population size crossover and the number of generations for six regions are 150 0 3 and 1000 respectively the results for wet normal and drought conditions have been shown in tables 5 7 respectively in table 5 the results of the optimization model for wet conditions are presented the cultivation area about 5422 5 1662 4 897 8 4318 1948 8 and 1169 8 ha increased in regions 1 6 respectively then the total cultivation area of optimal patterns in all regions were more than the existing patterns the optimization model placed all 7 selected crops in optimal cropping pattern in normal conditions based on regional policies the rice was not considered in the optimization model table 6 optimal cropping pattern for regions 1 4 included six crops wheat barley canola sugar beet grain maize and silage maize and for regions 5 and 6 they included these crops except grain maize as shown in table 7 in drought conditions except for the rice that is not considered in the model based on regional policies the cultivation area under grain maize is zero optimal cropping pattern for regions 1 3 include wheat barley canola sugar beet and silage maize and for regions 4 6 include wheat barley canola and silage maize 4 discussion in summary in this study it was assumed that using some management strategies could be effective to reduce the farmers requested water demands to achieve this goal topsis method was used to rank all agents i e farmers in terms of the aforementioned criteria and abm coefficients were obtained in a scope of 0 1 fig 5 as a result of these analyses farmers living in fath abad village agent number 29 held the top spot in the ranking the results also showed that this agent is highly affected by management tools hence more rigid rules can be set to deal with it using the proposed methodology helped reduce fath abad s requested water demand from 24 21 22 68 and 21 3 mcm to 24 06 20 44 and 14 89 mcm in wet normal and drought conditions respectively the results showed that applying abm and monitoring the farmers behavior greatly reduce their requested water demand and water consumption up to the optimum allocatable water to agriculture figs 6a and b and 7a and b the farmers total requested water before applying abm were 27 65 52 77 and 105 45 mcm more than the allocatable water in wet normal and drought conditions respectively after applying abm these values were 4 98 10 21 and 2 55 mcm more than the allocatable water in wet normal and drought conditions respectively a cropping pattern optimization model was designed to maximize the agents income and maintain or increase their benefits while reducing water demands in wet conditions the cultivated area in regions 1 6 increased about 15 419 ha for the optimal cropping pattern in normal conditions table 6 the total cultivation area of optimal cropping patterns in all regions except for region 2 were about 25 168 ha more than the existing patterns this increase in the cultivation area was because of allocating more water to winter crops such as wheat and limiting the major water consuming crops such as rice in wet condition or removing them in normal condition to optimize cropping patterns however given the current condition of the study area rice is one of the first choices of farmers for economic reasons moreover in drought conditions the total cultivation area of optimal cropping patterns in all regions except for region 3 were about 4169 ha more than the existing patterns increasing the cultivation area led to an increase in the employment and stability of the proposed optimal cropping patterns for the study area for region 2 in normal conditions and region 3 in drought conditions some management policies such as decreasing the tax must be established to support farmers and verify the proposed model for optimal cropping patterns 5 conclusions this study estimated the amount of water demand reduction by the farmers in the six management regions of doroudzan irrigation and drainage network in fars province in iran the results showed that by considering the properties of each agent and using management tools such as penalties incentives training and neighbors impacts social norming and sometimes executive and judicial systems we can reduce the water demand requested by agents by optimum allocatable water defined by the government a key point that should be considered at this stage is proposing an approach for maximizing farmers income to sustain the reduction of water demand by agents for this purpose an optimization cropping pattern model was carried with regard to the deficit irrigation the results of optimization model showed that total cultivated areas in most regions have increased compared to the current patterns in the regions thereby increasing the net income and employment in the study area in practice for the accurate predictions and understanding of the reactions of farmers in each area it is necessary to determine their behavioral functions and mental maps in various issues and dynamic models for multiple time step should be executed however a static model is presented here and this matter is not addressed our goal is to provide a methodology for determining the amount of water demand reduction from farmers when the government uses the management tools and considers individual properties and conditions of each agent for determining the penalties incentives and influence of training 
11564,the quality of irrigation water drawn from surface water sources varies greatly this is particularly true for waters that are subject to intermittent contamination events such as runoff from rainfall or direct entry of livestock upstream of use such pollution in irrigation systems increases the risk of food crop contamination and require adoption of best monitoring practices therefore this study aimed to define optimal strategies for monitoring irrigation water quality following the analysis of 1357 irrigation water samples for escherichia coli total coliforms and physical and chemical parameters the following key irrigation water collection approaches are suggested 1 explore up to 950 m upstream to ensure no major contamination or outfalls exists 2 collect samples before 12 00 p m local time 3 collect samples at the surface of the water at any point across the canal where safe access is available and 4 composite five samples and perform a single e coli assay these recommendations comprehensively consider the results as well as sampling costs personnel effort and current scientific knowledge of water quality characterization these strategies will help to better characterize risks from microbial pathogen contamination in irrigation waters in the southwest united states and aid in risk reduction practices for agricultural water use in regions with similar water quality climate and canal construction keywords food crop safety escherichia coli irrigation water quality agriculture water management monitoring guidelines 1 introduction historically water quality guidelines have focused on drinking waste and recreational sectors excluding waters used throughout the production of food crops the recently developed standards for growing harvesting packing and holding produce for human consumption establish safety guidelines for the us agriculture industry food and drug administration 2015 although these guidelines are scientifically based they fail to grasp the complexity of irrigation systems and offer few suggestions for the appropriate monitoring of irrigation water safety the us food and drug administration fda food safety modernization act fsma includes microbiological rules for irrigation water that are based on epidemiological studies undertaken at ocean and freshwater beaches little evidence exists that relates fsma to the associated risks for fresh produce and irrigation waters fsma guidelines require untreated surface water used for irrigation be tested for escherichia coli e coli 20 times over 2 4 years and then 5 times annually in water used for any purpose besides the growing of sprouts hand washing or direct application to food surfaces e coli concentrations cannot exceed 126 colony forming units cfu 100 ml using a geometric mean of at least five samples taken over multiple days e g a monthly geometric mean or 410 cfu 100 ml in a single sample i e a statistical threshold value stv if the e coli concentration exceeds this stv the water can still be used to irrigate food crops if an appropriate time prior to harvest is allowed assuming a 0 5 log10 die off of e coli per day for water used in sprout irrigation applied directly to food surfaces or used for hand washing e coli regulations are as stringent as for drinking water i e 0 cfu 100 ml if e coli concentrations exceed any of these thresholds the water cannot be used for irrigation food and drug administration 2015 these rules aimed at food safety fail to take under consideration the rapid spatial and temporal changes of microbial concentrations in water water research undertaken in rivers lakes oceans reservoirs and irrigation canals has routinely demonstrated significant changes in microbe concentrations on short spatial and temporal scales boehm 2007 haack et al 2004 juahir et al 2011 song et al 2012 verhougstraete and rose 2014 won et al 2013 for instance one study determined that enterococcus concentrations at california beaches typically varied by 60 over 10 min but could vary by as much as 700 boehm 2007 similarly the fda guidelines fail to consider the spatial variations of microbial water quality potentially leaving the food product vulnerable to contamination bacterial concentrations undergo rapid change along stream length throughout the vertical water column agogué et al 2011 karl 1978 krempin and sullivan 1981 llirós et al 2010 and across stream width byappanahalli et al 2003 jones et al 1995 whitman et al 2006 thus a single sample may not provide an adequate representation of the true microbial water quality in an irrigation water canal water quality scientists have also noted the implications of a single sample versus multiple samples for management actions e g opening or closing of a beach bertke 2007 reicherts and emerson 2010 kinzelman et al 2006 determined that compositing multiple lake water samples and assaying with a single test was not statistically different p 02 than analyzing multiple individual samples and reporting an average both approaches called for similar management actions the benefits of compositing samples include the ability to collect multiple samples from various locations more representative of water quality and reduced costs by performing a single test while still providing at least the same level of protection as collecting single or multiple samples considering previous research in non irrigation systems it is inadequate to base the safety of an entire irrigation canal on the results of a single sample in addition to the numerous surface water studies previously mentioned irrigation waters have been examined for microbial contamination fecal indicator bacteria e g total coliforms e coli enterococci salmonella spp staphylococcus aureus microsporidia giardia and cryptosporidium noroviruses campylobacter spp and clostridium perfringens have been measured in irrigation waters throughout the world gerba and choi

adequate water safety and reduce the risks for agricultural water microbial testing practices must be based on irrigation water specific research not adapted from drinking and recreational water studies this is critically important given that during the winter months more than 90 of all leafy greens consumed in the us are grown in the southwest region of yuma az http bit ly 2jhuwb1 accessed on 8 february 2017 in addition southern california produces 15 of the lettuce and leafy greens consumed by the us overall http bit ly 2k4cehk accessed on 8 february 2017 due to the importance of this region for fresh produce production and the current knowledge gaps in irrigation water quality science this study aimed to better understand the spatial and temporal variations of microbial concentrations in irrigation canals to produce a comprehensive monitoring plan and to reduce pathogen exposure risks at the point of irrigation water application to food crops to this end there were four study objectives 1 determine the most effective time of day for irrigation water monitoring 2 define canal cross sectional sampling locations 3 delineate the transport of microorganisms in irrigation canals and 4 determine the suitability of collecting single multiple or composite irrigation water samples for analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 site location sampling sites were selected following discussions with scientists from the university of arizona and local agricultural extension centers samples were collected from a total of 93 unique sites among yuma and maricopa counties az and imperial county ca in the southwestern us sampling sites included a mixture of main lateral and sub lateral canals and both cement lined and unlined canals with varying flow dynamics in addition some locations were located in urban and others in rural areas 2 2 field analysis and sample collection for all samples the water temperature air temperature conductivity total dissolved solids ph and relative humidity were measured in the field using the multiparameter pcs testr 35 oakton instruments vernon hill il and the fisherbrand traceable memory hygrometer thermometer thermo

collected between december 2014 and november 2015 using sterile 1l wide mouth hdpe bottles nalgene co rochester ny the depth below surface the distance from the bank the time of day and collection location were study objective dependent as detailed below to determine the most suitable time of day for irrigation water sampling grab samples were collected 0 15 m below the water surface near the canal bank at the same site four times per day i e before 09 00 09 00 12 00 12 00 13 00 and after 13 00 to define appropriate collection points in a canal cross section grab samples were collected vertically through the canal water column at the water surface and 0 61 m and 1 22 m below the surface and horizontally across canal transects at both banks and ¼ of the distance of the canal width from each bank a schematic of this sampling approach is presented in fig 1 to determine the best collection processing and results representation approach three sampling approaches were investigated approach a included collecting a single sample from a single collection point at 0 33 m from the canal bank and 0 15 m below the water surface approach b involved collecting five samples from the same canal stretch 0 15 m below the water surface and 0 33 m from the canal bank 2 m apart assaying each sample individually and calculating a geometric mean of the five samples and approach c involved collecting five samples from the same canal stretch 0 15 m below the water surface and 0 33 m from the canal bank 2 m apart adding equal 20 ml volumes of well mixed aliquots from each discrete sample to a sterile bottle to form a composite sample then assaying in an identical manner to a single sample 100 ml total and reporting the results as a single value diagrams of these sampling collection approaches are shown in fig 2 to better understand the transport of microorganisms in irrigation systems total coliforms and e coli were measured following the same plug of canal water as it traveled downstream in three different canals using a flow tracking bottle grab samples of this same plug of water were collected using sterile 1 l hdpe wide mouth bottles downstream at distances of 0 m 322 m 644 m 966 m 1288 m 1609 m 1931 m and 2253 m from the designated starting point the bacterial transport experiments were performed five times per canal additionally coliphage ms2 atcc 15597 b1 american type culture collection manassas va was used to seed the same three canals one experiment per canal to serve as a microbial tracer organism this non pathogenic virus has been used as a surrogate for many pathogens in various environments reynolds et al 2015 sinclair et al 2009 valdez et al 2015 a 200 ml volume of ms2 coliphage at a concentration of approximately 1 1012 plaque forming units pfu was mixed with 20 l of canal water this mixture was dispersed across the width of the canal and the plug of water containing the ms2 was followed downstream using a flow tracking device grab samples of this same plug of water were collected as before at distances of 0 m 322 m 644 m 966 m 1288 m 1609 m 1931 m and 2253 m from the seeding point in addition to 81 m 161 m and 241 m to limit the potential for non detection in measurements taken further from the seeding point the bacterial and viral tracer samples were placed on ice in a cooler and transported to the laboratory for processing and assay 2 3 laboratory analyses e coli and total coliforms were enumerated in all water samples using the colilert quanti tray idexx laboratories westbrook me most probable number mpn method following the manufacturer s instructions following incubation at 37 c for 24 2 h yellow wells were recorded as positive for total coliforms and wells fluorescing blue under ultraviolet uv light were recorded as positive for e coli positive and negative controls were used in coliform testing coliphage samples were serially diluted with sterile phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 4 sigma aldrich st

independent variables e g physical chemical weather canal discharge rates a significance level cutoff of α 0 05 was used for all correlative statistical tests stata statistical software statacorp college station tx was used for traditional statistical analyses including two tailed t tests kruskal wallis tests wilcoxon signed rank tests and spearman s rank correlation tests 3 results and

temperature and relative humidity summary results for these water quality measurements by region are provided in table 1 across all 1328 sites statistically significant correlations were identified

0001 from an additional 9 unique sites 29 samples were measured for coliphage the first objective of this study was to determine the appropriate time of day for irrigation water monitoring samples n 802 were collected at the same location on the same day at four different time points before 09 00 n 185 between 09 00 12 00 n 222 between 12 00 13 00 n 173 and after 13 00 n 222 overall e coli ranged from 0 5 mpn 100 ml to 2419 6 mpn 100 ml geometric mean gm 20 2 mpn 100 ml and total coliforms ranged from 77 1 mpn 100 ml to 2419 6 mpn 100 ml gm 821 mpn 100 ml results for e coli and total coliforms in samples collected by time of day are shown in table 2 while there were statistically significant differences between samples collected in the morning versus the afternoon the most statistically significant difference between the samples collected for e coli two tailed t test p 0001 was between those collected from 07 00 12 00 versus 12 00 16 00 with higher e coli concentrations detected in the morning gm 24 8 164 mpn 100 ml compared to the afternoon gm 15 4 117 mpn 100 ml no such relationship was found with total coliforms morning is thus the most conservative time to sample which supports previous studies lubo liu et al 2006 whitman et al 2004 in addition the microbial water quality in the southwest likely benefits from the high solar radiation levels previously shown to reduce bacterial concentrations the southwest has the highest solar radiation levels in the us nationa renewalble energy laboratory 2009 therefore the bacterial numbers would be expected to be reduced during the daytime hours with increasing exposure to the sun the second study objective was to determine the appropriate sample collection point within the cross section of canals based on multiple spatial samples fig 1 e coli measurements were grouped in all combinations of depth and distance to the bank and the means were compared overall e coli ranged from 1 0 to 1550 mpn 100 ml gm 8 4 mpn 100 ml e coli in the top middle and bottom horizontal transects ranged from 1 0 to 792 mpn 100 ml gm 8 32 mpn 100 ml 1 0 to 1300 mpn 100 ml gm 8 9 mpn 100 ml and 1 0 to 1550 mpn 100 ml gm 7 97 mpn 100 ml respectively e coli ranged from 1 0 to 1410 mpn 100 ml gm 8 33 mpn 100 ml near the canal banks and from 1 0 to 1550 mpn 100 ml gm 8 45 mpn 100 ml in the center of the canals there were no statistically significant differences between depth groups kruskal wallis test p 76 transect vs bank groups wilcoxon rank sum test p 73 any depth by transect group wilcoxon rank sum tests p 45 or any transect by depth group wilcoxon rank sum tests p 70 results for e coli measurements at cross section points are provided in table 3 results from this objective demonstrate homogenous microbial concentrations throughout the canals no previous studies were identified that measured bacterial concentrations in irrigation canal transects however previous research conducted in non irrigation water matrices demonstrated point source pollution and sediment resuspension produced rapid microbial concentration fluxes within the water column which return to a homogenous state over space and time mcdaniel et al 2013 pandey and soupir 2014 pandey et al 2016 rehmann and soupir 2009 in the current study the homogeneity of e coli concentrations likely indicates minimal direct fecal contamination sediment presence or sediment resuspension in the studied canals confirming this will require additional research based on these results we suggest irrigation monitoring samples be collected wherever safe access is achievable the third study objective was to address the transport of microorganisms in irrigation canals the initial approach involved enumerating e coli and total coliforms from grab samples collected in three different irrigation canals a total of five times each however samples n 40 per canal taken from a plug of water and analyzed for e coli and total coliforms did not produce a clear pattern of transport properties in these three canals table 4 to enhance this objective additional samples n 29 were analyzed as part of a ms2 virus tracer seeding experiment using three canals table 5 ms2 coliphage concentrations ranged from 0 1 to 182 000 pfu 100 ml with an overall geometric mean of 608 pfu 100 ml the ms2 coliphage tracer highlights the amount of mixing and dilution that occurs in canals over long stretches while these can vary greatly from canal to canal there is a statistically significant negative relationship between distance from the seed point and coliphage concentration spearman s rank correlation rho 0 91 p 0001 ms2 concentrations dropped gradually with increasing distance from the canal seeding point as shown in table 5 a 1 log10 reduction in the viral tracer concentration was observed roughly 161 m downstream of the seeding point and a 2 log10 reduction was observed by 966 m downstream differences in dilution effectiveness may be attributable to canal characteristics such as discharge velocity or lining type or to atmospheric factors including wind speed or precipitation meanwhile e coli and total coliform concentrations showed no discernable pattern with increasing distance from the first measurement point table 4 additional testing is needed to better understand the factors that promote dilution and mixing of a microbial contamination event in irrigation canals the fourth study objective was to determine if the best approach was to collect and report a single sample or to collect five separate samples and assay them individually reporting a geometric mean or as a composite fig 2 the results from a composite of five samples was found to be significantly different from both a single sample p 0 036 and also from the geometric mean of the five samples tested individually p 0 005 wilcoxon signed rank test monitoring approaches that collect a single water sample will typically fail to meet a very broad coefficient of variation however collecting and processing multiple samples to provide adequate representation of water quality may be cost prohibitive a composite sample is a cost effective alternative to testing a single or multiple samples individually in the current study a composite sample was the most representative sampling option of the water quality within a canal in that it provides more information than a single sample while minimizing the effects of outlying data high or low bacterial numbers that can lead to a misrepresentation of the water quality in a single sample or in multiple samples that are heavily influenced by one sample with outlying numbers fig 3 in addition a composite sample requires only nominally more time and money to collect and analyze than a single sample composite sampling can significantly reduce the analytical costs by reducing the number of samples while increasing the likelihood of capturing the high variation inherent to microbe concentrations in water that would likely be missed with a single sample previous surface water studies have shown that composite samples provide better protection of human exposure to elevated bacteria concentrations compared to a single sample reicherts and emerson 2010 whitman and nevers 2004 however even using composite samples a sampling strategy requiring five sampling events per year will not adequately protect produce safety considering the high variability potential of bacteria in water boehm 2007 verhougstraete and rose 2014 in any irrigation water sampling approach it is important that applied strategies are empirically derived from local irrigation systems composite sampling does come at a cost and that cost has direct implications on identifying whether contamination exceeds a specific threshold if e coli concentrations exceed the fsma standards composite sampling may dilute it with safe water samples resulting in an acceptable averaged result the current project shows that water quality is homogeneous in short canal stretches and therefore elevated bacterial concentrations would be measured using a single or composite sample however using a composite sample can help fulfill not only the fsma sampling requirements but also support the overall objective of sampling to protect food safety previous studies performed at recreational beaches indicate that single samples grossly over or underestimate the true e coli concentrations in water whitman and nevers 2004 using a more representative composite sampling strategy based on local irrigation water sampling will lead to greater monitoring effectiveness produce more accurate risk assessments and result in more accurate water quality management decisions e g to use or not to use water for irrigation coupling the four objectives of this study we suggest an overall sampling strategy that produces the most relevant data for determining the risks of microbial pathogen contamination of food crop waters through careful consideration of the entirety of our data as well as sampling costs personnel effort and the current state of scientific knowledge of irrigation water quality characterization our study shows that microbial water quality is homogenous in short spatial scales 161 m but varies significantly both temporally morning versus afternoon and over long distances 950 m we therefore recommend that open canal irrigation water sampling in the southwest region be undertaken while keeping the following guidelines in mind explore up to 950 m upstream to ensure no major contamination or outfalls exist sample before noon collect samples at any point across the canal where safe access is available composite five samples and perform a single e coli assay this study was conducted in the southwest united states and as such the suggested monitoring strategy is most appropriate for the agriculture communities located in this region or in other areas that routinely experience warm air temperatures average monthly highs of 21 c and low precipitation average monthly totals of 0 97 cm during the growing season however the study design offers an approach for agriculture communities anywhere to better understand the spatial and temporal variations of microbial concentrations in their irrigation canals to produce a comprehensive monitoring plan specific for their geographical region and to reduce pathogen exposure risks at the point of irrigation water application to the regional specific food crops one limitation of this approach is the inability to identify specific sources of microbial contamination in water using e coli a generic bacteria found in the feces of mammals some birds plants and can replicate in water outside its natural host mclellan et al 2001 whitman et al 2005 winfield and groisman 2003 additional microbial analysis such as molecular source tracking would be required to identify specific sources of contamination despite this limitation the current study suggests a comprehensive monitoring plan for irrigation water in the southwest united states this region plays a significant role in the supply of america s leafy green produce and therefore the suggested monitoring plan will reduce pathogen exposure risks at the point of irrigation water application to food crops 4 conclusion the current study provides evidence based suggestions for effective irrigation water quality monitoring these monitoring guidelines are focused on spatial and temporal monitoring strategies specific to the southwest united states and are aimed at practical applications considering human health risks relative to food crop contamination via irrigation waters and costs relative to sample analysis and personnel effort more so these suggested monitoring guidelines are based on irrigation water data not recreational water studies as has been the case in recent federal suggestions e g fsma these suggested monitoring guidelines will ultimately enhance food safety protect human health and reduce the potential for costly food recalls stemming from produce contaminated by irrigation water acknowledgements this work

quality guidelines have focused on drinking waste and recreational sectors excluding waters used throughout the production of food crops the recently developed standards for growing harvesting packing and holding produce for human consumption establish safety guidelines for the us agriculture industry food and drug administration 2015 although these guidelines are scientifically based they fail to grasp the complexity of irrigation systems and offer few suggestions for the appropriate monitoring of irrigation water safety the us food and drug administration fda food safety modernization act fsma includes microbiological rules for irrigation water that are based on epidemiological studies undertaken at ocean and freshwater beaches little evidence exists that relates fsma to the associated risks for fresh produce and irrigation waters fsma guidelines require untreated surface water used for irrigation be tested for escherichia coli e coli 20 times over 2 4 years and then 5 times annually in water used for any purpose besides the growing of sprouts hand washing or direct application to food surfaces e coli concentrations cannot exceed 126 colony forming units cfu 100 ml using a geometric mean of at least five samples taken over multiple days e g a monthly geometric mean or 410 cfu 100 ml in a single sample i e a statistical threshold value stv if the e coli concentration exceeds this stv the water can still be used to irrigate food crops if an appropriate time prior to harvest is allowed assuming a 0 5 log10 die off of e coli per day for water used in sprout irrigation applied directly to food surfaces or used for hand washing e coli regulations are as stringent as for drinking water i e 0 cfu 100 ml if e coli concentrations exceed any of these thresholds the water cannot be used for irrigation food and drug administration 2015 these rules aimed at food safety fail to take under consideration the rapid spatial and temporal changes of microbial concentrations in water water research undertaken in rivers lakes oceans reservoirs and irrigation canals has routinely demonstrated significant changes in microbe concentrations on short spatial and temporal scales boehm 2007 haack et al 2004 juahir et al 2011 song et al 2012 verhougstraete and rose 2014 won et al 2013 for instance one study determined that enterococcus concentrations at california beaches typically varied by 60 over 10 min but could vary by as much as 700 boehm 2007 similarly the fda guidelines fail to consider the spatial variations of microbial water quality potentially leaving the food product vulnerable to contamination bacterial concentrations undergo rapid change along stream length throughout the vertical water column agogué et al 2011 karl 1978 krempin and sullivan 1981 llirós et al 2010 and across stream width byappanahalli et al 2003 jones et al 1995 whitman et al 2006 thus a single sample may not provide an adequate representation of the true microbial water quality in an irrigation water canal water quality scientists have also noted the implications of a single sample versus multiple samples for management actions e g opening or closing of a beach bertke 2007 reicherts and emerson 2010 kinzelman et al 2006 determined that compositing multiple lake water samples and assaying with a single test was not statistically different p 02 than analyzing multiple individual samples and reporting an average both approaches called for similar management actions the benefits of compositing samples include the ability to collect multiple samples from various locations more representative of water quality and reduced costs by performing a single test while still providing at least the same level of protection as collecting single or multiple samples considering previous research in non irrigation systems it is inadequate to base the safety of an entire irrigation canal on the results of a single sample in addition to the numerous surface water studies previously mentioned irrigation waters have been examined for microbial contamination fecal indicator bacteria e g total coliforms e coli enterococci salmonella spp staphylococcus aureus microsporidia giardia and cryptosporidium noroviruses campylobacter spp and clostridium perfringens have been measured in irrigation waters throughout the world gerba and choi 2006 ijabadeniyi et al 2011 kayed 2017 thurston enriquez et al 2002 one study found irrigation water is a major risk factor for bacterial contamination of fresh lettuce due to the detection of e coli and campylobacter spp holvoet et al 2014 irrigation water and food safety concerns are further highlighted by a study that demonstrated hepatitis a virus and salmonella present in water used to irrigate iceberg lettuce was associated with exceedances of the u s environmental protection agency s acceptable annual risk level of 1 10 000 stine et al 2005 produce commonly grown using irrigation water includes corn orchard crops and vegetables all of which have to potential to be consumed raw and further increasing the potential for infection from contaminated irrigation water usda economic research service 2017 together these studies represent the diversity of microbial water quality and the importance of understanding irrigation water quality to protect fresh produce to help ensure adequate water safety and reduce the risks for agricultural water microbial testing practices must be based on irrigation water specific research not adapted from drinking and recreational water studies this is critically important given that during the winter months more than 90 of all leafy greens consumed in the us are grown in the southwest region of yuma az http bit ly 2jhuwb1 accessed on 8 february 2017 in addition southern california produces 15 of the lettuce and leafy greens consumed by the us overall http bit ly 2k4cehk accessed on 8 february 2017 due to the importance of this region for fresh produce production and the current knowledge gaps in irrigation water quality science this study aimed to better understand the spatial and temporal variations of microbial concentrations in irrigation canals to produce a comprehensive monitoring plan and to reduce pathogen exposure risks at the point of irrigation water application to food crops to this end there were four study objectives 1 determine the most effective time of day for irrigation water monitoring 2 define canal cross sectional sampling locations 3 delineate the transport of microorganisms in irrigation canals and 4 determine the suitability of collecting single multiple or composite irrigation water samples for analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 site location sampling sites were selected following discussions with scientists from the university of arizona and local agricultural extension centers samples were collected from a total of 93 unique sites among yuma and maricopa counties az and imperial county ca in the southwestern us sampling sites included a mixture of main lateral and sub lateral canals and both cement lined and unlined canals with varying flow dynamics in addition some locations were located in urban and others in rural areas 2 2 field analysis and sample collection for all samples the water temperature air temperature conductivity total dissolved solids ph and relative humidity were measured in the field using the multiparameter pcs testr 35 oakton instruments vernon hill il and the fisherbrand traceable memory hygrometer thermometer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma samples were placed on ice in a cooler and transported to the laboratory for microbial processing and additional analyses e g turbidity continuously recorded environmental variable data wind speed and direction barometric pressure and antecedent precipitation from national weather service stations were retrieved from the university of utah s mesowest interface mesowest http mesowest utah edu accessed on 10 december 2015 to account for seasonal variations in microbial concentrations weather variability crop production and water use practices grab samples were collected between december 2014 and november 2015 using sterile 1l wide mouth hdpe bottles nalgene co rochester ny the depth below surface the distance from the bank the time of day and collection location were study objective dependent as detailed below to determine the most suitable time of day for irrigation water sampling grab samples were collected 0 15 m below the water surface near the canal bank at the same site four times per day i e before 09 00 09 00 12 00 12 00 13 00 and after 13 00 to define appropriate collection points in a canal cross section grab samples were collected vertically through the canal water column at the water surface and 0 61 m and 1 22 m below the surface and horizontally across canal transects at both banks and ¼ of the distance of the canal width from each bank a schematic of this sampling approach is presented in fig 1 to determine the best collection processing and results representation approach three sampling approaches were investigated approach a included collecting a single sample from a single collection point at 0 33 m from the canal bank and 0 15 m below the water surface approach b involved collecting five samples from the same canal stretch 0 15 m below the water surface and 0 33 m from the canal bank 2 m apart assaying each sample individually and calculating a geometric mean of the five samples and approach c involved collecting five samples from the same canal stretch 0 15 m below the water surface and 0 33 m from the canal bank 2 m apart adding equal 20 ml volumes of well mixed aliquots from each discrete sample to a sterile bottle to form a composite sample then assaying in an identical manner to a single sample 100 ml total and reporting the results as a single value diagrams of these sampling collection approaches are shown in fig 2 to better understand the transport of microorganisms in irrigation systems total coliforms and e coli were measured following the same plug of canal water as it traveled downstream in three different canals using a flow tracking bottle grab samples of this same plug of water were collected using sterile 1 l hdpe wide mouth bottles downstream at distances of 0 m 322 m 644 m 966 m 1288 m 1609 m 1931 m and 2253 m from the designated starting point the bacterial transport experiments were performed five times per canal additionally coliphage ms2 atcc 15597 b1 american type culture collection manassas va was used to seed the same three canals one experiment per canal to serve as a microbial tracer organism this non pathogenic virus has been used as a surrogate for many pathogens in various environments reynolds et al 2015 sinclair et al 2009 valdez et al 2015 a 200 ml volume of ms2 coliphage at a concentration of approximately 1 1012 plaque forming units pfu was mixed with 20 l of canal water this mixture was dispersed across the width of the canal and the plug of water containing the ms2 was followed downstream using a flow tracking device grab samples of this same plug of water were collected as before at distances of 0 m 322 m 644 m 966 m 1288 m 1609 m 1931 m and 2253 m from the seeding point in addition to 81 m 161 m and 241 m to limit the potential for non detection in measurements taken further from the seeding point the bacterial and viral tracer samples were placed on ice in a cooler and transported to the laboratory for processing and assay 2 3 laboratory analyses e coli and total coliforms were enumerated in all water samples using the colilert quanti tray idexx laboratories westbrook me most probable number mpn method following the manufacturer s instructions following incubation at 37 c for 24 2 h yellow wells were recorded as positive for total coliforms and wells fluorescing blue under ultraviolet uv light were recorded as positive for e coli positive and negative controls were used in coliform testing coliphage samples were serially diluted with sterile phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 4 sigma aldrich st louis mo to create 10 1 10 1 10 2 10 3 and 10 4 ml duplicate subsamples double agar layers of tryptic soy agar difco sparks md were utilized to detect ms2 coliphage on its specific host bacterium e coli atcc 15597 following the double agar overlay method adams 1959 abbaszadegan et al 1997 clearings in the host lawn were counted and reported as pfu 100 ml sterile reagent water was used as a negative control for verification of the method integrity ms2 coliphage background measurements were taken before seeding in the canal 2 4 statistical analyses all bacterial data were log transformed prior to performing statistical analyses to minimize skewness and to ensure a normal distribution pearson correlation analysis was used to identify relationships between microbial concentrations and independent variables e g physical chemical weather canal discharge rates a significance level cutoff of α 0 05 was used for all correlative statistical tests stata statistical software statacorp college station tx was used for traditional statistical analyses including two tailed t tests kruskal wallis tests wilcoxon signed rank tests and spearman s rank correlation tests 3 results and discussion a total of 1328 samples were collected from 84 unique sites and were measured for e coli total coliforms ph conductivity turbidity total dissolved solids tds air temperature water temperature and relative humidity summary results for these water quality measurements by region are provided in table 1 across all 1328 sites statistically significant correlations were identified between e coli and air temperature r 0 13 p 0003 water temperature r 0 26 p 0001 relative humidity r 0 23 p 0001 ph r 0 15 p 0001 conductivity r 0 20 p 0001 turbidity r 0 29 p 0001 and tds r 0 20 p 0001 from an additional 9 unique sites 29 samples were measured for coliphage the first objective of this study was to determine the appropriate time of day for irrigation water monitoring samples n 802 were collected at the same location on the same day at four different time points before 09 00 n 185 between 09 00 12 00 n 222 between 12 00 13 00 n 173 and after 13 00 n 222 overall e coli ranged from 0 5 mpn 100 ml to 2419 6 mpn 100 ml geometric mean gm 20 2 mpn 100 ml and total coliforms ranged from 77 1 mpn 100 ml to 2419 6 mpn 100 ml gm 821 mpn 100 ml results for e coli and total coliforms in samples collected by time of day are shown in table 2 while there were statistically significant differences between samples collected in the morning versus the afternoon the most statistically significant difference between the samples collected for e coli two tailed t test p 0001 was between those collected from 07 00 12 00 versus 12 00 16 00 with higher e coli concentrations detected in the morning gm 24 8 164 mpn 100 ml compared to the afternoon gm 15 4 117 mpn 100 ml no such relationship was found with total coliforms morning is thus the most conservative time to sample which supports previous studies lubo liu et al 2006 whitman et al 2004 in addition the microbial water quality in the southwest likely benefits from the high solar radiation levels previously shown to reduce bacterial concentrations the southwest has the highest solar radiation levels in the us nationa renewalble energy laboratory 2009 therefore the bacterial numbers would be expected to be reduced during the daytime hours with increasing exposure to the sun the second study objective was to determine the appropriate sample collection point within the cross section of canals based on multiple spatial samples fig 1 e coli measurements were grouped in all combinations of depth and distance to the bank and the means were compared overall e coli ranged from 1 0 to 1550 mpn 100 ml gm 8 4 mpn 100 ml e coli in the top middle and bottom horizontal transects ranged from 1 0 to 792 mpn 100 ml gm 8 32 mpn 100 ml 1 0 to 1300 mpn 100 ml gm 8 9 mpn 100 ml and 1 0 to 1550 mpn 100 ml gm 7 97 mpn 100 ml respectively e coli ranged from 1 0 to 1410 mpn 100 ml gm 8 33 mpn 100 ml near the canal banks and from 1 0 to 1550 mpn 100 ml gm 8 45 mpn 100 ml in the center of the canals there were no statistically significant differences between depth groups kruskal wallis test p 76 transect vs bank groups wilcoxon rank sum test p 73 any depth by transect group wilcoxon rank sum tests p 45 or any transect by depth group wilcoxon rank sum tests p 70 results for e coli measurements at cross section points are provided in table 3 results from this objective demonstrate homogenous microbial concentrations throughout the canals no previous studies were identified that measured bacterial concentrations in irrigation canal transects however previous research conducted in non irrigation water matrices demonstrated point source pollution and sediment resuspension produced rapid microbial concentration fluxes within the water column which return to a homogenous state over space and time mcdaniel et al 2013 pandey and soupir 2014 pandey et al 2016 rehmann and soupir 2009 in the current study the homogeneity of e coli concentrations likely indicates minimal direct fecal contamination sediment presence or sediment resuspension in the studied canals confirming this will require additional research based on these results we suggest irrigation monitoring samples be collected wherever safe access is achievable the third study objective was to address the transport of microorganisms in irrigation canals the initial approach involved enumerating e coli and total coliforms from grab samples collected in three different irrigation canals a total of five times each however samples n 40 per canal taken from a plug of water and analyzed for e coli and total coliforms did not produce a clear pattern of transport properties in these three canals table 4 to enhance this objective additional samples n 29 were analyzed as part of a ms2 virus tracer seeding experiment using three canals table 5 ms2 coliphage concentrations ranged from 0 1 to 182 000 pfu 100 ml with an overall geometric mean of 608 pfu 100 ml the ms2 coliphage tracer highlights the amount of mixing and dilution that occurs in canals over long stretches while these can vary greatly from canal to canal there is a statistically significant negative relationship between distance from the seed point and coliphage concentration spearman s rank correlation rho 0 91 p 0001 ms2 concentrations dropped gradually with increasing distance from the canal seeding point as shown in table 5 a 1 log10 reduction in the viral tracer concentration was observed roughly 161 m downstream of the seeding point and a 2 log10 reduction was observed by 966 m downstream differences in dilution effectiveness may be attributable to canal characteristics such as discharge velocity or lining type or to atmospheric factors including wind speed or precipitation meanwhile e coli and total coliform concentrations showed no discernable pattern with increasing distance from the first measurement point table 4 additional testing is needed to better understand the factors that promote dilution and mixing of a microbial contamination event in irrigation canals the fourth study objective was to determine if the best approach was to collect and report a single sample or to collect five separate samples and assay them individually reporting a geometric mean or as a composite fig 2 the results from a composite of five samples was found to be significantly different from both a single sample p 0 036 and also from the geometric mean of the five samples tested individually p 0 005 wilcoxon signed rank test monitoring approaches that collect a single water sample will typically fail to meet a very broad coefficient of variation however collecting and processing multiple samples to provide adequate representation of water quality may be cost prohibitive a composite sample is a cost effective alternative to testing a single or multiple samples individually in the current study a composite sample was the most representative sampling option of the water quality within a canal in that it provides more information than a single sample while minimizing the effects of outlying data high or low bacterial numbers that can lead to a misrepresentation of the water quality in a single sample or in multiple samples that are heavily influenced by one sample with outlying numbers fig 3 in addition a composite sample requires only nominally more time and money to collect and analyze than a single sample composite sampling can significantly reduce the analytical costs by reducing the number of samples while increasing the likelihood of capturing the high variation inherent to microbe concentrations in water that would likely be missed with a single sample previous surface water studies have shown that composite samples provide better protection of human exposure to elevated bacteria concentrations compared to a single sample reicherts and emerson 2010 whitman and nevers 2004 however even using composite samples a sampling strategy requiring five sampling events per year will not adequately protect produce safety considering the high variability potential of bacteria in water boehm 2007 verhougstraete and rose 2014 in any irrigation water sampling approach it is important that applied strategies are empirically derived from local irrigation systems composite sampling does come at a cost and that cost has direct implications on identifying whether contamination exceeds a specific threshold if e coli concentrations exceed the fsma standards composite sampling may dilute it with safe water samples resulting in an acceptable averaged result the current project shows that water quality is homogeneous in short canal stretches and therefore elevated bacterial concentrations would be measured using a single or composite sample however using a composite sample can help fulfill not only the fsma sampling requirements but also support the overall objective of sampling to protect food safety previous studies performed at recreational beaches indicate that single samples grossly over or underestimate the true e coli concentrations in water whitman and nevers 2004 using a more representative composite sampling strategy based on local irrigation water sampling will lead to greater monitoring effectiveness produce more accurate risk assessments and result in more accurate water quality management decisions e g to use or not to use water for irrigation coupling the four objectives of this study we suggest an overall sampling strategy that produces the most relevant data for determining the risks of microbial pathogen contamination of food crop waters through careful consideration of the entirety of our data as well as sampling costs personnel effort and the current state of scientific knowledge of irrigation water quality characterization our study shows that microbial water quality is homogenous in short spatial scales 161 m but varies significantly both temporally morning versus afternoon and over long distances 950 m we therefore recommend that open canal irrigation water sampling in the southwest region be undertaken while keeping the following guidelines in mind explore up to 950 m upstream to ensure no major contamination or outfalls exist sample before noon collect samples at any point across the canal where safe access is available composite five samples and perform a single e coli assay this study was conducted in the southwest united states and as such the suggested monitoring strategy is most appropriate for the agriculture communities located in this region or in other areas that routinely experience warm air temperatures average monthly highs of 21 c and low precipitation average monthly totals of 0 97 cm during the growing season however the study design offers an approach for agriculture communities anywhere to better understand the spatial and temporal variations of microbial concentrations in their irrigation canals to produce a comprehensive monitoring plan specific for their geographical region and to reduce pathogen exposure risks at the point of irrigation water application to the regional specific food crops one limitation of this approach is the inability to identify specific sources of microbial contamination in water using e coli a generic bacteria found in the feces of mammals some birds plants and can replicate in water outside its natural host mclellan et al 2001 whitman et al 2005 winfield and groisman 2003 additional microbial analysis such as molecular source tracking would be required to identify specific sources of contamination despite this limitation the current study suggests a comprehensive monitoring plan for irrigation water in the southwest united states this region plays a significant role in the supply of america s leafy green produce and therefore the suggested monitoring plan will reduce pathogen exposure risks at the point of irrigation water application to food crops 4 conclusion the current study provides evidence based suggestions for effective irrigation water quality monitoring these monitoring guidelines are focused on spatial and temporal monitoring strategies specific to the southwest united states and are aimed at practical applications considering human health risks relative to food crop contamination via irrigation waters and costs relative to sample analysis and personnel effort more so these suggested monitoring guidelines are based on irrigation water data not recreational water studies as has been the case in recent federal suggestions e g fsma these suggested monitoring guidelines will ultimately enhance food safety protect human health and reduce the potential for costly food recalls stemming from produce contaminated by irrigation water acknowledgements this work
