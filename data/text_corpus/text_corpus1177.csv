5885,evapotranspiration et is a key component of the hydrologic cycle knowledge of et is important for modelling hydrologic fluxes and improving water resource management various remote sensing based et modelling studies have been conducted for investigating water demand in agricultural areas however et modelling studies of urban areas are rare due to the challenges inherent in the heterogeneity of urban landscapes this study proposes an improved surface energy balance algorithm for urban areas usebal to make it suitable for estimating et in urban environments in the proposed approach et is predicted using improved energy budget components considering urban land cover composition and anthropogenic heat flux the results of the usebal are compared with the traditional method of sebal and a sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the impact of uncertainties in et estimates the findings of this study indicate that the variability in urban land cover types impacts spatial variability in energy fluxes and et the results also show seasonal influence on et for different land covers but no significant influence of seasonality is observed on urban impervious areas which produces the lowest et nearly zero mm day the analysis of variance indicates that the differences between usebal and sebal derived et values for urban impervious areas are statistically significant p value 0 05 the results also show the variability of et values between models for other land cover types but show small variations in areas of wetland and dense vegetation an investigation of factors of changes in et indicates that surface albedo and solar radiation highly influence et and the errors in the estimation of them can result in the highest uncertainty in the estimation of et the model performance metrics indicate that the usebal is better than the sebal for estimating et in a heterogeneous urban environment this study supports the inclusion of anthropogenic heat in the energy budget and emphasizes the use of land cover maps while estimate et in urban areas keywords urban evapotranspiration remote sensing energy budget anthropogenic heat 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a key component of the hydrologic cycle which transfers from the earth surface to the atmosphere via evaporation and transpiration et links the terrestrial water and surface energy exchanges wang and dickinson 2012 it provides the atmospheric moisture that eventually returns to the earth in the form of rain and snow and helps to cool the land surface temperature chen et al 2014 in urban environment land surface energy fluxes are known to vary due in part to land cover heterogeneity weng et al 2014 the diversity in urban land cover types and their changes influence the micrometeorological conditions and et oke 1979 moreover anthropogenic activities and unsustainable water management practices affect the hydrologic components including et sound knowledge of the spatial variations in et is important for understanding the interactions between the atmosphere and the earth surfaces kustas and norman 1996 chen et al 2014 improving water resource management and predicting water usage under various geographical conditions wagle et al 2017 and for investigating water stress and drought occurrence mcvicar and jupp 1998 quantification of urban et is also important for computing hydrologic fluxes e g recharge and runoff while using the water balance model trout and ross 2006 various et estimation approaches have been developed and used to estimate the amount of water loss from geographical areas to the atmosphere magali et al 2016 wu 2016 wang et al 2016 the techniques used to estimate et can be commonly grouped as water balance approach traditional estimation empirical modelling and remote sensing rs zhang et al 2016 kumar et al 2018 oberg and melesss 2006 the water balance approach is highly dependent on the availability of other hydrologic components and their accuracy scanlon et al 2002 traditional approaches e g bowen ratio pan lysimeters eddy correlation provide an accurate estimation of et but are expensive and time consuming moreover traditional approaches are limited to point data and therefore cannot provide et estimates over large areas li and zhao 2010 empirical models employ a numerical algorithm and input parameters that come from model calibration exercises and or field investigations chen et al 2007 empirical models including the makkink method makkink 1957 priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 hargreaves samani jensen et al 1990 and fao penman monteith allen et al 1998 have been developed for modelling reference et however none of these studies focused on et estimation for a heterogeneous urban environment in contrast rs based approaches facilitate multi temporal et mapping on a regional scale and continuous monitoring of water loss to the atmosphere waters et al 2002 making them a promising tool for monitoring and mapping et for large areas bhattarai et al 2016 li and zhao 2010 wagle et al 2017 bachour et al 2014 five rs based et models have been developed for predicting et including the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 simplified surface energy balance index s sebi roerink et al 2000 the surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 mapping et at high resolution with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 and the operational simplified surface energy balance model ssebop senay et al 2013 various rs based studies have been conducted to estimate et el garouani et al 2000 nouri et al 2012 el tahir et al 2012 xiong et al 2010 mutiga et al 2010 li and zhao 2010 moreover analyses have been conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of rs based et models bhattarai et al 2016 wagle et al 2017 to date most of these previous studies focused on et monitoring and mapping in agricultural areas for managing crop water demand only a few studies have been conducted to estimate et in an urban environment wang et al 2016 trout and ross 2006 qiu et al 2017 digiovanni white et al 2018 grimmond and oke 1991 for example grimmond and oke 1991 developed an urban et model using an energy budget based on hourly measurements of micrometeorological flux their approach provided accurate hourly and daily estimates of latent heat and the state of surface water but the results were limited to point data trout and ross 2006 introduced a method of predicting point measurement of et using soil moisture data measured at various depths with capacitance sensors attached to a vertical probe however in addition to being expensive and labor intensive this approach cannot be used to obtain continuous data for vast areas without tremendous effort liu et al 2010 used an asce reference et algorithm and rs based evaporative fraction using land surface temperature lst and the mean temperature of hot and cold pixels to estimate urban et wang et al 2016 developed an empirical model to predict spatiotemporal patterns of urban et in a subtropical desert climate for a metropolitan area they used in situ flux measurement data from a local eddy tower and the lst and blue sky albedo of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land products they developed a regression model to predict et and urged to use in situ et measurements over various land cover classes qiu et al 2017 investigated the characteristics of et in urban lawns and the factors that influence et using the bowen ratio infrared rs and three temperature 3 t model they estimated et of a fully covered vegetative lawn and assumed a reference leaf without transpiration in the 3 t model however in practice it is not feasible to apply this model in areas that lack vegetation canopy including the urban built environment digiovanni white et al 2018 evaluated the influence of micrometeorological variability on the estimation of reference et in a heterogeneous urban environment they used penman monteith based asce standardized reference et algorithm to estimate et at six weather stations using micrometeorological datasets the study provided point data on predicted et for six monitoring sites and urged to evaluate the influence of non meteorological determinants such as soil type vegetation type moisture condition and anthropogenic heat flux on predictions of urban et although various et modelling approaches are available bastiaanssen et al 1998 allen et al 2007 wu 2016 su 2002 the estimation of et for the heterogeneous urban environment is still a challenge wang et al 2016 trout and ross 2006 qiu et al 2017 this study aims to enhance existing rs based et modelling in the typical urban environment using the principles of sebal developed by bastiaanssen et al 1998 the sebal is robust and has proved to be efficient in estimating et in flat agricultural areas sun et al 2011 minacapilli et al 2009 jassas et al 2015 li and zhao 2010 the sebal was initially developed for predicting et in agricultural areas and thus a land cover lc map was not a requirement and overlooked anthropogenic heat in the energy budget which is significant when analyzing urban environments it is worth noting that lc map is useful for estimating the surface roughness parameters waters et al 2002 and anthropogenic heat discharged from urban activities is one of the key components of urban energy budget wong et al 2015 oke 1982 in the highly urbanized area it should be included in the energy balance algorithm cong et al 2017 land surface parameters influence the exchange of energy among the atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere su 2002 thus necessitate accurate estimation this study aims to enhance the sebal so that it can map et in a heterogeneous urban environment and implement the resulting enhanced urban sebal usebal in the proposed approach the anthropogenic heat flux is delineated and included in the energy budget urban lc type is considered in delineating land surface parameters to allow reliable estimation of urban energy fluxes and improve et mapping in a heterogeneous urban environment section 2 includes a description of the study area and the experimental datasets and describes improved algorithms of the energy budget components for et modelling in urban areas section 3 details the experimental analysis including a sensitivity analysis that is performed to assess uncertainties in the estimation of et and a model evaluation that involves a direct comparison of usebal and sebal section 4 discusses the findings and concluding remarks are presented in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental datasets this study selects dhaka the capital city of bangladesh as a research area which is situated between latitudes 23 40 and 23 97 n and longitudes 90 20 and 90 59 e for this study an area of 604 km2 covering landsat path 137 and row 44 within zone 46 n is selected the topography of the study area is relatively flat rahman et al 2013 and its terrain mean elevation is 9 25 m fig a 1 the study area is characterized by a humid subtropical monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation is 2000 mm with 80 occurring during the monsoon season the temperature ranges from 28 c to 34 c in summer from 26 c to 30 c in autumn and from 10 c to 21 c in winter dhaka is one of the most densely populated megacities with a population of nearly 18 23 million due to excess urbanization the physical environment and water resources are changing and degrading the city s natural ecosystem islam et al 2010 over the past decades satellite images e g modis landsat and advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster containing thermal bands have been commonly used to estimate et the spatial resolution of landsat and aster is superior to modis images and thereby favourable to small scale study it should be noted that this study uses landsat data because it offers a cross calibrated medium resolution earth observation data of more than four decades and thus allow for long term multi temporal analysis moreover landsat data are publicly available and users are no longer restricted by precessing limitations markham and helder 2012 wulder et al 2016 note that this study uses landsat data however a future study is required to fully evaluate the applicability of this approach to other satellite data e g the aster it is important to use a totally clear sky cloud free satellite images to estimate et waters et al 2002 this study uses 16 cloud free landsat images table 1 that are obtained from the us geological survey https earthexplorer usgs gov the spatial resolution of all the images is 30 m pixel and the map projection is the universal transverse mercator utm it should be noted that this study uses images from 2001 to 2013 because corresponding in situ pan evaporation data which is used for validation are available on these dates this study aims to estimate et for every month and year from 2001 to 2013 however the cloud free landsat images are rarely available to all of the months years and seasons thus this study uses 16 representative images of three seasons e g spring mid february to april autumn mid august to november and winter december to mid february in this study the collected multi year landsat images are of level 1 thus image processing is carried out before computing the energy budget components the solar incidence angle and atmospheric effects change the spectral properties of the images thus radiometric and atmospheric corrections are applied to convert digital number values to surface reflectance this study also uses meteorological data e g wind speed relative humidity air temperature atmospheric pressure and pan evaporation that are obtained from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd it would be ideal to use meteorological data at the time that the satellite data were recorded but due to the unavailability of data this study uses the corresponding observed daily average meteorological data 2 2 improving surface energy budget components for et modelling in urban areas this study proposes an enhanced energy balance model to predict et for heterogeneous urban environments the satellite based surface energy balance model is a parameterization of the energy fluxes which requires few input parameters related to weather conditions this study adopts the principles of the sebal and implements the proposed usebal which includes urban land surface parameters and considers anthropogenic heat flux in this study the atmospherically corrected landsat images are classified using the support vector machine svm algorithm the classified land cover maps are used in the computation of surface energy budget components the energy budget for the urban area is expressed as eq 1 oke 1982 the sebal computes et flux as shown in eq 2 in contrast the proposed usebal computes the et flux as a residual of the urban energy budget as shown in eq 3 1 a r n h g n l e 2 l e r n h g n 3 l e u a r n h g n where a r n h g n l e a n d l e u represent urban anthropogenic heat net radiation sensible heat flux net heat storage soil heat flux et latent heat flux and urban et latent heat flux in w m2 respectively the following sections describe the approach of improving and delineating energy budget components within eq 3 the algorithms are illustrated to compare and highlight the distinction between the sebal and proposed usebal for improving et modelling in urban areas 2 2 1 enhanced estimation of net radiation rn in urban areas net radiation represents the actual radiant energy available at the surface which is calculated by sebal as the sum of all of the incoming and outgoing radiant fluxes eq 4 the land surface parameters e g surface emissivity albedo and lst are inputted to compute rn the sebal computes emissivity as a function of vegetation and leaf area index eq 5 waters et al 2002 4 s e b a l r n 1 α r s r l ε 0 σ l s t 1 ε 0 r l 5 ε 0 0 95 0 01 l a i w h e r e n d v i 0 a n d l a i 3 0 99 n d v i 0 0 98 o t h e r w i s e l a i 3 in contrast the usebal first assigns emissivity values to non vegetative land cover van de griend and owe 1993 mallick et al 2012 using the lc map and then computes the emissivity of vegetative land as a function of vegetation index eq 6 the improved emissivity values are then inputted to delineate rn eq 7 6 u s e b a l ε 0 u r b a n water 0 99 u r b a n i m p e r v i o u s 0 95 1 0094 0 047 ln n d v i f o r n d v i 0 15 0 90 o t h e r w i s e 7 r n 1 α r s r l ε 0 u r b a n σ l s t 1 ε 0 u r b a n r l where α is the surface albedo r s is the incoming shortwave radiation w m2 r l is the incoming long wave radiation w m2 ε 0 is the surface emissivity ε 0 u r b a n is the emissivity of urban land surfaces σ is the stefan boltzmann constant lst is the land surface temperature lai is the leaf area index and ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index 2 2 2 enhanced estimation of soil heat flux gn in urban areas soil heat flux is computed to estimate the rate of heat storage in the soil the sebal approach uses eq 8 to estimate gn in agricultural areas covered by vegetation in usebal the lc map is considered to improve the estimation of gn eq 9 specifically the proposed approach uses the algorithm from bastiaanssen et al 1998 to estimate gn for vegetative land cover and uses the coefficient values for water and urban areas as outlined in kato and yamaguchi 2005 to estimate gn for urban non vegetative land cover 8 s e b a l g n r n lst α 0 0038 α 0 0074 α 2 1 0 98 ndvi 4 9 u s e b a l g n r n lst α 0 0038 α 0 0074 α 2 1 0 98 ndvi 4 i f l a n d c o v e r s a r e v e g e t a t i v e c g r n o t h e r w i s e where rn is the net radiation w m2 lst is the land surface temperature c α is the surface albedo ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index and cg is the coefficient of non vegetative land cover 2 2 3 enhanced estimation of sensible heat flux h in urban areas sensible heat flux represents the rate of heat loss to the air due to the difference between surface and air temperatures the sebal uses parameters including surface roughness zom as a function of lai eq 10 and aerodynamic resistance to heat transport rah eq 11 to estimate h eq 12 10 z om 0 018 l a i 11 r ah l n z 2 z 1 k 0 4 u ln z x z om 12 h ρ c p dt r ah where lai is the leaf area index z1 and z2 are the heights in meters above the zero plane displacement k is von karman s constant 0 4 u is the wind speed m s zx is the height of wind speed and air temperature ρ is air density kg m3 cp is the specific heat capacity of air j kg k dt is the temperature difference and rah is the aerodynamic resistance to heat transport s m in the proposed usebal model the lc map is used to assign the values of zom for water bare land and urban areas as outlined by kato and yamaguchi 2007 in addition to zom values for vegetative land covers are estimated as a function of lai this study uses an algorithm developed by verma 1989 to compute rah eq 13 for the usebal because this algorithm has been widely used to estimate aerodynamic resistance to heat transport in urban environments and has proved to be efficient in this type of application finally the corresponding values of rah are used to delineate h eq 12 13 r ah 1 ku l n z x d 0 z 0 m l n z om z oh ψ h where d0 is the zero plane displacement height and ψ h is the stability correction for heat where ψ can be deemed as zero under neutral stratification 2 2 4 delineating anthropogenic heat flux a for impervious urban areas the heat generated by human activities is referred to as anthropogenic heat which comprises the heat discharged by the human metabolism heating and cooling equipment vehicle exhausts commercial estates and industrial plants wong et al 2015 in urban areas human activities are concentrated in impervious areas which generate anthropogenic heat in contrast the heat discharged from vegetation water and other natural land cover types is negligible thus anthropogenic heat is assumed to be zero for non impervious urban land covers to delineate urban anthropogenic heat this study first computes the latent heat of impervious urban areas leimp using the algorithm from wong et al 2015 second net radiation of impervious urban areas rnimp the soil heat flux of impervious urban areas gimp and the sensible heat flux of impervious urban areas himp are extracted from the energy fluxes eqs 7 9 and 12 using the lc map lastly eq 14 is used to compute urban anthropogenic heat for the entire area 14 a g imp h imp le imp rn imp i f i m p e r v i o u s u r b a n c o v e r 0 o t h e r w i s e where gimp himp leimp and rnimp represent soil sensible latent heat and net radiation for impervious urban areas respectively in units of w m2 2 2 5 enhanced estimation of latent heat of vaporization le and daily et latent heat flux is expressed as the energy that accounts for the total water vapor that exchanges from the earth surface into the atmosphere rwasoka et al 2011 and so represents the amount of heat loss from the earth surface due to et waters et al 2002 after computing le eqs 2 and 3 the instantaneous evaporative fractions of the sebal and usebal models are calculated using eqs 15 and 16 lastly 24 hour net radiation rn24 is computed following the procedure outlined in allen et al 1998 to estimate daily et from the sebal and usebal using eqs 17 and 18 respectively 15 λ le r n g n 16 λ urban le u r n g n where le is the latent heat flux rn is the net radiation and gn is the soil heat flux in w m2 17 et 86400 λ ρ w λ r n 24 18 et 86400 λ ρ w λ urban r n 24 where λ is the evaporative fraction for the sebal λ urban is the evaporative fraction for the usebal rn24 is the 24 h averaged net radiation in w m2 λ is the latent heat of vaporization in j kg and ρ w is the density of water in kg m3 2 3 model verification this study proposes an approach to enhance the prediction of urban et using the usebal to evaluate the results first a comparative analysis is performed between the predicted et derived from the usebal and the sebal second model performance metrics e g coefficient of determination r2 mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and percent bias pbias are enumerated to verify the model finally a sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess uncertainties in et estimates to validate rs based et it is important to measure surface energy fluxes simultaneously for all land cover types at the time that the satellite overpass however this is a difficult task due to the technical and financial limitations moreover in situ flux measurements are limited to point data and thus the validation of large scale energy fluxes and et is not straightforward farah and bastiaanssen 2001 it is worth noting that the study area lacks a flux measurement tower therefore model validation is conducted using in situ pan evaporation which represents the amount of water loss from the earth surface to the atmosphere in the form of water vapor during a period mm day with an unlimited supply of water sun et al 2011 in this study two different approaches are used to derive reference et first reference et is estimated using pan evaporation and pan coefficient values this study computes pan coefficient using eq 19 and then enumerates reference et using eq 20 allen and pruitt 1991 for further evaluation reference crop et is also computed based on the fao penman monteith algorithms allen et al 1998 19 k p 0 108 0 000331 u 2 0 0422 l n fetch 0 1434 l n r h mean 0 000631 l n fetch 2 l n r h mean where u is the wind speed and rhmean is the average relative humidity 20 e t 0 k p e pan where kp is the pan coefficient and epan is the daily measured pan evaporation finally the reference et is compared with predicted et for evaluating the results of the proposed approach a sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the impact of uncertainties in et estimates derived from the usebal this study applies a sensitivity analysis approach as proposed by timmermans et al 2007 they developed an algorithm for analyzing sensitivity to sensible heat flux which is modified and applied in this study for assessing the sensitivity to et eq 21 21 s i et et 0 et 0 100 where si is the sensitivity of the model to an input i et 0 et and et are the et predicted by the model when the input energy flux equals its reference value i 0 and is decreased and increased respectively with reference values used for all other inputs first the reference input energy fluxes are obtained from the algorithms as described in section 2 2 second the reference energy fluxes are averaged for six representative land cover types and predicted average et0 for each land cover type using eq 18 third the values of the input energy fluxes are perturbed to compute et and et and the sensitivity to et is enumerated a deviation of 30 w m2 with a step of 5 w m2 is used to test the sensitivity of et estimate 3 experimental analysis in this section first a comparison is shown between surface energy fluxes of the usebal and sebal second the predicted et that is derived using the usebal is presented with an evaluation of the impact of spatial and temporal variations on et then these results are compared with the et derived from the sebal lastly the model performance metrics and sensitivity analysis results are briefly described 3 1 surface energy fluxes and spatial distribution of et table a 1 summarizes the mean values of the predicted surface energy fluxes that are derived from the usebal considering urban land cover types and anthropogenic heat and the energy fluxes without considering them from the sebal this study demonstrates an obvious difference in the estimation of surface energy fluxes and these are variable to time and seasons fig 1 presents the spatial distribution of land covers and daily et in this study 16 images are used for predicting et however to be concise three representative land cover and et maps of three seasons are presented in fig 1 in contrast other maps are provided as supplementary material fig a 2 4 in the et maps the lowest et values are consistently observed in urban core areas dominated by impervious areas which spread with increasing urbanization in contrast the highest et values are found in areas of open water multi year et maps show gradual expansion of non evaporative surfaces which indicate an increase in water scarcity and thereby reduces overall et in the urban area table 2 and table a 2 3 summarize the basic statistics of predicted et for the different land cover types the results demonstrate that et values are variable to land cover classes and seasons in the proposed approach the highest et values are again observed for open water and the lowest for urban impervious areas based on et values the land cover types are ranked in the order of open water wetland dense vegetation sparse vegetation sandy bare land urban impervious the results also indicate that et increases in the spring season and decreases in the autumn and winter season during the spring season the highest et values are observed for all of the land cover types note that the seasonal variations have influence on et for different land cover types but no obvious influence is observed in the urban impervious areas the results also indicate that et values vary between winter and autumn season for different land cover types but the variations are very small this study concludes that both land cover types and their changes and seasonal variations have influence on et 3 2 factors influencing changes in et to evaluate the factors influencing changes in et this study uses land surface parameters e g surface albedo lst and ndvi and weather parameters e g solar radiation wind speed air temperature and relative humidity to investigate the interactions between predicted et and the values of several important land surface parameters the coefficient of determination is computed for different land covers fig 2 shows scatter plots of land surface parameters and predicted et for two representative images the results indicate a divergence in the relationship between land surface parameters and predicted et for urban impervious areas for further evaluation the coefficient of determination for all of the non impervious land covers are derived grouping them into one category as outlined in gray color it is evident that that open water has the lowest surface albedo and highest et fig 2 a and b in contrast sandy bare land has the highest albedo and lowest et among all the non impervious land covers in this study wetlands seem to be covered by aquatic macrophytes thus dense vegetation and wetland show very similar values for surface albedo and et the surface albedo of sparse vegetation is lower than that of bare land and higher than that of dense vegetation thus et of sparse vegetation is higher than that of bare land and lower than that of dense vegetation importantly it is noted that surface albedo shows a strong negative correlation with et for non impervious land cover in contrast impervious urban areas show surface albedo values similar to sparse vegetation but et was close to zero showing divergence in the relationship between et and surface albedo in impervious urban areas a strong coefficient of determination r2 0 93 and 0 96 between et and surface albedo was observed for the non impervious land cover types scatter plots of lst and predicted et by land cover type show that open water has the lowest lst and highest et fig 2 c and d in contrast sandy bare land has the highest lst and lowest et among all the non impervious land covers it is also notable that impervious areas show divergence in et and lst form other non impervious land covers these results indicate that lst can explain the variation in et for different land cover types except for impervious urban areas the coefficient of determination between lst and non impervious land cover is nearly 0 85 fig 2 e and f shows the coefficient of determination between ndvi and et the results indicate that homogeneous areas covered by sparse and dense vegetation canopy to some extent explain the observed variation between ndvi and et however ndvi cannot be used to explain the spatial variation in et for a heterogeneous urban environment the scatter plots of land surface parameters demonstrate that surface albedo and to a lesser extent lst highly influence et however urban impervious areas show divergence in the distribution of et in addition the wetlands also deviate to some extent because lst precipitation and growth of aquatic macrophytes bring changes in the characteristics of wetland areas jiang et al 2017 the investigations confirm that urban landscapes are diverse thus et prediction in the heterogeneous environment is not straightforward and care should be taken to map et in urban areas to evaluate temporal variation in et this study computes the correlation between mean predicted et and corresponding daily average relative humidity wind speed air temperature and solar radiation fig 3 the results indicate that variation in solar radiation shows the highest coefficient of determination for change in et fig 3 d followed by variation in air temperature fig 3 b this finding corroborates analysis by qiu et al 2017 that et is strongly correlated with solar radiation in urban areas note that micrometeorological variability can influence reference et in a heterogeneous urban environment digiovanni white et al 2018 the wind speed as well as solar radiation can affect et mcvicar et al 2012 however the results of this study show little influence of wind speed and relative humidity on et it is worth noting that this study uses meteorological datasets from only one weather station which is located in the core of the study site weather datasets from different locations will be used in future work to further investigate the influence of meteorological parameters on the variation in et the analysis confirms that surface albedo lst solar radiation and air temperature strongly influence et compared to other parameters however impervious urban areas show a high level of variability in the characteristics of the land surface parameters and thus care should be taken to map et in urban environments 3 3 comparison analysis and performance evaluation 3 3 1 comparison of predicted et in this study et is predicted for 16 datasets using the usebal and sebal however to be concise the comparative analysis is presented in detail for three datasets the results from the sebal and the histogram distribution for other datasets are provided as supplementary material fig a 5 6 fig 4 presents the delineated histograms and local spatial difference between et derived from the usebal and sebal for the dataset of 2001 2008 and 2013 the central part of the study area is dominated by impervious urban areas therefore et is low in the city centre compared to the fringe areas the usebal produces the lowest et values for impervious urban areas followed by sandy bare land fig 1 d f in contrast the sebal produces the lowest et values for sandy bare land followed by impervious areas fig 1 g i the histogram distribution of et fig 4 a c illustrates that the usebal produces an et value of nearly zero for more than 100 000 pixels in contrast the sebal shows an insignificant number of pixels with an et of nearly zero fig 4 d f the results of the other datasets fig a 5 show similar findings to those for the dataset from 2001 2008 and 2013 fig 5 presents the local spatial difference between et derived from the usebal and sebal the impervious areas show strong deviations between the results of usebal and sebal in the prediction of et for the dataset of 2001 fig 5 a in contrast vegetative land covers and open water areas show low deviations in et between the models the deviations in the estimated et in the 2008 and 2013 dataset fig 5 b and c and other datasets fig a 6 show similar findings to those for the dataset of 2001 table 2 shows the differences in basic statistics of predicted et derived from the usebal and sebal for three datasets this study also computes basic statistics of other datasets for both models which are provided as supplementary material in table a 2 3 the comparison analysis indicates the differences between usebal and sebal derived et values for different land cover types however the overall maximum predicted et values are nearly similar in both models in contrast a large variation is observed in the minimum and mean et values in this study the analysis of variance anova is used to test the significance of the differences between usebal and sebal derived et the results of anova as shown in table 3 indicate that the differences between overall minimum and mean et values are statistically significant p value 0 05 the result also indicates that the differences between usebal and sebal derived minimum maximum and mean et values for urban impervious areas are statistically significant p value 0 05 the differences in mean et values for open water and sandy bare land the differences in maximum et values for sparse vegetation and sandy bare land are also statistically significant p value 0 05 note that wetland and dense vegetation show differences between usebal and sebal derived et values but their differences are not significant in summary the results indicate that the predicted et values vary between two models but all the variations are not statistically significant the usebal yields the lowest et values for a large number of pixels that contained impervious areas fig 4 a c thus the overall mean et values are lower in the usebal than in the sebal 3 3 2 model performance to verify the models the predicted mean evaporation for the bodies of surface water is delineated from 16 et maps and then the regression analysis is performed against the measured pan evaporation fig 6 a and b the usebal show a strong coefficient of determination r2 0 84 compared to the sebal r2 0 77 the usebal also indicate better performance than the sebal in terms of rmse mae and pbias for further evaluation using eq 20 reference et is estimated based on pan evaporation data and used as the measured et to establish the relationship between et derived from the sebal and usebal overall the usebal has a higher coefficient of determination r2 0 79 than the sebal r2 0 74 fig 6 c and d in addition the rmse mae and pbias values of the usebal are better than those of the sebal fig 6 e and f show the coefficient of determination between predicted and reference et derived from fao penman monteith algorithm this evaluation also shows that the usebal yields a higher coefficient of determination r2 0 78 than the sebal r2 0 74 however the variations in the other model performance metrics are not significant 3 3 3 model sensitivity in the results of a sensitivity analysis using two representative datasets fig 7 a and b show that rn is positively correlated with et a 30 w m2 increase and decrease in rn result in the highest change in the estimate of et for sandy bare land and impervious urban areas followed by sparse vegetation in contrast the changes in rn for other land cover types show no significant sensitivity to et a linear negative correlation between gn and et fig 7 c and d shows that an increase in gn cloud led to a decrease in et however sandy bare land and urban impervious areas are highly sensitive compared to other land cover types a 30 w m2 increase and decrease in gn results in around an 8 change in et changes to h are negatively correlated with et and the correlations are approximately linear fig 7 e and f a 30 w m2 increase and decrease in h results in the highest relative change in et of around 25 30 for impervious urban areas followed by 15 changes in et for sandy bare land note that the changes in h are highly sensitive to et compared to the changes in rn and gn fig 7 g and h show that the changes in le are positively correlated with et a 30 w m2 increase and decrease in le results in a more than 20 change in the estimation of et for impervious urban areas note that the change in le for other land cover types is also sensitive to et but shows a lower relative change than that for impervious urban areas the results of sensitivity analysis indicate that the errors in input energy fluxes can result in an inaccurate estimation of et however sensitivity is variable to energy fluxes and land cover types the results demonstrate that the model is most sensitive to changes in le and h followed by rn and gn note that dense and sparse vegetation are less sensitive to changes in et than other land cover types it should also be noted that the errors in input parameters can result in an inaccurate estimation of the energy budget components this study investigates model sensitivity to changes in input parameters including lst and surface albedo that is derived from landsat images air temperature and solar radiation that is collected from the weather station among various factors of changes in et this study finds a high influence of these four parameters the values of input parameters are perturbed and the sensitivity to energy budget components is enumerated fig 8 shows an example of sensitivity to changes in surface albedo lst and air temperature for sandy bare land in the estimation of surface energy fluxes the results of sensitivity analysis for other land cover types are provided as supplementary material fig a 7 9 the results demonstrate that surface albedo is highly correlated with le followed by rn a 12 5 increase and decrease in surface albedo result in the highest change in the estimation of le in contrast an increase and decrease in lst and air temperature show the highest change in the estimation of le followed by h for sandy bare land and urban impervious areas in contrast other land cover types show the highest change in the estimation of h followed by le a 5 k increase and decrease in surface and air temperature results in a more than 40 change in the estimation of le and nearly 30 change in the estimation of h as mentioned previously solar radiation strongly influences et thus fig 7 i and j indicates that the change in 24 hour net radiation is highly sensitive to et it shows a positive and linear correlation with et a 30 w m2 increase and decrease in rn24 results in a more than 20 change in the estimation of et the sensitivity analysis results demonstrate that impervious urban areas and sandy bare lands are highly sensitive to changes in energy budget components compared to other land cover types thus care should be taken in the estimation of surface energy fluxes for et modelling in the typical urban areas 4 discussion the findings of this study suggest using a land cover map for the estimation of et in the urban environment because urban land cover types are diverse in nature and the variability in land cover types impacts spatial variability in energy fluxes and et waters et al 2002 mentioned that land cover map is not a requirement for surface energy balance algorithm but is highly recommended the existence of large impervious surfaces makes et estimation a challenge in urban areas trout and ross 2006 this study acknowledges the consideration of urban land cover classes to estimate urban energy fluxes the usebal with consideration of urban land cover types shows variation in the estimation of energy fluxes from the traditional sebal table a 1 the estimated net radiation shows the lowest difference between sebal and usebal in contrast other energy fluxes e g soil heat flux sensible heat flux and latent heat flux show the largest variation between them the results show variability in the predicted energy fluxes to dates it is important to validate predicted energy fluxes however this study lacks in situ measurement thus future work is a requirement this study evaluates the estimated energy fluxes by comparison the results of some other studies in an analysis of intra urban energy fluxes weng et al 2014 found the ranges of net radiation from 319 to 613 w m2 soil heat flux from 97 to 176 w m2 sensible heat flux from 93 to 165 and latent heat flux from 96 to 195 w m2 the results of the usebal show more consistency in the estimation of net radiation and soil heat flux than the sebal the sensible heat flux of some dates shows relatively low values while using the usebal in contrast the sebal yields relatively low values for all of the dates in the proposed approach the mean values of the latent heat flux show overestimation but relatively low than the mean values as derived using the sebal the deviations in the estimation of the energy fluxes can arise due to the variation in geographical settings and weather conditions however the observation of this study is consistent with findings reported in an analysis of weng et al 2014 that urban energy fluxes are variable to dates and seasons the characteristics of the physical properties and diverse landscapes affect land surface parameters in urban environments multi year image analysis indicates that the spatial variation in land cover and seasons strongly influence et the values of the land surface parameters and predicted et are also characterized by spatial and temporal variation of the landscapes land surface parameters e g surface albedo and lst show a strong negative correlation with et for non impervious land cover types the spatial distribution of et generally follows the spatial variation in surface temperature bhattarai et al 2016 however this study shows that et is strongly correlated to lst in non impervious areas but show greater deviation in areas containing impervious land cover this study supports the inclusion of anthropogenic heat in the energy budget while estimate et in an urban environment using the principles of land surface energy balance the results of this study indicate that the inclusion of anthropogenic heat and consideration of urban land cover composition improves et estimation in a heterogeneous urban environment and facilitates to map et in urban areas as mentioned previously the comparative analyses show significant deviations in the predicted et for impervious urban areas this corroborates previous studies showing that impervious urban areas are non evaporative and that et is generally small in areas with no water ma et al 2013 because dry areas generate the lowest latent heat flux farah and bastiaanssen 2001 a substantial variation in latent heat of vaporization for impervious urban areas is evident between sebal and usebal the proposed approach provides the lowest latent heat for impervious urban areas fig 9 therefore the usebal results in the lowest et for the impervious urban areas in contrast the sebal overestimate et for impervious urban areas note that kato and yamaguchi 2007 reported zero le for urban areas in addition wong et al 2015 reported that latent heat in urban areas is very low around 5 to 10 w m2 the findings of this study show good agreement with the findings of kato and yamaguchi 2007 and wong et al 2015 impervious areas are the dominant land cover in urban environments and anthropogenic heat is a significant energy flux thus it is important to consider this heat flux in the energy balance algorithm it should be noted that various meteorological parameters including solar radiation relative humidity air temperature and wind speed affect et shi et al 2017 tabari et al 2012 tomer and schilling 2009 however the most important factor influencing et is not stationary du et al 2016 indicated relative humidity as the factor most sensitive to seasonal and annual changes in et in the heihe river basin of northwestern china mcvicar et al 2012 found wind speed as the dominant force of changes in et tabari et al 2012 indicated that a significant increase in air temperature tends to increase in et in arid and semi arid regions of iran the results of yang et al 2019 showed that potential et is most sensitive to net radiation followed by relative humidity air temperature wind speed and soil heat flux in the qilian mountains northwestern china this study indicates the highest influence of solar radiation followed by air temperature this finding is consistent with the study of qiu et al 2017 which identified that et is strongly correlated with solar radiation in urban areas digiovanni white et al 2018 also found the strongest influence of temperature and solar radiation on the determination of et in a heterogeneous urban environment in new york city usa in contrast they noted the weak influence of wind speed and relative humidity on et but underlined the importance of them as the variables varied the most amongst the sites it should be noted that this study uses meteorological parameters from one weather station and lacks datasets from different locations urban environment is heterogeneous and results in strong variability in the micro weather digiovanni white et al 2018 this study acknowledges areas for future work in the evaluation of the influence of weather parameters on et using datasets from multiple sites in an urban environment model validation is important to estimate et using rs data this study uses pan evaporation and fao penman monteith based reference et to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach the model performance metrics indicate better performance of the usebal than the sebal it should be noted that the study site lacks an eddy flux tower which limits the robustness of the validation of the modelled et values thus a sensitivity analysis is performed the results of sensitivity analysis indicate that some of the energy budget components are highly sensitive to et which highlights the importance of its accurate estimation to reduce uncertainty considering the limitations of this study we urge researchers to evaluate and validate the proposed approach in urban areas that have in situ measurements of surface energy fluxes over various land cover types moreover future study is required to improve the usebal by considering other parameters such as weather data of different locations soil type and moisture conditions 5 conclusions et is an important component of the hydrologic cycle the hydrologic cycle starts with evaporation from the bodies of surface water and transpiration from the vegetative land cover and thus changes in land cover affect et in urban areas where water and the evaporative surfaces are scarce it is important to understand the spatial and temporal pattern of et for managing urban landscapes and microclimates and investigating urban water stress existing studies rarely estimate et in a typical urban environment this study proposes an approach to improve et estimation for a heterogeneous urban environment based on the urban surface energy balance algorithm called the usebal the proposed approach shows the lowest et for impervious urban areas while the sebal shows the lowest et for dry bare land followed by impervious areas the results indicate strong similarities in the maximum observed et values between the models however there are deviations between the minimum and mean et values the model performance metrics show the satisfactory performance of the proposed approach to estimate et in a heterogeneous urban environment however future study is required to test the transferability of the usebal and to fully evaluate the applicability of this approach to other rs data the results reported in this study confirm that the impervious areas are the dominant land cover in the urban areas where the human activities concentrate and generate anthropogenic heat thus this study supports the inclusion of this heat flux when estimating et in a heterogeneous urban environment based on the surface energy balance algorithm the sensitivity analysis indicates that variations in energy fluxes can affect et and so care should be taken in the estimation of the model inputs the proposed usebal is of significance to understand water demand for diverse urban landscapes and facilitate the monitoring of water stress in a

5885,evapotranspiration et is a key component of the hydrologic cycle knowledge of et is important for modelling hydrologic fluxes and improving water resource management various remote sensing based et modelling studies have been conducted for investigating water demand in agricultural areas however et modelling studies of urban areas are rare due to the challenges inherent in the heterogeneity of urban landscapes this study proposes an improved surface energy balance algorithm for urban areas usebal to make it suitable for estimating et in urban environments in the proposed approach et is predicted using improved energy budget components considering urban land cover composition and anthropogenic heat flux the results of the usebal are compared with the traditional method of sebal and a sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the impact of uncertainties in et estimates the findings of this study indicate that the variability in urban land cover types impacts spatial variability in energy fluxes and et the results also show seasonal influence on et for different land covers but no significant influence of seasonality is observed on urban impervious areas which produces the lowest et nearly zero mm day the analysis of variance indicates that the differences between usebal and sebal derived et values for urban impervious areas are statistically significant p value 0 05 the results also show the variability of et values between models for other land cover types but show small variations in areas of wetland and dense vegetation an investigation of factors of changes in et indicates that surface albedo and solar radiation highly influence et and the errors in the estimation of them can result in the highest uncertainty in the estimation of et the model performance metrics indicate that the usebal is better than the sebal for estimating et in a heterogeneous urban environment this study supports the inclusion of anthropogenic heat in the energy budget and emphasizes the use of land cover maps while estimate et in urban areas keywords urban evapotranspiration remote sensing energy budget anthropogenic heat 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a key component of the hydrologic cycle which transfers from the earth surface to the atmosphere via evaporation and transpiration et links the terrestrial water and surface energy exchanges wang and dickinson 2012 it provides the atmospheric moisture that eventually returns to the earth in the form of rain and snow and helps to cool the land surface temperature chen et al 2014 in urban environment land surface energy fluxes are known to vary due in part to land cover heterogeneity weng et al 2014 the diversity in urban land cover types and their changes influence the micrometeorological conditions and et oke 1979 moreover anthropogenic activities and unsustainable water management practices affect the hydrologic components including et sound knowledge of the spatial variations in et is important for understanding the interactions between the atmosphere and the earth surfaces kustas and norman 1996 chen et al 2014 improving water resource management and predicting water usage under various geographical conditions wagle et al 2017 and for investigating water stress and drought occurrence mcvicar and jupp 1998 quantification of urban et is also important for computing hydrologic fluxes e g recharge and runoff while using the water balance model trout and ross 2006 various et estimation approaches have been developed and used to estimate the amount of water loss from geographical areas to the atmosphere magali et al 2016 wu 2016 wang et al 2016 the techniques used to estimate et can be commonly grouped as water balance approach traditional estimation empirical modelling and remote sensing rs zhang et al 2016 kumar et al 2018 oberg and melesss 2006 the water balance approach is highly dependent on the availability of other hydrologic components and their accuracy scanlon et al 2002 traditional approaches e g bowen ratio pan lysimeters eddy correlation provide an accurate estimation of et but are expensive and time consuming moreover traditional approaches are limited to point data and therefore cannot provide et estimates over large areas li and zhao 2010 empirical models employ a numerical algorithm and input parameters that come from model calibration exercises and or field investigations chen et al 2007 empirical models including the makkink method makkink 1957 priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 hargreaves samani jensen et al 1990 and fao penman monteith allen et al 1998 have been developed for modelling reference et however none of these studies focused on et estimation for a heterogeneous urban environment in contrast rs based approaches facilitate multi temporal et mapping on a regional scale and continuous monitoring of water loss to the atmosphere waters et al 2002 making them a promising tool for monitoring and mapping et for large areas bhattarai et al 2016 li and zhao 2010 wagle et al 2017 bachour et al 2014 five rs based et models have been developed for predicting et including the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 simplified surface energy balance index s sebi roerink et al 2000 the surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 mapping et at high resolution with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 and the operational simplified surface energy balance model ssebop senay et al 2013 various rs based studies have been conducted to estimate et el garouani et al 2000 nouri et al 2012 el tahir et al 2012 xiong et al 2010 mutiga et al 2010 li and zhao 2010 moreover analyses have been conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of rs based et models bhattarai et al 2016 wagle et al 2017 to date most of these previous studies focused on et monitoring and mapping in agricultural areas for managing crop water demand only a few studies have been conducted to estimate et in an urban environment wang et al 2016 trout and ross 2006 qiu et al 2017 digiovanni white et al 2018 grimmond and oke 1991 for example grimmond and oke 1991 developed an urban et model using an energy budget based on hourly measurements of micrometeorological flux their approach provided accurate hourly and daily estimates of latent heat and the state of surface water but the results were limited to point data trout and ross 2006 introduced a method of predicting point measurement of et using soil moisture data measured at various depths with capacitance sensors attached to a vertical probe however in addition to being expensive and labor intensive this approach cannot be used to obtain continuous data for vast areas without tremendous effort liu et al 2010 used an asce reference et algorithm and rs based evaporative fraction using land surface temperature lst and the mean temperature of hot and cold pixels to estimate urban et wang et al 2016 developed an empirical model to predict spatiotemporal patterns of urban et in a subtropical desert climate for a metropolitan area they used in situ flux measurement data from a local eddy tower and the lst and blue sky albedo of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land products they developed a regression model to predict et and urged to use in situ et measurements over various land cover classes qiu et al 2017 investigated the characteristics of et in urban lawns and the factors that influence et using the bowen ratio infrared rs and three temperature 3 t model they estimated et of a fully covered vegetative lawn and assumed a reference leaf without transpiration in the 3 t model however in practice it is not feasible to apply this model in areas that lack vegetation canopy including the urban built environment digiovanni white et al 2018 evaluated the influence of micrometeorological variability on the estimation of reference et in a heterogeneous urban environment they used penman monteith based asce standardized reference et algorithm to estimate et at six weather stations using micrometeorological datasets the study provided point data on predicted et for six monitoring sites and urged to evaluate the influence of non meteorological determinants such as soil type vegetation type moisture condition and anthropogenic heat flux on predictions of urban et although various et modelling approaches are available bastiaanssen et al 1998 allen et al 2007 wu 2016 su 2002 the estimation of et for the heterogeneous urban environment is still a challenge wang et al 2016 trout and ross 2006 qiu et al 2017 this study aims to enhance existing rs based et modelling in the typical urban environment using the principles of sebal developed by bastiaanssen et al 1998 the sebal is robust and has proved to be efficient in estimating et in flat agricultural areas sun et al 2011 minacapilli et al 2009 jassas et al 2015 li and zhao 2010 the sebal was initially developed for predicting et in agricultural areas and thus a land cover lc map was not a requirement and overlooked anthropogenic heat in the energy budget which is significant when analyzing urban environments it is worth noting that lc map is useful for estimating the surface roughness parameters waters et al 2002 and anthropogenic heat discharged from urban activities is one of the key components of urban energy budget wong et al 2015 oke 1982 in the highly urbanized area it should be included in the energy balance algorithm cong et al 2017 land surface parameters influence the exchange of energy among the atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere su 2002 thus necessitate accurate estimation this study aims to enhance the sebal so that it can map et in a heterogeneous urban environment and implement the resulting enhanced urban sebal usebal in the proposed approach the anthropogenic heat flux is delineated and included in the energy budget urban lc type is considered in delineating land surface parameters to allow reliable estimation of urban energy fluxes and improve et mapping in a heterogeneous urban environment section 2 includes a description of the study area and the experimental datasets and describes improved algorithms of the energy budget components for et modelling in urban areas section 3 details the experimental analysis including a sensitivity analysis that is performed to assess uncertainties in the estimation of et and a model evaluation that involves a direct comparison of usebal and sebal section 4 discusses the findings and concluding remarks are presented in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental datasets this study selects dhaka the capital city of bangladesh as a research area which is situated between latitudes 23 40 and 23 97 n and longitudes 90 20 and 90 59 e for this study an area of 604 km2 covering landsat path 137 and row 44 within zone 46 n is selected the topography of the study area is relatively flat rahman et al 2013 and its terrain mean elevation is 9 25 m fig a 1 the study area is characterized by a humid subtropical monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation is 2000 mm with 80 occurring during the monsoon season the temperature ranges from 28 c to 34 c in summer from 26 c to 30 c in autumn and from 10 c to 21 c in winter dhaka is one of the most densely populated megacities with a population of nearly 18 23 million due to excess urbanization the physical environment and water resources are changing and degrading the city s natural ecosystem islam et al 2010 over the past decades satellite images e g modis landsat and advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster containing thermal bands have been commonly used to estimate et the spatial resolution of landsat and aster is superior to modis images and thereby favourable to small scale study it should be noted that this study uses landsat data because it offers a cross calibrated medium resolution earth observation data of more than four decades and thus allow for long term multi temporal analysis moreover landsat data are publicly available and users are no longer restricted by precessing limitations markham and helder 2012 wulder et al 2016 note that this study uses landsat data however a future study is required to fully evaluate the applicability of this approach to other satellite data e g the aster it is important to use a totally clear sky cloud free satellite images to estimate et waters et al 2002 this study uses 16 cloud free landsat images table 1 that are obtained from the us geological survey https earthexplorer usgs gov the spatial resolution of all the images is 30 m pixel and the map projection is the universal transverse mercator utm it should be noted that this study uses images from 2001 to 2013 because corresponding in situ pan evaporation data which is used for validation are available on these dates this study aims to estimate et for every month and year from 2001 to 2013 however the cloud free landsat images are rarely available to all of the months years and seasons thus this study uses 16 representative images of three seasons e g spring mid february to april autumn mid august to november and winter december to mid february in this study the collected multi year landsat images are of level 1 thus image processing is carried out before computing the energy budget components the solar incidence angle and atmospheric effects change the spectral properties of the images thus radiometric and atmospheric corrections are applied to convert digital number values to surface reflectance this study also uses meteorological data e g wind speed relative humidity air temperature atmospheric pressure and pan evaporation that are obtained from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd it would be ideal to use meteorological data at the time that the satellite data were recorded but due to the unavailability of data this study uses the corresponding observed daily average meteorological data 2 2 improving surface energy budget components for et modelling in urban areas this study proposes an enhanced energy balance model to predict et for heterogeneous urban environments the satellite based surface energy balance model is a parameterization of the energy fluxes which requires few input parameters related to weather conditions this study adopts the principles of the sebal and implements the proposed usebal which includes urban land surface parameters and considers anthropogenic heat flux in this study the atmospherically corrected landsat images are classified using the support vector machine svm algorithm the classified land cover maps are used in the computation of surface energy budget components the energy budget for the urban area is expressed as eq 1 oke 1982 the sebal computes et flux as shown in eq 2 in contrast the proposed usebal computes the et flux as a residual of the urban energy budget as shown in eq 3 1 a r n h g n l e 2 l e r n h g n 3 l e u a r n h g n where a r n h g n l e a n d l e u represent urban anthropogenic heat net radiation sensible heat flux net heat storage soil heat flux et latent heat flux and urban et latent heat flux in w m2 respectively the following sections describe the approach of improving and delineating energy budget components within eq 3 the algorithms are illustrated to compare and highlight the distinction between the sebal and proposed usebal for improving et modelling in urban areas 2 2 1 enhanced estimation of net radiation rn in urban areas net radiation represents the actual radiant energy available at the surface which is calculated by sebal as the sum of all of the incoming and outgoing radiant fluxes eq 4 the land surface parameters e g surface emissivity albedo and lst are inputted to compute rn the sebal computes emissivity as a function of vegetation and leaf area index eq 5 waters et al 2002 4 s e b a l r n 1 α r s r l ε 0 σ l s t 1 ε 0 r l 5 ε 0 0 95 0 01 l a i w h e r e n d v i 0 a n d l a i 3 0 99 n d v i 0 0 98 o t h e r w i s e l a i 3 in contrast the usebal first assigns emissivity values to non vegetative land cover van de griend and owe 1993 mallick et al 2012 using the lc map and then computes the emissivity of vegetative land as a function of vegetation index eq 6 the improved emissivity values are then inputted to delineate rn eq 7 6 u s e b a l ε 0 u r b a n water 0 99 u r b a n i m p e r v i o u s 0 95 1 0094 0 047 ln n d v

long wave radiation w m2 ε 0 is the surface emissivity ε 0 u r b a n is the emissivity of urban land surfaces σ is the stefan boltzmann constant lst is the land surface temperature lai is the leaf area index and ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index 2 2 2 enhanced estimation of soil heat flux gn in urban areas soil heat flux is computed to estimate the rate of heat storage in the soil the sebal approach uses eq 8 to estimate gn in agricultural areas covered by vegetation in usebal the lc map is considered to improve the estimation of gn eq 9 specifically the proposed approach uses the algorithm from bastiaanssen et al 1998 to estimate gn for vegetative land cover and uses the coefficient values for water and urban areas as outlined in kato and yamaguchi 2005 to estimate gn for urban non vegetative land cover 8 s e b a l g n r n lst α 0 0038 α 0 0074 α 2 1 0 98 ndvi 4 9 u s e b a l g n r n lst α 0 0038 α 0 0074 α 2 1 0 98 ndvi 4 i f l a n d c o v e r s a r e v e g e t a

coefficient of non vegetative land cover 2 2 3 enhanced estimation of sensible heat flux h in urban areas sensible heat flux represents the rate of heat loss to the air due to the difference between surface and air temperatures the sebal uses parameters including surface roughness zom as a function of lai eq 10 and aerodynamic resistance to heat transport rah eq 11 to estimate h eq 12 10 z om 0 018 l a i 11 r ah l n z 2 z 1 k 0 4 u ln z x z om 12 h ρ c p dt r ah where lai is the leaf area index z1 and z2 are the heights in meters above the zero plane displacement k is von karman s constant 0 4 u is the wind speed m s zx is the height of wind speed and air temperature ρ is air density kg m3 cp is the specific heat capacity of air j kg k dt is the temperature difference and rah is the aerodynamic resistance to heat transport s m in the proposed usebal model the lc map is used to assign the values of zom for water bare land and urban areas as outlined by kato and yamaguchi 2007 in addition to zom values for vegetative land covers are estimated as a function of lai this study uses an algorithm developed by verma 1989 to compute rah eq 13 for the usebal because this algorithm has been widely used to estimate aerodynamic resistance to heat transport in urban environments and has proved to be efficient in this type of application finally the corresponding values of rah are used to delineate h eq 12 13 r ah 1 ku l n z x d 0 z 0 m l n z om z oh ψ h where d0 is the zero plane displacement height and ψ h is the stability correction for heat where ψ can be deemed as zero under neutral stratification 2 2 4 delineating anthropogenic heat flux a for impervious urban areas the heat generated by human activities is referred to as anthropogenic heat which comprises the heat discharged by the human metabolism heating and cooling equipment vehicle exhausts commercial estates and industrial plants wong et al 2015 in urban areas human activities are concentrated in impervious areas which generate anthropogenic heat in contrast the heat discharged from vegetation water and other natural land cover types is negligible thus anthropogenic heat is assumed to be zero for non impervious urban land covers to delineate urban anthropogenic heat this study first computes the latent heat of impervious urban areas leimp using the algorithm from wong et al 2015 second net radiation of impervious urban areas rnimp the soil heat flux of impervious urban areas gimp and the sensible heat flux of impervious urban areas himp are extracted from the energy fluxes eqs 7 9 and 12 using the lc map lastly eq 14 is used to compute urban anthropogenic heat for the entire area 14 a g imp h imp le imp rn imp i f i m p e r v i o u s u r b a n c o v e r 0 o t h e r w i s e where gimp himp leimp and rnimp represent soil sensible latent heat and net radiation for impervious urban areas respectively in units of w m2 2 2 5 enhanced estimation of latent heat of vaporization le and daily et latent heat flux is expressed as the energy that accounts for the total water vapor that exchanges from the earth surface into the atmosphere rwasoka et al 2011 and so represents the amount of heat loss from the earth surface due to et waters et al 2002 after computing le eqs 2 and 3 the instantaneous evaporative fractions of the sebal and usebal models are calculated using eqs 15 and 16 lastly 24 hour net radiation rn24 is computed following the procedure outlined in allen et al 1998 to estimate daily et from the sebal and usebal using eqs 17 and 18 respectively 15 λ le r n g n 16 λ urban le u r n g n where le is the latent heat flux rn is the net radiation and gn is the soil heat flux in w m2 17 et 86400 λ ρ w λ r n 24 18 et 86400 λ ρ w λ urban r n 24 where λ is the evaporative fraction for the sebal λ urban is the evaporative fraction for the usebal rn24 is the 24 h averaged net radiation in w m2 λ is the latent heat of vaporization in j kg and ρ w is the density of water in kg m3 2 3 model verification this study proposes an approach to enhance the prediction of urban et using the usebal to evaluate the results first a comparative analysis is performed between the predicted et derived from the usebal and the sebal second model performance metrics e g coefficient of determination r2 mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and percent bias pbias are enumerated to verify the model finally a sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess uncertainties in et estimates to validate rs based et it is important to measure surface energy fluxes simultaneously for all land cover types at the time that the satellite overpass however this is a difficult task due to the technical and financial limitations moreover in situ flux measurements are limited to point data and thus the validation of large scale energy fluxes and et is not straightforward farah and bastiaanssen 2001 it is worth noting that the study area lacks a flux measurement tower therefore model validation is conducted using in situ pan evaporation which represents the amount of water loss from the earth surface to the atmosphere in the form of water vapor during a period mm day with an unlimited supply of water sun et al 2011 in this study two different approaches are used to derive reference et first reference et is estimated using pan evaporation and pan coefficient values this study computes pan coefficient using eq 19 and then enumerates reference et using eq 20 allen and pruitt 1991 for further evaluation reference crop et is also computed based on the fao penman monteith algorithms allen et al 1998 19 k p 0 108 0 000331 u 2 0 0422 l n fetch 0 1434 l n r h mean 0 000631 l n fetch 2 l n r h mean where u is the wind speed and rhmean is the average relative humidity 20 e t 0 k p e pan where kp is the pan coefficient and epan is the daily measured pan evaporation finally the reference et is compared with predicted et for evaluating the results of the proposed approach a sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the impact of uncertainties in et estimates derived from the usebal this study applies a sensitivity analysis approach as proposed by timmermans et al 2007 they developed an algorithm for analyzing sensitivity to sensible heat flux which is modified and applied in this study for assessing the sensitivity to et eq 21 21 s i et et 0 et 0 100 where si is the sensitivity of the model to an input i et 0 et and et are the et predicted by the model when the input energy flux equals its reference value i 0 and is decreased and increased respectively with reference values used for all other inputs first the reference input energy fluxes are obtained from the algorithms as described in section 2 2 second the reference energy fluxes are averaged for six representative land cover types and predicted average et0 for each land cover type using eq 18 third the values of the input energy fluxes are perturbed to compute et and et and the sensitivity to et is enumerated a deviation of 30 w m2 with a step of 5 w m2 is used to test the sensitivity of et estimate 3 experimental analysis in this section first a comparison is shown between surface energy fluxes of the usebal and sebal second the predicted et that is derived using the usebal is presented with an evaluation of the impact of spatial and temporal variations on et then these results are compared with the et derived from the sebal lastly the model performance metrics and sensitivity analysis results are briefly described 3 1 surface energy fluxes and spatial distribution of et table a 1 summarizes the mean values of the predicted surface energy fluxes that are derived from the usebal considering urban land cover types and anthropogenic heat and the energy fluxes without considering them from the sebal this study demonstrates an obvious difference in the estimation of surface energy fluxes and these are variable to time and seasons fig 1 presents the spatial distribution of land covers and daily et in this study 16 images are used for predicting et however to be concise three representative land cover and et maps of three seasons are presented in fig 1 in contrast other maps are provided as supplementary material fig a 2 4 in the et maps the lowest et values are consistently observed in urban core areas dominated by impervious areas which spread with increasing urbanization in contrast the highest et values are found in areas of open water multi year et maps show gradual expansion of non evaporative surfaces which indicate an increase in water scarcity and thereby reduces overall et in the urban area table 2 and table a 2 3 summarize the basic statistics of predicted et for the different land cover types the results demonstrate that et values are variable to land cover classes and seasons in the proposed approach the highest et values are again observed for open water and the lowest for urban impervious areas based on et values the land cover types are ranked in the order of open water wetland dense vegetation sparse vegetation sandy bare land urban impervious the results also indicate that et increases in the spring season and decreases in the autumn and winter season during the spring season the highest et values are observed for all of the land cover types note that the seasonal variations have influence on et for different land cover types but no obvious influence is observed in the urban impervious areas the results also indicate that et values vary between winter and autumn season for different land cover types but the variations are very small this study concludes that both land cover types and their changes and seasonal variations have influence on et 3 2 factors influencing changes in et to evaluate the factors influencing changes in et this study uses land surface parameters e g surface albedo lst and ndvi and weather parameters e g solar radiation wind speed air temperature and relative humidity to investigate the interactions between predicted et and the values of several important land surface parameters the coefficient of determination is computed for different land covers fig 2 shows scatter plots of land surface parameters and predicted et for two representative images the results indicate a divergence in the relationship between land surface parameters and predicted et for urban impervious areas for further evaluation the coefficient of determination for all of the non impervious land covers are derived grouping them into one category as outlined in gray color it is evident that that open water has the lowest surface albedo and highest et fig 2 a and b in contrast sandy bare land has the highest albedo and lowest et among all the non impervious land covers in this study wetlands seem to be covered by aquatic macrophytes thus dense vegetation and wetland show very similar values for surface albedo and et the surface albedo of sparse vegetation is lower than that of bare land and higher than that of dense vegetation thus et of sparse vegetation is higher than that of bare land and lower than that of dense vegetation importantly it is noted that surface albedo shows a strong negative correlation with et for non impervious land cover in contrast impervious urban areas show surface albedo values similar to sparse vegetation but et was close to zero showing divergence in the relationship between et and surface albedo in impervious urban areas a strong coefficient of determination r2 0 93 and 0 96 between et and surface albedo was observed for the non impervious land cover types scatter plots of lst and predicted et by land cover type show that open water has the lowest lst and highest et fig 2 c and d in contrast sandy bare land has the highest lst and lowest et among all the non impervious land covers it is also notable that impervious areas show divergence in et and lst form other non impervious land covers these results indicate that lst can explain the variation in et for different land cover types except for impervious urban areas the coefficient of determination between lst and non impervious land cover is nearly 0 85 fig 2 e and f shows the coefficient of determination between ndvi and et the results indicate that homogeneous areas covered by sparse and dense vegetation canopy to some extent explain the observed variation between ndvi and et however ndvi cannot be used to explain the spatial variation in et for a heterogeneous urban environment the scatter plots of land surface parameters demonstrate that surface albedo and to a lesser extent lst highly influence et however urban impervious areas show divergence in the distribution of et in addition the wetlands also deviate to some extent because lst precipitation and growth of aquatic macrophytes bring changes in the characteristics of wetland areas jiang et al 2017 the investigations confirm that urban landscapes are diverse thus et prediction in the heterogeneous environment is not straightforward and care should be taken to map et in urban areas to evaluate temporal variation in et this study computes the correlation between mean predicted et and corresponding daily average relative humidity wind speed air temperature and solar radiation fig 3 the results indicate that variation in solar radiation shows the highest coefficient of determination for change in et fig 3 d followed by variation in air temperature fig 3 b this finding corroborates analysis by qiu et al 2017 that et is strongly correlated with solar radiation in urban areas note that micrometeorological variability can influence reference et in a heterogeneous urban environment digiovanni white et al 2018 the wind speed as well as solar radiation can affect et mcvicar et al 2012 however the results of this study show little influence of wind speed and relative humidity on et it is worth noting that this study uses meteorological datasets from only one weather station which is located in the core of the study site weather datasets from different locations will be used in future work to further investigate the influence of meteorological parameters on the variation in et the analysis confirms that surface albedo lst solar radiation and air temperature strongly influence et compared to other parameters however impervious urban areas show a high level of variability in the characteristics of the land surface parameters and thus care should be taken to map et in urban environments 3 3 comparison analysis and performance evaluation 3 3 1 comparison of predicted et in this study et is predicted for 16 datasets using the usebal and sebal however to be concise the comparative analysis is presented in detail for three datasets the results from the sebal and the histogram distribution for other datasets are provided as supplementary material fig a 5 6 fig 4 presents the delineated histograms and local spatial difference between et derived from the usebal and sebal for the dataset of 2001 2008 and 2013 the central part of the study area is dominated by impervious urban areas therefore et is low in the city centre compared to the fringe areas the usebal produces the lowest et values for impervious urban areas followed by sandy bare land fig 1 d f in contrast the sebal produces the lowest et values for sandy bare land followed by impervious areas fig 1 g i the histogram distribution of et fig 4 a c illustrates that the usebal produces an et value of nearly zero for more than 100 000 pixels in contrast the sebal shows an insignificant number of pixels with an et of nearly zero fig 4 d f the results of the other datasets fig a 5 show similar findings to those for the dataset from 2001 2008 and 2013 fig 5 presents the local spatial difference between et derived from the usebal and sebal the impervious areas show strong deviations between the results of usebal and sebal in the prediction of et for the dataset of 2001 fig 5 a in contrast vegetative land covers and open water areas show low deviations in et between the models the deviations in the estimated et in the 2008 and 2013 dataset fig 5 b and c and other datasets fig a 6 show similar findings to those for the dataset of 2001 table 2 shows the differences in basic statistics of predicted et derived from the usebal and sebal for three datasets this study also computes basic statistics of other datasets for both models which are provided as supplementary material in table a 2 3 the comparison analysis indicates the differences between usebal and sebal derived et values for different land cover types however the overall maximum predicted et values are nearly similar in both models in contrast a large variation is observed in the minimum and mean et values in this study the analysis of variance anova is used to test the significance of the differences between usebal and sebal derived et the results of anova as shown in table 3 indicate that the differences between overall minimum and mean et values are statistically significant p value 0 05 the result also indicates that the differences between usebal and sebal derived minimum maximum and mean et values for urban impervious areas are statistically significant p value 0 05 the differences in mean et values for open water and sandy bare land the differences in maximum et values for sparse vegetation and sandy bare land are also statistically significant p value 0 05 note that wetland and dense vegetation show differences between usebal and sebal derived et values but their differences are not significant in summary the results indicate that the predicted et values vary between two models but all the variations are not statistically significant the usebal yields the lowest et values for a large number of pixels that contained impervious areas fig 4 a c thus the overall mean et values are lower in the usebal than in the sebal 3 3 2 model performance to verify the models the predicted mean evaporation for the bodies of surface water is delineated from 16 et maps and then the regression analysis is performed against the measured pan evaporation fig 6 a and b the usebal show a strong coefficient of determination r2 0 84 compared to the sebal r2 0 77 the usebal also indicate better performance than the sebal in terms of rmse mae and pbias for further evaluation using eq 20 reference et is estimated based on pan evaporation data and used as the measured et to establish the relationship between et derived from the sebal and usebal overall the usebal has a higher coefficient of determination r2 0 79 than the sebal r2 0 74 fig 6 c and d in addition the rmse mae and pbias values of the usebal are better than those of the sebal fig 6 e and f show the coefficient of determination between predicted and reference et derived from fao penman monteith algorithm this evaluation also shows that the usebal yields a higher coefficient of determination r2 0 78 than the sebal r2 0 74 however the variations in the other model performance metrics are not significant 3 3 3 model sensitivity in the results of a sensitivity analysis using two representative datasets fig 7 a and b show that rn is positively correlated with et a 30 w m2 increase and decrease in rn result in the highest change in the estimate of et for sandy bare land and impervious urban areas followed by sparse vegetation in contrast the changes in rn for other land cover types show no significant sensitivity to et a linear negative correlation between gn and et fig 7 c and d shows that an increase in gn cloud led to a decrease in et however sandy bare land and urban impervious areas are highly sensitive compared to other land cover types a 30 w m2 increase and decrease in gn results in around an 8 change in et changes to h are negatively correlated with et and the correlations are approximately linear fig 7 e and f a 30 w m2 increase and decrease in h results in the highest relative change in et of around 25 30 for impervious urban areas followed by 15 changes in et for sandy bare land note that the changes in h are highly sensitive to et compared to the changes in rn and gn fig 7 g and h show that the changes in le are positively correlated with et a 30 w m2 increase and decrease in le results in a more than 20 change in the estimation of et for impervious urban areas note that the change in le for other land cover types is also sensitive to et but shows a lower relative change than that for impervious urban areas the results of sensitivity analysis indicate that the errors in input energy fluxes can result in an inaccurate estimation of et however sensitivity is variable to energy fluxes and land cover types the results demonstrate that the model is most sensitive to changes in le and h followed by rn and gn note that dense and sparse vegetation are less sensitive to changes in et than other land cover types it should also be noted that the errors in input parameters can result in an inaccurate estimation of the energy budget components this study investigates model sensitivity to changes in input parameters including lst and surface albedo that is derived from landsat images air temperature and solar radiation that is collected from the weather station among various factors of changes in et this study finds a high influence of these four parameters the values of input parameters are perturbed and the sensitivity to energy budget components is enumerated fig 8 shows an example of sensitivity to changes in surface albedo lst and air temperature for sandy bare land in the estimation of surface energy fluxes the results of sensitivity analysis for other land cover types are provided as supplementary material fig a 7 9 the results demonstrate that surface albedo is highly correlated with le followed by rn a 12 5 increase and decrease in surface albedo result in the highest change in the estimation of le in contrast an increase and decrease in lst and air temperature show the highest change in the estimation of le followed by h for sandy bare land and urban impervious areas in contrast other land cover types show the highest change in the estimation of h followed by le a 5 k increase and decrease in surface and air temperature results in a more than 40 change in the estimation of le and nearly 30 change in the estimation of h as mentioned previously solar radiation strongly influences et thus fig 7 i and j indicates that the change in 24 hour net radiation is highly sensitive to et it shows a positive and linear correlation with et a 30 w m2 increase and decrease in rn24 results in a more than 20 change in the estimation of et the sensitivity analysis results demonstrate that impervious urban areas and sandy bare lands are highly sensitive to changes in energy budget components compared to other land cover types thus care should be taken in the estimation of surface energy fluxes for et modelling in the typical urban areas 4 discussion the findings of this study suggest using a land cover map for the estimation of et in the urban environment because urban land cover types are diverse in nature and the variability in land cover types impacts spatial variability in energy fluxes and et waters et al 2002 mentioned that land cover map is not a requirement for surface energy balance algorithm but is highly recommended the existence of large impervious surfaces makes et estimation a challenge in urban areas trout and ross 2006 this study acknowledges the consideration of urban land cover classes to estimate urban energy fluxes the usebal with consideration of urban land cover types shows variation in the estimation of energy fluxes from the traditional sebal table a 1 the estimated net radiation shows the lowest difference between sebal and usebal in contrast other energy fluxes e g soil heat flux sensible heat flux and latent heat flux show the largest variation between them the results show variability in the predicted energy fluxes to dates it is important to validate predicted energy fluxes however this study lacks in situ measurement thus future work is a requirement this study evaluates the estimated energy fluxes by comparison the results of some other studies in an analysis of intra urban energy fluxes weng et al 2014 found the ranges of net radiation from 319 to 613 w m2 soil heat flux from 97 to 176 w m2 sensible heat flux from 93 to 165 and latent heat flux from 96 to 195 w m2 the results of the usebal show more consistency in the estimation of net radiation and soil heat flux than the sebal the sensible heat flux of some dates shows relatively low values while using the usebal in contrast the sebal yields relatively low values for all of the dates in the proposed approach the mean values of the latent heat flux show overestimation but relatively low than the mean values as derived using the sebal the deviations in the estimation of the energy fluxes can arise due to the variation in geographical settings and weather conditions however the observation of this study is consistent with findings reported in an analysis of weng et al 2014 that urban energy fluxes are variable to dates and seasons the characteristics of the physical properties and diverse landscapes affect land surface parameters in urban environments multi year image analysis indicates that the spatial variation in land cover and seasons strongly influence et the values of the land surface parameters and predicted et are also characterized by spatial and temporal variation of the landscapes land surface parameters e g surface albedo and lst show a strong negative correlation with et for non impervious land cover types the spatial distribution of et generally follows the spatial variation in surface temperature bhattarai et al 2016 however this study shows that et is strongly correlated to lst in non impervious areas but show greater deviation in areas containing impervious land cover this study supports the inclusion of anthropogenic heat in the energy budget while estimate et in an urban environment using the principles of land surface energy balance the results of this study indicate that the inclusion of anthropogenic heat and consideration of urban land cover composition improves et estimation in a heterogeneous urban environment and facilitates to map et in urban areas as mentioned previously the comparative analyses show significant deviations in the predicted et for impervious urban areas this corroborates previous studies showing that impervious urban areas are non evaporative and that et is generally small in areas with no water ma et al 2013 because dry areas generate the lowest latent heat flux farah and bastiaanssen 2001 a substantial variation in latent heat of vaporization for impervious urban areas is evident between sebal and usebal the proposed approach provides the lowest latent heat for impervious urban areas fig 9 therefore the usebal results in the lowest et for the impervious urban areas in contrast the sebal overestimate et for impervious urban areas note that kato and yamaguchi 2007 reported zero le for urban areas in addition wong et al 2015 reported that latent heat in urban areas is very low around 5 to 10 w m2 the findings of this study show good agreement with the findings of kato and yamaguchi 2007 and wong et al 2015 impervious areas are the dominant land cover in urban environments and anthropogenic heat is a significant energy flux thus it is important to consider this heat flux in the energy balance algorithm it should be noted that various meteorological parameters including solar radiation relative humidity air temperature and wind speed affect et shi et al 2017 tabari et al 2012 tomer and schilling 2009 however the most important factor influencing et is not stationary du et al 2016 indicated relative humidity as the factor most sensitive to seasonal and annual changes in et in the heihe river basin of northwestern china mcvicar et al 2012 found wind speed as the dominant force of changes in et tabari et al 2012 indicated that a significant increase in air temperature tends to increase in et in arid and semi arid regions of iran the results of yang et al 2019 showed that potential et is most sensitive to net radiation followed by relative humidity air temperature wind speed and soil heat flux in the qilian mountains northwestern china this study indicates the highest influence of solar radiation followed by air temperature this finding is consistent with the study of qiu et al 2017 which identified that et is strongly correlated with solar radiation in urban areas digiovanni white et al 2018 also found the strongest influence of temperature and solar radiation on the determination of et in a heterogeneous urban environment in new york city usa in contrast they noted the weak influence of wind speed and relative humidity on et but underlined the importance of them as the variables varied the most amongst the sites it should be noted that this study uses meteorological parameters from one weather station and lacks datasets from different locations urban environment is heterogeneous and results in strong variability in the micro weather digiovanni white et al 2018 this study acknowledges areas for future work in the evaluation of the influence of weather parameters on et using datasets from multiple sites in an urban environment model validation is important to estimate et using rs data this study uses pan evaporation and fao penman monteith based reference et to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach the model performance metrics indicate better performance of the usebal than the sebal it should be noted that the study site lacks an eddy flux tower which limits the robustness of the validation of the modelled et values thus a sensitivity analysis is performed the results of sensitivity analysis indicate that some of the energy budget components are highly sensitive to et which highlights the importance of its accurate estimation to reduce uncertainty considering the limitations of this study we urge researchers to evaluate and validate the proposed approach in urban areas that have in situ measurements of surface energy fluxes over various land cover types moreover future study is required to improve the usebal by considering other parameters such as weather data of different locations soil type and moisture conditions 5 conclusions et is an important component of the hydrologic cycle the hydrologic cycle starts with evaporation from the bodies of surface water and transpiration from the vegetative land cover and thus changes in land cover affect et in urban areas where water and the evaporative surfaces are scarce it is important to understand the spatial and temporal pattern of et for managing urban landscapes and microclimates and investigating urban water stress existing studies rarely estimate et in a typical urban environment this study proposes an approach to improve et estimation for a heterogeneous urban environment based on the urban surface energy balance algorithm called the usebal the proposed approach shows the lowest et for impervious urban areas while the sebal shows the lowest et for dry bare land followed by impervious areas the results indicate strong similarities in the maximum observed et values between the models however there are deviations between the minimum and mean et values the model performance metrics show the satisfactory performance of the proposed approach to estimate et in a heterogeneous urban environment however future study is required to test the transferability of the usebal and to fully evaluate the applicability of this approach to other rs data the results reported in this study confirm that the impervious areas are the dominant land cover in the urban areas where the human activities concentrate and generate anthropogenic heat thus this study supports the inclusion of this heat flux when estimating et in a heterogeneous urban environment based on the surface energy balance algorithm the sensitivity analysis indicates that variations in energy fluxes can affect et and so care should be taken in the estimation of the model inputs the proposed usebal is of significance to understand water demand for diverse urban landscapes and facilitate the monitoring of water stress in a

5886,water availability is crucial for sustaining the development and even existence of human civilization identifying major sources of its variability is of paramount importance the climate elasticity method provides a suitable platform to quantify the relative influences of climatic variables and anthropogenic stresses using budyko hypothesis to the changes in runoff but judicious selection of budyko based equations with relevant runoff elasticities is vital in this paper comparative study is carried out using climate elasticity approach in 19 catchments across india to evaluate the disparity among runoff elasticities and percentage contributions of climatic variables precipitation maximum and minimum temperature wind speed sunshine duration and relative humidity and anthropogenic stress in runoff alterations among climatic parameters precipitation has shown the maximum influence in 16 catchments in 15 catchments maximum temperature has higher relative contribution than minimum temperature in addition anthropogenic influence is higher in 9 catchments for two parameter approach precipitation and potential evapotranspiration whereas it has higher impact in 10 catchments as per multi parameter including evapotranspiration elasticities approach decomposing evapotranspiration elasticity to five climatic variables has been proven to be unproductive as it has produced more disparity among the percentage contribution values the standard deviation values in contributions are more in the case of the multi parameter model thus it is pragmatic to adopt multi parameter model that constitutes runoff elasticities to different climatic variables when assignment demands the individual influences of these variables on hydrology adding more parameters into the framework introduces more error in the assessment of impacts of climatic variabilities keywords anthropogenic stress budyko framework evapotranspiration climate variability runoff elasticity 1 introduction with the increasing evidence from the past studies it is well established that climate change has become a paramount factor influencing the hydrological behaviour arnell 1999 huntington 2006 simonovic 2017 as per the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre industrial era ipcc 2014 which has led to the warming of the earth s atmosphere karl and trenberth 2003 the rising temperature modify the climatic patterns around the globe which in turn alter the spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation thereby affecting the hydrological systems and altering the quality and quantity of available water resources immerzeel et al 2010 das and umamahesh 2018a for instance a study carried out by schewe et al 2014 reported that 2 c of global warming will confront an additional 15 of the global population under water scarcity condition similarly anthropogenic activities viz deforestation urbanization industrialization construction of the dam irrigation etc are likely to influence the hydrological processes directly or indirectly huntington 2006 which consequently redistribute the spatio temporal availability of water resources milly et al 2005 moreover the anthropogenic activities heavily affect the regional hydrologic cycle globally wada et al 2010 wang and hejazi 2011 promoting anthropogenic droughts aghakouchak et al 2015 which suggest unsustainable water resources management as a result of human induced water stress it is worth mentioning that the term climate change encompasses climate evolution due to naturally and anthropogenically induced variability and the quantification of the changeability in the hydrological processes reflects the combined feedback from both natural and anthropogenic forcing india being an agrarian country with more than 1 2 billion population has a huge demand of water resources and due to the dual pressure of population growth and climate change the gap between demand and supply has increased substantially subsequently urbanization and industrialization due to india s booming economic growth have greatly altered the land use pattern in the most parts of the country unnikrishnan et al 2016 in addition to the anthropogenic activities the changing climate is one of the major threats to the water resources and food security as the country holds only 4 of total water resources and 9 of the arable land of the globe goyal and surampalli 2018 in this sense understanding the water resources system and its exposure to the adverse natural and anthropogenic stressors are crucial to fulfill the demand of the growing population understanding the individual effects of climatic variability and anthropogenic activities on water availability q are beneficial to promote optimal water resources management chawla and mujumdar 2015 to develop water management strategies to sustain the functionality of the ecosystem gao et al 2016 to devise adaptive measures against climate change x wang 2014 jha et al 2019 and to ensure the dependable water resources for domestic and agricultural uses liang et al 2015 hence in the recent years numerous studies have been attempted to examine the variability in the streamflow as a result of natural hereafter climatic variability and human induced changeability but are not limited to creed et al 2014 helman et al 2017 liang et al 2015 sinha et al 2018 wang 2014 wu et al 2017 in order to examine the extent of influence due to climatic variability and human activities in the long term average changes in the streamflow the commonly used methodologies are categorized into empirically based hydrological modelling based and elasticity based approaches the empirically based approach needs long record of hydro climatological datasets and establishes statistical relationships between the streamflow and other climatic variables of interest using regression analysis time trend analysis double mass curve method etc zhao et al 2015 kong et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 hydrological modelling serves as a powerful tool for conceptual physical representation of the hydrological cycle and capable of modelling the individual impact of climatic and anthropogenic activities on runoff variability chawla and mujumdar 2015 zeng et al 2015 li et al 2012 elasticity based methods determine the sensitiveness of hydrological responses to variability in climatic parameters this climate elasticity approach explained in the methodology section in detail has an advantage over the hydrological modelling as it uses fewer hydro climatic datasets and provides a generalized relationship based on the annual mean and without incorporating the underlying surface of a basin li et al 2012 the commonly used elasticity based methods include statistically based non parametric method and analytically derived budyko framework arora 2002 budyko 1974 fu et al 2007 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 in the initial stage runoff elasticity to precipitation p was defined by schaake 1990 as 1 ε p p q dq dp p q sankarasubramanian et al 2001 opted the methodology to prepare a contour map of precipitation elasticity across the united states arora 2002 with his comprehensive analytical elasticity method introduced two runoff elasticity to precipitation and potential evaporation using four non parametric and one parametric equations zhang et al 2001 fu et al 2007 derived the runoff elasticity to precipitation and temperature t and the relative change in discharge is defined as 2 δ q q ε p δ p p ε t δ t t the idea of introducing the temperature parameter was to include the influence of global warming that intensifies the hydrological cycle and ultimately leads to precipitation extremes it had been acknowledged that other climatic parameters along with temperature impact the evaporation process and this along with precipitation could represent the impact of climate change as a whole on the runoff subsequently zheng et al 2009 proposed a similar expression including the runoff elasticity to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration eo as 3 δ q q ε p δ p p ε e 0 δ e 0 e 0 yang and yang 2011 extended this expression to observe the individual impacts of climatic parameters namely temperature wind speed u net radiation rn relative humidity rh on runoff change the relative change in discharge was expressed as 4 δ q q ε p δ p p ε t δ t t ε u δ u u ε r n δ r n r n ε rh δ r h rh wang et al 2016 further discussed the importance of decomposing the temperature variable to maximum tx and minimum temperature tn and insisted on considering sunshine duration n in place of rn to avert from the relative errors due to inter dependency of rn on n rh tx and tn for addressing the issue of variability of surface characteristics like topographical attributes soil moisture vegetation covers etc predominantly influenced by human activities and its impact on hydrology wang et al 2016 added elasticity to catchment characteristics using budyko framework for quantifying the relative change in discharge the equation thus stated as 5 δ q q ε p δ p p ε tx δ t x tx ε ti δ t n tn ε u δ u u ε n δ n n ε rh δ r h rh ε n δ n n the budyko based equation given by choudhury 1999 was used by wang et al 2016 budyko framework works on the assumption that the hydrological system is in steady state while considering a temporal span of approximately 10 years wu et al 2017 it is a simple framework that adheres to the constrictions of water and energy availability generally budyko equations are expressed as e p f where e is actual evapotranspiration and φ represents dryness index which is the ratio of potential evapotranspiration eo to precipitation p in recent times researchers have successfully incorporated basin surface attributes like soil properties land covers geographical properties etc into the budyko framework and produced mathematical expressions table 1 choudhury 1999 fu et al 2007 wang and tang 2014 yang et al 2007 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 with all the available methods selection of an appropriate approach remains a tough task pertaining to the complexity involved in hydrological processes and the methodologies discussed above there is no clear affirmation of a technique on what climate elasticities to consider for impact assessment studies in addition elasticity magnitudes depend on the type of budyko based equation selected for the study performances of these elasticity models with different budyko based equations in context to the intricacy involved within the models have not been examined thus comparing the models and observing the differences in the outcomes would assist in addressing the issues of consideration of appropriate climatic parameters for assessing climatic impacts on runoff generation process in the present study a comparative analysis is carried out to observe the disparities involved in the models discussed above two models are considered involving precipitation and evapotranspiration elasticity herein referred as two parameter model tpm in one case and in the other the evapotranspiration elasticity is extended to five elasticity as was done by wang et al 2016 using the famous fao penman monteith equation herein referred as multi parameter model mpm the tpm is a simple model that incorporates the two key climatic variables as per the mean annual water balance principle to observe the assimilated impact of climate variability the fao penman monteith equation includes all the climatic parameters that influences the evapotranspiration process and thus serve in quantifying separate impacts of these parameters in runoff change in addition to see the disparities involved within the models eight budyko based equations are engaged in the analysis the investigation is carried out over 19 catchments from 11 river basins across india they are selected based on long term continuous data availability note that the budyko equations table 1 are equally appropriate and applicable on all catchments 2 study area and data used 2 1 study area in the present study 19 catchments from 11 major river basins of india are considered the spatial distribution of the catchments along with the locations of their runoff gauging stations are shown in fig 1 the hydro

long term streamflow pattern it has become indispensable to examine the change point or inflection point in the hydro meteorological time series for effective planning and management of the water resources raje 2014 the change point analysis is a powerful technique for identifying the change in the statistical properties in the time series the commonly used change point analysis techniques viz standard normal homogeneity test and wilcoxon s nonparametric rank test provide a single change point over the entire time series however in the present analysis we have used bayesian approach proposed by barry and hartigan 1993 to examine the change point in the annual streamflow unlike the classical approach bayesian analysis provides the probability density function of the change at each point in the time series das and umamahesh 2018b moreover several other advantages of the bayesian approach include i bayesian approach incorporates the uncertainty associated with the data series ii bayesian approach employs the prior distribution of the data and overcomes the shortcomings of the frequentist approach the product partition model proposed by hartigan 1990 is opted to segregate the data into different blocks the model assumes that within the block the observations are independent and identically distributed having a normal distribution with constant mean and variance the prior distribution of the partition probability is updated using markov chain monte carlo mcmc process without affecting the likelihood function and the posterior distribution is obtained using the bayes theorem in the present study the bayesian change point analysis is carried out using the r package bcp and can be downloaded from https cran r project org package bcp 3 2 runoff elasticity 3 2 1 climate elasticity from two parameter model elasticity or sensitivity based methods use coefficients that define the sensitivity of a dependent parameter to variability in the independent parameters sankarasubramanian et al 2001 schaake 1990 an analytical elasticity based method was proposed by arora 2002 using the budyko hypothesis to compute the relative influences of anthropogenic stresses and climatic variability to changes in runoff generation annual scale long term water balance equation of a catchment is defined as 6 p e q δ s here p is precipitation e is actual evapotranspiration q is discharge and δs is the change in water storage all parameters are in annual mean scale budyko hypothesis conceives the idea of long term water balance approximately 10 years or more wu et al 2017 for a catchment and considers the change in water storage to be negligible δs 0 total differentiation of qc i e changes in discharge due to climatic variability is shown as 7 d q c q c p d p q c e 0 d e 0 relative change in runoff is expressed as 8 q c q p p e q c p dp p e 0 p e q c e 0 d e 0 e 0 the coefficients of the relative changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as expressed in the above equation are the elasticity of runoff to p p and e0 e 0 respectively from eq 6 8 and budyko hypothesis the following expressions can be derived for the elasticity of runoff 9 p p e q c p 1 ϕ f ϕ 1 f ϕ e 0 p e q c e 0 ϕ f ϕ 1 f ϕ the sum of elasticity to precipitation and e0 equals 1 substituting eq 9 in eq 8 we get the equation for change in runoff due to variability in climatic parameters i e p and e0 as per the two parameter model 10 d q c q p dp p e 0 d e 0 e 0 3 2 2 climatic elasticity from multi parameter model the widely used fao penman monteith equation is adopted to calculate daily potential evapotranspiration and described as 11 e 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u v p d δ γ 1 0 34 u where δ is the slope of vapour pressure curve kpa 0c 1 rn is net radiation at the surface mj m 2 d 1 g is ground heat flux mj m 2 d 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa 0c 1 t is mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c u is wind speed at 2 m height ms 1 vpd is vapour pressure deficit kpa which is the difference between saturated and actual vapour pressures yang and yang 2011 used 4 climatic parameters i e rn temperature t u relative humidity rh to quantify the impacts on the evapotranspiration process contrary to this due to the dependence of relative humidity on maximum temperature tx minimum temperature tn net radiation n and rh and to see the individual contributions of tx and tn subjected to data availability wang et al 2016 conducted the contribution analysis with five climatic variables namely tx tn u n rh by the use of first order approximation the differential equation of e0 considering all the parameters is stated below as 12 d e 0 e 0 t x d t x e 0 t n d t n e 0 u d u e 0 n d n e 0 r h d r h all the parameters in the above equation are in daily time scale the equation needs to be in annual time scale for further analysis thus variation in annual e0 can be expressed as 13 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 i 1 n e 0 t x d t x i 1 n e 0 t n d t n i 1 n e 0 u d u i 1 n e 0 n d n i 1 n e 0 r h d r h the subscript y denotes the yearly time scale n represents the number of days in a year relative change in e0 y is given by 14 d e 0 y e 0 y 1 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 t x d t x 1 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 t n d t n 1 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 u d u 1 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 n d n 1 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 r h d r h the budyko framework implemented in the climate elasticity method functions in annual time scale to be consistent with the assumption of steady state δs 0 it is necessary to consider multi year time scale annual mean therefore eq 14 can be written as 15 d e 0 y e 0 y 1 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 t x d tx 1 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 t n d tn 1 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 u du 1 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 n dn 1 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 r h d rh here e 0 y tx tn u n and rh are the mean annual potential evapotranspiration maximum temperature minimum temperature wind speed sunshine duration and relative humidity respectively following terms can be re written as 16 e 0 y n e 0 i 1 n e 0 x n e 0 x in the above equation x represents the climatic variables therefore eq 15 can be expressed as 17 d e 0 y e 0 y 1 e 0 e 0 t x d tx 1 e 0 e 0 t n d tn u e 0 e 0 u d u u 1 e 0 e 0 n d n rh e 0 e 0 r h d rh rh to achieve similar expressions of relative change as in eq 10 the following equation can be written as 18 d e 0 e 0 tx 1 d t x tn 1 d t n u 1 du u n 1 d n rh 1 drh rh where tx 1 tn 1 u 1 n 1 and rh 1 represents the evapotranspiration elasticity to maximum temperature minimum temperature wind speed sunshine duration and relative humidity respectively incorporating eq 18 in eq 10 we obtain the expression to quantify the change in discharge due to climatic variability by using multi parameter model the equation is as stated below 19 d q c q p dp p e 0 tx 1 d t x tn 1 d t n u 1 du u n 1 d n rh 1 drh rh the final equation is obtained by combining elasticity of runoff and evapotranspiration as 20 d q c q p dp p tx d t x tn d t n u du u n d n rh drh rh where tx tn u n and rh are the runoff elasticity to maximum temperature minimum temperature wind speed sunshine duration and relative humidity respectively 3 3 attribution analysis from change point analysis non stationarity is defined for the discharge dataset of each catchment considered in the study the time period is divided accordingly into portions and termed as pre assessment and post assessment period it is assumed that the total change in discharge from pre to post assessment period includes both the changes in discharge due to climatic variability and anthropogenic stress as defined below 21 δ q δ q c δ q a where δ q is the total change in discharge δ q c is the change in discharge due to climatic variability and δqa is the change due to anthropogenic stress the study captures the influence of anthropogenic activities as a whole subtly capturing factors that chiefly depend on anthropogenic stress like catchment efficiency also note that additional assessments have not been undertaken to explicitly demonstrate the influence of anthropogenic stress quantifying land use land cover changes since the major objective of the study is to determine the disparities in the models thus from eq 21 δ q a is defined as 22 δ q a δ q δ q c δ q δ q p δ q e 0 where δ q p and δ q e 0 are defined as the changes in discharge due to variability in precipitation and pet respectively this representation is consistent with the hypothesis of tpm in the case of mpm the eq 22 can further be derived as 23 δ q a δ q δ q c δ q δ q p δ q tx δ q tn δ q u δ q n δ q rh where δ q tx δ q tn δ q u δ q n and δ q rh are defined as the changes in discharge due to variability in maximum temperature minimum temperature wind speed sunshine duration and relative humidity respectively 4 results 4 1 trend analysis of hydro meteorological variables the trend analysis of hydro meteorological datasets is carried out to detect the slowly varying monotonic pattern of the hydro meteorological dataset the non parametric mann kendall test is used to identify the trend at 95 confidence level hence the z values outside the bound of 1 96 and 1 96 denote significantly decreasing and increasing trends respectively the z statistics of the trend test for all the hydro meteorological variables in different catchments is presented in fig 2 it can be noted from the figure that out of 19 catchments catchment id 14 and 19 have significantly increasing and decreasing trend for discharge respectively catchment id 12 and 4 have shown a significant rising and declining trend respectively for pet in addition about half of the total catchments show a significantly increasing trend in maximum temperature in the case of minimum temperature only catchment id 8 has registered a significantly decreasing trend moreover no noticeable trend is observed in precipitation and sunshine duration 4 2 change point analysis of runoff data generally the change point analysis is performed using pettitt s test buishand s test and von neumann s test which results in a single change point over the time series however it is to be noted that a minimum of 10 years should be taken as the pre assessment period for the adoption of budyko hypothesis hence to avoid the case of arrival of a change point in a year that is within the first ten years of the study period a bayesian approach is adopted in the case of bayesian change point analysis it is assumed that each point in the data set has likelihood of witnessing a change point the point having higher posterior density value is considered as the change point for the time series in this sense if a change point lies within the initial ten years a point having second highest posterior density is taken and so on in the present study the change point is computed only for the runoff data performing the analysis on other climatic variables and assessing the relationships would definitely shed more light on the results but to explicitly document the runoff changes and see the influences of other factors in it the analysis is performed for streamflow datasets only the changing years correspond to change points are displayed in table 2 as pre and post assessment period it can be noticed from table 2 that seven catchments id 1 4 10 12 13 17 19 have experienced a decrement in runoff generation from pre to post assessment period as shown in fig 2 downward trend is observed in all these catchments except id 13 however decreasing trends in rainfall have not been registered for these catchments except ids 10 and 19 this is attributable to the intricacy of the catchment hydrology heavily interlinked with the anthropogenic activities 4 3 dryness attributes of catchments the dryness index for all the catchments in both the temporal periods pre and post assessment periods are shown in table s1 supplementary information it is seen that only 3 catchments id 10 13 19 have become drier in the post assessment period the spatial distributions of the aridity index for both the periods are shown in fig s1 supplementary information most of the catchments in the southern and central part of india have shown higher aridity index in both the periods it ranged from 1 152 id 3 anandapur to 3 039 id 14 singavaram with a mean value of 1 915 in the pre assessment period the values decreased in the post assessment period having ranged between 1 078 id 3 anandapur and 3 004 id 14 singavaram with a mean value of 1 818 highest negative changes from pre to post assessment periods more wet have been observed in all the catchments of western and a few from the southern part of india in addition a significant relationship is observed between absolute change in aridity index from pre to post assessment period and aridity index during the pre assessment period when we considered 17 catchments out of 19 r 0 663 p 0 01 fig 3 a the relationship appeared stronger when we considered only those catchments that became wetter in the post assessment period r 0 765 p 0 01 fig 3 b this indicates that catchments with higher aridity index in pre assessment period became wetter in the post assessment period 4 4 two parameter model 4 4 1 elasticities as stated above the two parameters that determine the variability in runoff generation as per the two parameter model are pet and precipitation the mean runoff elasticities to pet e 0 and p p are calculated and their spatial distributions are shown in fig 4 a for all the catchments e 0 is negative and thus implying that the change in runoff is negatively correlated with the variability in pet e 0 ranged from 1 051 id 3 to 2 071 id 18 with an average value of 1 451 the catchments in the southern part of india have shown lesser values of e 0 and higher values are observed in catchments in the central eastern and western part of india furthermore p is positive for all the catchments and varied between 3 071 id 18 to 2 051 id 3 with an average of 2 451 in addition the absolute value of e 0 is less than p for all catchments considered in the study indicating that runoff change is more sensitive to variability in precipitation than pet the spatial discrepancy of p is oppositely similar to e 0 due to the relationship between the two elasticities i e the sum of the elasticities equals 1 consistent with the two parameter model 4 4 2 quantitative characteristics of runoff change the contributions of climatic variability to runoff changes for all the catchments are quantified using the attribution analysis with the elasticities calculate as per tpm table s2 it is observed that 8 catchments id 3 6 7 9 10 11 15 16 are having the highest contributions of climatic variability a similar result is observed for anthropogenic contributions eight catchments id 1 4 8 12 13 14 17 and 18 have shown highest contributions from anthropogenic stress table not shown within climatic variability it is observed that contributions from precipitation are more than that of pet for all catchments except thammavaram id 17 table s3 and s4 negative contributions in some of the catchments id 4 12 17 indicate that the direction of total change in runoff and that of change caused due to climatic variability is opposite to each other if runoff has decreased then climatic variability has increased it from pre assessment to post assessment period and vice versa it can be observed that in some catchments id 4 7 9 12 16 the percentage contribution values are more than 100 table s2 it means that the change in runoff caused due to climatic variability is more than the actual runoff change observed for the catchments during the study period furthermore contributions from 2 budyko equations suggested by zhang et al 2001 and wang and tang 2014 were not quantified for one catchment pathagudem id 11 following the position of its evaporative index aet p in the proximity of the suggested values by the lower limits of the budyko curves almost on the curve where catchment parameter w 0 in budyko equation given by zhang et al 2001 and 0 in equation given by wang and tang 2014 this generally happens due to underestimation of aet calculated as p q these underestimations of aet may have resulted from considering runoffs generated from sources other than precipitation sinha et al 2018 one of the possible sources is the irrigation water that may percolate and join the base flow and comes into the considerations of total runoff the percentage contributions obtained from all the eight budyko equations are different from each other this discrepancy has been discussed in section 5 for further analysis their averages are considered as there is no irregularity in the sign of contributions for each catchment the highest climatic contribution is seen for jaraikela id 7 with a value of 283 028 and the lowest is 282 277 for sarati id 12 the spatial disparity of climatic and anthropogenic contributions is shown in fig 5 a it is to be noted that the spatial variations for both the influencers are similar but opposite in nature as the sum of the changes become 100 the climatic variability over catchments in the western part of india have contributed negatively moreover catchments in the central southern and eastern part of india have shown low climatic contributions in addition the catchments in the western part of india have shown high negative contributions of precipitation pet contributions are very low compared to precipitation table s3 and s4 it is maximum in catchment jaraikela id 7 with a value of 59 890 furthermore it can be noted that there are considerable differences in the contribution values for the same river basins fig 5 a this is due to the significant variabilities in the precipitation and pet values within the same basins for different catchments as can be observed from table 2 4 5 multi parameter model 4 5 1 elasticities mpm deals with parameters that influence the evapotranspiration process therefore in this model the evapotranspiration elasticities to five climatic parameters tx tn u n and rh are calculated and then combined with the runoff elasticity to evapotranspiration to obtain the sensitivity of runoff to the five climatic parameters the mean values range of tx tn u n and rh are 0 028 0 015 id 13 to 0 061 id 16 0 017 0 010 id13 to 0 035 id 16 0 297 0 469 id 19 to 0 071 id 12 0 051 0 083 id 18 to 0 038 id 11 0 711 0 321 id 13 to 1 591 id 16 respectively it is observed that wind speed and sunshine duration are negatively correlated with runoff change moreover changes in runoff are more sensitive to variability in relative humidity for most of the catchments considered for the study compared to the elasticity of runoff to evapotranspiration from tpm the elasticities of runoff to five parameters in mpm are less this may be due to further decomposition of the evapotranspiration variable that resulted in lowering the sensitivity of runoff change to individual climatic variables fig 4 b f shows the spatial variation of the elasticities the runoff elasticity to maximum temperature minimum temperature and relative humidity have shown similar spatial trait with higher values in the western and southern part of india catchments in the central part of india have shown lower elasticity values to wind speed compared to other catchments unlike other elasticities in the case of runoff elasticities to sunshine duration the values are found to be higher in the central and eastern part of india 4 5 2 quantitative characteristics of runoff change the contributions of climatic parameters to runoff change considered following decomposition of the evapotranspiration are quantified using the mpm in the climate elasticity method it is seen that n is having the highest contributions to runoff changes among the five parameters in 14 catchments with u having their highest influence in 4 catchments id 5 6 7 and 10 sunshine duration and u ranged from 13 765 id 9 kotni to 33 238 id 4 cholachguda and 60 716 id 7 jaraikela to 8 037 id 10 p g bridge respectively maximum temperature having a range from 14 226 id 7 jaraikela to 7 798 id 12 sarati has shown the highest influence in catchment sarati id 12 it has also been noticed that between tx and tn tx has higher contributions to runoff changes in 15 catchments leaving the rest 5 catchments id 3 8 9 16 and 18 with higher influence from tn this shows the importance of separating the temperature variable to tx and tn minimum temperature has the highest contribution of 4 008 in t k halli id 16 and lowest of 1 497 in kashinagar id 8 moreover rh ranged between 9 941 id 7 jaraikela to 11 094 id 19 zari the above outcomes are documented in tables s5 s9 as discussed before in the study 8 budyko equations are incorporated to quantify contributions and therefore it yields discrepancies within the model outputs these differences are discussed in section 5 for analysis average contributions are considered due to consistency in the sign of the contribution values the spatial variations of the contribution values are shown in fig 5 b f it is observed that tx in catchments in the western and a few in the central and eastern part of india have contributed negatively to runoff changes a similar trend is observed in the case of tn with higher contributions in the southern part of india u has contributed positively in most of the catchments of the southern and eastern part of india furthermore most of the catchments in the central and eastern part of india are having positive influences of n to runoff variations rh has contributed negatively in most of the catchments in the eastern part of india similar to the results from tpm differences in the results for catchments of same basins are solely due to variabilities in the climatic variables within the river basins 5 discussions 5 1 intra model disparity in the study eight budyko based equations are employed for the quantification of percentage contributions of climatic variables and anthropogenic stressors to runoff changes from pre assessment to post assessment period the results obtained from the study shows disparity among themselves fig 6 depicts the discrepancy in the climatic contributions obtained from the budyko equations pet contributions in the case of mpm mean the summation of all the five contributions tx tn u n and rh table 1 shows the four non parametric and parametric budyko equations incorporated in the study the disparity may have risen from the different approaches with which the equations were developed using the hydro meteorological variables moreover the contributions from parametric and non parametric equations form clusters this is due to the incorporation of catchment characteristics like soil properties land cover etc into the budyko hypothesis for parametric equations that may upsurge the possibilities of these equations to replicate the hydrological processes at catchment scale in this section the disparity within the models due to incorporation of eight budyko based equations is discussed since contributions from climatic parameters that influences evapotranspiration process are quantified with the mpm to maintain uniformity disparities in percentage contributions from pet calculated using tpm is analysed in tpm highest range of contribution values is seen in jaraikela id 7 standard deviations of contributions are obtained and shown in fig 7 a three catchments ids 7 11 19 are having high standard deviation furthermore difference in the average percentage contributions from parametric and non parametric equations are calculated and is termed as d it is observed that the slope of the trend line has reduced near to aridity index 1 965 when plotted between summation of d and summation of pre assessment aridity index fig 7 b it signifies that the rate of change of d per unit change in pre assessment aridity index has reduced after the aridity index value 1 965 this may be the reason for higher inconsistency in the contributions for two catchments out of three ids 7 and 11 with pre assessment aridity index 1 436 and 1 507 respectively fig 7 a similar observations are seen in the case of mpm jaraikela id 7 has the highest standard deviation fig 7 a in addition the slope of the trend line has decreased from pre assessment aridity index 1 679 when plotted between summation of d and summation of pre assessment aridity index as shown in fig 7 c it explains the higher discrepancy in the percentage contributions of two ids 1 7 out of three catchments ids 1 7 19 that showed high value of standard deviation fig 7 a 5 2 inter model disparity one of the key objectives of our study is to evaluate the differences between the tpm and mpm the differences in contributions values emerged from the disintegration of the evapotranspiration elasticity into five climatic elasticities to discuss this disparity pet contributions are considered for both the cases and plotted as shown in the fig 8 a a significant and strong linear relationship is observed between pet contributions from both the models r 0 761 p 0 01 quadrant 2 and 4 denote the state where both the models produced contradictory results one method showing positive and the other showing negative contributions six out of 19 catchments ids 3 8 10 11 12 and 15 have shown inconsistent results a possible explanation is the propagation of errors due to incorporation of more climatic parameters into the framework in addition as discussed above adding more variables may contribute to explaining the differences and improve the framework further although the contribution values are near to the 1 1 line green line few catchments have shown significant deviation from the line shown with red markers these deviations are due to disproportionate performance of the mpm as mentioned above about the parameter d it is detected that the change in the slope of the trend lines shown with blue and red colours are more in the case of mpm δsmpm 3 980 and δstpm 3 533 with an early occurrence of the change point φmpm 1 679 and φtpm 1 965 therefore the likelihood of occurrence of higher inconsistency within the budyko based equations is more in mpm compared to tpm moreover it can be seen from fig 7 a that in 13 catchments ids 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 14 15 17 18 19 standard deviation is more when multi parameter model is conducted which is also evident from fig 6 these suggest the instability in the performance of multi parameter model that eventually may lead to erroneous predictions of the impacts of climatic and anthropogenic influences on runoff changes to acquire a wider interpretation of the present study the differences in the influence of climatic variability and anthropogenic stress on runoff change when performed using two different models are further observed note that the impact from climatic variability includes the influences of precipitation same in both the model and evapotranspiration summation of five climatic parameters for mpm the percentage climatic contributions from both the models are plotted and shown in fig 8 b a very strong and significant linear correlation is observed between the two models r 0 99 p 0 01 it showcases confidence in the derivation of elasticities using the theoretical arrangement however separating the pet variable into five climatic components may increase the chances of error propagation into the derived framework contradictory results have been observed in catchment id 1 it is seen that d is higher in 12 catchments ids 1 4 6 8 9 12 17 for the case of mpm fig 8 c in addition fig 8 d f show the standard deviation of percentage contributions of climatic variability when four non parametric four parametric and all budyko equations are considered respectively it is higher in 12 catchments non parametric ids 1 4 6 8 9 12 17 parametric ids 1 4 6 8 9 12 17 all ids 1 4 6 8 9 12 17 for multi parameter model compared to two parameter model for all the three cases these clearly implies that there is a greater inconsistency in percentage contribution values from multi parameter model 5 3 applicability of the models the present study highlights the differences in the performance of two and multi parameter models mpm includes more climatic elasticities initiated from extending the evapotranspiration elasticity elasticities explain the sensitivity of a parameter to disturbances in its surroundings the elasticity concept was first introduced by schaake 1990 till now the elasticity theory is extended to precipitation and five evaporation related parameters tx tn u n rh that unfolds the correlation of solar radiation with temperature and relative humidity wang et al 2016 although the decomposition of the evapotranspiration elasticity seems to be judicious the results project a dissimilar sight higher inconsistency is obtained both within the model among eight budyko equations and compared to tpm while conducting contribution analysis using mpm moreover wang et al 2016 has also documented the instability in the presentation of multi parameter model while comparing the computed total runoff change with the observed runoff values the present study utilised the six runoff elasticities precipitation and evaporation related to determine the influence of variation in climatic variables to changes in runoff generation there is a possibility of occurrence of more runoff elasticity that could better explain the impact and minimise the variations between the two models thus it is not invalid to say that the use of multi parameter model should be restricted to only when evaluation of the influence of individual climatic parameters is the main goal considering climatic influence as a whole seems promising to quantify the impact of climatic variability to hydrology at catchment scale using tpm 5 4 uncertainty in the analysis in these kinds of studies of impact assessment many sources of uncertainties are involved during the quantification of contributions using two parameter model climatic variability and anthropogenic stress are considered to be independent of each other in real world both the elements hold a very intricate relationship between them wu et al 2017 zeng et al 2015 they work together collectively in a hydrological system and are complementary to each other during the implementation of budyko hypothesis in the climate elasticity method the water storage was considered to be negligible in the mean annual water balance it highly depends on the physiographical land surface and soil properties of a catchment there is no such firm evidence to ascertain this assumption wu et al 2017 furthermore change in runoff due to climatic variability is calculated by ignoring the higher orders in taylor expansions therefore considering first order expansion of runoff change may introduce error in the framework h yang et al 2014 thirdly during the quantification of runoff elasticity the catchment parameters 4 parametric budyko equations are kept unchanged throughout the temporal range of analysis for each catchment catchment parameters define the surface and soil attributes that are subjected to alterations due to anthropogenic surface and sub surface water withdrawals construction of hydraulic structures and climatic factors consideration of these issues ensures the natural flow conditions the present study captured the prime characteristics of the precipitation partitioning process by taking the mean annual values of the catchment parameters budyko hypothesis incorporating catchment parameter as a variable and quantifying runoff elasticity to catchment parameter would further enhance the results of contribution analysis as the framework works on mean annual water balance it considers only the temporal changes of mean values sometimes temporal variabilities may occur in variables with mean remaining almost similar which may be addressed by considering anomalies in the variables this calls for further research works on anomalies to see the changes in the temporal variabilities moreover human errors in collection of observed datasets add more sources of uncertainty in the study 6 conclusions it is vital to isolate and understand the relative contributions from the naturally induced and human induced forcings to runoff variability the elasticity based method presents a simple framework and thus widely used to differentiate the impacts of changing environment on runoff climatic elasticity of runoff generation assists in examining the sensitivity of the streamflow to the change in different meteorological variables the present study demonstrated a comparative assessment using budyko based equations on performance of two models that differs in the incorporation of number of climatic parameters into the climate elasticity framework higher inconsistency in relative contributions to changing runoff is observed in the multi parameter model that designates a degrading effect of decomposition of evapotranspiration into five climatic parameters in addition possibility of occurrence of considerable inconsistency in multi parameter model is more compared to two parameter model thus it can be inferred that two parameter model works well for the case of calculating the influence of climatic variability all together decomposing the evapotranspiration elasticity totally depends on the nature and purpose of plans and policies similar conclusions on extending the climatic elasticities have been noticed in previous studies our results suggest that the selection of the method based on budyko hypothesis budyko based equations should be done cautiously while quantifying the impacts of changing parameters which would ultimately help to formulate sustainable management and effective adaptation strategies author contributions jhilam sinha and jew das conceived the idea and performed

5886,water availability is crucial for sustaining the development and even existence of human civilization identifying major sources of its variability is of paramount importance the climate elasticity method provides a suitable platform to quantify the relative influences of climatic variables and anthropogenic stresses using budyko hypothesis to the changes in runoff but judicious selection of budyko based equations with relevant runoff elasticities is vital in this paper comparative study is carried out using climate elasticity approach in 19 catchments across india to evaluate the disparity among runoff elasticities and percentage contributions of climatic variables precipitation maximum and minimum temperature wind speed sunshine duration and relative humidity and anthropogenic stress in runoff alterations among climatic parameters precipitation has shown the maximum influence in 16 catchments in 15 catchments maximum temperature has higher relative contribution than minimum temperature in addition anthropogenic influence is higher in 9 catchments for two parameter approach precipitation and potential evapotranspiration whereas it has higher impact in 10 catchments as per multi parameter including evapotranspiration elasticities approach decomposing evapotranspiration elasticity to five climatic variables has been proven to be unproductive as it has produced more disparity among the percentage contribution values the standard deviation values in contributions are more in the case of the multi parameter model thus it is pragmatic to adopt multi parameter model that constitutes runoff elasticities to different climatic variables when assignment demands the individual influences of these variables on hydrology adding more parameters into the framework introduces more error in the assessment of impacts of climatic variabilities keywords anthropogenic stress budyko framework evapotranspiration climate variability runoff elasticity 1 introduction with the increasing evidence from the past studies it is well established that climate change has become a paramount factor influencing the hydrological behaviour arnell 1999 huntington 2006 simonovic 2017 as per the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre industrial era ipcc 2014 which has led to the warming of the earth s atmosphere karl and trenberth 2003 the rising temperature modify the climatic patterns around the globe which in turn alter the spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation thereby affecting the hydrological systems and altering the quality and quantity of available water resources immerzeel et al 2010 das and umamahesh 2018a for instance a study carried out by schewe et al 2014 reported that 2 c of global warming will confront an additional 15 of the global population under water scarcity condition similarly anthropogenic activities viz deforestation urbanization industrialization construction of the dam irrigation etc are likely to influence the hydrological processes directly or indirectly huntington 2006 which consequently redistribute the spatio temporal availability of water resources milly et al 2005 moreover the anthropogenic activities heavily affect the regional hydrologic cycle globally wada et al 2010 wang and hejazi 2011 promoting anthropogenic droughts aghakouchak et al 2015 which suggest unsustainable water resources management as a result of human induced water stress it is worth mentioning that the term climate change encompasses climate evolution due to naturally and anthropogenically induced variability and the quantification of the changeability in the hydrological processes reflects the combined feedback from both natural and anthropogenic forcing india being an agrarian country with more than 1 2 billion population has a huge demand of water resources and due to the dual pressure of population growth and climate change the gap between demand and supply has increased substantially subsequently urbanization and industrialization due to india s booming economic growth have greatly altered the land use pattern in the most parts of the country unnikrishnan et al 2016 in addition to the anthropogenic activities the changing climate is one of the major threats to the water resources and food security as the country holds only 4 of total water resources and 9 of the arable land of the globe goyal and surampalli 2018 in this sense understanding the water resources system and its exposure to the adverse natural and anthropogenic stressors are crucial to fulfill the demand of the growing population understanding the individual effects of climatic variability and anthropogenic activities on water availability q are beneficial to promote optimal water resources management chawla and mujumdar 2015 to develop water management strategies to sustain the functionality of the ecosystem gao et al 2016 to devise adaptive measures against climate change x wang 2014 jha et al 2019 and to ensure the dependable water resources for domestic and agricultural uses liang et al 2015 hence in the recent years numerous studies have been attempted to examine the variability in the streamflow as a result of natural hereafter climatic variability and human induced changeability but are not limited to creed et al 2014 helman et al 2017 liang et al 2015 sinha et al 2018 wang 2014 wu et al 2017 in order to examine the extent of influence due to climatic variability and human activities in the long term average changes in the streamflow the commonly used methodologies are categorized into empirically based hydrological modelling based and elasticity based approaches the empirically based approach needs long record of hydro climatological datasets and establishes statistical relationships between the streamflow and other climatic variables of interest using regression analysis time trend analysis double mass curve method etc zhao et al 2015 kong et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 hydrological modelling serves as a powerful tool for conceptual physical representation of the hydrological cycle and capable of modelling the individual impact of climatic and anthropogenic activities on runoff variability chawla and mujumdar 2015 zeng et al 2015 li et al 2012 elasticity based methods determine the sensitiveness of hydrological responses to variability in climatic parameters this climate elasticity approach explained in the methodology section in detail has an advantage over the hydrological modelling as it uses fewer hydro climatic datasets and provides a generalized relationship based on the annual mean and without incorporating the underlying surface of a basin li et al 2012 the commonly used elasticity based methods include statistically based non parametric method and analytically derived budyko framework arora 2002 budyko 1974 fu et al 2007 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 in the initial stage runoff elasticity to precipitation p was defined by schaake 1990 as 1 ε p p q dq dp p q sankarasubramanian et al 2001 opted the methodology to prepare a contour map of precipitation elasticity across the united states arora 2002 with his comprehensive analytical elasticity method introduced two runoff elasticity to precipitation and potential evaporation using four non parametric and one parametric equations zhang et al 2001 fu et al 2007 derived the runoff elasticity to precipitation and temperature t and the relative change in discharge is defined as 2 δ q q ε p δ p p ε t δ t t the idea of introducing the temperature parameter was to include the influence of global warming that intensifies the hydrological cycle and ultimately leads to precipitation extremes it had been acknowledged that other climatic parameters along with temperature impact the evaporation process and this along with precipitation could represent the impact of climate change as a whole on the runoff subsequently zheng et al 2009 proposed a similar expression including the runoff elasticity to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration eo as 3 δ q q ε p δ p p ε e 0 δ e 0 e 0 yang and yang 2011 extended this expression to observe the individual impacts of climatic parameters namely temperature wind speed u net radiation rn relative humidity rh on runoff change the relative change in discharge was expressed as 4 δ q q ε p δ p p ε t δ t t ε u δ u u ε r n δ r n r n ε rh δ r h rh wang et al 2016 further discussed the importance of decomposing the temperature variable to maximum tx and minimum temperature tn and insisted on considering sunshine duration n in place of rn to avert from the relative errors due to inter dependency of rn on n rh tx and tn for addressing the issue of variability of surface characteristics like topographical attributes soil moisture vegetation covers etc predominantly influenced by human activities and its impact on hydrology wang et al 2016 added elasticity to catchment characteristics using budyko framework for quantifying the relative change in discharge the equation thus stated as 5 δ q q ε p δ p p ε tx δ t x tx ε ti δ t n tn ε u δ u u ε n δ n n ε rh δ r h rh ε n δ n n the budyko based equation given by choudhury 1999 was used by wang et al 2016 budyko framework works on the assumption that the hydrological system is in steady state while considering a temporal span of approximately 10 years wu et al 2017 it is a simple framework that adheres to the constrictions of water and energy availability generally budyko equations are expressed as e p f where e is actual evapotranspiration and φ represents dryness index which is the ratio of potential evapotranspiration eo to precipitation p in recent times researchers have successfully incorporated basin surface attributes like soil properties land covers geographical properties etc into the budyko framework and produced mathematical expressions table 1 choudhury 1999 fu et al 2007 wang and tang 2014 yang et al 2007 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 with all the available methods selection of an appropriate approach remains a tough task pertaining to the complexity involved in hydrological processes and the methodologies discussed above there is no clear affirmation of a technique on what climate elasticities to consider for impact assessment studies in addition elasticity magnitudes depend on the type of budyko based equation selected for the study performances of these elasticity models with different budyko based equations in context to the intricacy involved within the models have not been examined thus comparing the models and observing the differences in the outcomes would assist in addressing the issues of consideration of appropriate climatic parameters for assessing climatic impacts on runoff generation process in the present study a comparative analysis is carried out to observe the disparities involved in the models discussed above two models are considered involving precipitation and evapotranspiration elasticity herein referred as two parameter model tpm in one case and in the other the evapotranspiration elasticity is extended to five elasticity as was done by wang et al 2016 using the famous fao penman monteith equation herein referred as multi parameter model mpm the tpm is a simple model that incorporates the two key climatic variables as per the mean annual water balance principle to observe the assimilated impact of climate variability the fao penman monteith equation includes all the climatic parameters that influences the evapotranspiration process and thus serve in quantifying separate impacts of these parameters in runoff change in addition to see the disparities involved within the models eight budyko based equations are engaged in the analysis the investigation is carried out over 19 catchments from 11 river basins across india they are selected based on long term continuous data availability note that the budyko equations table 1 are equally appropriate and applicable on all catchments 2 study area and data used 2 1 study area in the present study 19 catchments from 11 major river basins of india are considered the spatial distribution of the catchments along with the locations of their runoff gauging stations are shown in fig 1 the hydro

long term streamflow pattern it has become indispensable to examine the change point or inflection point in the hydro meteorological time series for effective planning and management of the water resources raje 2014 the change point analysis is a powerful technique for identifying the change in the statistical properties in the time series the commonly used change point analysis techniques viz standard normal homogeneity test and wilcoxon s nonparametric rank test provide a single change point over the entire time series however in the present analysis we have used bayesian approach proposed by barry and hartigan 1993 to examine the change point in the annual streamflow unlike the classical approach bayesian analysis provides the probability density function of the change at each point in the time series das and umamahesh 2018b moreover several other advantages of the bayesian approach include i bayesian approach incorporates the uncertainty associated with the data series ii bayesian approach employs the prior distribution of the data and overcomes the shortcomings of the frequentist approach the product partition model proposed by hartigan 1990 is opted to segregate the data into different blocks the model assumes that within the block the observations are independent and identically distributed having a normal distribution with constant mean and variance the prior distribution of the partition probability is updated using markov chain monte carlo mcmc process without affecting the likelihood function and the posterior distribution is obtained using the bayes theorem in the present study the bayesian change point analysis is carried out using the r package bcp and can be downloaded from https cran r project org package bcp 3 2 runoff elasticity 3 2 1 climate elasticity from two parameter model elasticity or sensitivity based methods use coefficients that define the sensitivity of a dependent parameter to variability in the independent parameters sankarasubramanian et al 2001 schaake 1990 an analytical elasticity based method was proposed by arora 2002 using the budyko hypothesis to compute the relative influences of anthropogenic stresses and climatic variability to changes in runoff generation annual scale long term water balance equation of a catchment is defined as 6 p e q δ s here p is precipitation e is actual evapotranspiration q is discharge and δs is the change in water storage all parameters are in annual mean scale budyko hypothesis conceives the idea of long term water balance approximately 10 years or more wu et al 2017 for a catchment and considers the change in water storage to be negligible δs 0 total differentiation of qc i e changes in discharge due to climatic variability is shown as 7 d q c q c p d p q c e 0 d e 0 relative change in runoff is expressed as 8 q c q p p e q c p dp p e 0 p e q c e 0 d e 0 e 0 the coefficients of the relative changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as expressed in the above equation are the elasticity of runoff to p p and e0 e 0 respectively from eq 6 8 and budyko hypothesis the following expressions can be derived for the elasticity of runoff 9 p p e q c p 1 ϕ f ϕ 1 f ϕ e 0 p e q c e 0 ϕ f ϕ 1 f ϕ the sum of elasticity to precipitation and e0 equals 1 substituting eq 9 in eq 8 we get the equation for change in runoff due to variability in climatic parameters i e p and e0 as per the two parameter model 10 d q c q p dp p e 0 d e 0 e 0 3 2 2 climatic elasticity from multi parameter model the widely used fao penman monteith equation is adopted to calculate daily potential evapotranspiration and described as 11 e 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u v p d δ γ 1 0 34 u where δ is the slope of vapour pressure curve kpa 0c 1 rn is net radiation at the surface mj m 2 d 1 g is ground heat flux mj m 2 d 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa 0c 1 t is mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c u is wind speed at 2 m height ms 1 vpd is vapour pressure deficit kpa which is the difference between saturated and actual vapour pressures yang and yang 2011 used 4 climatic parameters i e rn temperature t u relative humidity rh to quantify the impacts on the evapotranspiration process contrary to this due to the dependence of relative humidity on maximum temperature tx minimum temperature tn net radiation n and rh and to see the individual contributions of tx and tn subjected to data availability wang et al 2016 conducted the contribution analysis with five climatic variables namely tx tn u n rh by the use of first order approximation the differential equation of e0 considering all the parameters is stated below as 12 d e 0 e 0 t x d t x e 0 t n d t n e 0 u d u e 0 n d n e 0 r h d r h all the parameters in the above equation are in daily time scale the equation needs to be in annual time scale for further analysis thus variation in annual e0 can be expressed as 13 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 i 1 n e 0 t x d t x i 1 n e 0 t n d t n i 1 n e 0 u d u i 1 n e 0 n d n i 1 n e 0 r h d r h the subscript y denotes the yearly time scale n represents the number of days in a year relative change in e0 y is given by 14 d e 0 y e 0 y 1 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 t x d t x 1 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 t n d t n 1 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 u d u 1 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 n d n 1 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 r h d r h the budyko framework implemented in the climate elasticity method functions in annual time scale to be consistent with the assumption of steady state δs 0 it is necessary to consider multi year time scale annual mean therefore eq 14 can be written as 15 d e 0 y e 0 y 1 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 t x d tx 1 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 t n d tn 1 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 u du 1 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 n dn 1 e 0 y i 1 n e 0 r h d rh here e 0 y tx tn u n and rh are the mean annual potential evapotranspiration maximum temperature minimum temperature wind speed sunshine duration and relative humidity respectively following terms can be re written as 16 e 0 y n e 0 i 1 n e 0 x n e 0 x in the above equation x represents the climatic variables therefore eq 15 can be expressed as 17 d e 0 y e 0 y 1 e 0 e 0 t x d tx 1 e 0 e 0 t n d tn u e 0 e 0 u d u u 1 e 0 e 0 n d n rh e 0 e 0 r h d rh rh to achieve similar expressions of relative change as in eq 10 the following equation can be written as 18 d e 0 e 0 tx 1 d t x tn 1 d t n u 1 du u n 1 d n rh 1 drh rh where tx 1 tn 1 u 1 n 1 and rh 1 represents the evapotranspiration elasticity to maximum temperature minimum temperature wind speed sunshine duration and relative humidity respectively incorporating eq 18 in eq 10 we obtain the expression to quantify the change in discharge due to climatic variability by using multi parameter model the equation is as stated below 19 d q c q p dp p e 0 tx 1 d t x tn 1 d t n u 1 du u n 1 d n rh 1 drh rh the final equation is obtained by combining elasticity of runoff and evapotranspiration as 20 d q c q p dp p tx d t x tn d t n u du u n d n rh drh rh where tx tn u n and rh are the runoff elasticity to maximum temperature minimum temperature wind speed sunshine duration and relative humidity respectively 3 3 attribution analysis from change point analysis non stationarity is defined for the discharge dataset of each catchment considered in the study the time period is divided accordingly into portions and termed as pre assessment and post assessment period it is assumed that the total change in discharge from pre to post assessment period includes both the changes in discharge due to climatic variability and anthropogenic stress as defined below 21 δ q δ q c δ q a where δ q is the total change in discharge δ q c is the change in discharge due to climatic variability and δqa is the change due to anthropogenic stress the study captures the influence of anthropogenic activities as a whole subtly capturing factors that chiefly depend on anthropogenic stress like catchment efficiency also note that additional assessments have not been undertaken to explicitly demonstrate the influence of anthropogenic stress quantifying land use land cover changes since the major objective of the study is to determine the disparities in the models thus from eq 21 δ q a is defined as 22 δ q a δ q δ q c δ q δ q p δ q e 0 where δ q p and δ q e 0 are defined as the changes in discharge due to variability in precipitation and pet respectively this representation is consistent with the hypothesis of tpm in the case of mpm the eq 22 can further be derived as 23 δ q a δ q δ q c δ q δ q p δ q tx δ q tn δ q u δ q n δ q rh where δ q tx δ q tn δ q u δ q n and δ q rh are defined as the changes in discharge due to variability in maximum temperature minimum temperature wind speed sunshine duration and relative humidity respectively 4 results 4 1 trend analysis of hydro meteorological variables the trend analysis of hydro meteorological datasets is carried out to detect the slowly varying monotonic pattern of the hydro meteorological dataset the non parametric mann kendall test is used to identify the trend at 95 confidence level hence the z values outside the bound of 1 96 and 1 96 denote significantly decreasing and increasing trends respectively the z statistics of the trend test for all the hydro meteorological variables in different catchments is presented in fig 2 it can be noted from the figure that out of 19 catchments catchment id 14 and 19 have significantly increasing and decreasing trend for discharge respectively catchment id 12 and 4 have shown a significant rising and declining trend respectively for pet in addition about half of the total catchments show a significantly increasing trend in maximum temperature in the case of minimum temperature only catchment id 8 has registered a significantly decreasing trend moreover no noticeable trend is observed in precipitation and sunshine duration 4 2 change point analysis of runoff data generally the change point analysis is performed using pettitt s test buishand s test and von neumann s test which results in a single change point over the time series however it is to be noted that a minimum of 10 years should be taken as the pre assessment period for the adoption of budyko hypothesis hence to avoid the case of arrival of a change point in a year that is within the first ten years of the study period a bayesian approach is adopted in the case of bayesian change point analysis it is assumed that each point in the data set has likelihood of witnessing a change point the point having higher posterior density value is considered as the change point for the time series in this sense if a change point lies within the initial ten years a point having second highest posterior density is taken and so on in the present study the change point is computed only for the runoff data performing the analysis on other climatic variables and assessing the relationships would definitely shed more light on the results but to explicitly document the runoff changes and see the influences of other factors in it the analysis is performed for streamflow datasets only the changing years correspond to change points are displayed in table 2 as pre and post assessment period it can be noticed from table 2 that seven catchments id 1 4 10 12 13 17 19 have experienced a decrement in runoff generation from pre to post assessment period as shown in fig 2 downward trend is observed in all these catchments except id 13 however decreasing trends in rainfall have not been registered for these catchments except ids 10 and 19 this is attributable to the intricacy of the catchment hydrology heavily interlinked with the anthropogenic activities 4 3 dryness attributes of catchments the dryness index for all the catchments in both the temporal periods pre and post assessment periods are shown in table s1 supplementary information it is seen that only 3 catchments id 10 13 19 have become drier in the post assessment period the spatial distributions of the aridity index for both the periods are shown in fig s1 supplementary information most of the catchments in the southern and central part of india have shown higher aridity index in both the periods it ranged from 1 152 id 3 anandapur to 3 039 id 14 singavaram with a mean value of 1 915 in the pre assessment period the values decreased in the post assessment period having ranged between 1 078 id 3 anandapur and 3 004 id 14 singavaram with a mean value of 1 818 highest negative changes from pre to post assessment periods more wet have been observed in all the catchments of western and a few from the southern part of india in addition a significant relationship is observed between absolute change in aridity index from pre to post assessment period and aridity index during the pre assessment period when we considered 17 catchments out of 19 r 0 663 p 0 01 fig 3 a the relationship appeared stronger when we considered only those catchments that became wetter in the post assessment period r 0 765 p 0 01 fig 3 b this indicates that catchments with higher aridity index in pre assessment period became wetter in the post assessment period 4 4 two parameter model 4 4 1 elasticities as stated above the two parameters that determine the variability in runoff generation as per the two parameter model are pet and precipitation the mean runoff elasticities to pet e 0 and p p are calculated and their spatial distributions are shown in fig 4 a for all the catchments e 0 is negative and thus implying that the change in runoff is negatively correlated with the variability in pet e 0 ranged from 1 051 id 3 to 2 071 id 18 with an average value of 1 451 the catchments in the southern part of india have shown lesser values of e 0 and higher values are observed in catchments in the central eastern and western part of india furthermore p is positive for all the catchments and varied between 3 071 id 18 to 2 051 id 3 with an average of 2 451 in addition the absolute value of e 0 is less than p for all catchments considered in the study indicating that runoff change is more sensitive to variability in precipitation than pet the spatial discrepancy of p is oppositely similar to e 0 due to the relationship between the two elasticities i e the sum of the elasticities equals 1 consistent with the two parameter model 4 4 2 quantitative characteristics of runoff change the contributions of climatic variability to runoff changes for all the catchments are quantified using the attribution analysis with the elasticities calculate as per tpm table s2 it is observed that 8 catchments id 3 6 7 9 10 11 15 16 are having the highest contributions of climatic variability a similar result is observed for anthropogenic contributions eight catchments id 1 4 8 12 13 14 17 and 18 have shown highest contributions from anthropogenic stress table not shown within climatic variability it is observed that contributions from precipitation are more than that of pet for all catchments except thammavaram id 17 table s3 and s4 negative contributions in some of the catchments id 4 12 17 indicate that the direction of total change in runoff and that of change caused due to climatic variability is opposite to each other if runoff has decreased then climatic variability has increased it from pre assessment to post assessment period and vice versa it can be observed that in some catchments id 4 7 9 12 16 the percentage contribution values are more than 100 table s2 it means that the change in runoff caused due to climatic variability is more than the actual runoff change observed for the catchments during the study period furthermore contributions from 2 budyko equations suggested by zhang et al 2001 and wang and tang 2014 were not quantified for one catchment pathagudem id 11 following the position of its evaporative index aet p in the proximity of the suggested values by the lower limits of the budyko curves almost on the curve where catchment parameter w 0 in budyko equation given by zhang et al 2001 and 0 in equation given by wang and tang 2014 this generally happens due to underestimation of aet calculated as p q these underestimations of aet may have resulted from considering runoffs generated from sources other than precipitation sinha et al 2018 one of the possible sources is the irrigation water that may percolate and join the base flow and comes into the considerations of total runoff the percentage contributions obtained from all the eight budyko equations are different from each other this discrepancy has been discussed in section 5 for further analysis their averages are considered as there is no irregularity in the sign of contributions for each catchment the highest climatic contribution is seen for jaraikela id 7 with a value of 283 028 and the lowest is 282 277 for sarati id 12 the spatial disparity of climatic and anthropogenic contributions is shown in fig 5 a it is to be noted that the spatial variations for both the influencers are similar but opposite in nature as the sum of the changes become 100 the climatic variability over catchments in the western part of india have contributed negatively moreover catchments in the central southern and eastern part of india have shown low climatic contributions in addition the catchments in the western part of india have shown high negative contributions of precipitation pet contributions are very low compared to precipitation table s3 and s4 it is maximum in catchment jaraikela id 7 with a value of 59 890 furthermore it can be noted that there are considerable differences in the contribution values for the same river basins fig 5 a this is due to the significant variabilities in the precipitation and pet values within the same basins for different catchments as can be observed from table 2 4 5 multi parameter model 4 5 1 elasticities mpm deals with parameters that influence the evapotranspiration process therefore in this model the evapotranspiration elasticities to five climatic parameters tx tn u n and rh are calculated and then combined with the runoff elasticity to evapotranspiration to obtain the sensitivity of runoff to the five climatic parameters the mean values range of tx tn u n and rh are 0 028 0 015 id 13 to 0 061 id 16 0 017 0 010 id13 to 0 035 id 16 0 297 0 469 id 19 to 0 071 id 12 0 051 0 083 id 18 to 0 038 id 11 0 711 0 321 id 13 to 1 591 id 16 respectively it is observed that wind speed and sunshine duration are negatively correlated with runoff change moreover changes in runoff are more sensitive to variability in relative humidity for most of the catchments considered for the study compared to the elasticity of runoff to evapotranspiration from tpm the elasticities of runoff to five parameters in mpm are less this may be due to further decomposition of the evapotranspiration variable that resulted in lowering the sensitivity of runoff change to individual climatic variables fig 4 b f shows the spatial variation of the elasticities the runoff elasticity to maximum temperature minimum temperature and relative humidity have shown similar spatial trait with higher values in the western and southern part of india catchments in the central part of india have shown lower elasticity values to wind speed compared to other catchments unlike other elasticities in the case of runoff elasticities to sunshine duration the values are found to be higher in the central and eastern part of india 4 5 2 quantitative characteristics of runoff change the contributions of climatic parameters to runoff change considered following decomposition of the evapotranspiration are quantified using the mpm in the climate elasticity method it is seen that n is having the highest contributions to runoff changes among the five parameters in 14 catchments with u having their highest influence in 4 catchments id 5 6 7 and 10 sunshine duration and u ranged from 13 765 id 9 kotni to 33 238 id 4 cholachguda and 60 716 id 7 jaraikela to 8 037 id 10 p g bridge respectively maximum temperature having a range from 14 226 id 7 jaraikela to 7 798 id 12 sarati has shown the highest influence in catchment sarati id 12 it has also been noticed that between tx and tn tx has higher contributions to runoff changes in 15 catchments leaving the rest 5 catchments id 3 8 9 16 and 18 with higher influence from tn this shows the importance of separating the temperature variable to tx and tn minimum temperature has the highest contribution of 4 008 in t k halli id 16 and lowest of 1 497 in kashinagar id 8 moreover rh ranged between 9 941 id 7 jaraikela to 11 094 id 19 zari the above outcomes are documented in tables s5 s9 as discussed before in the study 8 budyko equations are incorporated to quantify contributions and therefore it yields discrepancies within the model outputs these differences are discussed in section 5 for analysis average contributions are considered due to consistency in the sign of the contribution values the spatial variations of the contribution values are shown in fig 5 b f it is observed that tx in catchments in the western and a few in the central and eastern part of india have contributed negatively to runoff changes a similar trend is observed in the case of tn with higher contributions in the southern part of india u has contributed positively in most of the catchments of the southern and eastern part of india furthermore most of the catchments in the central and eastern part of india are having positive influences of n to runoff variations rh has contributed negatively in most of the catchments in the eastern part of india similar to the results from tpm differences in the results for catchments of same basins are solely due to variabilities in the climatic variables within the river basins 5 discussions 5 1 intra model disparity in the study eight budyko based equations are employed for the quantification of percentage contributions of climatic variables and anthropogenic stressors to runoff changes from pre assessment to post assessment period the results obtained from the study shows disparity among themselves fig 6 depicts the discrepancy in the climatic contributions obtained from the budyko equations pet contributions in the case of mpm mean the summation of all the five contributions tx tn u n and rh table 1 shows the four non parametric and parametric budyko equations incorporated in the study the disparity may have risen from the different approaches with which the equations were developed using the hydro meteorological variables moreover the contributions from parametric and non parametric equations form clusters this is due to the incorporation of catchment characteristics like soil properties land cover etc into the budyko hypothesis for parametric equations that may upsurge the possibilities of these equations to replicate the hydrological processes at catchment scale in this section the disparity within the models due to incorporation of eight budyko based equations is discussed since contributions from climatic parameters that influences evapotranspiration process are quantified with the mpm to maintain uniformity disparities in percentage contributions from pet calculated using tpm is analysed in tpm highest range of contribution values is seen in jaraikela id 7 standard deviations of contributions are obtained and shown in fig 7 a three catchments ids 7 11 19 are having high standard deviation furthermore difference in the average percentage contributions from parametric and non parametric equations are calculated and is termed as d it is observed that the slope of the trend line has reduced near to aridity index 1 965 when plotted between summation of d and summation of pre assessment aridity index fig 7 b it signifies that the rate of change of d per unit change in pre assessment aridity index has reduced after the aridity index value 1 965 this may be the reason for higher inconsistency in the contributions for two catchments out of three ids 7 and 11 with pre assessment aridity index 1 436 and 1 507 respectively fig 7 a similar observations are seen in the case of mpm jaraikela id 7 has the highest standard deviation fig 7 a in addition the slope of the trend line has decreased from pre assessment aridity index 1 679 when plotted between summation of d and summation of pre assessment aridity index as shown in fig 7 c it explains the higher discrepancy in the percentage contributions of two ids 1 7 out of three catchments ids 1 7 19 that showed high value of standard deviation fig 7 a 5 2 inter model disparity one of the key objectives of our study is to evaluate the differences between the tpm and mpm the differences in contributions values emerged from the disintegration of the evapotranspiration elasticity into five climatic elasticities to discuss this disparity pet contributions are considered for both the cases and plotted as shown in the fig 8 a a significant and strong linear relationship is observed between pet contributions from both the models r 0 761 p 0 01 quadrant 2 and 4 denote the state where both the models produced contradictory results one method showing positive and the other showing negative contributions six out of 19 catchments ids 3 8 10 11 12 and 15 have shown inconsistent results a possible explanation is the propagation of errors due to incorporation of more climatic parameters into the framework in addition as discussed above adding more variables may contribute to explaining the differences and improve the framework further although the contribution values are near to the 1 1 line green line few catchments have shown significant deviation from the line shown with red markers these deviations are due to disproportionate performance of the mpm as mentioned above about the parameter d it is detected that the change in the slope of the trend lines shown with blue and red colours are more in the case of mpm δsmpm 3 980 and δstpm 3 533 with an early occurrence of the change point φmpm 1 679 and φtpm 1 965 therefore the likelihood of occurrence of higher inconsistency within the budyko based equations is more in mpm compared to tpm moreover it can be seen from fig 7 a that in 13 catchments ids 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 14 15 17 18 19 standard deviation is more when multi parameter model is conducted which is also evident from fig 6 these suggest the instability in the performance of multi parameter model that eventually may lead to erroneous predictions of the impacts of climatic and anthropogenic influences on runoff changes to acquire a wider interpretation of the present study the differences in the influence of climatic variability and anthropogenic stress on runoff change when performed using two different models are further observed note that the impact from climatic variability includes the influences of precipitation same in both the model and evapotranspiration summation of five climatic parameters for mpm the percentage climatic contributions from both the models are plotted and shown in fig 8 b a very strong and significant linear correlation is observed between the two models r 0 99 p 0 01 it showcases confidence in the derivation of elasticities using the theoretical arrangement however separating the pet variable into five climatic components may increase the chances of error propagation into the derived framework contradictory results have been observed in catchment id 1 it is seen that d is higher in 12 catchments ids 1 4 6 8 9 12 17 for the case of mpm fig 8 c in addition fig 8 d f show the standard deviation of percentage contributions of climatic variability when four non parametric four parametric and all budyko equations are considered respectively it is higher in 12 catchments non parametric ids 1 4 6 8 9 12 17 parametric ids 1 4 6 8 9 12 17 all ids 1 4 6 8 9 12 17 for multi parameter model compared to two parameter model for all the three cases these clearly implies that there is a greater inconsistency in percentage contribution values from multi parameter model 5 3 applicability of the models the present study highlights the differences in the performance of two and multi parameter models mpm includes more climatic elasticities initiated from extending the evapotranspiration elasticity elasticities explain the sensitivity of a parameter to disturbances in its surroundings the elasticity concept was first introduced by schaake 1990 till now the elasticity theory is extended to precipitation and five evaporation related parameters tx tn u n rh that unfolds the correlation of solar radiation with temperature and relative humidity wang et al 2016 although the decomposition of the evapotranspiration elasticity seems to be judicious the results project a dissimilar sight higher inconsistency is obtained both within the model among eight budyko equations and compared to tpm while conducting contribution analysis using mpm moreover wang et al 2016 has also documented the instability in the presentation of multi parameter model while comparing the computed total runoff change with the observed runoff values the present study utilised the six runoff elasticities precipitation and evaporation related to determine the influence of variation in climatic variables to changes in runoff generation there is a possibility of occurrence of more runoff elasticity that could better explain the impact and minimise the variations between the two models thus it is not invalid to say that the use of multi parameter model should be restricted to only when evaluation of the influence of individual climatic parameters is the main goal considering climatic influence as a whole seems promising to quantify the impact of climatic variability to hydrology at catchment scale using tpm 5 4 uncertainty in the analysis in these kinds of studies of impact assessment many sources of uncertainties are involved during the quantification of contributions using two parameter model climatic variability and anthropogenic stress are considered to be independent of each other in real world both the elements hold a very intricate relationship between them wu et al 2017 zeng et al 2015 they work together collectively in a hydrological system and are complementary to each other during the implementation of budyko hypothesis in the climate elasticity method the water storage was considered to be negligible in the mean annual water balance it highly depends on the physiographical land surface and soil properties of a catchment there is no such firm evidence to ascertain this assumption wu et al 2017 furthermore change in runoff due to climatic variability is calculated by ignoring the higher orders in taylor expansions therefore considering first order expansion of runoff change may introduce error in the framework h yang et al 2014 thirdly during the quantification of runoff elasticity the catchment parameters 4 parametric budyko equations are kept unchanged throughout the temporal range of analysis for each catchment catchment parameters define the surface and soil attributes that are subjected to alterations due to anthropogenic surface and sub surface water withdrawals construction of hydraulic structures and climatic factors consideration of these issues ensures the natural flow conditions the present study captured the prime characteristics of the precipitation partitioning process by taking the mean annual values of the catchment parameters budyko hypothesis incorporating catchment parameter as a variable and quantifying runoff elasticity to catchment parameter would further enhance the results of contribution analysis as the framework works on mean annual water balance it considers only the temporal changes of mean values sometimes temporal variabilities may occur in variables with mean remaining almost similar which may be addressed by considering anomalies in the variables this calls for further research works on anomalies to see the changes in the temporal variabilities moreover human errors in collection of observed datasets add more sources of uncertainty in the study 6 conclusions it is vital to isolate and understand the relative contributions from the naturally induced and human induced forcings to runoff variability the elasticity based method presents a simple framework and thus widely used to differentiate the impacts of changing environment on runoff climatic elasticity of runoff generation assists in examining the sensitivity of the streamflow to the change in different meteorological variables the present study demonstrated a comparative assessment using budyko based equations on performance of two models that differs in the incorporation of number of climatic parameters into the climate elasticity framework higher inconsistency in relative contributions to changing runoff is observed in the multi parameter model that designates a degrading effect of decomposition of evapotranspiration into five climatic parameters in addition possibility of occurrence of considerable inconsistency in multi parameter model is more compared to two parameter model thus it can be inferred that two parameter model works well for the case of calculating the influence of climatic variability all together decomposing the evapotranspiration elasticity totally depends on the nature and purpose of plans and policies similar conclusions on extending the climatic elasticities have been noticed in previous studies our results suggest that the selection of the method based on budyko hypothesis budyko based equations should be done cautiously while quantifying the impacts of changing parameters which would ultimately help to formulate sustainable management and effective adaptation strategies author contributions jhilam sinha and jew das conceived the idea and performed

5887,long term skillful prediction of prolonged hydrologic anomalies is essential for proper planning to reduce the societal risk of extreme hydrological anomalies such as drought climate indices estimated from sea surface temperature anomalies ssta of the pacific and indian oceans are often used to predict monthly and seasonal rainfall in australia and many other places around the world this study investigates the merit of distorting the time aggregation of such indices before casting them in a predictive model aggregated climate indices are used to predict sustained drought and wet anomalies characterised here using a drought index i e standardize precipitation index spi as response and the australia as the study region of interest the aim is to enhance the strength of relationships of drought index and climate indices predictors by tuning the frequency of climate predictors using an aggregation technique result shows that aggregated climate indices provide significant improvement in prediction of spi over raw climate indices across australia as strong spatial variations in optimum aggregation window lengths are evident across australia suggesting multiple candidate predictive models with similar accuracies a model combination approach is also adopted model combination is found useful in reducing structural uncertainty and further improving the prediction efficiency given that the improved predictive accuracy for ssta the current generation of climate models exhibit the methodology developed in this study has significant implications for skillful prediction and projection of long term droughts keywords standardized precipitation index aggregated climate indices model combination uncertainty 1 introduction sustainable management of water resource systems requires skillful prediction of extended precipitation anomalies for water resource planning and allocation some of the important drivers of extended precipitation anomalies in australia are related to key modes of the pacific and indian oceans khan et al 2015 kirono et al 2010 risbey et al 2009 rogers and beringer 2017 tozer et al 2017 westra and sharma 2010 the influence of these climate indices is strong enough to also affect long term drought dijk et al 2013 ummenhofer et al 2009 with the climate teleconnections particularly strong at interannual and interdecadal frequencies özger et al 2009 the influence of el niño southern oscillation enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo indian ocean dipole iod and the subtropical ridge str on australian rainfall variability are well documented cai and cowan 2013 kirono et al 2010 murphy and timbal 2008 in australia typically la niña and el niño are associated with drier and wetter than the normal conditions respectively for southern australia iod has greater influence than enso during winter and spring rainfall as a result of the strong covariation between enso and the iod cai et al 2011 interannual variability of droughts over large part of australia is linked to the co occurrence of an el niño and a positive iod event whereas lower frequency variability such as multi year drought have iod as the dominating influence risbey et al 2009 ummenhofer et al 2009 ummenhofer et al 2011 this indicates that ssta based climate indices have potential in predicting droughts in australia among different approaches used for prediction of sustained droughts models with large scale climate indices is most common as their relationships with sustained droughts are reasonable awan and bae 2016 ren et al 2016 vicente serrano et al 2011 however variability and plausible teleconnections between droughts and large scale climate indices are different for different temporal scales özger et al 2009 for example occurrence of long term droughts is dominated by the multi year to decadal oscillations of climate indices dijk et al 2013 therefore identify most useful time scales of climate indices by optimizing the relationships with droughts is crucial to improve drought prediction out of different modelling techniques used for drought prediction non parametric data driven models become popular in the recent time anshuka et al 2019 fung et al 2019 many drought indices have been developed to represent sustained drought and wet anomalies mishra and singh 2010 among those standardized precipitation index spi is the most widely used index due to its simplicity in formulation and application spi can be compared across different locations due to its transformation to a standard normal distribution spi can be used to estimate drought and wet anomalies at different time scales while spi estimated at shorter time scales e g 3 and 6 month represent short term droughts i e meteorological droughts spi estimated at longer time scales e g 12 and 36 month is capable to capture long term droughts i e hydrological droughts li et al 2016 in australia and many other places of the world the droughts of most concern for water resource management occur over year to multi year periods and are often quantified with spi at longer time scales dijk et al 2013 sheffield and wood 2007 we hypothesise here that a predictive model for drought does not necessarily need to use ssta predictors at the same time scale as the drought response of interest or one may need a modulation of the ssta predictors to a different temporal scale to assist in the formulation of the best predictive model such a modulation is proposed here by means of aggregating the predictor variables over variable length time scales of interest while such aggregated predictors have been used before in formulating downscaling and other predictive models mehrotra and sharma 2006 their use in a seasonal forecasting context has not been attempted to understand the relationships at these longer time scales methods that emphasise or filter the low frequency components of the climate indices could be therefore useful to predict long term drought and wet conditions temporal aggregation is a simple way to filter the different frequency components of a time series wavelet transforms also often used to filter the signals at different frequency bands to use in model development he et al 2014 rashid et al 2015a rashid et al 2015c rashid et al 2018 temporal aggregation of climate indices has been used to forecast seasonal rainfall kirono et al 2010 standardized streamflow seibert et al 2017 and to identify teleconnections with rainfall anomalies dijk et al 2013 shi et al 2016 however the application of temporally aggregated climate indices in a modelling framework to predict long term sustained drought and wet anomalies has not been explored here we investigate using filtered relationships of climate indicators to predict a drought index the aim is to maximize the strength of relationships between the drought index and climate indices by smoothing climate indices time series using temporal aggregation in this study we develop a modelling framework where low frequency components of climate indices obtained through temporal aggregation were used as predictor in the k nearest neighbor knn to predict sustained drought and wet anomalies directly projecting future drought and wet anomalies from gcm simulated precipitation is questionable due to the limited ability of these models to correctly simulate the low frequency variability of precipitation while bias correction through nesting at different time scales can go some way towards correcting low frequency biases johnson and sharma 2011 mehrotra and sharma 2016 there are questions about the assumed stationarity of these biases nahar et al 2017 in contrast developing a framework to project spi from sea surface temperature sst is promising because of the skill of gcms in predicting sea surface temperature sst especially over the tropical indian and pacific ocean song et al 2014 wang et al 2015 in addition sst predictions may be further improved using multi modal combination kaiser khan et al 2014 using predicted ssts to derive the spi hence can offer advantages when compared to the use of gcm simulated rainfall directly thus this study provides a new approach that may improve future drought projections because the teleconnections of australian rainfall and drought with the different climate indices varies strongly over space and time rashid and beecham 2019a rashid and beecham 2019b risbey et al 2009 tozer et al 2017 there may be value in developing alternate models with different predictor sets the advantage of this approach is that an ensemble of the multiple models can be used which has been shown to provide better predictions on average than a single individual model a second advantage of a multi model ensemble is that it can improve our understanding of the uncertainty of the predictions of sustained drought and wet anomalies it also circumvents the need to select a best model from the set of alternate models hagedorn et al 2005 sharma and chowdhury 2011 in this study a multi model combination approach is used to make predictions of long term drought and wet conditions obtained from alternate models 2 data observed monthly gridded precipitation data from the australian water availability project awap have been used to estimate the drought response variable used in this study the rainfall data was re gridded to a spatial resolution of 0 5 using area averaging grid cells with zero rainfall for more than thirty percent of the data length were not considered for the analysis these grid cells are located in central and western desert of australia and coincide with the area identified by jones et al 2009 where gridded precipitation is unreliable due to the sparse gauge network while there are several climate indices which have significant influence on australian rainfall dijk et al 2013 tozer et al 2017 this study uses niño3 4 and dmi to predict spi to simplify the presentation niño3 4 represents the sea surface temperature anomalies ssta over the pacific ocean and is the leading mode of the el niño southern oscillation enso dmi represents the ssta over the indian ocean saji et al 1999 when combined enso and dmi are capable of explaining the variability of sustained rainfall anomalies across australia cai et al 2011 fierro and leslie 2013 ummenhofer et al 2011 niño3 4 and dmi are derived from monthly sea surface temperature values of hadley centre global ice and sea surface temperature hadisst datasets rayner et al 2003 for the period 1910 2010 table 1 3 methods 3 1 standardized precipitation index spi the most widely used drought index is the standardized precipitation index spi which can be estimated from precipitation data alone mckee et al 1995 the advantages the spi are that it can be estimated for any time scale of interest and it is comparable across different locations because of the transformation to a standard normal distribution spi is classically estimated by fitting a gamma distribution to the aggregated rainfall at different time scales and then transforming this to a normal distribution guttman 1999 a range of other distributions have been recommended angelidis et al 2012 naresh kumar et al 2009 due to issues with fitting the gamma distribution in areas with extremely low or high rainfall non parametric distributions have also been proposed for spi farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 to overcome the fitting issues the parametric spi method is sensitive to the choice of probability distribution and its parameters particularly when applied over large areas with a wide range of different climatic conditions the non parametric spi approach minimizes this issue because of the range of climate conditions across australia and variety of precipitation distributions the spi is estimated here using the non parametric method proposed by farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 3 2 aggregated climate indices the aim of this study is to assess whether the spi can be better predicted using a multi model ensemble with temporally aggregated climate indices as predictors to isolate the most important signals present in these climate indices ci we have considered eighty temporal windows to aggregate the indices using a simple backwards moving average for example considering an aggregation window of l months awl the aggregated climate index time series acil is estimated as 1 aci t l t t t l c i the aci are the potential predictors for spi and with l aggregation windows and two climate indices the model can be formulated using a total of 2l predictor time series the process of selecting a subset of predictors to use in the multi model ensemble is discussed in the next section 3 3 predictor selection and model formulation framework one of our objectives is to develop a range of models to use in the multi model ensemble to maximise the effectiveness of the ensemble it is desirable for predictors of each of the models to be as different as possible from each other sharma and chowdhury 2011 predictors of interest are identified from the pool of predictors variables i e the time series of aggregated climate indices using a nonparametric approach based on partial information correlation pic sharma and mehrotra 2014 pic is a measure of conditional dependence and similar to partial correlation in general the pic framework can be used to select predictors for a model by comparing the information in the predictors to the response and is flexible enough to also consider additional pre selected predictors that are presumed important from a physical perspective here pic has been used to maximise the additional information provided by each predictor equivalent to choosing new predictors with the smallest partial information correlation with a predictor that has previously been selected a comprehensive flowchart of the proposed method for multimodal prediction of spi is presented in fig 1 and further details are presented below let the general form of the predictive model be 2 y t y t a t i b t i where y t is the response variable i e spi at a specified time scale and a t i and b t i are the two predictors for the model named order 1 and order 2 predictors respectively both of which are aggregated climate indices for different aggregation periods for clarity we have restricted our study to four predictive models thus a t 1 a t 2 a t 3 and a t 4 are the four order 1 predictors and b t 1 b t 2 b t 3 and b t 4 are the four order 2 predictors each of the four models is constructed using a k nearest neighbor knn regression approach based on partial weights pw to predict spi sharma and mehrotra 2014 we have used the nonparametric prediction npred r package for the analysis sharma et al 2016 additionally a reference model is developed following the same method where raw climate indices are used as predictor instead of aggregated climate indices the procedure of model fitting was kept the same to enable a fair comparison between two models for example at any grid location we have considered spi and non aggregated raw niño3 4 and dmi time series to estimate pw and then predict spi using regression based knn model based on estimated pw as our hypothesis is that the aggregated climate indices better represent the spi variability compare to the raw climate indices the reference model with raw climate indices as predictor is appropriate the multi model ensemble can be constructed using simple averaging of the ensemble members hagedorn et al 2005 rashid et al 2015b or by optimizing the weights to maximize predictive skill rajagopalan et al 2002 robertson et al 2004 or estimating the weights conditioned to dominant predictors chowdhury and sharma 2011 devineni and sankarasubramanian 2010 weights can be static or temporally dynamic chowdhury and sharma 2009 kaiser khan et al 2014 here the multi model combination is obtained as the weighted sum of each individual model prediction the optimum weights for each model are estimated from the error variance covariance matrix kaiser khan et al 2014 3 4 model implementation details using the framework presented in the previous section and fig 1 predictions of the 12 month and 36 month spi are made at each grid location across australia for the period from 1910 to 2010 using the aggregated time series of niño3 4 and dmi as the predictors for each location and spi time scale 12 month or 36 month the following steps are required to select the significant predictors and formulate the four models used 1 the order 1 predictors are selected from aggregated climate indices using pic a partial information analyses is undertaken using observed spi as the response and all potential aggregated climate indices as predictors the predictor with maximum pic is chosen as the order 1 predictor for the first model a1 a number of additional predictors a 1 c representing candidate predictors for the other three models considered are also identified 2 the order 1 predictor for the second model is then selected by using a1 as the response and remaining predictors in a 1 c using partial information analysis the predictor with the lowest pic is now chosen to be the order 1 predictor for the second model a2 this ensures that a2 has the minimum correlation with a1 while still being strongly related to the response it is thus assumed that using this additional predictor to form a new model will result in a predictive model that is structurally different to the model formulated earlier 3 to select the order 1 predictor for the third model a1 and a2 are excluded from the predictor set and a new predictor a3 chosen from a 1 c the partial information analysis now uses a1 as the response and a2 as a pre existing predictor and the predictor with the lowest pic from the remaining aggregated climate indices is then chosen as the third order 1 predictor a3 this process is then repeated to ascertain the fourth order 1 predictor to form the predictors a1 to a4 while we have restricted our study to four models the number of models could be expanded by repeating step 1 to 4 but considering the remaining potential aggregated climate indices as predictors once the order 1 predictors have been selected for each model the order 2 predictors are then added this proceeds in the same way as step 3 above for each model the partial information analysis now uses spi as the response with remaining candidate predictors as the potential predictors excluding the four order 1 predictors already selected for each model the order 1 predictor associated is the pre existing predictor for pic the predictor with the highest pic is now chosen as the order 2 predictor for that model readers are referred to sharma and chowdhury 2011 for additional details about this approach to construct the multi model average a model combination weight is estimated the approach of kaiser khan et al 2014 and khan et al 2017 has been used this involves calculating the residuals for each of the four models and estimating their error covariance matrix with four models m 4 the size of the error covariance matrix is 4 4 with the diagonals representing the error variance of each model and the off diagonals the covariance of the errors between the models the weights for each model are calculated using equation 3 and are static in time 3 w v e 1 1 e 1 v where v is a m x 1 dimensional column vector of ones and e is the covariance matrix of prediction errors to ensure that the multi model prediction is unbiased we add additional constraints that the individual model weights add up to 1 and all weights are greater than zero the multi model prediction mm at each time step is then the weighted sum of the predictions from the four models at the same time step as per equation 4 4 y t mm i 1 4 w i y t i where y t y t 1 y t 2 y t 3 a n d y t 4 are the spi time series predicted from four models where t varies from 1 to n the total number data points in the spi series and w w 1 w 2 w 3 a n d w 4 are the optimum weights for each model 3 5 assessment of model skill the performance of the proposed model is assessed using a cross validation approach where available 100 years of data record is divided into ten subsets consisting of 10 years long non overlapping series each subset is used as a validation and the remaining 90 year period used for calibration a reference model is also formulated that does not consider the aggregated predictor variables used in the modelling framework described earlier the mean square error mse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse are used as a measure of prediction skill for all four individual models the multi model ensemble and the reference model the improvement in the multi model prediction is estimated in term of the relative differences in mse and nse between the multi model and reference model 4 results 4 1 importance of temporal aggregation our hypothesis is that by temporally aggregating climate indices their strength as potential predictors of sustained drought and wet anomalies can be improved as a proof of this concept simple regression models are constructed to predict spi firstly using each climate index as a predictor the improvements in this base model by using an aggregated climate index are then measured using the mean square error mse for the purpose of illustrating the worth of using time aggregated predictor variables an aggregation period l of 80 is used this implies that predictors are selected from a set of 80 possible variables for both order 1 and 2 predictors for each individual model fig 2 shows the mses obtained from the reference model and models with aggregated climate indices at different aggregation windows for 12 month and 36 month spi at a randomly selected single location in validation the models with aggregated climate indices provide consistently lower mses for each selected climate indices compared to the reference models the blue curve in fig 2 demonstrates that the temporal aggregation of climate indices improves the model efficiency i e decreases mses up to an optimal window length when the mse is the smallest when aggregations longer than the optimum are used the model error increases and in some cases becomes larger than the base model the optimum window length varies with the climate drivers and time scale of the spi response there is strong regional variability in the optimal window across australia fig 3 over eastern australian there is a north south gradient with longer optimum lengths in the north for niño3 4 the length of the optimum aggregation windows over eastern australia varies from 5 to 20 months and 30 to 50 months for the 12 month and 36 month spi respectively in western australia an east west gradient to longer optimum windows is observed for niño3 4 for both the 12 month and 36 month spi the relationship between dmi and spi is strengthened when comparatively long windows are used 60 to 80 months for both 12 month and 36 month spi areas with these multi year to almost decadal optimum windows include the far inland of new south wales south australia and northern australia other parts of the country e g north east coast southern australia and tasmania are dominated by sub annual to annual variability of dmi when predicting the 12 month spi for longer droughts the length of the optimum aggregation windows increases from 30 to 40 months over the north east coast south east coast and tasmania up to 50 to 70 months in the remainder of the country the regional variability evident in the optimum windows suggests that not one single model to predict spi will be successful 4 2 prediction of sustained drought and wet anomalies with aggregated climate indices using the temporally aggregated climate indices as predictors we developed multiple models using the framework described in 2 4 these models are compared to a reference model which uses unsmoothed climate indices as predictors to illustrate the method in depth the results from four grid cells are first presented followed by summary results across australia the prediction errors mse and model efficiency nse for spi from each of the four constituent models m1 m2 m3 and m4 the multi model ensemble mm and the reference model at the four selected grid locations are listed in table 2 the order 1 and order 2 predictors for each constituent model are also listed the value of temporally aggregating climate indices is clear with all four constituent models outperforming the reference model at each location for both the 12 month and 36 month spi scatter plots of spi predicted by the multi model ensemble and reference model against the observed spi along with their corresponding correlation coefficient as shown in figs s1 and s2 of the supporting document further demonstrate the superiority of using temporally aggregated climate indices to predict 12 month and 36 month spi it should be noted that the results presented here and elsewhere in the document all represent cross validation performances and hence improvements in one versus the other are statistically significant the multi model approach allows the uncertainty in the spi predictions originating from the choice of predictor variable to be explored at each grid location each of the four models performs quite differently illustrating the influence of different predictors and different aggregation windows on the spi this also illustrates the uncertainty in the predictive model being formulated a scenario that is known to be benefitted through model combination further improvements are obtained when model combination is applied the multi model prediction by combining multiple models with optimized weights reduces predictive uncertainty and improves the skill compared to any single model prediction the multi model approach allows for the interactions between the climate indices at a range of time scales to be incorporated into the predictions whilst still maintaining very simple model structures the relative improvement offered by the multi model prediction of spi is different at the four selected grid locations which is not surprising given the regionally variable relationships between sustained rainfall anomalies and climate indices dijk et al 2013 king et al 2013 kirono et al 2010 the predictions from the multi model ensemble compared to the observations and the reference model are shown in fig 4 where density plots are used to summarise the distribution of spi predictions in all four locations fig s3 in the supporting document the simple reference model consistently underestimates the frequency of droughts and wet periods with larger values of spi i e spi 1 and spi 1 respectively with the consequence that predictions of neutral conditions i e 0 5 spi 0 5 occurs too frequently this is because of the inability of reference model to adequately capture the long term variability of the observed spi series in contrast the smoothing and isolation of important frequencies through the temporal aggregation means that the multi model has much more skill in representing severe to extreme drought and wet conditions which are important for water resource management in general the improvements from the multi model ensemble are larger for the 36 month spi compared to 12 month spi this is because the smoothed version of the climate index time series is more valuable in representing the longer drought compared to the 12 month spi the multi model estimates do not capture the full range of observed spi values with the probability of events with an absolute value of spi more than 2 being underestimated further a probability density function pdf based skill score perkins et al 2007 which measure the similarity between two pdfs is used to quantify the improvement in spi prediction this metric measures the common area between two pdfs by summing the minimum value of two distributions for different bins skill scores are estimated for both reference and multi model spi predictions against the observation at each grid locations across australia fig 5 shows the relative improvement of skill score for multi model prediction compare to the reference model multi model prediction of spi provides improvement in skill score at varying magnitude compare to the reference model in approximately 95 grid locations the average improvement of skill score is 23 and 28 for 12 month and 36 month spi respectively across australia the improved skill for four selected locations g1 to g4 were estimated as 5 11 17 and 22 for 12 month spi and 12 16 28 and 41 for 36 month spi extending the analysis to all of australia reduction of errors in the spi predictions are observed in almost all locations fig 6 for both the 12 month and 36 month spi the average reduction in mae is 44 and 54 for 12 month and 36 month spi respectively consistent with the results for the 4 sample locations larger reductions are obtained for 36 month spi because as discussed earlier the temporal aggregation of the climate indices better reflects the smoother spi at this time scale for example greater than 50 reduction of error in spi prediction is observed in 881 grid locations for 12 month spi whereas the count is 1705 grid locations for 36 month spi there is substantial spatial structure to the improvements offered by the multi model ensemble the largest improvements are evident over the arid inland of south australia northern australia and western australia rainfall over this region is highly persistent rocheta et al 2014 which leads to more memory in spi time series a similar spatial pattern of improvement is observed for pdf skill score as well fig 5 thus the aggregated climate indices can represent the memory better through the smoothing of the aggregation process this provides more skill in the predictions consistent with the results in fig 3 finally model performance of reproducing drought characteristics was assessed first drought events i e spi values is continuously lower than 1 at least for 2 months were identified from the observed and modelled spi series drought characteristics such as severity sum of spi values of each drought events duration i e average of duration of each drought events and peak average of largest negative values of spi of each drought events were estimated for each event and averaged drought frequency is the total number of drought events over the period 1910 2010 fig 7 shows the scatter plots of observed and modelled reference model and multi model ensemble drought characteristics at each grid location across australia results show a clear improvement when spi is modelled with temporally aggregated climate indices instead of raw climate indices however both models showed less skill for the grid locations with relatively longer and highly intense droughts generally in the central arid region of australia although the multi model ensemble still perform better than the reference model 5 discussion one of the important sources of uncertainty in any modelling study is the input data or predictors this uncertainty is introduced partially by the choice of which subset of predictors to use which can be considered as model structural uncertainty here a framework for identifying and using this predictor uncertainty has been presented in the context of providing improved drought predictions temporally aggregating climate indices was shown to maximise their skill in representing drought and in particular multi year droughts with strong regional variability found for the length of optimum aggregation window the temporal aggregation also increases the number of predictors available for use with different window lengths providing different amounts of smoothing leading to more structural uncertainty when constructing the prediction model the pic approach used here to select the predictors maximises the difference between predictors and provides a framework to create multi model predictions the multi model ensemble clearly outperforms all of the constituent models as well as the reference model an additional benefit is that it also allows the uncertainty in the predictions to be quantified at each time step the standard deviations of the four spi predictions is calculated and used to construct prediction limits to quantify the uncertainty of the spi fig 8 shows the multi model spi prediction and corresponding prediction limits 95 significance level for 12 month and 36 month cases at the four selected grid locations while uncertainty slightly varies over the whole distribution of the multi model spi uncertainty for the wet periods positive spi values is generally higher than during the drier periods for 12 m spi quantifying the uncertainty in drought predictions is useful for decision making to ensure sustainable water resource management practices uncertainty in the extremes is much higher compare to more neutral condition suggest that extreme droughts should be considered carefully when used in decision making this study considered four models to quantify the uncertainty in the prediction of spi chosen to provide a clear demonstration of the model framework more models could be considered if needed as ascertained through a sensitivity analyses with more models which provided similar results to those presented above other sensitivity testing could explore the skill provided by longer aggregation windows however data availability becomes limited as the aggregation window and spi time period are increased the spatial distribution of optimum aggregation window lengths across australia provides a clear representation of the regional variability of teleconnections across the country locations with the longest aggregation windows are generally in the arid inland of australia rainfall in these areas has high persistence with many dry months leading to longer spells of drought therefore the estimated spi time series are quite smoother with the highest variance at low frequencies for example multi year to decadal compared to the other locations in australia so it is expected that the low frequency components of climate indices would provide stronger relationships this is prominently observed in case of dmi correlation of 12 month and 36 month spi with dmi at different frequency bands as shown in fig 9 indicates that the frequency band of maximum correlation varies in space and reasonably resemble with the spatial distribution of length of optimum aggregation window raw dmi series are decomposed by discrete wavelet transform and the filtered time series corresponding to selected frequency bands are reconstructed using inverse discrete wavelet transform this is followed by identifying which frequency band provides maximum correlation with spi similarly spatial variability of optimum aggregation windows as shown in fig 3 over the far inland multi year frequency band of dmi shows strongest relationships with 12 month spi other parts of the country are dominated by inter annual frequency bands in case of 36 month spi multi year frequency band of dmi is found as the most dominating over most parts of australia this suggests that aggregation of climate indices acts to enhance the strength of relationships with spi by isolating frequency bands of interest and provides a better prediction of spi compare to raw climate indices in this study we have considered spi at 12 month and 36 month time scales because droughts of most concern for water resource management in australia and many other parts of the world occurs over the year to multi year periods the reference model would be expected to perform better for shorter duration droughts as the value of aggregated climate indices would be lower in representing these events while the aggregated model reasonably reduce the errors in spi series compare to the reference model the gap between the pdfs of the observed and modelled spi is still high and further work is needed to improve it the model has a tendency to predict neutral conditions i e 0 5 spi 0 5 more frequently and the extreme conditions occur less frequently compare to the observations this might be due to the limited ability of the knn model to capture the extremes i e tail of the distribution as it is biased to the non extreme values of the spi series especially when high values of the smoothing parameter k are used lall and sharma 1996 fitting separate knn models for non extreme and extreme values of spi would reduce the error in pdfs additionally fitting a parametric probabilistic model might be useful to reduce error in pdfs which is recommended for future work prediction of long term drought and wet conditions using climate indices estimated from ssta suggests that we could consider future drought risk using ssta information from general circulation models gcms directly projecting future drought and wet anomalies from gcm simulated precipitation is questionable due to the inability of these models to correctly simulate the low frequency variability of precipitation johnson and sharma 2011 rocheta et al 2014 in contrast gcms are reasonably reliable in predicting sea surface temperature sst especially over the tropical indian and pacific ocean song et al 2014 wang et al 2015 in addition prediction of sst could be further improved by the multi model combination kaiser khan et al 2014 thus this study provides a new insight into approaches that may improve future drought quantification and projections 6 conclusions in this study we investigate the potential of aggregated climate indices to enhance the prediction of prolonged drought and wet anomalies over the concurrent raw climate indices using a drought index i e spi as response additionally alternate constituent models with different subsets of predictors are developed to explore the uncertainty in the spi predictions and a model combination approach is used to reduce the structural uncertainty the results show that the optimum aggregation window length for varies substantially over space this reveals the importance of using multiple constituent models with unique set of predictors to explore the extent of uncertainty the methodology developed in this study is found useful to represent the prediction uncertainty originated from markedly different predictive models that exhibit different climatic combinations clear improvements are evident in the spi prediction with aggregated climate indices over the case where concurrent raw climate indices are used as predictors the multi model prediction framework reduces the structural uncertainty and further improves the prediction efficiency relatively larger improvements are observed for more extreme drought and wet anomalies the methods developed in this study are can be applied to predict the response of any dynamic system that is influenced by the low frequency variability of climatic modes one such application might be to

5887,long term skillful prediction of prolonged hydrologic anomalies is essential for proper planning to reduce the societal risk of extreme hydrological anomalies such as drought climate indices estimated from sea surface temperature anomalies ssta of the pacific and indian oceans are often used to predict monthly and seasonal rainfall in australia and many other places around the world this study investigates the merit of distorting the time aggregation of such indices before casting them in a predictive model aggregated climate indices are used to predict sustained drought and wet anomalies characterised here using a drought index i e standardize precipitation index spi as response and the australia as the study region of interest the aim is to enhance the strength of relationships of drought index and climate indices predictors by tuning the frequency of climate predictors using an aggregation technique result shows that aggregated climate indices provide significant improvement in prediction of spi over raw climate indices across australia as strong spatial variations in optimum aggregation window lengths are evident across australia suggesting multiple candidate predictive models with similar accuracies a model combination approach is also adopted model combination is found useful in reducing structural uncertainty and further improving the prediction efficiency given that the improved predictive accuracy for ssta the current generation of climate models exhibit the methodology developed in this study has significant implications for skillful prediction and projection of long term droughts keywords standardized precipitation index aggregated climate indices model combination uncertainty 1 introduction sustainable management of water resource systems requires skillful prediction of extended precipitation anomalies for water resource planning and allocation some of the important drivers of extended precipitation anomalies in australia are related to key modes of the pacific and indian oceans khan et al 2015 kirono et al 2010 risbey et al 2009 rogers and beringer 2017 tozer et al 2017 westra and sharma 2010 the influence of these climate indices is strong enough to also affect long term drought dijk et al 2013 ummenhofer et al 2009 with the climate teleconnections particularly strong at interannual and interdecadal frequencies özger et al 2009 the influence of el niño southern oscillation enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo indian ocean dipole iod and the subtropical ridge str on australian rainfall variability are well documented cai and cowan 2013 kirono et al 2010 murphy and timbal 2008 in australia typically la niña and el niño are associated with drier and wetter than the normal conditions respectively for southern australia iod has greater influence than enso during winter and spring rainfall as a result of the strong covariation between enso and the iod cai et al 2011 interannual variability of droughts over large part of australia is linked to the co occurrence of an el niño and a positive iod event whereas lower frequency variability such as multi year drought have iod as the dominating influence risbey et al 2009 ummenhofer et al 2009 ummenhofer et al 2011 this indicates that ssta based climate indices have potential in predicting droughts in australia among different approaches used for prediction of sustained droughts models with large scale climate indices is most common as their relationships with sustained droughts are reasonable awan and bae 2016 ren et al 2016 vicente serrano et al 2011 however variability and plausible teleconnections between droughts and large scale climate indices are different for different temporal scales özger et al 2009 for example occurrence of long term droughts is dominated by the multi year to decadal oscillations of climate indices dijk et al 2013 therefore identify most useful time scales of climate indices by optimizing the relationships with droughts is crucial to improve drought prediction out of different modelling techniques used for drought prediction non parametric data driven models become popular in the recent time anshuka et al 2019 fung et al 2019 many drought indices have been developed to represent sustained drought and wet anomalies mishra and singh 2010 among those standardized precipitation index spi is the most widely used index due to its simplicity in formulation and application spi can be compared across different locations due to its transformation to a standard normal distribution spi can be used to estimate drought and wet anomalies at different time scales while spi estimated at shorter time scales e g 3 and 6 month represent short term droughts i e meteorological droughts spi estimated at longer time scales e g 12 and 36 month is capable to capture long term droughts i e hydrological droughts li et al 2016 in australia and many other places of the world the droughts of most concern for water resource management occur over year to multi year periods and are often quantified with spi at longer time scales dijk et al 2013 sheffield and wood 2007 we hypothesise here that a predictive model for drought does not necessarily need to use ssta predictors at the same time scale as the drought response of interest or one may need a modulation of the ssta predictors to a different temporal scale to assist in the formulation of the best predictive model such a modulation is proposed here by means of aggregating the predictor variables over variable length time scales of interest while such aggregated predictors have been used before in formulating downscaling and other predictive models mehrotra and sharma 2006 their use in a seasonal forecasting context has not been attempted to understand the relationships at these longer time scales methods that emphasise or filter the low frequency components of the climate indices could be therefore useful to predict long term drought and wet conditions temporal aggregation is a simple way to filter the different frequency components of a time series wavelet transforms also often used to filter the signals at different frequency bands to use in model development he et al 2014 rashid et al 2015a rashid et al 2015c rashid et al 2018 temporal aggregation of climate indices has been used to forecast seasonal rainfall kirono et al 2010 standardized streamflow seibert et al 2017 and to identify teleconnections with rainfall anomalies dijk et al 2013 shi et al 2016 however the application of temporally aggregated climate indices in a modelling framework to predict long term sustained drought and wet anomalies has not been explored here we investigate using filtered relationships of climate indicators to predict a drought index the aim is to maximize the strength of relationships between the drought index and climate indices by smoothing climate indices time series using temporal aggregation in this study we develop a modelling framework where low frequency components of climate indices obtained through temporal aggregation were used as predictor in the k nearest neighbor knn to predict sustained drought and wet anomalies directly projecting future drought and wet anomalies from gcm simulated precipitation is questionable due to the limited ability of these models to correctly simulate the low frequency variability of precipitation while bias correction through nesting at different time scales can go some way towards correcting low frequency biases johnson and sharma 2011 mehrotra and sharma 2016 there are questions about the assumed stationarity of these biases nahar et al 2017 in contrast developing a framework to project spi from sea surface temperature sst is promising because of the skill of gcms in predicting sea surface temperature sst especially over the tropical indian and pacific ocean song et al 2014 wang et al 2015 in addition sst predictions may be further improved using multi modal combination kaiser khan et al 2014 using predicted ssts to derive the spi hence can offer advantages when compared to the use of gcm simulated rainfall directly thus this study provides a new approach that may improve future drought projections because the teleconnections of australian rainfall and drought with the different climate indices varies strongly over space and time rashid and beecham 2019a rashid and beecham 2019b risbey et al 2009 tozer et al 2017 there may be value in developing alternate models with different predictor sets the advantage of this approach is that an ensemble of the multiple models can be used which has been shown to provide better predictions on average than a single individual model a second advantage of a multi model ensemble is that it can improve our understanding of the uncertainty of the predictions of sustained drought and wet anomalies it also circumvents the need to select a best model from the set of alternate models hagedorn et al 2005 sharma and chowdhury 2011 in this study a multi model combination approach is used to make predictions of long term drought and wet conditions obtained from alternate models 2 data observed monthly gridded precipitation data from the australian water availability project awap have been used to estimate the drought response variable used in this study the rainfall data was re gridded to a spatial resolution of 0 5 using area averaging grid cells with zero rainfall for more than thirty percent of the data length were not considered for the analysis these grid cells are located in central and western desert of australia and coincide with the area identified by jones et al 2009 where gridded precipitation is unreliable due to the sparse gauge network while there are several climate indices which have significant influence on australian rainfall dijk et al 2013 tozer et al 2017 this study uses niño3 4 and dmi to predict spi to simplify the presentation niño3 4 represents the sea surface temperature anomalies ssta over the pacific ocean and is the leading mode of the el niño southern oscillation enso dmi represents the ssta over the indian ocean saji et al 1999 when combined enso and dmi are capable of explaining the variability of sustained rainfall anomalies across australia cai et al 2011 fierro and leslie 2013 ummenhofer et al 2011 niño3 4 and dmi are derived from monthly sea surface temperature values of hadley centre global ice and sea surface temperature hadisst datasets rayner et al 2003 for the period 1910 2010 table 1 3 methods 3 1 standardized precipitation index spi the most widely used drought index is the standardized precipitation index spi which can be estimated from precipitation data alone mckee et al 1995 the advantages the spi are that it can be estimated for any time scale of interest and it is comparable across different locations because of the transformation to a standard normal distribution spi is classically estimated by fitting a gamma distribution to the aggregated rainfall at different time scales and then transforming this to a normal distribution guttman 1999 a range of other distributions have been recommended angelidis et al 2012 naresh kumar et al 2009 due to issues with fitting the gamma distribution in areas with extremely low or high rainfall non parametric distributions have also been proposed for spi farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 to overcome the fitting issues the parametric spi method is sensitive to the choice of probability distribution and its parameters particularly when applied over large areas with a wide range of different climatic conditions the non parametric spi approach minimizes this issue because of the range of climate conditions across australia and variety of precipitation distributions the spi is estimated here using the non parametric method proposed by farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 3 2 aggregated climate indices the aim of this study is to assess whether the spi can be better predicted using a multi model ensemble with temporally aggregated climate indices as predictors to isolate the most important signals present in these climate indices ci we have considered eighty temporal windows to aggregate the indices using a simple backwards moving average for example considering an aggregation window of l months awl the aggregated climate index time series acil is estimated as 1 aci t l t t t l c i the aci are the potential predictors for spi and with l aggregation windows and two climate indices the model can be formulated using a total of 2l predictor time series the process of selecting a subset of predictors to use in the multi model ensemble is discussed in the next section 3 3 predictor selection and model formulation framework one of our objectives is to develop a range of models to use in the multi model ensemble to maximise the effectiveness of the ensemble it is desirable for predictors of each of the models to be as different as possible from each other sharma and chowdhury 2011 predictors of interest are identified from the pool of predictors variables i e the time series of aggregated climate indices using a nonparametric approach based on partial information correlation pic sharma and mehrotra 2014 pic is a measure of conditional dependence and similar to partial correlation in general the pic framework can be used to select predictors for a model by comparing the information in the predictors to the response and is flexible enough to also consider additional pre selected predictors that are presumed important from a physical perspective here pic has been used to maximise the additional information provided by each predictor equivalent to choosing new predictors with the smallest partial information correlation with a predictor that has previously been selected a comprehensive flowchart of the proposed method for multimodal prediction of spi is presented in fig 1 and further details are presented below let the general form of the predictive model be 2 y t y t a t i b t i where y t is the response variable i e spi at a specified time scale and a t i and b t i are the two predictors for the model named order 1 and order 2 predictors respectively both of which are aggregated climate indices for different aggregation periods for clarity we have restricted our study to four predictive models thus a t 1 a t 2 a t 3 and a t 4 are the four order 1 predictors and b t 1 b t 2 b t 3 and b t 4 are the four order 2 predictors each of the four models is constructed using a k nearest neighbor knn regression approach based on partial weights pw to predict spi sharma and mehrotra 2014 we have used the nonparametric prediction npred r package for the analysis sharma et al 2016 additionally a reference model is developed following the same method where raw climate indices are used as predictor instead of aggregated climate indices the procedure of model fitting was kept the same to enable a fair comparison between two models for example at any grid location we have considered spi and non aggregated raw niño3 4 and dmi time series to estimate pw and then predict spi using regression based knn model based on estimated pw as our hypothesis is that the aggregated climate indices better represent the spi variability compare to the raw climate indices the reference model with raw climate indices as predictor is appropriate the multi model ensemble can be constructed using simple averaging of the ensemble members hagedorn et al 2005 rashid et al 2015b or by optimizing the weights to maximize predictive skill rajagopalan et al 2002 robertson et al 2004 or estimating the weights conditioned to dominant predictors chowdhury and sharma 2011 devineni and sankarasubramanian 2010 weights can be static or temporally dynamic chowdhury and sharma 2009 kaiser khan et al 2014 here the multi model combination is obtained as the weighted sum of each individual model prediction the optimum weights for each model are estimated from the error variance covariance matrix kaiser khan et al 2014 3 4 model implementation details using the framework presented in the previous section and fig 1 predictions of the 12 month and 36 month spi are made at each grid location across australia for the period from 1910 to 2010 using the aggregated time series of niño3 4 and dmi as the predictors for each location and spi time scale 12 month or 36 month the following steps are required to select the significant predictors and formulate the four models used 1 the order 1 predictors are selected from aggregated climate indices using pic a partial information analyses is undertaken using observed spi as the response and all potential aggregated climate indices as predictors the predictor with maximum pic is chosen as the order 1 predictor for the first model a1 a number of additional predictors a 1 c representing candidate predictors for the other three models considered are also identified 2 the order 1 predictor for the second model is then selected by using a1 as the response and remaining predictors in a 1 c using partial information analysis the predictor with the lowest pic is now chosen to be the order 1 predictor for the second model a2 this ensures that a2 has the minimum correlation with a1 while still being strongly related to the response it is thus assumed that using this additional predictor to form a new model will result in a predictive model that is structurally different to the model formulated earlier 3 to select the order 1 predictor for the third model a1 and a2 are excluded from the predictor set and a new predictor a3 chosen from a 1 c the partial information analysis now uses a1 as the response and a2 as a pre existing predictor and the predictor with the lowest pic from the remaining aggregated climate indices is then chosen as the third order 1 predictor a3 this process is then repeated to ascertain the fourth order 1 predictor to form the predictors a1 to a4 while we have restricted our study to four models the number of models could be expanded by repeating step 1 to 4 but considering the remaining potential aggregated climate indices as predictors once the order 1 predictors have been selected for each model the order 2 predictors are then added this proceeds in the same way as step 3 above for each model the partial information analysis now uses spi as the response with remaining candidate predictors as the potential predictors excluding the four order 1 predictors already selected for each model the order 1 predictor associated is the pre existing predictor for pic the predictor with the highest pic is now chosen as the order 2 predictor for that model readers are referred to sharma and chowdhury 2011 for additional details about this approach to construct the multi model average a model combination weight is estimated the approach of kaiser khan et al 2014 and khan et al 2017 has been used this involves calculating the residuals for each of the four models and estimating their error covariance matrix with four models m 4 the size of the error covariance matrix is 4 4 with the diagonals representing the error variance of each model and the off diagonals the covariance of the errors between the models the weights for each model are calculated using equation 3 and are static in time 3 w v e 1 1 e 1 v where v is a m x 1 dimensional column vector of ones and e is the covariance matrix of prediction errors to ensure that the multi model prediction is unbiased we add additional constraints that the individual model weights add up to 1 and all weights are greater than zero the multi model prediction mm at each time step is then the weighted sum of the predictions from the four models at the same time step as per equation 4 4 y t mm i 1 4 w i y t i where y t y t 1 y t 2 y t 3 a n d y t 4 are the spi time series predicted from four models where t varies from 1 to n the total number data points in the spi series and w w 1 w 2 w 3 a n d w 4 are the optimum weights for each model 3 5 assessment of model skill the performance of the proposed model is assessed using a cross validation approach where available 100 years of data record is divided into ten subsets consisting of 10 years long non overlapping series each subset is used as a validation and the remaining 90 year period used for calibration a reference model is also formulated that does not consider the aggregated predictor variables used in the modelling framework described earlier the mean square error mse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse are used as a measure of prediction skill for all four individual models the multi model ensemble and the reference model the improvement in the multi model prediction is estimated in term of the relative differences in mse and nse between the multi model and reference model 4 results 4 1 importance of temporal aggregation our hypothesis is that by temporally aggregating climate indices their strength as potential predictors of sustained drought and wet anomalies can be improved as a proof of this concept simple regression models are constructed to predict spi firstly using each climate index as a predictor the improvements in this base model by using an aggregated climate index are then measured using the mean square error mse for the purpose of illustrating the worth of using time aggregated predictor variables an aggregation period l of 80 is used this implies that predictors are selected from a set of 80 possible variables for both order 1 and 2 predictors for each individual model fig 2 shows the mses obtained from the reference model and models with aggregated climate indices at different aggregation windows for 12 month and 36 month spi at a randomly selected single location in validation the models with aggregated climate indices provide consistently lower mses for each selected climate indices compared to the reference models the blue curve in fig 2 demonstrates that the temporal aggregation of climate indices improves the model efficiency i e decreases mses up to an optimal window length when the mse is the smallest when aggregations longer than the optimum are used the model error increases and in some cases becomes larger than the base model the optimum window length varies with the climate drivers and time scale of the spi response there is strong regional variability in the optimal window across australia fig 3 over eastern australian there is a north south gradient with longer optimum lengths in the north for niño3 4 the length of the optimum aggregation windows over eastern australia varies from 5 to 20 months and 30 to 50 months for the 12 month and 36 month spi respectively in western australia an east west gradient to longer optimum windows is observed for niño3 4 for both the 12 month and 36 month spi the relationship between dmi and spi is strengthened when comparatively long windows are used 60 to 80 months for both 12 month and 36 month spi areas with these multi year to almost decadal optimum windows include the far inland of new south wales south australia and northern australia other parts of the country e g north east coast southern australia and tasmania are dominated by sub annual to annual variability of dmi when predicting the 12 month spi for longer droughts the length of the optimum aggregation windows increases from 30 to 40 months over the north east coast south east coast and tasmania up to 50 to 70 months in the remainder of the country the regional variability evident in the optimum windows suggests that not one single model to predict spi will be successful 4 2 prediction of sustained drought and wet anomalies with aggregated climate indices using the temporally aggregated climate indices as predictors we developed multiple models using the framework described in 2 4 these models are compared to a reference model which uses unsmoothed climate indices as predictors to illustrate the method in depth the results from four grid cells are first presented followed by summary results across australia the prediction errors mse and model efficiency nse for spi from each of the four constituent models m1 m2 m3 and m4 the multi model ensemble mm and the reference model at the four selected grid locations are listed in table 2 the order 1 and order 2 predictors for each constituent model are also listed the value of temporally aggregating climate indices is clear with all four constituent models outperforming the reference model at each location for both the 12 month and 36 month spi scatter plots of spi predicted by the multi model ensemble and reference model against the observed spi along with their corresponding correlation coefficient as shown in figs s1 and s2 of the supporting document further demonstrate the superiority of using temporally aggregated climate indices to predict 12 month and 36 month spi it should be noted that the results presented here and elsewhere in the document all represent cross validation performances and hence improvements in one versus the other are statistically significant the multi model approach allows the uncertainty in the spi predictions originating from the choice of predictor variable to be explored at each grid location each of the four models performs quite differently illustrating the influence of different predictors and different aggregation windows on the spi this also illustrates the uncertainty in the predictive model being formulated a scenario that is known to be benefitted through model combination further improvements are obtained when model combination is applied the multi model prediction by combining multiple models with optimized weights reduces predictive uncertainty and improves the skill compared to any single model prediction the multi model approach allows for the interactions between the climate indices at a range of time scales to be incorporated into the predictions whilst still maintaining very simple model structures the relative improvement offered by the multi model prediction of spi is different at the four selected grid locations which is not surprising given the regionally variable relationships between sustained rainfall anomalies and climate indices dijk et al 2013 king et al 2013 kirono et al 2010 the predictions from the multi model ensemble compared to the observations and the reference model are shown in fig 4 where density plots are used to summarise the distribution of spi predictions in all four locations fig s3 in the supporting document the simple reference model consistently underestimates the frequency of droughts and wet periods with larger values of spi i e spi 1 and spi 1 respectively with the consequence that predictions of neutral conditions i e 0 5 spi 0 5 occurs too frequently this is because of the inability of reference model to adequately capture the long term variability of the observed spi series in contrast the smoothing and isolation of important frequencies through the temporal aggregation means that the multi model has much more skill in representing severe to extreme drought and wet conditions which are important for water resource management in general the improvements from the multi model ensemble are larger for the 36 month spi compared to 12 month spi this is because the smoothed version of the climate index time series is more valuable in representing the longer drought compared to the 12 month spi the multi model estimates do not capture the full range of observed spi values with the probability of events with an absolute value of spi more than 2 being underestimated further a probability density function pdf based skill score perkins et al 2007 which measure the similarity between two pdfs is used to quantify the improvement in spi prediction this metric measures the common area between two pdfs by summing the minimum value of two distributions for different bins skill scores are estimated for both reference and multi model spi predictions against the observation at each grid locations across australia fig 5 shows the relative improvement of skill score for multi model prediction compare to the reference model multi model prediction of spi provides improvement in skill score at varying magnitude compare to the reference model in approximately 95 grid locations the average improvement of skill score is 23 and 28 for 12 month and 36 month spi respectively across australia the improved skill for four selected locations g1 to g4 were estimated as 5 11 17 and 22 for 12 month spi and 12 16 28 and 41 for 36 month spi extending the analysis to all of australia reduction of errors in the spi predictions are observed in almost all locations fig 6 for both the 12 month and 36 month spi the average reduction in mae is 44 and 54 for 12 month and 36 month spi respectively consistent with the results for the 4 sample locations larger reductions are obtained for 36 month spi because as discussed earlier the temporal aggregation of the climate indices better reflects the smoother spi at this time scale for example greater than 50 reduction of error in spi prediction is observed in 881 grid locations for 12 month spi whereas the count is 1705 grid locations for 36 month spi there is substantial spatial structure to the improvements offered by the multi model ensemble the largest improvements are evident over the arid inland of south australia northern australia and western australia rainfall over this region is highly persistent rocheta et al 2014 which leads to more memory in spi time series a similar spatial pattern of improvement is observed for pdf skill score as well fig 5 thus the aggregated climate indices can represent the memory better through the smoothing of the aggregation process this provides more skill in the predictions consistent with the results in fig 3 finally model performance of reproducing drought characteristics was assessed first drought events i e spi values is continuously lower than 1 at least for 2 months were identified from the observed and modelled spi series drought characteristics such as severity sum of spi values of each drought events duration i e average of duration of each drought events and peak average of largest negative values of spi of each drought events were estimated for each event and averaged drought frequency is the total number of drought events over the period 1910 2010 fig 7 shows the scatter plots of observed and modelled reference model and multi model ensemble drought characteristics at each grid location across australia results show a clear improvement when spi is modelled with temporally aggregated climate indices instead of raw climate indices however both models showed less skill for the grid locations with relatively longer and highly intense droughts generally in the central arid region of australia although the multi model ensemble still perform better than the reference model 5 discussion one of the important sources of uncertainty in any modelling study is the input data or predictors this uncertainty is introduced partially by the choice of which subset of predictors to use which can be considered as model structural uncertainty here a framework for identifying and using this predictor uncertainty has been presented in the context of providing improved drought predictions temporally aggregating climate indices was shown to maximise their skill in representing drought and in particular multi year droughts with strong regional variability found for the length of optimum aggregation window the temporal aggregation also increases the number of predictors available for use with different window lengths providing different amounts of smoothing leading to more structural uncertainty when constructing the prediction model the pic approach used here to select the predictors maximises the difference between predictors and provides a framework to create multi model predictions the multi model ensemble clearly outperforms all of the constituent models as well as the reference model an additional benefit is that it also allows the uncertainty in the predictions to be quantified at each time step the standard deviations of the four spi predictions is calculated and used to construct prediction limits to quantify the uncertainty of the spi fig 8 shows the multi model spi prediction and corresponding prediction limits 95 significance level for 12 month and 36 month cases at the four selected grid locations while uncertainty slightly varies over the whole distribution of the multi model spi uncertainty for the wet periods positive spi values is generally higher than during the drier periods for 12 m spi quantifying the uncertainty in drought predictions is useful for decision making to ensure sustainable water resource management practices uncertainty in the extremes is much higher compare to more neutral condition suggest that extreme droughts should be considered carefully when used in decision making this study considered four models to quantify the uncertainty in the prediction of spi chosen to provide a clear demonstration of the model framework more models could be considered if needed as ascertained through a sensitivity analyses with more models which provided similar results to those presented above other sensitivity testing could explore the skill provided by longer aggregation windows however data availability becomes limited as the aggregation window and spi time period are increased the spatial distribution of optimum aggregation window lengths across australia provides a clear representation of the regional variability of teleconnections across the country locations with the longest aggregation windows are generally in the arid inland of australia rainfall in these areas has high persistence with many dry months leading to longer spells of drought therefore the estimated spi time series are quite smoother with the highest variance at low frequencies for example multi year to decadal compared to the other locations in australia so it is expected that the low frequency components of climate indices would provide stronger relationships this is prominently observed in case of dmi correlation of 12 month and 36 month spi with dmi at different frequency bands as shown in fig 9 indicates that the frequency band of maximum correlation varies in space and reasonably resemble with the spatial distribution of length of optimum aggregation window raw dmi series are decomposed by discrete wavelet transform and the filtered time series corresponding to selected frequency bands are reconstructed using inverse discrete wavelet transform this is followed by identifying which frequency band provides maximum correlation with spi similarly spatial variability of optimum aggregation windows as shown in fig 3 over the far inland multi year frequency band of dmi shows strongest relationships with 12 month spi other parts of the country are dominated by inter annual frequency bands in case of 36 month spi multi year frequency band of dmi is found as the most dominating over most parts of australia this suggests that aggregation of climate indices acts to enhance the strength of relationships with spi by isolating frequency bands of interest and provides a better prediction of spi compare to raw climate indices in this study we have considered spi at 12 month and 36 month time scales because droughts of most concern for water resource management in australia and many other parts of the world occurs over the year to multi year periods the reference model would be expected to perform better for shorter duration droughts as the value of aggregated climate indices would be lower in representing these events while the aggregated model reasonably reduce the errors in spi series compare to the reference model the gap between the pdfs of the observed and modelled spi is still high and further work is needed to improve it the model has a tendency to predict neutral conditions i e 0 5 spi 0 5 more frequently and the extreme conditions occur less frequently compare to the observations this might be due to the limited ability of the knn model to capture the extremes i e tail of the distribution as it is biased to the non extreme values of the spi series especially when high values of the smoothing parameter k are used lall and sharma 1996 fitting separate knn models for non extreme and extreme values of spi would reduce the error in pdfs additionally fitting a parametric probabilistic model might be useful to reduce error in pdfs which is recommended for future work prediction of long term drought and wet conditions using climate indices estimated from ssta suggests that we could consider future drought risk using ssta information from general circulation models gcms directly projecting future drought and wet anomalies from gcm simulated precipitation is questionable due to the inability of these models to correctly simulate the low frequency variability of precipitation johnson and sharma 2011 rocheta et al 2014 in contrast gcms are reasonably reliable in predicting sea surface temperature sst especially over the tropical indian and pacific ocean song et al 2014 wang et al 2015 in addition prediction of sst could be further improved by the multi model combination kaiser khan et al 2014 thus this study provides a new insight into approaches that may improve future drought quantification and projections 6 conclusions in this study we investigate the potential of aggregated climate indices to enhance the prediction of prolonged drought and wet anomalies over the concurrent raw climate indices using a drought index i e spi as response additionally alternate constituent models with different subsets of predictors are developed to explore the uncertainty in the spi predictions and a model combination approach is used to reduce the structural uncertainty the results show that the optimum aggregation window length for varies substantially over space this reveals the importance of using multiple constituent models with unique set of predictors to explore the extent of uncertainty the methodology developed in this study is found useful to represent the prediction uncertainty originated from markedly different predictive models that exhibit different climatic combinations clear improvements are evident in the spi prediction with aggregated climate indices over the case where concurrent raw climate indices are used as predictors the multi model prediction framework reduces the structural uncertainty and further improves the prediction efficiency relatively larger improvements are observed for more extreme drought and wet anomalies the methods developed in this study are can be applied to predict the response of any dynamic system that is influenced by the low frequency variability of climatic modes one such application might be to forecast and project reservoir inflows for sustainable management and operation of large water storages credit authorship contribution statement md mamunur rashid conceptualization data curation

5888,this study aims reporting on 23 gridded precipitation datasets p datasets reliability across west africa through direct comparisons with rain gauges measurement at the daily and monthly time scales over a 4 years period 2000 2003 all p datasets reliability vary in space and time the most efficient p dataset in term of kling gupta efficiency kge changes at the local scale and the p dataset performance is sensitive to seasonal effects satellite based p datasets performed better during the wet than the dry season whereas the opposite is observed for reanalysis p datasets the best overall performance was obtained for mswep v 2 2 and chirps v 2 for daily and monthly time step respectively part of the differences in p dataset performance at daily and monthly time step comes from the time step used to proceed the gauges adjustment i e day or month and from a mismatch between gauge and satellite reporting times in comparison to the others p datasets tmpa adj v 7 reliability is stable and reach the second highest kge value at both daily and monthly time step reanalysis p datasets wfdei merra 2 jra 55 era interim present among the lowest statistical scores at the daily time step which drastically increased at the monthly time step for wfdei and merra 2 the non adjusted p datasets were the less efficient but their near real time availability should be helpful for risk forecast studies i e gsmap rt v 6 the results of this study give important elements to select the most adapted p dataset for specific application across west africa keywords precipitation datasets reliability west africa 1 introduction 1 1 precipitation a key factor subject to uncertainty water resources are facing unprecedented changes related to redistribution of seasonal precipitation saeed et al 2018 and intensity fischer and knutti 2015 giorgi et al 2018 owing to climate variability with a six fold increase of water extraction during the 20th century in response to increases in the world population cosgrove and risberman 2000 food requirements and the economy may be particularly affected by these changes accurate spatiotemporal precipitation monitoring is therefore crucial for detect and quantifying ongoing changes in optimising water resource management traditionally the precipitation amount is measured at the point scale from gauge measurements however access difficulty political instability and economic issues have often resulted in sparse and unevenly distributed rain gauge networks that incorrectly capture the spatial precipitation variability lebel et al 1997 li and heap 2014 alternatively weather radar stations enable precipitation monitoring with spatial distribution over larger and even remote areas however radar stations are expensive and only a few are available worldwide in addition large amounts of radar signal interference prevent accurate estimation of precipitation over complex terrains tang et al 2016 zeng et al 2018 several authors have recently reported on the potential of using cellular phone signal attenuation during precipitation events to retrieve precipitation measurements doumounia et al 2014 messer et al 2006 overeem et al 2011 zinevich et al 2008 although these estimations are accurate they are limited to regions with high antenna density e g urban areas moreover this technique faces the problem of accessing data owned by private cellular phone companies regardless of the technique employed precipitation data collection at the regional scale usually includes potential conflicts of interest in water resource management between neighbouring countries in this context gridded precipitation datasets p dataset at an almost global scale offer an unprecedented alternative over remote regions p datasets have already shown promising perspective for water resource management by enhancing our understanding of drought e g agutu et al 2017 guo et al 2017 satgé et al 2017a toté et al 2015 and flood e g gao et

et al 2018b zhang et al 2018 and snow cover dynamics e g satgé et al 2019 and agriculture productivity e g thaler et al 2018 de wit et al 2010 1 2 state of the art for p datasets three groups of gridded p dataset can be defined depending on the input and technique used to retrieve the precipitation amounts 1 those based on the spatial information of available gauges 2 those based on reanalysis data derived from physical and dynamical models and 3 those based on satellite information using passive microwave pmw and infrared ir information it is worth mentioning that most of the p datasets merge aspects of these three inputs and techniques to ensure the best accuracy possible recently 30 global scale p datasets with variable space time coverage and resolution have been listed sun et al 2018a which present precipitation estimates discrepancy in space and time according to their different bases such as data capture integration and algorithms for example gauge based p dataset reliability varies in space and time according to changes in the number of available gauges used for the interpolation process sun et al 2015 similarly satellite based p dataset reliability varies in space and time because the pmw and ir algorithms present limits over complex mountainous hussain et al 2017 satgé et al 2017b and snow covered regions ferraro et al 1998 levizzani et al 2002 and during short term and slight precipitation events gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 tian et al 2009 finally reanalysis data based p datasets present variable reliability in space and time owing to the limited ability of the models used to represent small scale convective cells beck et al 2019 in this context many studies assess p dataset space time uncertainties to evaluate their reliability maggioni et al 2016 maggioni and massari 2018 a recurrent drawback of assessment studies on p dataset reliability is the consideration of a limited number of p datasets a comprehensive reliability overview of available p datasets as listed in table 1 can be achieved only by backcrossing the results from different p dataset assessment studies however the studies are conducted over distinct regions and are based on different statistical indices spatial and temporal scales and periods thus creating difficulties in intercomparing p dataset reliability assessments for example when comparing tmpa cmorph and persiann p datasets with reference gauge estimates cmorph was shown to have the most reliable p datasets in pakistan china bali and indonesia hussain et al 2017 rahmawati and lubczynski 2017 su et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 however tmpa was the most reliable in india guyana chile and the south american andean plateau prakash et al 2014a ringard et al 2015 satgé et al 2016 zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 hence p dataset reliability for a given region should not be determined from results reported for other regions in this context it is decisive to consider the most representative p dataset sample to insure a consistent report on p dataset reliability across the considered region 1 3 the need for assessing p datasets over west africa africa is particularly affected by climate changes threatening rainfed agriculture which represents its main agricultural and economic activity sultan et al 2013 however owing to the socio economic context the available gauge network is limited by many spatial and temporal gaps which prevent efficient water management according to the world meteorological organisation wmo the african continent requires uniform distribution of at least 3000 stations ideally 10 000 however only 744 stations are present moreover only one quarter of the 744 stations conform to international standards because they provide precipitation information on a regular grid at the global scale p datasets offer a unique opportunity for complementing traditional precipitation measurements and optimising population adaption to the ongoing changes however as previously mentioned p dataset estimates are indirect measurements with spatial and temporal uncertainties which need to be reported to evaluate their reliability some authors have already initiated this effort over west africa in 2012 seven p datasets were tested over the basin of la volta including cmorph gprof v6 gsmap mvk v5 rfe 2 0 tmpa v6 persiann and era interim thiemig et al 2012 in 2013 nine p datasets including cmorph epsat sg gpcp gsmap mvk gsmap rt rfe 2 tmpa v6 tmpa rt v6 and persiann and seven p datasets including persiann cmorph tmpa rt v 6 tmpa adj v 6 gsmap mvk gcpc 1dd and rfe 2 were tested in benin and niger for hydrological gosset et al 2013 and agriculture applications ramarohetra et al 2013 respectively both studies found that their use could introduce large biases in crop or hydrological modelling framework more recently six p datasets including arc 2 cmorph gsmap mvk persiann tamsat and tmpa v 6 were compared with gauge measurements data over the entire african continent awange et al 2016 all of the aforementioned studies focus mainly on p datasets regularly updated by their developers to enhance the precipitation estimates since then updated versions of the considered products have been made available with more accurate precipitation estimates for example the benefits brought by the new tmpa v 7 in comparison to its previous version tmpa v 6 has been reported in many regions e g anjum et al 2016 prakash et al 2014b satgé et al 2016 additionally most of the tested p datasets originate from the trmm era constellation which has limited temporal coverage from 1998 to the present in this context new studies have reported on recently released p dataset versions with larger temporal coverage for example in 2016 over burkina seven p datasets including arc 2 chirps v 2 persiann cdr rfe v 2 tamsat v 2 tmpa v 7 and tmpa rt v 7 were assessed at the daily decadal and monthly timescales dembélé and zwart 2016 in 2017 tamsat v 3 was introduced and compared with its previous version tamsat v 2 and with six p datasets including arc v 2 chirp v 2 chirps v 2 cmorph v 1 rfe and tmpa v 7 over west africa specifically nigeria and niger uganda zambia and mozambique maidment et al 2017 in 2017 10 p datasets including cfsr chirps cmorph v 1 raw and crt persiann cdr rfe 2 tamsat v 2 tmpa v 7 tmpa rt v 7 and gpcc were assessed over six watersheds located in burkina nigeria and ghana poméon et al 2017 nonetheless the reported studies indicate that the results are mostly limited in space country or basin scale and in terms of considered p datasets sample to our knowledge only one study has reported on p datasets at the regional west african scale with a limited sample of p datasets including tmpa v 7 udel v 3 1 cru v 3 and arc v 2 akinsanola et al 2016 1 4 objectives according to the previously described context the present study aims to compare the accuracy of 23 p datasets in reproducing the characteristics of rain gauge measurements across west africa which is an unprecedented comparison the consideration of a p dataset sample as large as possible aims to provide a robust overview of p dataset performance over west africa the analysis is conducted at both daily and monthly time steps this study provides important feedback to p dataset developers for enhancing the algorithms for next generation p datasets and to potential users to support their p datasets selection 2 materials methods 2 1 study area the study area hereafter referred to as west africa extends from the atlantic coast of senegal to eastern chad and the gulf of guinea to north of the sahel 18 w 25 e 4 n 25 n fig 1 the region is characterised by a marked south north gradient of rainfall amount ranging from 5000 mm year 1 in cameroon to less than 200 mm year 1 in the northern sahel the west africa region can be divided into three main climatic zones i the guinea coast 4 8 n ii the savannah 8 11 n and iii the sahel 11 16 n abiodun et al 2012 akinsanola et al 2016 fig 1 for all zones the year is characterised by a dry season in winter and a rainy season in summer linked to the west african monsoon this concentrates most of the annual rainfall amount from april to october for the guinea coast zone and from june to september for both the savanah and sahel zones fig 1 the rainfall interannual temporality is great with the occurrence of drought phases dry spell during the rainy season and in interannual rainfall with very dry and very wet years in the 1970 s and 1950 s respectively 2 2 selected p datasets a sample of 23 gridded p datasets including 13 long term p datasets with more than 35 years of continuous observation and 10 p datasets spanning more than 15 years was selected table 1 provides an overview of these p datasets and relevant references for further information on their respective productions 2 2 1 comments on the selected p datasets some p datasets use gauge based information in their respective algorithms table 1 three types of gauge based information are used 1 punctual precipitation estimates derived from gauge records 2 gridded precipitation estimates based on interpolation of punctual gauge records and 3 gauge precipitation estimates punctual or gridded merged with different satellite datasets of precipitation brightness or land surface temperature punctual precipitation estimates from the world meteorological organisation wmo global telecommunication system gts novella and thiaw 2012 and numerous african national meteorological and hydrological centres maidment et al 2014 are used for arc 2 and tamsat v 3 respectively in both cases the gauge network is very sparse for example the gts gauge network has a 1 23 000 km2 gauge to area ratio across the african continent novella and thiaw 2012 the gridded precipitation estimates are i the gpcc with a 1 spatial resolution becker et al 2013 schneider et al 2014 and ii the daily cpc with 0 5 spatial resolution chen et al 2008 xie et al 2007 jra 55 adj tmpa adj v 7 and wfdei use gpcc monthly data whereas cmorph crt v 1 cmorph bld v 1 gsmap adj v 6 and merra 2 use cpc daily data the gridded precipitation estimates merged with satellite precipitation estimates are i the chpclim dataset with a 0 05 grid cell size funk et al 2015 ii the gpcp dataset with a 2 5 grid cell size adler et al 2003 2012 and iii the worldclim 2 dataset with a 1 km grid cell size fick and hijmans 2017 chpclim and worldclim 2 use satellite observations as predictors to improve the interpolation from point gauge records whereas gpcp uses the gauge record to adjust the precipitation fields derived from satellite observations further details are reported elsewhere adler et al 2003 funk et al 2015 among the considered p datasets chirps v 2 use the chpclim dataset mswep v 2 2 use the worldclim 2 dataset and persiann cdr uses the gpcp dataset chirps v 2 also includes punctual precipitation estimates from various public data streams private archives and national meteorological agencies while mswep v 2 2 incorporates monthly gpcc and daily gauge observations compiled from several sources beck et al 2018 another difference between the p datasets is the time latency for their availability the p datasets are generally available in i a few days or ii a few months after the observation table 1 some are in near real time nrt latency of one to three days and are more adapted for flood or landslides forecasting water resource management and agriculture while the others are more adapted for retrospective climatic studies fig 2 shows the mean annual precipitation patterns retrieved from all p datasets except for cpc v 1 and the p datasets which use cpc v 1 for post adjustment processing arc 2 cmorph crt v 1 cmorph bld v 1 gsmap adj v 6 and merra 2 all p datasets represent the typical south north precipitation gradient with two precipitation hotspots located over the southwest and south region it should be noted that sm2rain cci v 2 estimates are based on soil moisture estimates which are strongly attenuated by the vegetation canopy this results in significant gaps over areas with moderate to dense vegetation as observed over the southern region fig 2 dorigo et al 2015 additionally a sensor failure in the ers 2 gyroscope from january 2001 to june 2003 accentuated these gaps and explains the gaps observed over the central and northern regions fig 2 dorigo et al 2015 2 2 2 p dataset pre processing the p datasets available at a sub daily time step table 1 were aggregated to obtain daily time step records matching the local gauge observations 8 h to 8 h local time it is worth mentioning that p datasets delivered at daily time scales table 1 use time windows different from those of the gauge which can compromise the comparison at the daily scale this point is further discussed in section 4 1 moreover the p datasets differ in terms of grid cell size ranging from 0 0375 for tamsat v 3 to 1 for gpcc v 7 to enable consistent comparison all p datasets were resampled to the 0 1 grid cell size bilinear averaging interpolation are used for p datasets with grid cell size 0 1 0 1 beck et al 2019 3 reference precipitation dataset a database of 1 440 gauges were made available by several african national meteorological and hydrological centres the stations are distributed onto 952 0 1 grid cells for each grid cell a reference daily precipitation series was obtained averaging the gauges included in the grid cell to ensure consistent analysis only grid cells with more than 80 of daily records were considered the four year period of 2000 2003 was finally retained to consider the largest number of 0 1 grid cells 187 3 1 monthly p dataset estimate assessment the monthly amounts were computed for only months with more than 80 of common daily records for all datasets reference and p datasets the accuracy of monthly p dataset estimates was assessed using a quantitative statistical analysis based on the modified kling gupta efficiency kge an objective function combining correlation r bias β and variability γ components gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 eq 1 we used kge because water resource management requires reliable representation of precipitation temporal dynamics measured by r and volume measured by β and γ 1 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where r represents the pearson coefficient eq 2 β is the ratio between the mean observed and predicted precipitation eq 2 and γ is the ratio of the estimated and observed coefficients of variation eq 3 2 r 1 n 1 n o n μ o s n μ s σ o σ s 3 β μ s μ o 4 γ σ s μ s σ o μ o where μ and σ are the distribution mean and standard deviation respectively and s and o indicate the estimate and reference respectively kge β γ and r have their optimum at unity the analysis was performed considering all months of 2000 2003 and the wet and dry seasons months separately for each grid cell the wet and dry seasons were selected according to their corresponding climatic zone fig 1 the sahel seasonality was applied for the grid cells located up to latitude 16 n the values of kge r β and γ were computed at each grid cell location to observe the p dataset reliability over space and their median values was used to observe that at the regional scale considering the important gaps over space and time for sm2rain cci v 2 fig 2 its performance analysis was based on a reduced number of 0 1 grid cells 79 finally gpcc v 7 is only available at the monthly time step table 1 consistent comparison between gpcc v 7 and the reference was possible only for grid cells and months with complete daily observation series for a total of 183 grid cells 3 2 daily p dataset estimate assessment the daily precipitation estimates were assessed on the basis of both quantitative and categorical statistical metrics the quantitative analysis relied on the median kge r β and γ obtained from the 187 considered grid cells for all days and the wet and dry seasons days separately and from the 79 183 grid cells for sm2rain cci v 2 gpcc v 7 the categorical statistics were used to measure the p dataset capacity for detecting the daily precipitation events daily precipitation events are considered as discrete values with only two observable cases rainy or not rainy days a rainy day was considered when the precipitation amount was greater than or equal to a prescribed threshold mm day 1 four cases were possible table 2 based on this characterisation the heidke skill score hss eq 4 evaluates the p dataset ability for detecting precipitation events in comparison with a random based prediction 5 hss 2 a d b c a c c d a b b d the hss values range from to 1 with a perfect score of 1 and negative values indicating that random based prediction outperforms the p dataset one the mean hss value was computed from those obtained for all of the considered grid cells for threshold values ranging from 0 to 25 mm day 1 with a 1 mm day 1 increment this consideration was used to assess the p dataset performance based on light to heavy daily precipitation events finally using a 1 mm day 1 the hss value was computed at each grid cell location to observe the p dataset reliability over space 4 results 4 1 p dataset assessment at the monthly time step with negative kge values three p datasets cmorph raw v 1 tmpa rt v 7 and persiann rt were unable to represent the regional monthly precipitation fig 3 interestingly their adjusted versions cmorph bld v 1 tmpa adj v 7 and persiann cdr respectively performed much better with kge greater than 0 8 correlation better than 0 9 and bias and variability close to the optimum values 1 the same results were shown for chirp v 2 gsmap rt v 6 and jra 55 which were systematically outperformed by their corresponding adjusted versions chirps v 2 gsmap adj v 6 and jra 55 adj respectively in a general way all p datasets using gauges based information present higher kge than the others the p datasets developed for the african continent tamsat v 3 and arc 2 did not outperform the global scale p datasets however the tamsat v 3 reliability was very close to that of the other p datasets kge 0 8 the p dataset performance expressed as kge varied seasonally tamsat v 3 jra 55 adj persiann adj arc 2 gsmap rt v 6 and gpcc v 7 were more effective during the wet season and cmorph bld v 1 merra 2 gsmap adj v 6 cpc v 1 and era interim had better performance during the dry season however the most effective p datasets chirps v 2 tmpa adj v 7 wfdei persiann cdr and mswep v 2 2 performed similarly for both wet and dry seasons interestingly all p datasets presented higher correlation coefficient and bias values during the dry season with respect to the variability ratio no clear seasonal trend was observed for the different p datasets adjustment of chirp v 2 jra 55 persiann rt tmpa rt v 7 gsmap rt v 6 and cmorph raw v 1 increased the kge values considerably at most of the grid cell locations the adjustment applied to gsmap adj v 6 was not effective over the western region where kge values decreased in comparison to gsmap rt v 6 its non adjusted version similarly the cmorph adjusted versions cmorph crt v 1 and bld v 1 presented the lowest registered kge values over the western region cpc v 1 merra 2 and arc 2 also presented the lowest kge value over this region regarding the most effective p datasets chirps v 2 gpcc v 7 wfdei and tmpa adj v 7 presented similar kge distributions most of the p datasets were well correlated to the reference with correlation better than 0 8 fig 5 the adjusted version systematically presented higher correlation values with mswep v 2 2 presenting the highest number of grid cells with correlation better than 0 9 and only one grid cell with correlation worse than 0 7 interestingly chirps presented the lowest correlation score over the northern very arid region with correlation worse than 0 7 fig 5 the p datasets without gauge based information presented higher bias fig 6 persiann rt highly overestimate precipitation throughout the region bias greater than 1 55 the bias decreased in the post adjusted version persiann adj with acceptable bias estimates 1 15 bias 1 35 over many grid cells similar results were observed for persiann cdr cmorph raw v 1 and tmpa rt v 7 presented similar bias distributions from overestimation to underestimation in the northern arid and southern humid regions respectively tmpa rt gauge adjustment was highly successful with most of the tmpa adj v 7 grid cells presenting acceptable bias values at 0 85 bias 1 15 cpc v 1 strongly underestimates precipitation over the western region this bias spread for all p datasets using cpc v 1 for their adjustement process cmorph crt and bld v 1 arc 2 gsmap adj v 6 and merra 2 interestingly the precipitation adjustment applied on gsmap rt v 6 increased the bias on gsmap adj v 6 wfdei tmpa adj v 7 and chirps v 2 presented less biased precipitation estimates with reasonable bias values of 0 85 bias 1 15 in most of the considered grid cells regarding the variability ratio distribution the efficiency of using gauge based information to retrieve the precipitation estimates was obvious when comparing persiann rt tmpa rt v 7 and cmorph raw v 1 with their post adjusted versions fig 7 the non adjusted products cmorph raw v 1 and tmpa rt v 7 strongly overestimated the precipitation variability in the majority of grid cells with variability ratios better than 1 25 to the contrary persiann rt strongly underestimated the precipitation variability in most grid cells with a variability ratio worse than 0 85 however when considering jra 55 jra 55 adj and chirp v 2 chirps v 2 the use of gauge based information did not significantly enhance the variability ratio finally the two african p datasets underestimated the precipitation variability over most of the grid cells variability ratios 0 90 4 2 p dataset assessment at the daily time step at the regional scale the ability of the p datasets to quantify the daily precipitation amount was relatively low with most having median kge values worse than 0 4 fig 8 only mswep v 2 2 tmpa adj v 7 cmorph bld v 1 cmorph crt v 1 gsmap rt v 6 and persiann adj had kge scores superior to 0 4 with the best score achieved by mswep v 2 2 kge 0 52 generally non adjusted p datasets presented the lowest kge values except for gsmap v 6 the kge decreased from 0 44 gsmap rt v 6 to 0 35 for gsmap adj v 6 interestingly persiann rt presented a negative kge value but one of the highest correlation score at 0 5 therefore its low kge score appears to be influenced by its very high positive bias value of 2 5 this is in line with observation made at the monthly time step and the dominant influence of the bias values on the kge score in term of kge the p dataset accuracy was higher during the wet than that in the dry season interestingly merra 2 wfdei era interim and jra 55 performed better during the dry season which is line with the results obtained over the continental united states conus beck et al 2019 however the performances of merra 2 wfdei era interim and jra 55 were very low with kge 0 2 most of the p datasets presented the highest hss scores using a threshold value of 1 mm day 1 fig 9 in particular the hss values of chirp v 2 and merra 2 were close to 0 when considering a 0 mm day 1 threshold value the values jumped to 0 3 and 0 36 respectively when considering a 1 mm day 1 threshold value actually the p datasets detected many precipitation events with less than 1 mm day 1 which were not detected by the gauges this can be explained by different factors 1 the gauges are not sensitive enough to such precipitation amounts 2 difference in the spatial scale between point gauge and average area p dataset grid cell measurements 3 the p dataset algorithm is deficient because these precipitation events are insignificant 1 mm day 1 they should be considered as no precipitation events the highest hss score was achieved by cmorph bld v 1 hss 0 58 and mswep v 2 2 hss 0 55 the p dataset ability in reproducing daily precipitation amounts decreased for increasing intensity two p dataset groups measured differently events of more than 15 mm day 1 the first group cmorph crt and bld v 1 gsmap rt and adj v 6 mswep v 2 2 persiann rt and adj arc 2 and cpc and tmpa adj v 7 was much more suited for reproducing high intensity precipitation events than the second group chirp v 2 chirps v 2 cmorph raw v 1 jra 55 jra 55 adj persiann cdr tamsat v 3 tmpa rt v 7 wfdei merra 2 era interim and sm2rain cci v 2 fig 9 it is worth mentioning that the first group includes i p datasets with gauge based calibration using daily data and ii p datasets available at the sub daily time step the second group includes i non adjusted p datasets or ii those adjusted with monthly gauges based data iii p datasets delivered at the daily time step and iv reanalysis p datasets which generally have the largest discrepancies when compared with other p datasets sun et al 2018a therefore the gauge based information used for p datasets and the delivered time step daily or sub daily considerably influence the p dataset reliability at the daily time scale this point is further discussed in section 4 in the discussion using gauge based information improved the hss score over space for instance tmpa rt v 7 cmorph raw v 1 chirp v 2 and persiann rt adjusted versions provided much better hss scores throughout the region fig 10 the adjusted versions of jra 55 and gsmap rt v 6 did not show significant enhancement overall the first group identified in fig 9 cmorph crt and bld v 1 gsmap rt and adj v 6 mswep v 2 2 persiann rt and adj arc 2 cpc and tmpa adj v 7 presents the highest hss all over west africa fig 10 5 discussion 5 1 monthly versus daily p dataset reliability interestingly the p dataset performance ranking differed at the monthly and daily timescale fig 11 we identified two main factors to explain these discrepancies the first is related to the gauge based information time step used to adjust p dataset estimates indeed the five most efficient p datasets at the monthly time step chirps v 2 tmpa adj v 7 wfdei persiann cdr and mswep v2 2 were adjusted using monthly gauge based information whereas three of the five most efficient p datasets at the daily time step mswep v 2 2 cmorph bld v 1 and cmorph crt v 1 were adjusted using daily gauge based information fig 11 additionally the reliability of the gauge based information can also influence the p dataset accuracy accordingly over the sahel region the chpclim monthly dataset reliability was higher than that of gpcc funk et al 2015 because most of the considered grid cells used to assess p dataset reliability are in the sahel region fig 1 chirps which uses chpclim provides more realistic monthly precipitation estimates at kge 0 86 than wfdei and persiann cdr which uses gpcc and gpcp respectively fig 3 this demonstrates the importance of maintaining reliable gauge networks to insure accurate p dataset estimates the second factor is the p datasets delivered time step some p datasets are delivered at the daily aggregation level table 1 which is based on different time windows than those used for local records for example persiann cdr daily estimates correspond to a given 0 h to 0 h utc aggregation time period whereas the gauges used in this study register daily amount from 8 h to 8 h utc such temporal inconsistency can introduce large differences between the p datasets and the gauge measurements ashouri et al 2015 satgé et al 2019 therefore only one of the p datasets cmorph bld v 1 delivered at the daily time step ranked in the top five most efficient p datasets on the contrary four of the five most efficient p datasets at the daily time step were delivered at the sub daily time step 3 hourly to hourly table 1 and fig 11 the sub daily time step enables matching of the computed daily estimates with the local record time windows to ensure consistent comparison between gauges and p dataset estimates our results demonstrate the importance of considering both daily and monthly time steps when assessing p dataset reliability because the latter is influenced by the gauge based adjustment process and the delivered time step generally p datasets using gauge based information achieved highest kge scores at both monthly and daily time step figs 3 and 8 which supports previous results obtained over west african regions casse et al 2015 gosset et al 2013 poméon et al 2017 and elsewhere beck et al 2019 dinku et al 2007 satgé et al 2016 however the use of gauge based information for p dataset adjustment is not always as effective indeed gsmap rt v 6 outperformed its adjusted version gsmap adj v 6 at the daily time step this result is consistent with previous observation over the conus beck et al 2019 and illustrates the potential p dataset algorithm limit to consider the best of gauge data gsmap rt v 6 is the only p dataset with no gauge based information of the top five daily ranking therefore gsmap adj v 6 should be highly effective if using the gauge based information in the optimal form 5 2 p dataset reliability in space and time cmorph bld v 1 cmorph crt v 1 gsmap adj v 6 and merra 2 presented weaker performance over the western region in comparison with other p datasets fig 3 we identified one factor to explain this spatial inconsistency different from other p datasets which use gpcc or gpcp data cmorph bld v 1 gsmap adj v 6 and merra 2 use cpc data the gauge number used to retrieve cpc is lower than that used to retrieve gpcc fig 12 a over the senegal gambia guinea bissau and guinea regions only two cpc grid cells counted with more than one gauge against seven for gpcc fig 12b and c as a result compared with gpcc v 7 cpc v 1 presents the lowest efficiency over the western region fig 4 which propagates into the use of cpc by the p datasets to adjust their estimates the available gauge information for retrieving cpc and gpcc datasets also varies with time fig 12a therefore the p dataset reliability could be better worse if considering a period with more fewer available gauges for retrieving gpcc or cpc datasets in this context tamsat v 3 uses consistent gauge based information in space and time rather than a continuously updated information to avoid adding any space or time discrepancy maidment et al 2017 actually p datasets present space and time inconsistencies which cannot be reported by using single temporal windows satgé et al 2019 the authors assessed p dataset reliability over three different four years period and one twelve years period across the lake titicaca region results show that the p dataset reliability conclusion vary according to the considered period therefore the analysis should be conducted over different temporal windows to adequately evaluate the p dataset space and time reliability such a consideration is challenging over west africa owing to the scarcity of gauge networks and the important temporal gaps present to overcome this issue an alternative method could use satellite based soil moisture estimates rather than traditional rain gauges measurements as a reference benchmark massari et al 2017 it is worth mentioning that gpcc and cpc share common gauges with the reference network used in this study as highlighted by many overlapping between both network fig 12b and c similar observation should be done if considering the others gauges based datasets used for p dataset calibration and presented in section 2 2 1 therefore the gauges network used for the assessment is not totally independent of the considered p datasets and could influence p dataset reliability conclusions the p dataset reliability conclusion could have been less optimist if only based on independent gauges network in this context future studies should try to consider totally independent gauges network to provide more consistent feedback on actual p dataset reliability however information on the shared information between national gauges networks and gauges based dataset i e cpc and gpcc is hard to obtain and compromise this kind of consideration 5 3 p datasets sensitivity to seasonal variation reanalysis p datasets era interim merra 2 jra 55 and wfdei performed better during the dry than during the wet season fig 3 this agrees with previous results obtained over the conus beck et al 2019 the authors explained that reanalysis p datasets are better adapted to detecting large scale stratiform systems which are typical in the dry season than unpredictable small scale convective cells which are typical in the wet season on the contrary only satellite based p datasets performed better during the wet than the dry season beck et al 2019 salles et al 2019 satgé et al 2017b actually the irregular sampling of the low earth orbiting satellites and the limited number of overpasses hardly captures short precipitation events which are typical during the dry season gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 tian et al 2009 therefore gsmap rt v 6 presented a better kge value during the wet than that during the dry season fig 3 the seasonality sensitivity of the other p datasets incorporating satellite reanalysis or gauge based information shows a greater contrast because they consider the different inputs despite the seasonal variation in kge value the p datasets presented significantly higher coefficient correlation during the dry season fig 3 this difference could be related to the higher monthly precipitation variability during the dry season fig 1 tending to increase the correlation coefficient accordingly all p datasets presented higher correlation coefficients considering the entire period because the precipitation variability is even more marked than at the seasonal scale at the contrary the p datasets were more biased during the dry season fig 3 except for cpc v 1 gsmap adj v 6 and era interim the p datasets with higher bias values during the dry season tamsat v 3 persiann adj arc 2 gsmap rt v 6 sm2rain cci v 2 jra 55 adj and gpcc v 7 or the wet season cpc v 1 gsmap adj v 6 and era interim presented lower kge scores during this specific season whereas the p datasets with close bias values for both wet and dry seasons chirps v 2 tmpa adj v 7 wfdei persiann cdr mswep v2 2 cmorph crt v 1 chirp v 2 presented similar kge values for both seasons considering the similar seasonal trend observed for both kge and bias values the bias appears to have a dominant influence on the kge score interestingly if considering the p dataset bias in millimetres all p datasets had systematically higher bias values during the wet season fig 13 because lower monthly precipitation occurred during the dry season the same volumetric error millimetres expressed in ratio eq 2 corresponds to higher bias during the dry in comparison to that during the wet season for most of the p datasets the reported bias value during the dry season was 5 mm month 1 fig 13 which should have an insignificant influence on the water budget therefore despite the low kge value during the dry season p datasets still provide valuable additional information to follow both temporal and volume monthly precipitation dynamics over west africa 5 4 p dataset time latency fig 14 shows the kge scores of the nrt p datasets in comparison with the most accurate p dataset at the daily time step at the daily time step gsmap rt v 6 was the most reliable nrt p dataset with three days of time latency the gsmap rt kge at 0 44 was close to the most effective p dataset mswep v 2 2 with kge 0 52 which is available with a few months of latency it is worth mentioning that the low score achieved by the p datasets at the daily time step is partly related to the difference between spatially averaged p dataset grid cell and point reference gauges measurements salles et al 2019 satgé et al 2019 tang et al 2018 the p dataset reliability increased with the number of gauges used to represent the spatially average grid cell measurement salles et al 2019 tang et al 2018 in this study most of the considered 0 1 grid cells were counted with only one gauge therefore the presented kge score may underestimate the actual p dataset reliability testing the sensitivity of streamflow modelling to p datasets at basin outlets overcome the influence of scarce and unevenly distributed gauge networks indeed aggregation of precipitation at the basin scale eliminates the difference in spatial representation between point gauge and areal p datasets measurements because both gauge and p datasets represent precipitation at the basin spatial scale therefore the reliability of p datasets varies significantly when used to reproduce gauge precipitation estimates or streamflow observations satgé et al 2019 in this context nrt p dataset coverage and latency can fit the needs of an early warning system across sparsely gauged or ungauged regions recent studies have successfully used nrt p datasets to follow flood events in terms of streamflow yuan et al 2019 and flood extent belabib et al 2019 or for landslide occurrence estimations brunetti et al 2018 future studies should assess nrt p datasets in the scope of early warning studies to consistently evaluate nrt dataset reliability in this specific context 5 5 towards an enhanced p dataset over west africa this study considers an unprecedented sample of 23 p datasets over the west african region to provide a consistent guideline for potential users the results suggest that during 2000 2003 chirps v 2 and mswep v 2 2 showed the best estimates of monthly and daily precipitation respectively the most reliable p dataset can change at the local scale as an example fig 15 shows the most suitable p datasets for representing both monthly and daily precipitation at the grid cell level interestingly at the daily time step mswep v 2 2 was more consistent for the western region whereas cmorph p datasets provided more accurate estimates over the central and southern regions fig 15 at the monthly time step even if chirp s p datasets are counted with the highest number of grid cells large spatial heterogeneity is observed with many grid cells where wfdei jra 55 adj cmorph and tmpa outperformed chirp s fig 15 to take advantage of all available p datasets merging all p datasets to produce an enhanced p dataset over the region is a good option previous studies have reported on the benefit of such an approach to retrieve a more realistic p dataset over pakistan muhammad et al 2018 rahman et al 2018 tibet ma et al 2018 and different tropical complex terrain bhuiyan et al 2019 these ensemble precipitation datasets enhance the regional precipitation representation and should be used as guideline over west africa 6 conclusions the present study evaluates the accuracy of 23 gridded p datasets over the west african region at both monthly and daily time step for the 2000 2003 period despite the limited coverage and scarcity of the ground reference points some consistent features emerged from the analysis the p dataset performance ranking differs at the monthly and daily timescale p datasets using sub daily monthly gauge information perform better at the daily monthly time step additionally for the p datasets released at the daily time step the temporal mismatch between gauge and satellite reporting times decrease their reliability at the daily time step in this line mswep v 2 2 and chirps v 2 provide the most reliable daily and monthly precipitation estimates respectively whereas tmpa adj v 7 performance is very good for both daily and monthly estimates the only satellite based p datasets cmorph rt v 1 tmpa rt v 7 persiann rt gsmap v 6 rt performance is very low at both monthly and daily time scale their reliability drastically increase for their adjusted versions cmorph crt and bld v 1 tmpa adj v 7 persiann adj excepted for gsmap v 6 at the daily time step all the considered reanalysis p datasets wfdei jra 55 jra 55 adj era interim are unreliable at the daily time step the use of monthly gpcc p dataset to adjust their estimates considerably increase their reliability at the monthly time step wfdei jra 55 adj the two african p datasets tamsat v 3 and arc 2 present an overall lower performance in comparison to the almost global scale p datasets at both daily and monthly time step despite good performance in some parts of the region sm2rain cci v 2 still suffers too many gaps in space and time across west african all p datasets present spatial discrepancies in their statistical score suggesting the use of a spatial p datasets merging approach to take advantage from all available p datasets across west africa it should be reminded that most of the considered 0 1 grid cells count with only one gauge to represent the observed precipitation because of spatial inconsistency between point gauges and spatially average p datasets measurement different conclusion regarding the p datasets reliability could have been drawn if more gauges had been available per grid cells or if using p datasets as forcing data for hydrological modelling additionally the study is based on a single four years temporal window however p dataset reliability vary in time and the results could have been different if considering another four years temporal window or a larger one therefore this study aims more at compare the p dataset reliability between them rather than to provide definitive conclusion on their respective accuracy credit authorship contribution statement

5888,this study aims reporting on 23 gridded precipitation datasets p datasets reliability across west africa through direct comparisons with rain gauges measurement at the daily and monthly time scales over a 4 years period 2000 2003 all p datasets reliability vary in space and time the most efficient p dataset in term of kling gupta efficiency kge changes at the local scale and the p dataset performance is sensitive to seasonal effects satellite based p datasets performed better during the wet than the dry season whereas the opposite is observed for reanalysis p datasets the best overall performance was obtained for mswep v 2 2 and chirps v 2 for daily and monthly time step respectively part of the differences in p dataset performance at daily and monthly time step comes from the time step used to proceed the gauges adjustment i e day or month and from a mismatch between gauge and satellite reporting times in comparison to the others p datasets tmpa adj v 7 reliability is stable and reach the second highest kge value at both daily and monthly time step reanalysis p datasets wfdei merra 2 jra 55 era interim present among the lowest statistical scores at the daily time step which drastically increased at the monthly time step for wfdei and merra 2 the non adjusted p datasets were the less efficient but their near real time availability should be helpful for risk forecast studies i e gsmap rt v 6 the results of this study give important elements to select the most adapted p dataset for specific application across west africa keywords precipitation datasets reliability west africa 1 introduction 1 1 precipitation a key factor subject to uncertainty water resources are facing unprecedented changes related to redistribution of seasonal precipitation saeed et al 2018 and intensity fischer and knutti 2015 giorgi et al 2018 owing to climate variability with a six fold increase of water extraction during the 20th century in response to increases in the world population cosgrove and risberman 2000 food requirements and the economy may be particularly affected by these changes accurate spatiotemporal precipitation monitoring is therefore crucial for detect and quantifying ongoing changes in optimising water resource management traditionally the precipitation amount is measured at the point scale from gauge measurements however access difficulty political instability and economic issues have often resulted in sparse and unevenly distributed rain gauge networks that incorrectly capture the spatial precipitation variability lebel et al 1997 li and heap 2014 alternatively weather radar stations enable precipitation monitoring with spatial distribution over larger and even remote areas however radar stations are expensive and only a few are available worldwide in addition large amounts of radar signal interference prevent accurate estimation of precipitation over complex terrains tang et al 2016 zeng et al 2018 several authors have recently reported on the potential of using cellular phone signal attenuation during precipitation events to retrieve precipitation measurements doumounia et al 2014 messer et al 2006 overeem et al 2011 zinevich et al 2008 although these estimations are accurate they are limited to regions with high antenna density e g urban areas moreover this technique faces the problem of accessing data owned by private cellular phone companies regardless of the technique employed precipitation data collection at the regional scale usually includes potential conflicts of interest in water resource management between neighbouring countries in this context gridded precipitation datasets p dataset at an almost global scale offer an unprecedented alternative over remote regions p datasets have already shown promising perspective for water resource management by enhancing our understanding of drought e g agutu et al 2017 guo et al 2017 satgé et al 2017a toté et al 2015 and flood e g gao et

gridded p dataset can be defined depending on the input and technique used to retrieve the precipitation amounts 1 those based on the spatial information of available gauges 2 those based on reanalysis data derived from physical and dynamical models and 3 those based on satellite information using passive microwave pmw and infrared ir information it is worth mentioning that most of the p datasets merge aspects of these three inputs and techniques to ensure the best accuracy possible recently 30 global scale p datasets with variable space time coverage and resolution have been listed sun et al 2018a which present precipitation estimates discrepancy in space and time according to their different bases such as data capture integration and algorithms for example gauge based p dataset reliability varies in space and time according to changes in the number of available gauges used for the interpolation process sun et al 2015 similarly satellite based p dataset reliability varies in space and time because the pmw and ir algorithms present limits over complex mountainous hussain et al 2017 satgé et al 2017b and snow covered regions ferraro et al 1998 levizzani et al 2002 and during short term and slight precipitation events gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 tian et al 2009 finally reanalysis data based p datasets present variable reliability in space and time owing to the limited ability of the models used to represent small scale convective cells beck et al 2019 in this context many studies assess p dataset space time uncertainties to evaluate their reliability maggioni et al 2016 maggioni and massari 2018 a recurrent drawback of assessment studies on p dataset reliability is the consideration of a limited number of p datasets a comprehensive reliability overview of available p datasets as listed in table 1 can be achieved only by backcrossing the results from different p dataset assessment studies however the studies are conducted over distinct regions and are based on different statistical indices spatial and temporal scales and periods thus creating difficulties in intercomparing p dataset reliability assessments for example when comparing tmpa cmorph and persiann p datasets with reference gauge estimates cmorph was shown to have the most reliable p datasets in pakistan china bali and indonesia hussain et al 2017 rahmawati and lubczynski 2017 su et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 however tmpa was the most reliable in india guyana chile and the south american andean plateau prakash et al 2014a ringard et al 2015 satgé et al 2016 zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 hence p dataset reliability for a given region should not be determined from results reported for other regions in this context it is decisive to consider the most representative p dataset sample to insure a consistent report on p dataset reliability across the considered region 1 3 the need for assessing p datasets over west africa africa is particularly affected by climate changes threatening rainfed agriculture which represents its main agricultural and economic activity sultan et al 2013 however owing to the socio economic context the available gauge network is limited by many spatial and temporal gaps which prevent efficient water management according to the world meteorological organisation wmo the african continent requires uniform distribution of at least 3000 stations ideally 10 000 however only 744 stations are present moreover only one quarter of the 744 stations conform to international standards because they provide precipitation information on a regular grid at the global scale p datasets offer a unique opportunity for complementing traditional precipitation measurements and optimising population adaption to the ongoing changes however as previously mentioned p dataset estimates are indirect measurements with spatial and temporal uncertainties which need to be reported to evaluate their reliability some authors have already initiated this effort over west africa in 2012 seven p datasets were tested over the basin of la volta including cmorph gprof v6 gsmap mvk v5 rfe 2 0 tmpa v6 persiann and era interim thiemig et al 2012 in 2013 nine p datasets including cmorph epsat sg gpcp gsmap mvk gsmap rt rfe 2 tmpa v6 tmpa rt v6 and persiann and seven p datasets including persiann cmorph tmpa rt v 6 tmpa adj v 6 gsmap mvk gcpc 1dd and rfe 2 were tested in benin and niger for hydrological gosset et al 2013 and agriculture applications ramarohetra et al 2013 respectively both studies found that their use could introduce large biases in crop or hydrological modelling framework more recently six p datasets including arc 2 cmorph gsmap mvk persiann tamsat and tmpa v 6 were compared with gauge measurements data over the entire african continent awange et al 2016 all of the aforementioned studies focus mainly on p datasets regularly updated by their developers to enhance the precipitation estimates since then updated versions of the considered products have been made available with more accurate precipitation estimates for example the benefits brought by the new tmpa v 7 in comparison to its previous version tmpa v 6 has been reported in many regions e g anjum et al 2016 prakash et al 2014b satgé et al 2016 additionally most of the tested p datasets originate from the trmm era constellation which has limited temporal coverage from 1998 to the present in this context new studies have reported on recently released p dataset versions with larger temporal coverage for example in 2016 over burkina seven p datasets including arc 2 chirps v 2 persiann cdr rfe v 2 tamsat v 2 tmpa v 7 and tmpa rt v 7 were assessed at the daily decadal and monthly timescales dembélé and zwart 2016 in 2017 tamsat v 3 was introduced and compared with its previous version tamsat v 2 and with six p datasets including arc v 2 chirp v 2 chirps v 2 cmorph v 1 rfe and tmpa v 7 over west africa specifically nigeria and niger uganda zambia and mozambique maidment et al 2017 in 2017 10 p datasets including cfsr chirps cmorph v 1 raw and crt persiann cdr rfe 2 tamsat v 2 tmpa v 7 tmpa rt v 7 and gpcc were assessed over six watersheds located in burkina nigeria and ghana poméon et al 2017 nonetheless the reported studies indicate that the results are mostly limited in space country or basin scale and in terms of considered p datasets sample to our knowledge only one study has reported on p datasets at the regional west african scale with a limited sample of p datasets including tmpa v 7 udel v 3 1 cru v 3 and arc v 2 akinsanola et al 2016 1 4 objectives according to the previously described context the present study aims to compare the accuracy of 23 p datasets in reproducing the characteristics of rain gauge measurements across west africa which is an unprecedented comparison the consideration of a p dataset sample as large as possible aims to provide a robust overview of p dataset performance over west africa the analysis is conducted at both daily and monthly time steps this study provides important feedback to p dataset developers for enhancing the algorithms for next generation p datasets and to potential users to support their p datasets selection 2 materials methods 2 1 study area the study area hereafter referred to as west africa extends from the atlantic coast of senegal to eastern chad and the gulf of guinea to north of the sahel 18 w 25 e 4 n 25 n fig 1 the region is characterised by a marked south north gradient of rainfall amount ranging from 5000 mm year 1 in cameroon to less than 200 mm year 1 in the northern sahel the west africa region can be divided into three main climatic zones i the guinea coast 4 8 n ii the savannah 8 11 n and iii the sahel 11 16 n abiodun et al 2012 akinsanola et al 2016 fig 1 for all zones the year is characterised by a dry season in winter and a rainy season in summer linked to the west african monsoon this concentrates most of the annual rainfall amount from april to october for the guinea coast zone and from june to september for both the savanah and sahel zones fig 1 the rainfall interannual temporality is great with the occurrence of drought phases dry spell during the rainy season and in interannual rainfall with very dry and very wet years in the 1970 s and 1950 s respectively 2 2 selected p datasets a sample of 23 gridded p datasets including 13 long term p datasets with more than 35 years of continuous observation and 10 p datasets spanning more than 15 years was selected table 1 provides an overview of these p datasets and relevant references for further information on their respective productions 2 2 1 comments on the selected p datasets some p datasets use gauge based information in their respective algorithms table 1 three types of gauge based information are used 1 punctual precipitation estimates derived from gauge records 2 gridded precipitation estimates based on interpolation of punctual gauge records and 3 gauge precipitation estimates punctual or gridded merged with different satellite datasets of precipitation brightness or land surface temperature punctual precipitation estimates from the world meteorological organisation wmo global telecommunication system gts novella and thiaw 2012 and numerous african national meteorological and hydrological centres maidment et al 2014 are used for arc 2 and tamsat v 3 respectively in both cases the gauge network is very sparse for example the gts gauge network has a 1 23 000 km2 gauge to area ratio across the african continent novella and thiaw 2012 the gridded precipitation estimates are i the gpcc with a 1 spatial resolution becker et al 2013 schneider et al 2014 and ii the daily cpc with 0 5 spatial resolution chen et al 2008 xie et al 2007 jra 55 adj tmpa adj v 7 and wfdei use gpcc monthly data whereas cmorph crt v 1 cmorph bld v 1 gsmap adj v 6 and merra 2 use cpc daily data the gridded precipitation estimates merged with satellite precipitation estimates are i the chpclim dataset with a 0 05 grid cell size funk et al 2015 ii the gpcp dataset with a 2 5 grid cell size adler et al 2003 2012 and iii the worldclim 2 dataset with a 1 km grid cell size fick and hijmans 2017 chpclim and worldclim 2 use satellite observations as predictors to improve the interpolation from point gauge records whereas gpcp uses the gauge record to adjust the precipitation fields derived from satellite observations further details are reported elsewhere adler et al 2003 funk et al 2015 among the considered p datasets chirps v 2 use the chpclim dataset mswep v 2 2 use the worldclim 2 dataset and persiann cdr uses the gpcp dataset chirps v 2 also includes punctual precipitation estimates from various public data streams private archives and national meteorological agencies while mswep v 2 2 incorporates monthly gpcc and daily gauge observations compiled from several sources beck et al 2018 another difference between the p datasets is the time latency for their availability the p datasets are generally available in i a few days or ii a few months after the observation table 1 some are in near real time nrt latency of one to three days and are more adapted for flood or landslides forecasting water resource management and agriculture while the others are more adapted for retrospective climatic studies fig 2 shows the mean annual precipitation patterns retrieved from all p datasets except for cpc v 1 and the p datasets which use cpc v 1 for post adjustment processing arc 2 cmorph crt v 1 cmorph bld v 1 gsmap adj v 6 and merra 2 all p datasets represent the typical south north precipitation gradient with two precipitation hotspots located over the southwest and south region it should be noted that sm2rain cci v 2 estimates are based on soil moisture estimates which are strongly attenuated by the vegetation canopy this results in significant gaps over areas with moderate to dense vegetation as observed over the southern region fig 2 dorigo et al 2015 additionally a sensor failure in the ers 2 gyroscope from january 2001 to june 2003 accentuated these gaps and explains the gaps observed over the central and northern regions fig 2 dorigo et al 2015 2 2 2 p dataset pre processing the p datasets available at a sub daily time step table 1 were aggregated to obtain daily time step records matching the local gauge observations 8 h to 8 h local time it is worth mentioning that p datasets delivered at daily time scales table 1 use time windows different from those of the gauge which can compromise the comparison at the daily scale this point is further discussed in section 4 1 moreover the p datasets differ in terms of grid cell size ranging from 0 0375 for tamsat v 3 to 1 for gpcc v 7 to enable consistent comparison all p datasets were resampled to the 0 1 grid cell size bilinear averaging interpolation are used for p datasets with grid cell size 0 1 0 1 beck et al 2019 3 reference precipitation dataset a database of 1 440 gauges were made available by several african national meteorological and hydrological centres the stations are distributed onto 952 0 1 grid cells for each grid cell a reference daily precipitation series was obtained averaging the gauges included in the grid cell to ensure consistent analysis only grid cells with more than 80 of daily records were considered the four year period of 2000 2003 was finally retained to consider the largest number of 0 1 grid cells 187 3 1 monthly p dataset estimate assessment the monthly amounts were computed for only months with more than 80 of common daily records for all datasets reference and p datasets the accuracy of monthly p dataset estimates was assessed using a quantitative statistical analysis based on the modified kling gupta efficiency kge an objective function combining correlation r bias β and variability γ components gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 eq 1 we used kge because water resource management requires reliable representation of precipitation temporal dynamics measured by r and volume measured by β and γ 1 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where r represents the pearson coefficient eq 2 β is the ratio between the mean observed and predicted precipitation eq 2 and γ is the ratio of the estimated and observed coefficients of variation eq 3 2 r 1 n 1 n o n μ o s n μ s σ o σ s 3 β μ s μ o 4 γ σ s μ s σ o μ o where μ and σ are the distribution mean and standard deviation respectively and s and o indicate the estimate and reference respectively kge β γ and r have their optimum at unity the analysis was performed considering all months of 2000 2003 and the wet and dry seasons months separately for each grid cell the wet and dry seasons were selected according to their corresponding climatic zone fig 1 the sahel seasonality was applied for the grid cells located up to latitude 16 n the values of kge r β and γ were computed at each grid cell location to observe the p dataset reliability over space and their median values was used to observe that at the regional scale considering the important gaps over space and time for sm2rain cci v 2 fig 2 its performance analysis was based on a reduced number of 0 1 grid cells 79 finally gpcc v 7 is only available at the monthly time step table 1 consistent comparison between gpcc v 7 and the reference was possible only for grid cells and months with complete daily observation series for a total of 183 grid cells 3 2 daily p dataset estimate assessment the daily precipitation estimates were assessed on the basis of both quantitative and categorical statistical metrics the quantitative analysis relied on the median kge r β and γ obtained from the 187 considered grid cells for all days and the wet and dry seasons days separately and from the 79 183 grid cells for sm2rain cci v 2 gpcc v 7 the categorical statistics were used to measure the p dataset capacity for detecting the daily precipitation events daily precipitation events are considered as discrete values with only two observable cases rainy or not rainy days a rainy day was considered when the precipitation amount was greater than or equal to a prescribed threshold mm day 1 four cases were possible table 2 based on this characterisation the heidke skill score hss eq 4 evaluates the p dataset ability for detecting precipitation events in comparison with a random based prediction 5 hss 2 a d b c a c c d a b b d the hss values range from to 1 with a perfect score of 1 and negative values indicating that random based prediction outperforms the p dataset one the mean hss value was computed from those obtained for all of the considered grid cells for threshold values ranging from 0 to 25 mm day 1 with a 1 mm day 1 increment this consideration was used to assess the p dataset performance based on light to heavy daily precipitation events finally using a 1 mm day 1 the hss value was computed at each grid cell location to observe the p dataset reliability over space 4 results 4 1 p dataset assessment at the monthly time step with negative kge values three p datasets cmorph raw v 1 tmpa rt v 7 and persiann rt were unable to represent the regional monthly precipitation fig 3 interestingly their adjusted versions cmorph bld v 1 tmpa adj v 7 and persiann cdr respectively performed much better with kge greater than 0 8 correlation better than 0 9 and bias and variability close to the optimum values 1 the same results were shown for chirp v 2 gsmap rt v 6 and jra 55 which were systematically outperformed by their corresponding adjusted versions chirps v 2 gsmap adj v 6 and jra 55 adj respectively in a general way all p datasets using gauges based information present higher kge than the others the p datasets developed for the african continent tamsat v 3 and arc 2 did not outperform the global scale p datasets however the tamsat v 3 reliability was very close to that of the other p datasets kge 0 8 the p dataset performance expressed as kge varied seasonally tamsat v 3 jra 55 adj persiann adj arc 2 gsmap rt v 6 and gpcc v 7 were more effective during the wet season and cmorph bld v 1 merra 2 gsmap adj v 6 cpc v 1 and era interim had better performance during the dry season however the most effective p datasets chirps v 2 tmpa adj v 7 wfdei persiann cdr and mswep v 2 2 performed similarly for both wet and dry seasons interestingly all p datasets presented higher correlation coefficient and bias values during the dry season with respect to the variability ratio no clear seasonal trend was observed for the different p datasets adjustment of chirp v 2 jra 55 persiann rt tmpa rt v 7 gsmap rt v 6 and cmorph raw v 1 increased the kge values considerably at most of the grid cell locations the adjustment applied to gsmap adj v 6 was not effective over the western region where kge values decreased in comparison to gsmap rt v 6 its non adjusted version similarly the cmorph adjusted versions cmorph crt v 1 and bld v 1 presented the lowest registered kge values over the western region cpc v 1 merra 2 and arc 2 also presented the lowest kge value over this region regarding the most effective p datasets chirps v 2 gpcc v 7 wfdei and tmpa adj v 7 presented similar kge distributions most of the p datasets were well correlated to the reference with correlation better than 0 8 fig 5 the adjusted version systematically presented higher correlation values with mswep v 2 2 presenting the highest number of grid cells with correlation better than 0 9 and only one grid cell with correlation worse than 0 7 interestingly chirps presented the lowest correlation score over the northern very arid region with correlation worse than 0 7 fig 5 the p datasets without gauge based information presented higher bias fig 6 persiann rt highly overestimate precipitation throughout the region bias greater than 1 55 the bias decreased in the post adjusted version persiann adj with acceptable bias estimates 1 15 bias 1 35 over many grid cells similar results were observed for persiann cdr cmorph raw v 1 and tmpa rt v 7 presented similar bias distributions from overestimation to underestimation in the northern arid and southern humid regions respectively tmpa rt gauge adjustment was highly successful with most of the tmpa adj v 7 grid cells presenting acceptable bias values at 0 85 bias 1 15 cpc v 1 strongly underestimates precipitation over the western region this bias spread for all p datasets using cpc v 1 for their adjustement process cmorph crt and bld v 1 arc 2 gsmap adj v 6 and merra 2 interestingly the precipitation adjustment applied on gsmap rt v 6 increased the bias on gsmap adj v 6 wfdei tmpa adj v 7 and chirps v 2 presented less biased precipitation estimates with reasonable bias values of 0 85 bias 1 15 in most of the considered grid cells regarding the variability ratio distribution the efficiency of using gauge based information to retrieve the precipitation estimates was obvious when comparing persiann rt tmpa rt v 7 and cmorph raw v 1 with their post adjusted versions fig 7 the non adjusted products cmorph raw v 1 and tmpa rt v 7 strongly overestimated the precipitation variability in the majority of grid cells with variability ratios better than 1 25 to the contrary persiann rt strongly underestimated the precipitation variability in most grid cells with a variability ratio worse than 0 85 however when considering jra 55 jra 55 adj and chirp v 2 chirps v 2 the use of gauge based information did not significantly enhance the variability ratio finally the two african p datasets underestimated the precipitation variability over most of the grid cells variability ratios 0 90 4 2 p dataset assessment at the daily time step at the regional scale the ability of the p datasets to quantify the daily precipitation amount was relatively low with most having median kge values worse than 0 4 fig 8 only mswep v 2 2 tmpa adj v 7 cmorph bld v 1 cmorph crt v 1 gsmap rt v 6 and persiann adj had kge scores superior to 0 4 with the best score achieved by mswep v 2 2 kge 0 52 generally non adjusted p datasets presented the lowest kge values except for gsmap v 6 the kge decreased from 0 44 gsmap rt v 6 to 0 35 for gsmap adj v 6 interestingly persiann rt presented a negative kge value but one of the highest correlation score at 0 5 therefore its low kge score appears to be influenced by its very high positive bias value of 2 5 this is in line with observation made at the monthly time step and the dominant influence of the bias values on the kge score in term of kge the p dataset accuracy was higher during the wet than that in the dry season interestingly merra 2 wfdei era interim and jra 55 performed better during the dry season which is line with the results obtained over the continental united states conus beck et al 2019 however the performances of merra 2 wfdei era interim and jra 55 were very low with kge 0 2 most of the p datasets presented the highest hss scores using a threshold value of 1 mm day 1 fig 9 in particular the hss values of chirp v 2 and merra 2 were close to 0 when considering a 0 mm day 1 threshold value the values jumped to 0 3 and 0 36 respectively when considering a 1 mm day 1 threshold value actually the p datasets detected many precipitation events with less than 1 mm day 1 which were not detected by the gauges this can be explained by different factors 1 the gauges are not sensitive enough to such precipitation amounts 2 difference in the spatial scale between point gauge and average area p dataset grid cell measurements 3 the p dataset algorithm is deficient because these precipitation events are insignificant 1 mm day 1 they should be considered as no precipitation events the highest hss score was achieved by cmorph bld v 1 hss 0 58 and mswep v 2 2 hss 0 55 the p dataset ability in reproducing daily precipitation amounts decreased for increasing intensity two p dataset groups measured differently events of more than 15 mm day 1 the first group cmorph crt and bld v 1 gsmap rt and adj v 6 mswep v 2 2 persiann rt and adj arc 2 and cpc and tmpa adj v 7 was much more suited for reproducing high intensity precipitation events than the second group chirp v 2 chirps v 2 cmorph raw v 1 jra 55 jra 55 adj persiann cdr tamsat v 3 tmpa rt v 7 wfdei merra 2 era interim and sm2rain cci v 2 fig 9 it is worth mentioning that the first group includes i p datasets with gauge based calibration using daily data and ii p datasets available at the sub daily time step the second group includes i non adjusted p datasets or ii those adjusted with monthly gauges based data iii p datasets delivered at the daily time step and iv reanalysis p datasets which generally have the largest discrepancies when compared with other p datasets sun et al 2018a therefore the gauge based information used for p datasets and the delivered time step daily or sub daily considerably influence the p dataset reliability at the daily time scale this point is further discussed in section 4 in the discussion using gauge based information improved the hss score over space for instance tmpa rt v 7 cmorph raw v 1 chirp v 2 and persiann rt adjusted versions provided much better hss scores throughout the region fig 10 the adjusted versions of jra 55 and gsmap rt v 6 did not show significant enhancement overall the first group identified in fig 9 cmorph crt and bld v 1 gsmap rt and adj v 6 mswep v 2 2 persiann rt and adj arc 2 cpc and tmpa adj v 7 presents the highest hss all over west africa fig 10 5 discussion 5 1 monthly versus daily p dataset reliability interestingly the p dataset performance ranking differed at the monthly and daily timescale fig 11 we identified two main factors to explain these discrepancies the first is related to the gauge based information time step used to adjust p dataset estimates indeed the five most efficient p datasets at the monthly time step chirps v 2 tmpa adj v 7 wfdei persiann cdr and mswep v2 2 were adjusted using monthly gauge based information whereas three of the five most efficient p datasets at the daily time step mswep v 2 2 cmorph bld v 1 and cmorph crt v 1 were adjusted using daily gauge based information fig 11 additionally the reliability of the gauge based information can also influence the p dataset accuracy accordingly over the sahel region the chpclim monthly dataset reliability was higher than that of gpcc funk et al 2015 because most of the considered grid cells used to assess p dataset reliability are in the sahel region fig 1 chirps which uses chpclim provides more realistic monthly precipitation estimates at kge 0 86 than wfdei and persiann cdr which uses gpcc and gpcp respectively fig 3 this demonstrates the importance of maintaining reliable gauge networks to insure accurate p dataset estimates the second factor is the p datasets delivered time step some p datasets are delivered at the daily aggregation level table 1 which is based on different time windows than those used for local records for example persiann cdr daily estimates correspond to a given 0 h to 0 h utc aggregation time period whereas the gauges used in this study register daily amount from 8 h to 8 h utc such temporal inconsistency can introduce large differences between the p datasets and the gauge measurements ashouri et al 2015 satgé et al 2019 therefore only one of the p datasets cmorph bld v 1 delivered at the daily time step ranked in the top five most efficient p datasets on the contrary four of the five most efficient p datasets at the daily time step were delivered at the sub daily time step 3 hourly to hourly table 1 and fig 11 the sub daily time step enables matching of the computed daily estimates with the local record time windows to ensure consistent comparison between gauges and p dataset estimates our results demonstrate the importance of considering both daily and monthly time steps when assessing p dataset reliability because the latter is influenced by the gauge based adjustment process and the delivered time step generally p datasets using gauge based information achieved highest kge scores at both monthly and daily time step figs 3 and 8 which supports previous results obtained over west african regions casse et al 2015 gosset et al 2013 poméon et al 2017 and elsewhere beck et al 2019 dinku et al 2007 satgé et al 2016 however the use of gauge based information for p dataset adjustment is not always as effective indeed gsmap rt v 6 outperformed its adjusted version gsmap adj v 6 at the daily time step this result is consistent with previous observation over the conus beck et al 2019 and illustrates the potential p dataset algorithm limit to consider the best of gauge data gsmap rt v 6 is the only p dataset with no gauge based information of the top five daily ranking therefore gsmap adj v 6 should be highly effective if using the gauge based information in the optimal form 5 2 p dataset reliability in space and time cmorph bld v 1 cmorph crt v 1 gsmap adj v 6 and merra 2 presented weaker performance over the western region in comparison with other p datasets fig 3 we identified one factor to explain this spatial inconsistency different from other p datasets which use gpcc or gpcp data cmorph bld v 1 gsmap adj v 6 and merra 2 use cpc data the gauge number used to retrieve cpc is lower than that used to retrieve gpcc fig 12 a over the senegal gambia guinea bissau and guinea regions only two cpc grid cells counted with more than one gauge against seven for gpcc fig 12b and c as a result compared with gpcc v 7 cpc v 1 presents the lowest efficiency over the western region fig 4 which propagates into the use of cpc by the p datasets to adjust their estimates the available gauge information for retrieving cpc and gpcc datasets also varies with time fig 12a therefore the p dataset reliability could be better worse if considering a period with more fewer available gauges for retrieving gpcc or cpc datasets in this context tamsat v 3 uses consistent gauge based information in space and time rather than a continuously updated information to avoid adding any space or time discrepancy maidment et al 2017 actually p datasets present space and time inconsistencies which cannot be reported by using single temporal windows satgé et al 2019 the authors assessed p dataset reliability over three different four years period and one twelve years period across the lake titicaca region results show that the p dataset reliability conclusion vary according to the considered period therefore the analysis should be conducted over different temporal windows to adequately evaluate the p dataset space and time reliability such a consideration is challenging over west africa owing to the scarcity of gauge networks and the important temporal gaps present to overcome this issue an alternative method could use satellite based soil moisture estimates rather than traditional rain gauges measurements as a reference benchmark massari et al 2017 it is worth mentioning that gpcc and cpc share common gauges with the reference network used in this study as highlighted by many overlapping between both network fig 12b and c similar observation should be done if considering the others gauges based datasets used for p dataset calibration and presented in section 2 2 1 therefore the gauges network used for the assessment is not totally independent of the considered p datasets and could influence p dataset reliability conclusions the p dataset reliability conclusion could have been less optimist if only based on independent gauges network in this context future studies should try to consider totally independent gauges network to provide more consistent feedback on actual p dataset reliability however information on the shared information between national gauges networks and gauges based dataset i e cpc and gpcc is hard to obtain and compromise this kind of consideration 5 3 p datasets sensitivity to seasonal variation reanalysis p datasets era interim merra 2 jra 55 and wfdei performed better during the dry than during the wet season fig 3 this agrees with previous results obtained over the conus beck et al 2019 the authors explained that reanalysis p datasets are better adapted to detecting large scale stratiform systems which are typical in the dry season than unpredictable small scale convective cells which are typical in the wet season on the contrary only satellite based p datasets performed better during the wet than the dry season beck et al 2019 salles et al 2019 satgé et al 2017b actually the irregular sampling of the low earth orbiting satellites and the limited number of overpasses hardly captures short precipitation events which are typical during the dry season gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 tian et al 2009 therefore gsmap rt v 6 presented a better kge value during the wet than that during the dry season fig 3 the seasonality sensitivity of the other p datasets incorporating satellite reanalysis or gauge based information shows a greater contrast because they consider the different inputs despite the seasonal variation in kge value the p datasets presented significantly higher coefficient correlation during the dry season fig 3 this difference could be related to the higher monthly precipitation variability during the dry season fig 1 tending to increase the correlation coefficient accordingly all p datasets presented higher correlation coefficients considering the entire period because the precipitation variability is even more marked than at the seasonal scale at the contrary the p datasets were more biased during the dry season fig 3 except for cpc v 1 gsmap adj v 6 and era interim the p datasets with higher bias values during the dry season tamsat v 3 persiann adj arc 2 gsmap rt v 6 sm2rain cci v 2 jra 55 adj and gpcc v 7 or the wet season cpc v 1 gsmap adj v 6 and era interim presented lower kge scores during this specific season whereas the p datasets with close bias values for both wet and dry seasons chirps v 2 tmpa adj v 7 wfdei persiann cdr mswep v2 2 cmorph crt v 1 chirp v 2 presented similar kge values for both seasons considering the similar seasonal trend observed for both kge and bias values the bias appears to have a dominant influence on the kge score interestingly if considering the p dataset bias in millimetres all p datasets had systematically higher bias values during the wet season fig 13 because lower monthly precipitation occurred during the dry season the same volumetric error millimetres expressed in ratio eq 2 corresponds to higher bias during the dry in comparison to that during the wet season for most of the p datasets the reported bias value during the dry season was 5 mm month 1 fig 13 which should have an insignificant influence on the water budget therefore despite the low kge value during the dry season p datasets still provide valuable additional information to follow both temporal and volume monthly precipitation dynamics over west africa 5 4 p dataset time latency fig 14 shows the kge scores of the nrt p datasets in comparison with the most accurate p dataset at the daily time step at the daily time step gsmap rt v 6 was the most reliable nrt p dataset with three days of time latency the gsmap rt kge at 0 44 was close to the most effective p dataset mswep v 2 2 with kge 0 52 which is available with a few months of latency it is worth mentioning that the low score achieved by the p datasets at the daily time step is partly related to the difference between spatially averaged p dataset grid cell and point reference gauges measurements salles et al 2019 satgé et al 2019 tang et al 2018 the p dataset reliability increased with the number of gauges used to represent the spatially average grid cell measurement salles et al 2019 tang et al 2018 in this study most of the considered 0 1 grid cells were counted with only one gauge therefore the presented kge score may underestimate the actual p dataset reliability testing the sensitivity of streamflow modelling to p datasets at basin outlets overcome the influence of scarce and unevenly distributed gauge networks indeed aggregation of precipitation at the basin scale eliminates the difference in spatial representation between point gauge and areal p datasets measurements because both gauge and p datasets represent precipitation at the basin spatial scale therefore the reliability of p datasets varies significantly when used to reproduce gauge precipitation estimates or streamflow observations satgé et al 2019 in this context nrt p dataset coverage and latency can fit the needs of an early warning system across sparsely gauged or ungauged regions recent studies have successfully used nrt p datasets to follow flood events in terms of streamflow yuan et al 2019 and flood extent belabib et al 2019 or for landslide occurrence estimations brunetti et al 2018 future studies should assess nrt p datasets in the scope of early warning studies to consistently evaluate nrt dataset reliability in this specific context 5 5 towards an enhanced p dataset over west africa this study considers an unprecedented sample of 23 p datasets over the west african region to provide a consistent guideline for potential users the results suggest that during 2000 2003 chirps v 2 and mswep v 2 2 showed the best estimates of monthly and daily precipitation respectively the most reliable p dataset can change at the local scale as an example fig 15 shows the most suitable p datasets for representing both monthly and daily precipitation at the grid cell level interestingly at the daily time step mswep v 2 2 was more consistent for the western region whereas cmorph p datasets provided more accurate estimates over the central and southern regions fig 15 at the monthly time step even if chirp s p datasets are counted with the highest number of grid cells large spatial heterogeneity is observed with many grid cells where wfdei jra 55 adj cmorph and tmpa outperformed chirp s fig 15 to take advantage of all available p datasets merging all p datasets to produce an enhanced p dataset over the region is a good option previous studies have reported on the benefit of such an approach to retrieve a more realistic p dataset over pakistan muhammad et al 2018 rahman et al 2018 tibet ma et al 2018 and different tropical complex terrain bhuiyan et al 2019 these ensemble precipitation datasets enhance the regional precipitation representation and should be used as guideline over west africa 6 conclusions the present study evaluates the accuracy of 23 gridded p datasets over the west african region at both monthly and daily time step for the 2000 2003 period despite the limited coverage and scarcity of the ground reference points some consistent features emerged from the analysis the p dataset performance ranking differs at the monthly and daily timescale p datasets using sub daily monthly gauge information perform better at the daily monthly time step additionally for the p datasets released at the daily time step the temporal mismatch between gauge and satellite reporting times decrease their reliability at the daily time step in this line mswep v 2 2 and chirps v 2 provide the most reliable daily and monthly precipitation estimates respectively whereas tmpa adj v 7 performance is very good for both daily and monthly estimates the only satellite based p datasets cmorph rt v 1 tmpa rt v 7 persiann rt gsmap v 6 rt performance is very low at both monthly and daily time scale their reliability drastically increase for their adjusted versions cmorph crt and bld v 1 tmpa adj v 7 persiann adj excepted for gsmap v 6 at the daily time step all the considered reanalysis p datasets wfdei jra 55 jra 55 adj era interim are unreliable at the daily time step the use of monthly gpcc p dataset to adjust their estimates considerably increase their reliability at the monthly time step wfdei jra 55 adj the two african p datasets tamsat v 3 and arc 2 present an overall lower performance in comparison to the almost global scale p datasets at both daily and monthly time step despite good performance in some parts of the region sm2rain cci v 2 still suffers too many gaps in space and time across west african all p datasets present spatial discrepancies in their statistical score suggesting the use of a spatial p datasets merging approach to take advantage from all available p datasets across west africa it should be reminded that most of the considered 0 1 grid cells count with only one gauge to represent the observed precipitation because of spatial inconsistency between point gauges and spatially average p datasets measurement different conclusion regarding the p datasets reliability could have been drawn if more gauges had been available per grid cells or if using p datasets as forcing data for hydrological modelling additionally the study is based on a single four years temporal window however p dataset reliability vary in time and the results could have been different if considering another four years temporal window or a larger one therefore this study aims more at compare the p dataset reliability between them rather than to provide definitive conclusion on their respective accuracy credit authorship contribution statement

5889,recent changes in global climate and especially changes in precipitation patterns may negatively impact on siltation of andean storage reservoirs thereby putting at risk the provision of resources to the local population the extent to which this may happen is poorly understood we therefore studied the catchment of the cañete river in the western peruvian coastal range as it plays an important role in the socioeconomic development of the region it houses the 220 mw el platanal hydroelectric plant and the capillucas reservoir that provide the surrounding areas with water and energy we used a hydrological model hec hms coupled with a sediment transport model hec ras to simulate future changes in river discharge and sediment load this information was then used to calculate the siltation of the capillucas storage reservoir ten scenarios were developed a combination of two different precipitation patterns and five different precipitation rates the precipitation patterns differed in the distribution of the precipitation change during the rainfall season and the precipitation rates differed in the extent of change in precipitation amounts the average sediment load of the cañete river was estimated at 981 kton yr upstream of the capillucas reservoir and showed that the calculated life span of the capillucas reservoir is about 17 years the most pessimistic scenario suggested a reduction in the life span of the reservoir to 7 years and the most optimistic scenario to 31 years even under the most optimistic scenario the life span of the reservoir is shorter than its officially expected functionality of 50 years as such our results demonstrated the vulnerability of andean hydroelectric reservoirs against future climate change keywords soil erosion sediment transport climate change andes hydroelectric projects storage dams extreme events 1 introduction the global water storage capacity of hydroelectric reservoirs is decreasing annually while the economic activity the hydropower industry and the world population continue to grow strongly palmieri et al 2003 therefore sustainable management of reservoirs and water resource infrastructure is necessary to guarantee the projected usable lifespan of the hydroelectric infrastructure for future generations about 80 of the reservoir volume in europe will be filled up with sediments by the year 2080 and in north america by the year 2060 hauer et al 2018 likewise in the near future the hydropower sector will be impacted by an increase in sediment production due to global warming hauer et al 2018 large dams interrupt water flow and sediment transport and trigger deposition of sediments in the middle or lower reaches of rivers as well as inundations of the surrounding areas sedimentation in the reservoirs might add compressional forces on the dam structure thereby exceeding the normal hydrostatic design and the decrease of water storage in the reservoir and clogging of water intake also hinders the production of energy morris et al 2008 annandale et al 2016 in this sense the world bank proposed a life cycle management approach for reservoir infrastructure with special emphasis on the economic evaluation of sediment management palmieri et al 2003 it highlighted techniques to reduce the influx of sediments to manage and evacuate sediments from the reservoir and to replace lost storage of the reservoirs the boom in hydropower development in andean river basins was identified as one of the top 15 global conservation issues sutherland et al 2013 for this region the electricity generation might increase by 550 from 2005 to the year 2050 thereby needing an increase in water volume from 70 5 billion m3 to 150 7 billion m3 wec 2010 of the andean countries peru has the highest numbers of existing and proposed hydropower projects because of its rapidly evolving energy demands estimated at 8 growth per year and regulatory framework that aims at promoting renewable energy tamayo et al 2016 world bank 2017 existing studies on the sustainability of its reservoirs are mainly focused on the largest ones for example the gallito ciego and poechos reservoirs in northwestern

reservoir was highly affected by recent el niño events where the average sediment fluxes exceeded those of normal years by a factor of 11 thereby shortening its life span considerably tote et al 2011 despite these initial efforts studies that describe the impact of changing sediment transfer due to climate change to the hydroelectric infrastructural system are still limited latrubesse and restrepo 2014 this is reason for concern as andean countries like peru are highly vulnerable to changes in precipitation rates and patterns as shown by the recent 2017 and 2018 el niño southern oscillation enso events cadilhac et al 2017 these high intensity runoff events are associated with landsliding clark et al 2016 mudflows tote et al 2011 and gully erosion molina et al 2008 and potentially lead to catastrophic flooding downstream coppus and imeson 2002 roman gonzalez et al 2019 during such extreme rainfall events the suspended sediment concentrations in andean rivers may be 360 times higher when compared to normal conditions molina et al 2015 morera et al 2013 this paper evaluates the potential impact of climate variability on the water storage capacity of hydroelectric reservoirs in andean countries via a case study of the cañete river in the peruvian coastal range by using a coupled hydrological sediment transport model we assessed projected changes in sediment transport rates under different scenarios of precipitation variability the model simulations allowed us to evaluate the possible impacts of precipitation change on the life cycle of a hydroelectric plant 2 study area

platanal s a celepsa the plant has been operational since 2010 and generates up to 220 mwatt of electricity tamayo et al 2016 the capillucas dam is 36 m high 60 m long and located at an elevation of 1543 m a s l its maximum water storage is 1 4 106 m3 of which 0 8 106 m3 corresponds to the usable capacity the cañete basin is highly affected by rapid siltation with sediment delivery from landslides mud and debris flows and gully erosion principally in the middle and middle upper reaches of the basin fig 2b the geomorphic activity is mainly triggered by extreme rainfall events that characterize the area especially in the headwaters indeci 2012 rau et al 2017 in some tributaries the amount of transported sediment in suspension affects periodically the local infrastructure water quality and local economic activity indeci 2012 2017a b 2 2 physiographic characteristics the lower cañete basin is formed in a series of extensional tectonic basins in which over 600 m of sediments have accumulated during the cenozoic viveen and schlunegger 2018 the basin lithology presents a large variability of sedimentary plutonic and volcanic rocks fig 2a granites acid plutonic cover most of the lower basin coastal range whereas alluvial fans debris flows and ancient flood plains occupy the valley floor sedimentary rocks such as sandstones and limestones and intermediate volcanic rocks occur in the middle and middle upper reaches of the basin the upper basin reach is made up of carbonate rich sedimentary rocks such as limestones and dolomites above 4500 m a s l glacial landforms and peri glacial sediments are present the cañete basin experiences an annual average temperature of 20 c the rainfall rate in the basin normally ranges from 2 2 mm day to 44 mm day but surpasses 70 mm day during enso events celepsa unpublished data within the basin there is a strong topographic control on rainfall patterns with mean annual precipitation amounts ranging from 20 mm in the lower part of the basin 721 m a s l to more than 1000 mm in the upper part of the basin 4675 m a s l since the 1950 s a significant warming was reported for central peru with a temperature increase of roughly 0 1 c per decade vuille et al 2018 future temperature projections for the cañete basin suggest temperature increases ranging from 1 c to 4 c by the end of the 21th century fluixá et al 2018 in contrast to the widely reported warming trend over the andes the trends in precipitation are more difficult to predict due to the interannual variability driven by enso and the scarcity of long observational meteorological records vuille et al 2018 south american regional climate change models do not provide clear indications of future precipitation change marengo et al 2010 chou et al 2014 and large uncertainties remain regarding the long term trends in precipitation amounts vuille et al 2018 recently fluixá et al 2018 used downscaling techniques based on gcm cmip5 circulation models to address these issues their predictions showed large uncertainties in the projected rainfall trends for the cañete basin with projected changes ranging from 17 to 24 by the end of the 21st century 3 materials and methods a coupled hydrological and sediment transport model was built to simulate water flow and sediment transport in the cañete river upstream of the capillucas dam fig 3 the hec hms u s army corps of engineers 2000 and hec ras u s army corps of engineering 2016 platforms were applied to simulate precipitation runoff and sediment transport both models have been widely applied in the usa to describe discharge and sediment transfer in river channels knebl et al 2005 pereira et al 2009 and to some extent in data poor regions halwatura and najim 2013 amini et al 2014 3 1 hydrological model the hec hms platform was developed to simulate precipitation runoff and hydrologic processes of dendritic basins u s army corps of engineers 2000 it is based on a structure of sub basins that are interconnected through a channel network and rainfall runoff generation is calculated independently for each sub basin the model assumes a closed hydrological system where one part of the precipitation returns to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration another part infiltrates into the surface and the remaining part is evacuated by overland flow thus the stream flow is the combination of overland flow precipitation in water bodies such as lakes and base flow in the model baseflow is set to a constant value fig 4 based on the observation of a constant and permanent low flow during the rainy and dry seasons coustau et al 2012 mccuen 2004 in the dry seasons the meltwater of the glaciers located in the headwaters of the cañete basin provide the base flow as a first step the hec hms platform assigns the observed rainfall data to every sub basin by applying an inverse distance weighting algorithm u s army corps of engineers 2000 because the number of meteorological stations is limited we slightly modified the algorithm to account for the strong correlation between precipitation and altitude in the region compare to chang et al 2005 this modification allows for a better rainfall distribution by reducing the uncertainty related to the limited number of meteorological stations eq 1 1 p x t 1 n d i j δ z i k p i t 1 n d i j δ z i k where d is the distance m between the meteorological station i and the evaluated point x δz is the elevation difference m between i and x p is the daily precipitation amount mm day n is the number of meteorological stations and j and k are geographic parameters the hec hms model considers losses through evapotranspiration and infiltration evapotranspiration loss has been estimated by the turc equation eq 2 diouf et al 2016 2 et 0 a c r g b t t 15 where et0 is the potential daily evapotranspiration mm day t is the average daily air temperature c rg is the global radiation in mj m2 day and a b and c are empirical parameters to obtain the accumulative infiltration loss the initial and constant rate models have been considered u s army corps of engineers 2000 here the precipitation which is neither retained on the land surface nor infiltrated into the soil also known as precipitation excess pet is estimated as the difference between the mean regional precipitation pt and the maximum potential rate of loss fc the regional precipitation is derived from the local meteorological stations whereas the rate of loss corresponds to localized event based infiltration interception and evapotranspiration until the mean precipitation exceeds the rate of loss no overland flow occurs eq 3 3 pe t p t f c if p t f c 0 otherwise to transform the precipitation excess into overland flow the kinematic wave method was applied in order to simulate the hydrologic flow in the river channel this methodology is based on the continuity equation and a simplified form of the momentum equation for the cañete basin we accounted for base flow in the river channel and assessed the base flow from the sustained runoff during the dry period the hec hms model includes the constant monthly base flow model where the average discharge in the dry season is added to the overland flow computed for each time step of the simulation u s army corps of engineers 2000 3 2 sediment transport model the hec ras model is capable of modelling sediment transport comprising bed and suspended river load based on field observations we assumed that the cañete river is a transport limited fluvial system in its middle and lower reach we used the transport equation of ackers and white 1973 in the hec ras platform it considers parameters of transport mobility and particle size and is capable of distinguishing between fine and transitionary particles 0 06 2 mm and coarse sediments 2mm eq 4 presents the non dimensional transport function ggr 4 g gr c f gr a a m which depends on the sediment mobility non dimensional parameter fgr eq 5 5 f

the mean flow velocity m s h is the effective flow depth m c and m are the coefficient and the exponent of transport formula respectively a is the non dimensional threshold of mobility and n is a non dimensional transition parameter parameters n m a and c depend on the non dimensional sediment size dgr described by eq 6 this parameter is capable of characterizing both suspended fine and transitionary sediments and coarse sediments 6 d gr d g s 1 v 2 1 3 in which v is the kinematic viscosity m2 s and parameters d g and s were described above for suspended sediment 1 d gr 60 the

s d h v and v were described above to simulate bed sorting and armouring hec ras uses the thomas mixing method formerly exner 5 that estimates the coarse armour or inactive layer which limits the transport capacity of a river u s army corps of engineering 2016 the method describes the gradations of the active layer which includes the cover and subsurface layers in order to assess the transport capacity of the river additionally the particle fall velocity ω influences the ability to set a particle into motion to keep it suspended and to have it transported the suspension of a particle is initiated once the bed level shear velocity is similar to ω equation 12 proposed by rubey u s army corps of engineering 2016 is applicable to the entire range of particle sizes e g gravel sand and

and 13 were already presented above 3 3 model calibration to calibrate the hydrological and sediment transport model the modelled discharge and sediment load were compared against stream flow and sediment measurements in the river channel to assess the models performance five efficiency indexes were selected table 1 namely the nash sutcliffe efficiency e the coefficient of determination r2 the index of agreement d the relative volume bias rvb and the kling gupta efficiency kge the first three are widely used in hydrological modelling krause et al 2005 while the efficiency e is capable of evaluating basin dynamics the disadvantage is that it presents the differences between the observed and predicted values as squared values thus the highest values are overestimated while the lowest ones are underestimated the coefficient r2 describes the combined dispersion against the single dispersion of the observed and predicted series a value of 1 means that the dispersion of the prediction is equal to that of the observation unlike e this parameter is not sensitive to over or underestimated model outputs the index d represents the ratio of the mean square error and the potential error where the numerator in the equation table 1 is sensitive to peak values thereby overcoming the weakness of e and r2 indexes to account for low values we also included the rvb index moussa and chahinian 2009 finally the kge parameter gupta et al 2009 is based on a multi objective criterion that includes three components namely correlation bias and variability measures 3 4 data 3 4 1 discharge and sediments the hydrometeorology of the cañete basin is monitored by a private company ambiand that installed 12 meteorological ground stations fig 5 six of them record rainfall and temperature five only rainfall and one only temperature the meteorological data corresponds to daily precipitation mm day and temperature c collected over a 6 year period 2010 2015 ambiand unpublished data we only used meteorological data recorded after the year 2010 as earlier records were discontinuous time series see table 2 the basin contains 13 gauging stations distributed along the river channel fig 5 these stations provided daily discharge data m3 s and we used the flow data from the years 2014 2015 ambiand unpublished data to calibrate the model six gauging stations that are situated upstream of the capillucas dam were selected for the hydrological model calibration namely tanta azuchas huantan cacuciri putinza and chavin gauging stations fig 5 detailed information on sediment transport for chavin gauging station is available from celepsa that owns the el platanal hydroelectric plant table 2 before the construction of the capillucas reservoir sediment transport was measured several times a day during the months december to february rainy season of the four consecutive years 1998 to 2001 a total of 2465 water samples was collected at chavin station using an us dh 48 depth integrating suspended sediment sampler samples were analysed following the astm d3977 analysis method to determine the sediment concentration at chavin station sediment concentrations of up to 12 g l were measured to obtain information on the spatial variation in sediment transport within the cañete basin a new monitoring campaign was organised from january 2018 to march 2018 during this campaign water with suspended sediment samples were collected twice a day in 1 l bottles using an us dh 48 depth integrating suspended sediment sampler a total of 256 sediment samples were collected at four stations chavin putinza huantan and azuchas fig 2 fig 5 the samples were analysed in the laboratory also following the test method b filtration from the astm standard d3977 in order to determine sediment concentrations 3 4 2 basin distribution and channel geometry the cañete river basin was divided into 25 sub basins based on differences in altitude and climatological conditions fig 2b fourteen lakes with surface areas 0 4 km2 ana 2016 were modelled as natural reservoirs likewise the paucarcocha and capillucas storage dams were included in the model domain the model domain covered a length of about 228 km of the cañete river in the lower most reach the river enters a large extensional tectonic basin and consequently the river channel widens significantly with less vertical incision for this reach we considered a trapezoidal channel shape and estimated its dimensions from field observations and google earth images 3 4 3 bedload grain size image processing techniques were used to estimate the superficial grain size distribution of the bedload in the upper middle upper middle and lower part reach of the cañete river e g litty et al 2017 a 1 5 m 1 5 m square frame was placed on the gravel bars that were deposited on the proximal floodplain it has been shown that by using a frame the bias induced through preferential sampling of the clasts is reduced marcus et al 1995 ipcc 2014 for each sample site four high resolution photographs of the gravel bars were taken fig 2b the grain size distribution was calculated by digital image analysis techniques detert and weitbrecht 2012 the gravel bars of the upper reach contained a large fraction of big boulders and some bedrock outcrops table 3 the ones of the middle and middle upper reaches contained a mix of cobbles and pebbles 16 mm and sand particles and the lower section is rich in small gravels and fine particles 4 mm 3 4 4 rating curves the gauging records table 2 were used to construct a rating curve to characterize the relationship between the water flow q and the sediment load qs for the sediment data from celepsa at chavin station the curve was based on the average of the top 25 values to account for the maximum values since the 1998 2001 monitoring campaign took place before the construction of the capillucas dam in 2006 the rating curve of 1998 2001 for chavin station was assigned to the putinza station located upstream of the dam fig 5 fig 6 illustrates the power relation with exponent 2 5 between the sediment load and the discharge in the middle reach of the cañete river here the river transports water with low sediment concentrations fig 6 during the dry season i e 0 78 g l for discharge of 50 m3 s and high sediment concentration during discharge peaks i e 3 08 g l for 250 m3 s the values are congruent with an earlier report from morera et al 2013 likewise based on the data from our sediment monitoring campaign at chavin putinza huantan and azuchas stations in 2018 table 2 we derived sediment ratings curves for the four stations and assigned them to chavin putinza huantan and azuchas calibration sites fig 7 3 5 scenarios of climate variability a total of 10 climate change scenarios were constructed a combination of two different precipitation patterns and five different precipitation amounts the precipitation patterns a and b differ in the distribution of the rainfall change over the rainy season scenario a simulated the daily rainfall change distributed over the whole rainy season while scenario b distributed the variability over the moments with the highest precipitation only i e the upper 99 percentile in the precipitation record for each precipitation pattern a and b the amount of precipitation change was based on rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate change model simulations moss et al 2008 from two global circulation models giss e h p3 and mpi esm mr table 4 gives an overview of the predicted change in seasonal rainfall by the giss e h p3 and mpi esm mr models fluixá et al 2018 for the 21st century the change in precipitation ranges from 24 to 15 for the rainy season december to february and from 33 to 24 in the dry season june to august based on table 4 we generated 5 scenarios that included a variation of 5 8 10 15 and 17 of the total rainfall amount in the rainy season table 5 4 results 4 1 hydrological model the results for six gauging stations present a marked increase in discharge including high flow rates during the rainy season dec apr followed by a sustained low rate in the dry season may nov fig 8 during most of the model runs the modelled data followed the same discharge pattern as the observed flow data likewise the high r2 and d values r2 0 67 and d 0 85 and rvb of around zero in most of the stations table 6 are indicative for an acceptable model performance at the seasonal timescale bárdossy and das 2008 singh and bárdossy 2012 halwatura and najim 2013 haberlandt and radtke 2014 nevertheless a constant underestimation of 15 to 25 in the modelled discharge peaks was observed for the tanta huantan and cacuciri stations fig 8 while the model efficiency improved for the second half of the rainy season the calibration indexes correspond to an acceptable hydrological model performance table 6 especially when considering the poor spatial distribution of the available hydro meteorological data and the heterogeneity in climate topography soils and vegetation 4 2 sediment transport model given that few data are available on sediment transport in the basin the sediment transport model was calibrated here with the sediment loads that were derived from the 2018 rating curves qs vs q of the chavin huantan azucha and putinza station fig 7 the rating curves are based on the sediment concentration and discharge measurements in each control point fig 7 the model results are congruent with the overall spatial pattern of sediment loads within the cañete catchment based on daily estimations in general the model results were acceptable with model efficiency indexes r2 0 5 d 1 and e 0 5 for most stations although the rvb and kge indexes did not reach their optimum values table 7 a comparison between the rating curve derived and modelled data showed that the highest modelled sediment loads qs were underestimated by 35 to 50 fig 9 for huantan station the model underestimated sediment load by 80 at the end of the rainy season and the r2 0 6 and e 0 5 indexes showed low values even though the d parameter 0 7 reflected a good model performance similarly the model underestimated in azucha station the sediment load by about 0 5 kton day on average and 1 kton day during peak flows the sediment transport model predicts an annual sediment load of 981 kton yr at the putinza calibration site corresponding to a mean physical erosion rate of 0 12 mm yr for the 3081 km2 watershed upstream of putinza station table 8 in the capillucas storage dam the model predicts a sediment accumulation of 217 kton per year corresponding to a siltation rate of 82 103 m3 per year these values should be considered as minimum estimates given the underestimation of the sediment loads by the sediment transport model table 7 4 3 scenario analyses fig 10 shows the rainfall runoff graphs for the middle part of the cañete basin based on the rainfall hyetograph for yauyos meteorological station and the streamflow hydrograph for putinza station the graphs include the model run for 2014 2015 and the model outcomes for the eight projected rainfall scenarios with rainfall increases of 5 8 10 and 15 as expected an increase in precipitation rate led to an increase in streamflow this increase is largest for the rainfall scenarios where the rainfall increase was distributed over the upper 99 percentile of the precipitation records a nonlinear relation was observed between the increment in the rainfall amount and the streamflow with an abrupt increase in discharge when augmenting the rainfall amount with only 5 fig 11 illustrates the nonlinear response of the streamflow to changes in the rainfall amount for putinza station when increasing the rainfall amount with only 5 the average streamflow increased by 12 m3 s or 2 m3 s per of rainfall increase the increase in streamflow levels off to 0 4 and 0 5 m3 s per of rainfall increase when increasing the rainfall amount by an additional 3 i e between 5 and 8 for an equal amount of precipitation increase the b scenarios where the rainfall was distributed amongst the upper 99 percentile of rainfall events showed the largest increase in average streamflow fig 11 the sediment load transported by the cañete river was estimated at putinza station a positive relation exists between the rainfall increase and the sediment load in the river at putinza fig 12 a where an increase in rainfall amount leads to a nonlinear increase in sediment load with an increase in rainfall amount between 5 and 10 the sediment load increases only slightly with 1 7 for the a scenario and increases proportionally with 5 5 for the b scenario an additional increase in rainfall amount from 10 to 15 leads to a higher increase of 11 3 and 20 in sediment load per of rainfall increase for the a and b scenarios with maximum sediment loads of 1 1 mton yr scenario a 15 and 1 3 mton yr scenario b 15 besides the nonlinear response of sediment load to precipitation increments the model simulations showed that the rainfall pattern plays an important role in controlling sediment transport in all cases the b scenarios led to higher sediment loads than the a scenarios fig 12a for example an increase in discharge with 15 resulted in sediment loads that were 195 kton yr higher for the b compared to the a scenario the change in sediment load in the river channel has consequences for the siltation rate in the storage reservoir of capillucas the sediment that is delivered to the dam progressively reduced the water storage capacity of the reservoir fig 12c using the 2014 2015 calibration dataset the average life cycle of the capillucas dam is estimated at 17 years our results suggested that a regular increase in the precipitation of 5 and 15 might reduce the useful life to resp 16 and 10 years when the increase in precipitation occurred during the peak rainfall events only then the life cycle of the reservoir is rapidly reduced to respectively 13 and 7 years for scenario b 5 and b 15 scenarios a 17 and b 17 were the most optimistic scenarios with a reduction of 900 ton yr in the sediment load and trapped sediment volume and subsequent increase in the life cycle of the reservoir to 27 a 17 and 31 years b 17 fig 12a and b 5 discussion 5 1 limitations of gauge based sediment load measurements one of the main issues to assess the impact climate change will have on fluvial systems is the scarcity of observed hydrometeorological data guyot 2007 lavado 2012 rau et al 2017 commonly the spatial distribution of rainfall and discharge measurement stations is limited and the recorded data do not present continuous time series this is especially true for the andean countries restrepo and syvitski 2006 latrubesse and restrepo 2014 our hydrological model yielded average calibration indexes for most of the gauging stations fig 8 but underestimated discharge peaks this is probably related to the temporal resolution of the input data the daily resolution of the data allowed us to simulate the overall pattern of daily discharge but to have an adequate representation of peak discharges the input data need to have a finer i e hourly resolution beven 2012 the underestimation of the modelled sediment transport for some of the stations is likely because of the limited sediment concentration data used to build the sediment rating curves fig 6 y 7 this will likely have a significant impact on our modelling outcomes as the cañete river is a transport limited system the limitations of rating curves to represent the large variations in sediment load related to seasonal effects and antecedent conditions in river basin were identified in a large range of climate conditions walling 1977 asselman 2000 moges et al 2016 tenorio et al 2018 likewise the short duration of the sediment monitoring campaigns for both the modelling only one sampling station and the calibration only one campaign during the 2018 rainy season exercises limit model performance even so other issues like change in grain size distribution or error propagation from the hydrological model outcomes might also play a role furthermore estimating sediment yields bases on stream gauge measurements strongly depends on i the assumption of stationarity in the flood records and ii the reliability of the sediment rating curves for extreme discharge events it is likely that climate variability due to the influence of enso in the cañete basin will affect the assumption of an evenly distributed frequency of flood events machado et al 2015 molina et al 2015 in addition the sediment rating curve fig 6 that was used as input of the sediment transport model was based on observations of total suspended solids although the range of flow rates during the 1998 2001 monitoring period is not different from the daily flow rates of the model simulations it is clear from figs 6 and 7 that the sediment concentration data is heteroskedastic the sediment load estimates derived from the limited gauge data are therefore associated with larger uncertainty for high and very high flow rates fig 6 illustrates how the sediment rating curve at chavin station before the construction of the dam fails to predict the 3 g l sediment concentrations observed at very high flow rates of 250 m3 s fig 6 this affects the precision of the sediment transport model where the annual sediment load is reasonably well predicted notwithstanding the underestimation of the sediment load during extreme events 5 2 potential impact of climate variability on water storage capacity of hydroelectric reservoirs the coupled hydrological sediment transport model calibrated for the 2014 2015 period predicted a sediment load of 981 kton yr or 370 103 m3 yr or 318 ton km2 yr upstream of the capillucas reservoir our estimates for the cañete river are lower than the sediment fluxes that were reported by morera et al 2013 and latrubesse and restrepo 2014 for the northern peruvian coast where modern sediment fluxes of 779 and 1000 ton km2 yr were reported the latter rivers are located along the northern coast where enso events periodically trigger high rainfall rates and a significant increase in river discharge the modern physical erosion rate of 0 12 mm yr or 981 kton yr for putinza station table 8 is in line with published 10be derived denudation rates of the cañete and adjacent river systems the 10be derived denudation rates integrate over 103 to 104 years and are representative for the long term denudation rates of the basin vanacker et al 2015 reber et al 2017 reported 10be derived denudation rates of 0 05 mm yr for the lower reach of the cañete river where the river is located in a wide alluvial valley flanked by low gradient hillslopes in adjacent catchments south of cañete 10be derived catchment wide denudation rates of 0 08 to 0 13 mm yr were reported by abbühl et al 2011 and bekaddour et al 2014 along the peruvian coastal range a strong relation between rainfall amount and sediment load is expected based on previous works e g morera et al 2013 the interannual rainfall pattern plays an important role where enso events induce high rainfall rates over a short time as shown by the modelled b scenarios therefore a very high amount of sediment production can be expected during such episodic events pepin et al 2010 this is corroborated by data from the piura region in northern peru which is highly susceptible to enso events here a sediment flux of 20 mton yr latrubesse and restrepo 2014 or a maximum denudation rate of 0 185 mm yr abbühl et al 2011 was calculated for enso events the northern peruvian jequetepeque river basin exhibits high erosion rates of 0 1 0 9 mm yr during enso events estrada et al 2009 pepin et al 2013 a context similar to enso events is performed by scenarios b 10 and b 15 that investigated the occurrence of extreme precipitation resulting in a denudation rate of 0 13 and 0 16 mm yr respectively however most of the published denudation studies represent average values over geological time scales there is a lack of quantitative analysis of contemporary erosion and denudation rates for extreme events such as enso but observations from a recent coastal el niño event in 2017 indeci 2017a show that the denudation rates are likely 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than indicated in the aforementioned studies abbühl et al 2011 estrada et al 2009 pepin et al 2013 furthermore these recent events also provide insights into physical mechanisms of sediment transport dynamics especially in the dry middle and lower reaches of the cañete river ephemeral tributary channels are activated during extreme rainfall events and transport large sediment loads to the cañete river where virtually all gauging stations are located the tributaries are typically discharge limited and not sediment limited so due to its climatic and geologic conditions sediment production and transport dynamics in the cañete catchment are strongly driven by extreme events which makes the modelling of transport dynamics challenging our results furthermore suggested an average sedimentation rate into the capillucas reservoir of 217 kton yr or 82 103 m3 yr or 70 ton yr per km2 of drainage area table 8 under extreme enso induced conditions the calculated rates were 110 ton yr and 180 ton yr per km2 of drainage area fig 12b for scenarios b 10 and b 15 respectively likewise our model results suggested a strong relationship between the stored sediment the rainfall amount and rainfall pattern it is worth stressing the fact that the impact of exogenous geomorphic hazards e g dam sedimentation has devastating consequences alcántara ayala 2002 vanacker et al 2018 despite its limitations the methodology we propose is highly replicable and could be used to assess other dams in developing countries most studies related to sediment transport in peru were focused so far at the principal reservoirs that are periodically impacted by enso the gallito ciego reservoir trapped 14 mton yr 3 8 kton yr per km2 of drainage area taking into account a sediment density of 2 65 ton m3 between the years 1991 2007 walter et al 2012 equally the poechos reservoir trapped a mean sediment amount of 16 mton yr 1 3 kton yr per km2 of drainage area tote et al 2011 those rates are higher to the ones observed in the cañete basin and show that the peruvian hydroelectric reservoirs are highly vulnerable to climate variability with an annual increase of 8 in energy demand and strong impulse of the hydroelectric sector peru is in a prime position to push for sustainable development of the hydroelectric sector 6 conclusions the amount of sediment transported in andean rivers may increase over the next years due to climate variability and change as a result hydroelectric reservoirs could be silting up more rapidly than anticipated the methodology presented in this paper coupled a hydrological and sediment transport model to model the sediment load of the 6049 km2 large cañete river basin in the peruvian andes ten climate change scenarios were developed to evaluate the potential impact of precipitation change on stream discharge and sediment load the model outcomes showed that the amount of precipitation as well as the precipitation pattern controls the amount of sediment transported by the cañete river the sediment load presents a nonlinear positive exponential relationship with the change in precipitation rate thereby showing the importance of extreme climate events on sediment load a simulation of transported sediments influenced by a 15 increase in the moments of highest precipitation shows that peak discharge qs may increase with 34 the average sediment load was estimated at 981 175 ton yr or 0 12 mm yr upstream of the capillucas reservoir which is in agreement with published denudation rates for the area our results show that the lifespan of the capillucas reservoir ranges from 7 years for the most pessimistic scenario to 31 years for the most optimistic scenario this is much shorter than the projected lifespan of 50 years peru currently has a large growth in energy demand of 8 per year and has pushed a significant growth in hydroelectricity of all andean countries but peru is also expected to be strongly affected by climate change our pilot study therefore shows that silting of hydroelectric reservoirs may become a serious issue if counter

5889,recent changes in global climate and especially changes in precipitation patterns may negatively impact on siltation of andean storage reservoirs thereby putting at risk the provision of resources to the local population the extent to which this may happen is poorly understood we therefore studied the catchment of the cañete river in the western peruvian coastal range as it plays an important role in the socioeconomic development of the region it houses the 220 mw el platanal hydroelectric plant and the capillucas reservoir that provide the surrounding areas with water and energy we used a hydrological model hec hms coupled with a sediment transport model hec ras to simulate future changes in river discharge and sediment load this information was then used to calculate the siltation of the capillucas storage reservoir ten scenarios were developed a combination of two different precipitation patterns and five different precipitation rates the precipitation patterns differed in the distribution of the precipitation change during the rainfall season and the precipitation rates differed in the extent of change in precipitation amounts the average sediment load of the cañete river was estimated at 981 kton yr upstream of the capillucas reservoir and showed that the calculated life span of the capillucas reservoir is about 17 years the most pessimistic scenario suggested a reduction in the life span of the reservoir to 7 years and the most optimistic scenario to 31 years even under the most optimistic scenario the life span of the reservoir is shorter than its officially expected functionality of 50 years as such our results demonstrated the vulnerability of andean hydroelectric reservoirs against future climate change keywords soil erosion sediment transport climate change andes hydroelectric projects storage dams extreme events 1 introduction the global water storage capacity of hydroelectric reservoirs is decreasing annually while the economic activity the hydropower industry and the world population continue to grow strongly palmieri et al 2003 therefore sustainable management of reservoirs and water resource infrastructure is necessary to guarantee the projected usable lifespan of the hydroelectric infrastructure for future generations about 80 of the reservoir volume in europe will be filled up with sediments by the year 2080 and in north america by the year 2060 hauer et al 2018 likewise in the near future the hydropower sector will be impacted by an increase in sediment production due to global warming hauer et al 2018 large dams interrupt water flow and sediment transport and trigger deposition of sediments in the middle or lower reaches of rivers as well as inundations of the surrounding areas sedimentation in the reservoirs might add compressional forces on the dam structure thereby exceeding the normal hydrostatic design and the decrease of water storage in the reservoir and clogging of water intake also hinders the production of energy morris et al 2008 annandale et al 2016 in this sense the world bank proposed a life cycle management approach for reservoir infrastructure with special emphasis on the economic evaluation of sediment management palmieri et al 2003 it highlighted techniques to reduce the influx of sediments to manage and evacuate sediments from the reservoir and to replace lost storage of the reservoirs the boom in hydropower development in andean river basins was identified as one of the top 15 global conservation issues sutherland et al 2013 for this region the electricity generation might increase by 550 from 2005 to the year 2050 thereby needing an increase in water volume from 70 5 billion m3 to 150 7 billion m3 wec 2010 of the andean countries peru has the highest numbers of existing and proposed hydropower projects because of its rapidly evolving energy demands estimated at 8 growth per year and regulatory framework that aims at promoting renewable energy tamayo et al 2016 world bank 2017 existing studies on the sustainability of its reservoirs are mainly focused on the largest ones for example the gallito ciego and poechos reservoirs in northwestern peru the admissible sediment s storage limit dead storage in gallito ciego reservoir was reached in 10 years even though its designed lifespan was 50 years ramirez and cisneros 2007 the poechos reservoir was highly affected by recent el niño events where the average sediment fluxes exceeded those of normal years by a factor of 11 thereby shortening its life span considerably tote et al 2011 despite these initial efforts studies that describe the impact of changing sediment transfer due to climate change to the hydroelectric infrastructural system are still limited latrubesse and restrepo 2014 this is reason for concern as andean countries like peru are highly vulnerable to changes in precipitation rates and patterns as shown by the recent 2017 and 2018 el niño southern oscillation enso events cadilhac et al 2017 these high intensity runoff events are associated with landsliding clark et al 2016 mudflows tote et al 2011 and gully erosion molina et al 2008 and potentially lead to catastrophic flooding downstream coppus and imeson 2002 roman gonzalez et al 2019 during such extreme rainfall events the suspended sediment concentrations in andean rivers may be 360 times higher when compared to normal conditions molina et al 2015 morera et al 2013 this paper evaluates the potential impact of climate variability on the water storage capacity of hydroelectric reservoirs in andean countries via a case study of the cañete river in the peruvian coastal range by using a coupled hydrological sediment transport model we assessed projected changes in sediment transport rates under different scenarios of precipitation variability the model simulations allowed us to evaluate the possible impacts of precipitation change on the life cycle of a hydroelectric plant 2 study area cañete river basin 2 1 socioeconomic characteristics the cañete river is located approximately 150 km south of lima peru the basin has an extension of 6049 km2 and connects the peruvian andes to the pacific ocean fig 1 the lower fig 2 b arid part of the cañete basin 0 1500 m a s l is an important agricultural area that produces fig avocado lúcuma orchards sugar cane alfalfa crops and river shrimps inei 2017 the middle basin fig 2b is predominantly sub humid and hosts subsistence agriculture the upper part 4000 m a s l is a treeless high elevation puna landscape where the nor yauyos national park is located this is an important karst area with extensive limestone caves and upwelling of subterraneous ground water snow cover and glaciers are present at the headwaters above 5000 m a s l the retreat of glaciers due to global warming is expected to have an impact on water supply downstream the rivers the change in streamflow seasonality due to a reduction of glacier meltwater will affect water availability and fluvial regimes downstream especially during the dry season vuille et al 2018 in the most optimistic case future climate change is expected to lead to a 1 6 increase in overall water availability in the cañete and a 24 decrease in the worst case fluixá et al 2018 the cañete basin plays an important role in the socioeconomic development of the region approximately 85 2 2516 hm3 of the surface water resources are destined for energy production and 14 5 427 hm3 for agriculture both of them constitute the prevalent economic activities in the area ana 2017 the capillucas reservoir located in the middle section of the basin fig 1 is one of the main operating structures of el platanal hydropower plant operated by the peruvian generator compañía eléctrica el platanal s a celepsa the plant has been operational since 2010 and generates up to 220 mwatt of electricity tamayo et al 2016 the capillucas dam is 36 m high 60 m long and located at an elevation of 1543 m a s l its maximum water storage is 1 4 106 m3 of which 0 8 106 m3 corresponds to the usable capacity the cañete basin is highly affected by rapid siltation with sediment delivery from landslides mud and debris flows and gully erosion principally in the middle and middle upper reaches of the basin fig 2b the geomorphic activity is mainly triggered by extreme rainfall events that characterize the area especially in the headwaters indeci 2012 rau et al 2017 in some tributaries the amount of transported sediment in suspension affects periodically the local infrastructure water quality and local economic activity indeci 2012 2017a b 2 2 physiographic characteristics the lower cañete basin is formed in a series of extensional tectonic basins in which over 600 m of sediments have accumulated during the cenozoic viveen and schlunegger 2018 the basin lithology presents a large variability of sedimentary plutonic and volcanic rocks fig 2a granites acid plutonic cover most of the lower basin coastal range whereas alluvial fans debris flows and ancient flood plains occupy the valley floor sedimentary rocks such as sandstones and limestones and intermediate volcanic rocks occur in the middle and middle upper reaches of the basin the upper basin reach is made up of carbonate rich sedimentary rocks such as limestones and dolomites above 4500 m a s l glacial landforms and peri glacial sediments are present the cañete basin experiences an annual average temperature of 20 c the rainfall rate in the basin normally ranges from 2 2 mm day to 44 mm day but surpasses 70 mm day during enso events celepsa unpublished data within the basin there is a strong topographic control on rainfall patterns with mean annual precipitation amounts ranging from 20 mm in the lower part of the basin 721 m a s l to more than 1000 mm in the upper part of the basin 4675 m a s l since the 1950 s a significant warming was reported for central peru with a temperature increase of roughly 0 1 c per decade vuille et al 2018 future temperature projections for the cañete basin suggest temperature increases ranging from 1 c to 4 c by the end of the 21th century fluixá et al 2018 in contrast to the widely reported warming trend over the andes the trends in precipitation are more difficult to predict due to the interannual variability driven by enso and the scarcity of long observational meteorological records vuille et al 2018 south american regional climate change models do not provide clear indications of future precipitation change marengo et al 2010 chou et al 2014 and large uncertainties remain regarding the long term trends in precipitation amounts vuille et al 2018 recently fluixá et al 2018 used downscaling techniques based on gcm cmip5 circulation models to address these issues their predictions showed large uncertainties in the projected rainfall trends for the cañete basin with projected changes ranging from 17 to 24 by the end of the 21st century 3 materials and methods a coupled hydrological and sediment transport model was built to simulate water flow and sediment transport in the cañete river upstream of the capillucas dam fig 3 the hec hms u s army corps of engineers 2000 and hec ras u s army corps of engineering 2016 platforms were applied to simulate precipitation runoff and sediment transport both models have been widely applied in the usa to describe discharge and sediment transfer in river channels knebl et al 2005 pereira et al 2009 and to some extent in data poor regions halwatura and najim 2013 amini et al 2014 3 1 hydrological model the hec hms platform was developed to simulate precipitation runoff and hydrologic processes of dendritic basins u s army corps of engineers 2000 it is based on a structure of sub basins that are interconnected through a channel network and rainfall runoff generation is calculated independently for each sub basin the model assumes a closed hydrological system where one part of the precipitation returns to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration another part infiltrates into the surface and the remaining part is evacuated by overland flow thus the stream flow is the combination of overland flow precipitation in water bodies such as lakes and base flow in the model baseflow is set to a constant value fig 4 based on the observation of a constant and permanent low flow during the rainy and dry seasons coustau et al 2012 mccuen 2004 in the dry seasons the meltwater of the glaciers located in the headwaters of the cañete basin provide the base flow as a first step the hec hms platform assigns the observed rainfall data to every sub basin by applying an inverse distance weighting algorithm u s army corps of engineers 2000 because the number of meteorological stations is limited we slightly modified the algorithm to account for the strong correlation between precipitation and altitude in the region compare to chang et al 2005 this modification allows for a better rainfall distribution by reducing the uncertainty related to the limited number of meteorological stations eq 1 1 p x t 1 n d i j δ z i k p i t 1 n d i j δ z i k where d is the distance m between the meteorological station i and the evaluated point x δz is the elevation difference m between i and x p is the daily precipitation amount mm day n is the number of meteorological stations and j and k are geographic parameters the hec hms model considers losses through evapotranspiration and infiltration evapotranspiration loss has been estimated by the turc equation eq 2 diouf et al 2016 2 et 0 a c r g b t t 15 where et0 is the potential daily evapotranspiration mm day t is the average daily air temperature c rg is the global radiation in mj m2 day and a b and c are empirical parameters to obtain the accumulative infiltration loss the initial and constant rate models have been considered u s army corps of engineers 2000 here the precipitation which is neither retained on the land surface nor infiltrated into the soil also known as precipitation excess pet is estimated as the difference between the mean regional precipitation pt and the maximum potential rate of loss fc the regional precipitation is derived from the local meteorological stations whereas the rate of loss corresponds to localized event based infiltration interception and evapotranspiration until the mean precipitation exceeds the rate of loss no overland flow occurs eq 3 3 pe t p t f c if p t f c 0 otherwise to transform the precipitation excess into overland flow the kinematic wave method was applied in order to simulate the hydrologic flow in the river channel this methodology is based on the continuity equation and a simplified form of the momentum equation for the cañete basin we accounted for base flow in the river channel and assessed the base flow from the sustained runoff during the dry period the hec hms model includes the constant monthly base flow model where the average discharge in the dry season is added to the overland flow computed for each time step of the simulation u s army corps of engineers 2000 3 2 sediment transport model the hec ras model is capable of modelling sediment transport comprising bed and suspended river load based on field observations we assumed that the cañete river is a transport limited fluvial system in its middle and lower reach we used the transport equation of ackers and white 1973 in the hec ras platform it considers parameters of transport mobility and particle size and is capable of distinguishing between fine and transitionary particles 0 06 2 mm and coarse sediments 2mm eq 4 presents the non dimensional transport function ggr 4 g gr c f gr a a m which depends on the sediment mobility non dimensional parameter fgr eq 5 5 f gr v n gd s 1 v 32 l o g 10 h d 1 n where v is the shear velocity m s g the gravitational acceleration m s2 d is the diameter of bed sediment mm s the specific gravity of sediments non dimensional v the mean flow velocity m s h is the effective flow depth m c and m are the coefficient and the exponent of transport formula respectively a is the non dimensional threshold of mobility and n is a non dimensional transition parameter parameters n m a and c depend on the non dimensional sediment size dgr described by eq 6 this parameter is capable of characterizing both suspended fine and transitionary sediments and coarse sediments 6 d gr d g s 1 v 2 1 3 in which v is the kinematic viscosity m2 s and parameters d g and s were described above for suspended sediment 1 d gr 60 the parameters were calculated as follows eqs 7 10 7 n 1 0 56 log d gr 8 a 0 14 0 23 d gr 9 m 1 67 6 83 d gr 10 logc 3 46 2 79 log d gr for coarse sediment d gr 60 we assumed the following values n 0 a 0

s d h v and v were described above to simulate bed sorting and armouring hec ras uses the thomas mixing method formerly exner 5 that estimates the coarse armour or inactive layer which limits the transport capacity of a river u s army corps of engineering 2016 the method describes the gradations of the active layer which includes the cover and subsurface layers in order to assess the transport capacity of the river additionally the particle fall velocity ω influences the ability to set a particle into motion to keep it suspended and to have it transported the suspension of a particle is initiated once the bed level shear velocity is similar to ω equation 12 proposed by rubey u s army corps of engineering 2016 is applicable to the entire range of particle sizes e g gravel sand and silt the parameter f1 equals 0 79 for particles 1 mm and is derived using eq 13 for smaller particles 12 ω f 1 s 1 g d 13 f 1 2 3 36 v 2 g d 3 s 1 36 v 2 g d 3 s 1 the parameters included in eqs 12 and 13 were already presented above 3 3 model calibration to calibrate the hydrological and sediment transport model the modelled discharge and sediment load were compared against stream flow and sediment measurements in the river channel to assess the models performance five efficiency indexes were selected table 1 namely the nash sutcliffe efficiency e the coefficient of determination r2 the index of agreement d the relative volume bias rvb and the kling gupta efficiency kge the first three are widely used in hydrological modelling krause et al 2005 while the efficiency e is capable of evaluating basin dynamics the disadvantage is that it presents the differences between the observed and predicted values as squared values thus the highest values are overestimated while the lowest ones are underestimated the coefficient r2 describes the combined dispersion against the single dispersion of the observed and predicted series a value of 1 means that the dispersion of the prediction is equal to that of the observation unlike e this parameter is not sensitive to over or underestimated model outputs the index d represents the ratio of the mean square error and the potential error where the numerator in the equation table 1 is sensitive to peak values thereby overcoming the weakness of e and r2 indexes to account for low values we also included the rvb index moussa and chahinian 2009 finally the kge parameter gupta et al 2009 is based on a multi objective criterion that includes three components namely correlation bias and variability measures 3 4 data 3 4 1 discharge and sediments the hydrometeorology of the cañete basin is monitored by a private company ambiand that installed 12 meteorological ground stations fig 5 six of them record rainfall and temperature five only rainfall and one only temperature the meteorological data corresponds to daily precipitation mm day and temperature c collected over a 6 year period 2010 2015 ambiand unpublished data we only used meteorological data recorded after the year 2010 as earlier records were discontinuous time series see table 2 the basin contains 13 gauging stations distributed along the river channel fig 5 these stations provided daily discharge data m3 s and we used the flow data from the years 2014 2015 ambiand unpublished data to calibrate the model six gauging stations that are situated upstream of the capillucas dam were selected for the hydrological model calibration namely tanta azuchas huantan cacuciri putinza and chavin gauging stations fig 5 detailed information on sediment transport for chavin gauging station is available from celepsa that owns the el platanal hydroelectric plant table 2 before the construction of the capillucas reservoir sediment transport was measured several times a day during the months december to february rainy season of the four consecutive years 1998 to 2001 a total of 2465 water samples was collected at chavin station using an us dh 48 depth integrating suspended sediment sampler samples were analysed following the astm d3977 analysis method to determine the sediment concentration at chavin station sediment concentrations of up to 12 g l were measured to obtain information on the spatial variation in sediment transport within the cañete basin a new monitoring campaign was organised from january 2018 to march 2018 during this campaign water with suspended sediment samples were collected twice a day in 1 l bottles using an us dh 48 depth integrating suspended sediment sampler a total of 256 sediment samples were collected at four stations chavin putinza huantan and azuchas fig 2 fig 5 the samples were analysed in the laboratory also following the test method b filtration from the astm standard d3977 in order to determine sediment concentrations 3 4 2 basin distribution and channel geometry the cañete river basin was divided into 25 sub basins based on differences in altitude and climatological conditions fig 2b fourteen lakes with surface areas 0 4 km2 ana 2016 were modelled as natural reservoirs likewise the paucarcocha and capillucas storage dams were included in the model domain the model domain covered a length of about 228 km of the cañete river in the lower most reach the river enters a large extensional tectonic basin and consequently the river channel widens significantly with less vertical incision for this reach we considered a trapezoidal channel shape and estimated its dimensions from field observations and google earth images 3 4 3 bedload grain size image processing techniques were used to estimate the superficial grain size distribution of the bedload in the upper middle upper middle and lower part reach of the cañete river e g litty et al 2017 a 1 5 m 1 5 m square frame was placed on the gravel bars that were deposited on the proximal floodplain it has been shown that by using a frame the bias induced through preferential sampling of the clasts is reduced marcus et al 1995 ipcc 2014 for each sample site four high resolution photographs of the gravel bars were taken fig 2b the grain size distribution was calculated by digital image analysis techniques detert and weitbrecht 2012 the gravel bars of the upper reach contained a large fraction of big boulders and some bedrock outcrops table 3 the ones of the middle and middle upper reaches contained a mix of cobbles and pebbles 16 mm and sand particles and the lower section is rich in small gravels and fine particles 4 mm 3 4 4 rating curves the gauging records table 2 were used to construct a rating curve to characterize the relationship between the water flow q and the sediment load qs for the sediment data from celepsa at chavin station the curve was based on the average of the top 25 values to account for the maximum values since the 1998 2001 monitoring campaign took place before the construction of the capillucas dam in 2006 the rating curve of 1998 2001 for chavin station was assigned to the putinza station located upstream of the dam fig 5 fig 6 illustrates the power relation with exponent 2 5 between the sediment load and the discharge in the middle reach of the cañete river here the river transports water with low sediment concentrations fig 6 during the dry season i e 0 78 g l for discharge of 50 m3 s and high sediment concentration during discharge peaks i e 3 08 g l for 250 m3 s the values are congruent with an earlier report from morera et al 2013 likewise based on the data from our sediment monitoring campaign at chavin putinza huantan and azuchas stations in 2018 table 2 we derived sediment ratings curves for the four stations and assigned them to chavin putinza huantan and azuchas calibration sites fig 7 3 5 scenarios of climate variability a total of 10 climate change scenarios were constructed a combination of two different precipitation patterns and five different precipitation amounts the precipitation patterns a and b differ in the distribution of the rainfall change over the rainy season scenario a simulated the daily rainfall change distributed over the whole rainy season while scenario b distributed the variability over the moments with the highest precipitation only i e the upper 99 percentile in the precipitation record for each precipitation pattern a and b the amount of precipitation change was based on rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate change model simulations moss et al 2008 from two global circulation models giss e h p3 and mpi esm mr table 4 gives an overview of the predicted change in seasonal rainfall by the giss e h p3 and mpi esm mr models fluixá et al 2018 for the 21st century the change in precipitation ranges from 24 to 15 for the rainy season december to february and from 33 to 24 in the dry season june to august based on table 4 we generated 5 scenarios that included a variation of 5 8 10 15 and 17 of the total rainfall amount in the rainy season table 5 4 results 4 1 hydrological model the results for six gauging stations present a marked increase in discharge including high flow rates during the rainy season dec apr followed by a sustained low rate in the dry season may nov fig 8 during most of the model runs the modelled data followed the same discharge pattern as the observed flow data likewise the high r2 and d values r2 0 67 and d 0 85 and rvb of around zero in most of the stations table 6 are indicative for an acceptable model performance at the seasonal timescale bárdossy and das 2008 singh and bárdossy 2012 halwatura and najim 2013 haberlandt and radtke 2014 nevertheless a constant underestimation of 15 to 25 in the modelled discharge peaks was observed for the tanta huantan and cacuciri stations fig 8 while the model efficiency improved for the second half of the rainy season the calibration indexes correspond to an acceptable hydrological model performance table 6 especially when considering the poor spatial distribution of the available hydro meteorological data and the heterogeneity in climate topography soils and vegetation 4 2 sediment transport model given that few data are available on sediment transport in the basin the sediment transport model was calibrated here with the sediment loads that were derived from the 2018 rating curves qs vs q of the chavin huantan azucha and putinza station fig 7 the rating curves are based on the sediment concentration and discharge measurements in each control point fig 7 the model results are congruent with the overall spatial pattern of sediment loads within the cañete catchment based on daily estimations in general the model results were acceptable with model efficiency indexes r2 0 5 d 1 and e 0 5 for most stations although the rvb and kge indexes did not reach their optimum values table 7 a comparison between the rating curve derived and modelled data showed that the highest modelled sediment loads qs were underestimated by 35 to 50 fig 9 for huantan station the model underestimated sediment load by 80 at the end of the rainy season and the r2 0 6 and e 0 5 indexes showed low values even though the d parameter 0 7 reflected a good model performance similarly the model underestimated in azucha station the sediment load by about 0 5 kton day on average and 1 kton day during peak flows the sediment transport model predicts an annual sediment load of 981 kton yr at the putinza calibration site corresponding to a mean physical erosion rate of 0 12 mm yr for the 3081 km2 watershed upstream of putinza station table 8 in the capillucas storage dam the model predicts a sediment accumulation of 217 kton per year corresponding to a siltation rate of 82 103 m3 per year these values should be considered as minimum estimates given the underestimation of the sediment loads by the sediment transport model table 7 4 3 scenario analyses fig 10 shows the rainfall runoff graphs for the middle part of the cañete basin based on the rainfall hyetograph for yauyos meteorological station and the streamflow hydrograph for putinza station the graphs include the model run for 2014 2015 and the model outcomes for the eight projected rainfall scenarios with rainfall increases of 5 8 10 and 15 as expected an increase in precipitation rate led to an increase in streamflow this increase is largest for the rainfall scenarios where the rainfall increase was distributed over the upper 99 percentile of the precipitation records a nonlinear relation was observed between the increment in the rainfall amount and the streamflow with an abrupt increase in discharge when augmenting the rainfall amount with only 5 fig 11 illustrates the nonlinear response of the streamflow to changes in the rainfall amount for putinza station when increasing the rainfall amount with only 5 the average streamflow increased by 12 m3 s or 2 m3 s per of rainfall increase the increase in streamflow levels off to 0 4 and 0 5 m3 s per of rainfall increase when increasing the rainfall amount by an additional 3 i e between 5 and 8 for an equal amount of precipitation increase the b scenarios where the rainfall was distributed amongst the upper 99 percentile of rainfall events showed the largest increase in average streamflow fig 11 the sediment load transported by the cañete river was estimated at putinza station a positive relation exists between the rainfall increase and the sediment load in the river at putinza fig 12 a where an increase in rainfall amount leads to a nonlinear increase in sediment load with an increase in rainfall amount between 5 and 10 the sediment load increases only slightly with 1 7 for the a scenario and increases proportionally with 5 5 for the b scenario an additional increase in rainfall amount from 10 to 15 leads to a higher increase of 11 3 and 20 in sediment load per of rainfall increase for the a and b scenarios with maximum sediment loads of 1 1 mton yr scenario a 15 and 1 3 mton yr scenario b 15 besides the nonlinear response of sediment load to precipitation increments the model simulations showed that the rainfall pattern plays an important role in controlling sediment transport in all cases the b scenarios led to higher sediment loads than the a scenarios fig 12a for example an increase in discharge with 15 resulted in sediment loads that were 195 kton yr higher for the b compared to the a scenario the change in sediment load in the river channel has consequences for the siltation rate in the storage reservoir of capillucas the sediment that is delivered to the dam progressively reduced the water storage capacity of the reservoir fig 12c using the 2014 2015 calibration dataset the average life cycle of the capillucas dam is estimated at 17 years our results suggested that a regular increase in the precipitation of 5 and 15 might reduce the useful life to resp 16 and 10 years when the increase in precipitation occurred during the peak rainfall events only then the life cycle of the reservoir is rapidly reduced to respectively 13 and 7 years for scenario b 5 and b 15 scenarios a 17 and b 17 were the most optimistic scenarios with a reduction of 900 ton yr in the sediment load and trapped sediment volume and subsequent increase in the life cycle of the reservoir to 27 a 17 and 31 years b 17 fig 12a and b 5 discussion 5 1 limitations of gauge based sediment load measurements one of the main issues to assess the impact climate change will have on fluvial systems is the scarcity of observed hydrometeorological data guyot 2007 lavado 2012 rau et al 2017 commonly the spatial distribution of rainfall and discharge measurement stations is limited and the recorded data do not present continuous time series this is especially true for the andean countries restrepo and syvitski 2006 latrubesse and restrepo 2014 our hydrological model yielded average calibration indexes for most of the gauging stations fig 8 but underestimated discharge peaks this is probably related to the temporal resolution of the input data the daily resolution of the data allowed us to simulate the overall pattern of daily discharge but to have an adequate representation of peak discharges the input data need to have a finer i e hourly resolution beven 2012 the underestimation of the modelled sediment transport for some of the stations is likely because of the limited sediment concentration data used to build the sediment rating curves fig 6 y 7 this will likely have a significant impact on our modelling outcomes as the cañete river is a transport limited system the limitations of rating curves to represent the large variations in sediment load related to seasonal effects and antecedent conditions in river basin were identified in a large range of climate conditions walling 1977 asselman 2000 moges et al 2016 tenorio et al 2018 likewise the short duration of the sediment monitoring campaigns for both the modelling only one sampling station and the calibration only one campaign during the 2018 rainy season exercises limit model performance even so other issues like change in grain size distribution or error propagation from the hydrological model outcomes might also play a role furthermore estimating sediment yields bases on stream gauge measurements strongly depends on i the assumption of stationarity in the flood records and ii the reliability of the sediment rating curves for extreme discharge events it is likely that climate variability due to the influence of enso in the cañete basin will affect the assumption of an evenly distributed frequency of flood events machado et al 2015 molina et al 2015 in addition the sediment rating curve fig 6 that was used as input of the sediment transport model was based on observations of total suspended solids although the range of flow rates during the 1998 2001 monitoring period is not different from the daily flow rates of the model simulations it is clear from figs 6 and 7 that the sediment concentration data is heteroskedastic the sediment load estimates derived from the limited gauge data are therefore associated with larger uncertainty for high and very high flow rates fig 6 illustrates how the sediment rating curve at chavin station before the construction of the dam fails to predict the 3 g l sediment concentrations observed at very high flow rates of 250 m3 s fig 6 this affects the precision of the sediment transport model where the annual sediment load is reasonably well predicted notwithstanding the underestimation of the sediment load during extreme events 5 2 potential impact of climate variability on water storage capacity of hydroelectric reservoirs the coupled hydrological sediment transport model calibrated for the 2014 2015 period predicted a sediment load of 981 kton yr or 370 103 m3 yr or 318 ton km2 yr upstream of the capillucas reservoir our estimates for the cañete river are lower than the sediment fluxes that were reported by morera et al 2013 and latrubesse and restrepo 2014 for the northern peruvian coast where modern sediment fluxes of 779 and 1000 ton km2 yr were reported the latter rivers are located along the northern coast where enso events periodically trigger high rainfall rates and a significant increase in river discharge the modern physical erosion rate of 0 12 mm yr or 981 kton yr for putinza station table 8 is in line with published 10be derived denudation rates of the cañete and adjacent river systems the 10be derived denudation rates integrate over 103 to 104 years and are representative for the long term denudation rates of the basin vanacker et al 2015 reber et al 2017 reported 10be derived denudation rates of 0 05 mm yr for the lower reach of the cañete river where the river is located in a wide alluvial valley flanked by low gradient hillslopes in adjacent catchments south of cañete 10be derived catchment wide denudation rates of 0 08 to 0 13 mm yr were reported by abbühl et al 2011 and bekaddour et al 2014 along the peruvian coastal range a strong relation between rainfall amount and sediment load is expected based on previous works e g morera et al 2013 the interannual rainfall pattern plays an important role where enso events induce high rainfall rates over a short time as shown by the modelled b scenarios therefore a very high amount of sediment production can be expected during such episodic events pepin et al 2010 this is corroborated by data from the piura region in northern peru which is highly susceptible to enso events here a sediment flux of 20 mton yr latrubesse and restrepo 2014 or a maximum denudation rate of 0 185 mm yr abbühl et al 2011 was calculated for enso events the northern peruvian jequetepeque river basin exhibits high erosion rates of 0 1 0 9 mm yr during enso events estrada et al 2009 pepin et al 2013 a context similar to enso events is performed by scenarios b 10 and b 15 that investigated the occurrence of extreme precipitation resulting in a denudation rate of 0 13 and 0 16 mm yr respectively however most of the published denudation studies represent average values over geological time scales there is a lack of quantitative analysis of contemporary erosion and denudation rates for extreme events such as enso but observations from a recent coastal el niño event in 2017 indeci 2017a show that the denudation rates are likely 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than indicated in the aforementioned studies abbühl et al 2011 estrada et al 2009 pepin et al 2013 furthermore these recent events also provide insights into physical mechanisms of sediment transport dynamics especially in the dry middle and lower reaches of the cañete river ephemeral tributary channels are activated during extreme rainfall events and transport large sediment loads to the cañete river where virtually all gauging stations are located the tributaries are typically discharge limited and not sediment limited so due to its climatic and geologic conditions sediment production and transport dynamics in the cañete catchment are strongly driven by extreme events which makes the modelling of transport dynamics challenging our results furthermore suggested an average sedimentation rate into the capillucas reservoir of 217 kton yr or 82 103 m3 yr or 70 ton yr per km2 of drainage area table 8 under extreme enso induced conditions the calculated rates were 110 ton yr and 180 ton yr per km2 of drainage area fig 12b for scenarios b 10 and b 15 respectively likewise our model results suggested a strong relationship between the stored sediment the rainfall amount and rainfall pattern it is worth stressing the fact that the impact of exogenous geomorphic hazards e g dam sedimentation has devastating consequences alcántara ayala 2002 vanacker et al 2018 despite its limitations the methodology we propose is highly replicable and could be used to assess other dams in developing countries most studies related to sediment transport in peru were focused so far at the principal reservoirs that are periodically impacted by enso the gallito ciego reservoir trapped 14 mton yr 3 8 kton yr per km2 of drainage area taking into account a sediment density of 2 65 ton m3 between the years 1991 2007 walter et al 2012 equally the poechos reservoir trapped a mean sediment amount of 16 mton yr 1 3 kton yr per km2 of drainage area tote et al 2011 those rates are higher to the ones observed in the cañete basin and show that the peruvian hydroelectric reservoirs are highly vulnerable to climate variability with an annual increase of 8 in energy demand and strong impulse of the hydroelectric sector peru is in a prime position to push for sustainable development of the hydroelectric sector 6 conclusions the amount of sediment transported in andean rivers may increase over the next years due to climate variability and change as a result hydroelectric reservoirs could be silting up more rapidly than anticipated the methodology presented in this paper coupled a hydrological and sediment transport model to model the sediment load of the 6049 km2 large cañete river basin in the peruvian andes ten climate change scenarios were developed to evaluate the potential impact of precipitation change on stream discharge and sediment load the model outcomes showed that the amount of precipitation as well as the precipitation pattern controls the amount of sediment transported by the cañete river the sediment load presents a nonlinear positive exponential relationship with the change in precipitation rate thereby showing the importance of extreme climate events on sediment load a simulation of transported sediments influenced by a 15 increase in the moments of highest precipitation shows that peak discharge qs may increase with 34 the average sediment load was estimated at 981 175 ton yr or 0 12 mm yr upstream of the capillucas reservoir which is in agreement with published denudation rates for the area our results show that the lifespan of the capillucas reservoir ranges from 7 years for the most pessimistic scenario to 31 years for the most optimistic scenario this is much shorter than the projected lifespan of 50 years peru currently has a large growth in energy demand of 8 per year and has pushed a significant growth in hydroelectricity of all andean countries but peru is also expected to be strongly affected by climate change our pilot study therefore shows that silting of hydroelectric reservoirs may become a serious issue if counter
