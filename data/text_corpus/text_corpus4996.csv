24980,expectations of the impacts of climatic variation on species can depend on whether and how intraspecific variability is incorporated in models coefficients of variation from tree ring records of pinus albicaulis through time and across space were used to parameterize volatility and individuality respectively the records across sites were used to differentiate the average modes on an environmental gradient for gaussian fitness of ecotypic niches and to add further individual variation in mode and standard deviation of these functions in individual based monte carlo simulations of reproduction and mortality with inheritance of individual variability ecotypic gamma and shannon diversity decreased with volatility included however the decreases were mitigated by niche differentiation but not individual level variability increasing climatic volatility may threaten biodiversity but less so if a species has ecotypes as represented by ecotypic niches in the model the results illustrate the usefulness of these parameterizations and of simulations versus analytical solutions keywords diversity individual based intraspecific pinus albicaulis simulation variability 1 introduction 1 1 background ongoing global climate changes will likely include change in climate variability and extremes easterling et al 2000 rahmstorf and coumou 2011 hereafter climatic volatility because climate scientists use variability for any type of change this type of change could have ecological consequences at least as great as changes in mean climate e g vasseur et al 2014 of primary concern is whether climatic volatility will cause extinctions and lower biodiversity urban 2015 malanson et al 2017 however the consequences will likely be buffered by both interspecific and intraspecific variability in fitness relative to environment such as through phenotypic plasticity e g valladares et al 2014 ashander et al 2016 our objective is to assess how tree rings can indicate climatic volatility and intraspecific variability in fitness and how these factors might affect the intraspecific diversity of populations the potential for increasing climatic volatility is important e g ipcc 2012 and contentious alexander and perkins 2013 observations and model results are inconsistent increases in variance over the past century have been reported easterling et al 2000 meehl et al 2000 rahmstorf and coumou 2011 including some based on biological indicators millar et al 2007 li et al 2011 2013 fowler 2012 geographically specific studies based on ice core huntingford et al 2013 and arctic temperature data screen 2014 do not show trends however and methodologies for projecting extremes are uncertain sippel et al 2015 interspecific and intraspecific variability in fitness in relation to climatic gradients could affect species abundance and survival in periods of climate change adler et al 2006 found that climatic variability resulted in coexistence through the temporal storage effect and concluded that future increases in climatic volatility could strengthen this effect newer work has indicated that intraspecific variability may interact with environmental variability in maintaining coexistence e g violle et al 2012 han et al 2016 turcotte and levine 2016 martinez garcia and tarnita 2017 clark 2010 showed that populations were able to coexist based on the variation in demographic traits among the individuals within them other work however indicated that intraspecific variation could reduce coexistence barabas and d andrea 2016 reported that intraspecific variation reduced coexistence in a 2 species model unless the variation differed so that a specialist and a generalist with the same mean traits coexisted hart et al 2016 modeled nonlinear averaging trait variation and stochastic demography and found that the three in combination decreased coexistence in their model the potential for individual variation to reduce niche differentiation was a key explanation hausch et al 2018 found some resolution to this apparent contrast in experiments in which whether intraspecific variability decreased or maintained coexistence depended on mis or evenly matched competition in a stable environment efforts to include intraspecific variation in simulations follow a number of directions of which individual based models have been important brown et al 2007 used measures of plant parts to parameterize a spatially explicit simulation using resource distribution as the base for population processes that resulted in differences in genotype diversity kautz et al 2014 incorporated variability among bark beetles in a spatially explicit simulation to examine system level infestation laughlin and joshi 2015 examined interactions of traits and environmental gradients to relate intraspecific variability and niche dimension malanson 2018 reported on simulations that showed increasing climatic volatility might not be mitigated by interspecific and individual variability because some effects of negative climatic anomalies such as extinctions could not be balanced by positive ones individual based models allow representation of intraspecific variability but their ability to separate species subspecies or ecotypes and individual levels has not been fully exploited 1 2 rationale the aim of this paper is to further explore the effects of climatic volatility on populations with and without intraspecific variability in fitness on an environmental gradient we ask with climatic volatility would a population with the fitness of individuals distributed along an environmental gradient differ in diversity metrics from one where the individuals were identical gause 1934 and chesson 2000 would lead us to expect that volatility which increases mortality and extinctions could also slow competitive exclusion so diversity could persist longer therefore the effect of volatility is not certain as a result our expectations become greater volatility leads to greater intraspecific diversity unless it increases extinction intraspecific variability supports greater diversity at levels of volatility that increase extinction to examine these propositions we used a novel parameterization of a gridded individual based model to examine the effects of different aspects of variability on diversity fig 1 we used coefficients of variation from measurements of tree ring width data through time and across space to parameterize volatility and individuality respectively two summaries of the latter were used to differentiate two levels of intraspecific variation niche different average modes on an environmental gradient for gaussian fitness functions and individual variability individual variation in mode and standard deviation of these functions reproduction and mortality were simulated and composite metrics of diversity were calculated 2 material and methods 2 1 tree ring data we used tree ring data to guide selection of parameters for the initial niche breadths and separation of the gaussian distributions of fitness on an environmental gradient fig 1 its variation among individuals and for climatic volatility the stages were 1 calculate the standard deviation σ of niche breadth from the average coefficient of variation cv of site chronologies of tree ring widths across trees in the same year fig 1 upper across rows which is also used to parameterize differences among ecotypes 2 calculate the cv through years for all trees not site chronologies the average of which is used to parameterize individual variability 3 calculate the volatility from the average cv of tree ring widths through years fig 1 upper down columns we used 14 site chronologies with 940 individual tree ring series for pinus albicaulis from the international tree ring data bank itrdb www ncdc noaa gov data access paleoclimatology data datasets tree ring these were chronologies from the northern rocky mountains that had at least 400 years of record within the past 500 years tree ring data provided an internally consistent indication of both environmental variation here volatility down the columns of standardized increments and biological variability here individual variability across the columns of individual trees as measures contained within the same data year x tree tables fig 1 upper where referral to human defined data i e measures of climate were unnecessary the tree ring data were cross dated in itrdb to ensure calendar year resolution and we standardized to remove the biological growth trend of decreasing widths with age but without variance stabilization or autoregressive modeling using arstan cook and krusic 2005 first to set equal niche breadth of ecotypes we calculated the coefficient of variation cv of the chronologies of 14 sites for each year in which all had a record and then took the average cv although the variation captured by this cv includes that caused by spatial environmental differences across sites in addition to tree growth in a single year as well as sample error we used it to represent the niche differentiation of ecotypes second to set the variability of the individuals we calculated the cvs of all individual series across years for every year in which at least 100 trees had a record we used the average of these cvs third to represent climatic volatility we calculated the cv of the standardized tree ring series through all years for each tree here down columns in fig 1 whereas above it was across rows the average of these cvs represented the volatility of the environment of this species across its range in the northern rocky mountains vt p albicaulis evolved to survive in a volatile environment but its growth as indicated in tree rings is relatively complacent perkins and swetnam 1996 luckman et al 1997 the data used preceded the recent extensive die back caused by blister rust 2 2 model design and initialization the simulation was designed and implanted as outlined following a simplified odd protocol grimm et al 2010 the odd protocol categores included 2 2 1 purpose the model simulated population dynamics for a species on an environmental gradient for cases with and without intraspecific individual variation and with or without climatic volatility 2 2 2 design concepts the mode and standard deviation of gaussian fitness functions on an environmental gradient could differ among individuals the terms of this variation were inherited by offspring individuals interacted indirectly by occupying space climatic volatility was examined by shifting the underlying environmental gradient relative to the individual fitness distributions processes were stochastically implemented via monte carlo routines with a uniform random number generator gamma and shannon diversity over the grid were observed at each iteration 2 2 3 entities state variables scales to address our questions we needed to simulate ecotypes with initially identical niche breadth evenly distributed on an environmental gradient represented by a grid of cells and so we created an arbitrary nine ecotypes so that some persist with eventual extinctions ecotypes having gaussian distributions of fitness on the gradient fig 1 middle the environmental gradient was represented by grid of 425 cells in breadth which is arbitrary and simply long enough to encompass all species without spatial constraints the height of the grid allows some redundancy and is wrapped into a cylinder to avoid edge effects the height was set at 20 cells only one individual occupied a cell 2 2 4 initialization given that the initial distributions of fitness were identical we used the tree ring data from a single species to parameterize the niche breadth for the nine virtual ecotypes and their intraspecific variability as well as climatic volatility while an arbitrary niche breadth and variability would suffice we based ours on observations to limit unrealistic parameterization but the simulation may not represent a particular species the fitness distribution of each species was calculated as 1 ds exp x μs 2 2σs 2 with x the grid column of the cell μs the modal grid column and σs 2 the variance of the fitness distribution of the ecotype s for the first level of intraspecific variability the modes for the nine ecotypes were equally spaced along the gradient with the middle one at the 200th cell to represent ecotypic niche differentiation the cases without niche were modeled by using the central mode cell 300 for all nine ecotypes only the central fitness function in fig 1 middle we used the average of the first cv in the tree ring analyses as the standard deviation in number of cells on the gradient for the niche breadth of the initial distributions given this breadth the distance between modes was set at σ of the gaussian distributions so that competition would be high for the second level of intraspecific variability individual level variability we used a multiplier from the cvs of the individual tree ring series the average of this cv was used as the standard deviation of a random normal distribution with a mean of 1 from which a multiplier was drawn for every individual this multiplier for intraspecific variability fi was used to alter the position of the mode and the variance of the fitness distribution from the ecotype standard fig 2 as noted by laughlin and joshi 2015 fi was limited to a range of 0 2 given the weak connection between growth and the demographic processes simulated to initialize the populations 50 000 trials were run in which a random species and a random grid cell was chosen and whether it established or not was determined as a function of the ecotype fitness at that cell initialization resulted in the nine ecotypes being evenly mixed on the gradient in the cases without variability and separated but with considerable overlap in the cases with intraspecific variability fig 1 middle 2 2 5 process overview and scheduling at each iteration the gradient shifted back and forth to represent climatic volatility the number of cells offset from the original gradient at each iteration was derived from tree ring data the cv from the third tree ring step above was used to determine a random number of grid cells vt on the gradient offset from the individuals initial mode fractions were rounded to an integer number of cells this value was drawn once every iteration and applied to all reproduction and mortality chances i e the climate in each year varies so the calculation of volatility can be visualized as having the environmental gradient shift back and forth under the simulated individuals to combine volatility and individual variability in the reproduction and mortality of individuals at each iteration the mode and niche breadth of fitness were included in functions of the monte carlo simulation reproduction rxti was varied for individuals with an addition for volatility vt and a multiplier for intraspecific variability fi the multiplier was applied to both the modal position of the niche and to its variance and so we used its square root f i twice 2 rxti exp x vt μ f i 2 2σ2 f i where vt is the volatility in number of cells to be added to shift the environment on the gradient in a given iteration and fi is the multiplier that moves the mode and changes the niche breadth of the individual volatility was computed at each iteration with a random normal number with a mean of zero and a standard deviation derived from tree ring data indicative of climatic volatility intraspecific variability was similarly computed mean 1 standard deviation derived from tree ring data indicative of intraspecific variability for mortality the rate was halved because while reproduction should be as sensitive as growth to environmental variation mortality is not the trees survived the variability indicated and so 3 mxti 2e x vt 2 μ fi 2 2σ2 fi the rates for reproduction rxti and mortality mxti of each individual at its cell on the environmental gradient was used in the monte carlo calculations each produced a propagule at probability rxti given unknowns for parameterizing dispersal kernels the propagule was dispersed to a random cell on the grid which it occupied if empty ubiquitous dispersal decreased alpha diversity by 8 or less relative to a gaussian kernel with a standard deviation σ of 42 cells in limited trials then all individuals experienced mortality at probability 1 mxti we ran combinations without and with volatility niche differentiation single mode and different modes and individual variability each for 500 iterations after which most values were close to equilibrium and for 50 replications of which averages are reported we implemented the simulation on the netlogo platform wilensky and netlogo 1999 the model is available at ir uiowa edu attached to a link to this paper 2 3 diversity metrics we report two metrics of diversity gamma diversity the number of extant ecotypes and shannon diversity which captures evenness more than richness we used a general linear model for anova with tukey post hoc tests for comparisons to determine differences among the cases 3 results across the chronologies of p albicaulis in a given year the average cv was 0 24 this value was used to set the same niche width for all ecotypes this and the cv of the individuals 0 52 were used in determining the multiplier fi the average of the cvs for the temporal records was 0 21 which was used to set the volatility vt the diversity metrics differed dramatically with volatility and given no variance for gamma diversity we did not test this factor further table 1 except to note that anova and tukey without volatility both niche and individual variability lowered shannon diversity slightly but significantly the proportional changes in table 1 showed that volatility without any niche differentiation or individual variability lowered gamma diversity by 11 and shannon diversity by 25 niche differentiation mitigated these losses which indicated that extinctions occurred in fewer simulation replications and ecotype populations were more even table 1 the loss of gamma diversity was minimal however the significant differences in anova were confirmed by the tukey tests with volatility the effect of niche differentiation was significant but small for gamma diversity for which the error in anova was 95 of the model and individual variability did not have a significant effect table 2 for shannon diversity niche differentiation had a large significant effect and accounted for slightly more than half of the anova model 4 discussion individual based simulations were run that combined climatic volatility with ecotypic niche differentiation and individual level variability in the absence of volatility neither niche differentiation or individual variability or their combination increased diversity whereas niche differentiation mitigated losses of diversity with volatility maintenance of diversity without either niche differentiation or individual level variability and no volatility would seem to contradict gause s 1934 principle but a minor competitive advantage for one ecotype would have to be maintained indefinitely and this is unlikely to occur with stochastic demographics this result illustrates the potential usefulness of simulations showing iterations or time versus analytical solutions the effect of niche differentiation but not of individual variability might resolve the contrast in earlier results wherein intraspecific variability increased e g clark 2010 clark et al 2011 or decreased e g barabas and d andrea 2016 hart et al 2016 diversity or coexistence first our simulation specifically increased the type of niche differentiation that clark clark 2010 clark et al 2011 had argued would be developed by individuals on the other hand our representation of individual level variability in the mode and standard deviation of the fitness functions increased the blurring of niche differentiation which was the process posited by hart et al 2016 to explain loss of diversity with greater individual variability reduction of competitive exclusion would be expected to maintain greater diversity at intermediate levels of volatility however in our simulated level of volatility the primary effect was to increase density independent extinction iterations where the environment moved outside of the niche dimensions of ecotypes or individuals reduced populations and eliminated some the greater effect was to increase the unevenness of the populations among replications the smaller and larger populations vary among the nine ecotypes simulations could inform expectations of consequences of increased climatic volatility with global climate change by recognizing niche differentiation in existing adaptations to disturbance or stress adaptations to temporal gradients as proposed by clark 2010 and scranton and vasseur 2016 e g demographic strategies to increase fitness with temporal variation such as masting could mitigate the impacts of increased climatic volatility predictions will need to incorporate such adaptations as opposed to including simple individual variability a framework beginning with that presented by turcotte and levine 2016 could be developed that explicitly incorporates both niche and individual variability in multiple dimensions of resources time and space however increases in volatility at levels observed over the past century i e localized doubling of variability in tree ring records millar et al 2007 malanson 2017 could cause extinctions 5 conclusions both ecotypic niche differentiation and individual variability can be factors in a species response to climate change for modeling including both requires procedures for parameterization and for implementation we introduced a procedure to derive an indicator of variability for ecotypes from the cv of tree ring widths across space while we used a range of trees to derive a single number which we then used with theory to evenly distribute the modes of fitness functions on an environmental gradient actual differences in modes for populations of observed ecotypes could add realism our use of the variability of the cv of tree ring widths across space to represent individual level variability could be done within those populations applying these representations of variability in individual based models by application to the mode and standard deviation of fitness functions is useful for generalization and can lead to observations not attainable by current analytical approaches alone empirically based fitness functions could be changed similarly and other types of models such as species distribution models already incorporating intraspecific variability e g valladares et al 2014 theodoridis et al 2018 could also incorporate changes analogous to shifting modes and changing breadths credit statement gpm conceived the problem and wrote and executed the model jr and mb provide training data for tree ring analyses

resolve the contrast in earlier results wherein intraspecific variability increased e g clark 2010 clark et al 2011 or decreased e g barabas and d andrea 2016 hart et al 2016 diversity or coexistence first our simulation specifically increased the type of niche differentiation that clark clark 2010 clark et al 2011 had argued would be developed by individuals on the other hand our representation of individual level variability in the mode and standard deviation of the fitness functions increased the blurring of niche differentiation which was the process posited by hart et al 2016 to explain loss of diversity with greater individual variability reduction of competitive exclusion would be expected to maintain greater diversity at intermediate levels of volatility however in our simulated level of volatility the primary effect was to increase density independent extinction iterations where the environment moved outside of the niche dimensions of ecotypes or individuals reduced populations and eliminated some the greater effect was to increase the unevenness of the populations among replications the smaller and larger populations vary among the nine ecotypes simulations could inform expectations of consequences of increased climatic volatility with global climate change by recognizing niche differentiation in existing adaptations to disturbance or stress adaptations to temporal gradients as proposed by clark 2010 and scranton and vasseur 2016 e g demographic strategies to increase fitness with temporal variation such as masting could mitigate the impacts of increased climatic volatility predictions will need to incorporate such adaptations as opposed to including simple individual variability a framework beginning with that presented by turcotte and levine 2016 could be developed that explicitly incorporates both niche and individual variability in multiple dimensions of resources time and space however increases in volatility at levels observed over the past century i e localized doubling of variability in tree ring records millar et al 2007 malanson 2017 could cause extinctions 5 conclusions both ecotypic niche differentiation and individual variability can be factors in a species response to climate change for modeling including both requires procedures for parameterization and for implementation we introduced a procedure to derive an indicator of variability for ecotypes from the cv of tree ring widths across space while we used a range of trees to derive a single number which we then used with theory to evenly distribute the modes of fitness functions on an environmental gradient actual differences in modes for populations of observed ecotypes could add realism our use of the variability of the cv of tree ring widths across space to represent individual level variability could be done within those populations applying these representations of variability in individual based models by application to the mode and standard deviation of fitness functions is useful for generalization and can lead to observations not attainable by current analytical approaches alone empirically based fitness functions could be changed similarly and other types of models such as species distribution models already incorporating intraspecific variability e g valladares et al 2014 theodoridis et al 2018 could also incorporate changes analogous to shifting modes and changing breadths credit statement gpm conceived the problem and wrote and executed the model jr and mb provide training data for tree ring analyses

24981,in order to analyse the efficiency of the transmission cycles of six lyme disease genospecies and diverse potential reservoir hosts in central europe we modelled each possible genospecies host relationship using a next generation matrix approach in particular we determined the basic reproduction number r0 of any combination of each genospecies and various species of rodents birds and lizards based on a thorough literature analysis we parameterized the model with field derived and laboratory derived values although r0 of borrelia afzelii varied widely with the rodent species analysed the association of this genospecies with rodents overall reached higher r0 values than the association of b garinii or b valaisiana with birds or of b lusitaniae with lizards for such well adapted combinations of genospecies and host species the survival probability from larva to nymphs and the parameters relevant for horizontal transmission most strongly influenced r0 the model differentiated the transmission efficiency of the two ubiquitous genospecies infecting rodents b afzelii and b burgdorferi s s and emphasized differences between experimental and field derived observations it appears that the fraction of blood meals that larvae take on particular omnipresent host species influences the local proportion of each of the ubiquitous genospecies b afzelii b garinii and b valaisiana in questing nymphs the efficiency of the transmission cycles of locally restricted genospecies b spielmanii and b lusitaniae on the other hand appears to result in their predominance in sites where their respective competent hosts occur we observed that r0 varies around its threshold value of 1 depending on the genospecies host association and differs for species even within host groups this justifies and calls for distinguishing both genospecies and host species in further modelling studies in central europe keywords tick host spirochaete interaction lyme disease next generation matrix ixodes ricinus borrelia burgdorferi elasticity 1 introduction a wide range of pathogens are transmitted by ticks the major tick borne disease in temperate zones lyme disease is caused by the bacterial agent borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato wormser et al 2006 this vector borne pathogen is transmitted mainly horizontally i e non infected ticks become infected when feeding on an infected reservoir host these hosts must be attractive to ticks susceptible to tick borne infection maintain the pathogen and become infectious to ticks estrada peña et al 2013 richter et al 2000 after moulting to the next stage these ticks are able to transmit the pathogen to their subsequent hosts other transmission routes are possible but appear rare such as the transmission between co feeding ticks by a locally and temporally limited infection of a tick s host with b burgdorferi s l richter et al 2002 no appreciable extent of vertical transmission of b burgdorferi s l from one tick generation to the next has been observed richter et al 2012 rollend et al 2013 to understand and quantify the interaction between a host and a tick borne pathogen the basic reproduction number r0 is a useful concept randolph and craine 1995 r0 characterises the number of secondary cases caused by one single infected individual over the entire period of its infectivity in a population completely susceptible to the pathogen diekmann et al 1990 generally it provides a threshold quantity of the pathogen s maintenance in its natural transmission cycle the pathogen s transmission cycle is maintained if r0 1 otherwise the pathogen becomes extinct r0 has been calculated in models describing lyme disease spirochaetes and rodents these models focus on the relationship between b burgdorferi sensu stricto and the white footed mouse i e the north american system davis and bent 2011 dunn et al 2013 nonaka et al 2010 in contrast to the north american transmission cycle the transmission of lyme disease spirochaetes in central europe is somewhat more complex in europe b burgdorferi s l transmitted by ixodes ricinus are differentiated into several genospecies b afzelii b bavariensis b burgdorferis s b garinii b lusitaniae b spielmanii and b valaisiana and each of them is maintained in a natural transmission cycle involving a different host group b afzelii b bavariensis and b spielmanii use rodent species to reproduce hanincová et al 2003a richter et al 2012 2004a 2004b whereas b garinii and b valaisiana appear to be associated with birds hanincová et al 2003b b burgdorferi s s may be maintained by both rodents and birds richter et al 2004a 2000 b lusitaniae is the only genospecies perpetuated by lizards majláthová et al 2008 2006 richter and matuschka 2006 an existing model captures the european situation without differentiating the distinct genospecies of b burgdorferi s l and the various host species i ricinus feeds on hartemink et al 2008 we expect that modelling the variety of individual combinations of hosts and genospecies helps to identify which genospecies host association is most efficiently transmitted and whether particular parameters influence its efficiency to compare the efficiency of transmission of the several genospecies host associations we addressed the complex relationships of the central european genospecies with various reservoir hosts in particular we developed a next generation matrix model based on a previous model by hartemink et al 2008 for an in depth analysis differentiating six genospecies and various species of rodents birds and lizards we parametrized our model with a wide range of laboratory derived and field derived data furthermore we performed an elasticity analysis for each of the model parameters 2 methods we adapted the 5 5 next generation matrix model designed for various tick borne disease agents tbd with different transmission routes hartemink et al 2008 to the specific conditions of the european system of hosts and genospecies of lyme disease spirochaetes the underlying model includes five distinct types at birth each of which representing a stage that may potentially acquire an infection egg e larva l nymph n adult a host h fig 1 a each matrix element kij describes the expected number of individuals at stage i infected by one individual infected at stage j because the agents of lyme disease b burgdorferi s l cannot be vertically transmitted the columns and rows corresponding to the egg of hartemink s 5 5 next generation matrix ktbd equal zero i e row k11 through k15 in fig 1a since we limited our analysis to hosts on which subadult ticks feed the columns and rows corresponding to the adult type at birth equal zero too i e column k14 through k54 in fig 1a in order to avoid operating with a rank deficient matrix resulting from a zero determinant we employed an adapted 3 3 matrix klyme fig 1b recognizing the characteristic polynomials it is evident that both matrices have the same eigenvalues although ktbd has two extra trivial zero points over klyme hence k refers to klyme and kij to its matrix elements each of which is defined by an equation fig 1 and appendix a in supplementary material consisting of tick related and pathogen related parameters table 1 2 1 sensitivity and elasticity analysis the change of the basic reproduction number r0 resulting from a change of single matrix elements or lower level parameters see table 1 and appendix a in supplementary material of the next generation matrix plays a key role in the analysis of transmission dynamics this change may be quantified by means of sensitivities and elasticities in order to evaluate the importance of particular parameters and transmission paths therefore we calculated local sensitivities and elasticities to the single matrix elements as well as to the lower level tick related and pathogen related parameters analogous to hartemink et al 2008 according to caswell 2001 cf appendix a in supplementary material 2 2 parameterisation to calculate r0 as well as the sensitivities and elasticities we thoroughly evaluated the tick related and pathogen related parameters table 1 for the genospecies of b burgdorferi s l and host species since field derived and experimental data for some parameter values are lacking we adopted these from the existing model we calculated all other parameter values from data derived from a thorough literature analysis and describe the approach and rationale for each of the parameters in detail 2 3 transmission efficiency from host to tick p the parameter p is defined as the transmission efficiency from a competent host to a tick according to hartemink et al 2008 who used a value of 0 5 for both pl and pn the transmission efficiency pl quantifies the ratio of larvae acquiring the pathogen from an infected host and may be based on standardized laboratory studies or on field studies in laboratory studies a host is infected by tick borne lyme disease spirochaetes and subsequently non infected unfed larvae are permitted to feed on it during a so called xenodiagnosis richter et al 2000 the ratio of the number of infected larvae to the number of all fed larvae indicates the transmission efficiency from host to larva matuschka et al 1997 alternatively the transmission efficiency may also be derived from larvae naturally infesting field captured hosts because lyme disease spirochaetes are not transmitted vertically richter et al 2012 rollend et al 2013 thus questing unfed larvae are not infected and acquire infection only during their first blood meal on an infected host these larvae may similarly be regarded as xenodiagnostic ticks experimental studies capture the transmission efficiency of a host species more precisely because the status of the infection of the examined hosts is known and may be standardized ideally xenodiagnostic ticks are examined for spirochaetal presence in the moulted nymphal stage because this also includes the likelihood of the tick s development and of the spirochaetal survival during moulting standardized laboratory studies provide values for the transmission efficiency under ideal conditions which may result in somewhat overestimated values compared to data derived from field studies with varying conditions therefore sufficiently large long term sampling in various environments throughout several seasons is necessary to obtain a representative mean parameter value to calculate the efficiency of pathogen transmission from host to larva pl for the parameterisation of the next generation matrix fig 1b we used the proportion of infected larvae averaged over all analysed laboratory studies eq 1 which concurs with the specific host infectivity according to kahl et al 2002 1 p l n i n f e c t e d l a r v a e n e x a m i n e d l a r v a e for field derived data we used the examined larvae of all examined hosts although the number of examined larvae on infected hosts would be more accurate because it is similar to the calculation using experimentally infected hosts the number of infected hosts is not provided in most publications the transmission efficiency from host to larva may also be calculated as the specific infectivity is according to mather et al 1989 or the host to larval transmission coefficient βh t according to hanincová et al 2003a these calculations however require that the proportion of the infected larvae is known in respect to a particular host individual which is rarely published in some publications the specific infectivity is and or the host to larval transmission coefficient βh t is presented without the input values e g hanincová et al 2003a not permitting to calculate the transmission efficiency according to eq 1 to ensure comparability and because differences between the host species are more important than absolute values randolph and craine 1995 we focused on publications that permit the calculation using eq 1 field studies providing data on the transmission efficiency from host to larva are more numerous than laboratory studies table 2 presumably due to animal welfare regulations and feasibility of experimentation on lizards and birds laboratory studies mainly focus on rodents therefore we calculated the mean transmission efficiency from host to larva pl according to eq 1 mainly based on results of published and unpublished field studies table 2 whenever possible we additionally parameterised the next generation matrix using the transmission efficiency results of laboratory studies to compare the transmission efficiencies of field and laboratory studies for particular rodent species table 2 because of the ideal experimental conditions the transmission efficiency based on laboratory derived values will most likely be overestimated whereas the use of field derived values will result in an underestimation because larvae feeding on non infected hosts enter into the calculation of the major host species in central europe we selected those species which permitted us to parameterise the next generation matrix on thorough data fig 1b table 2 the transmission efficiency from host to nymph cannot be determined in field studies because the nymph may have already acquired infection during its larval blood meal thus the source of infection of the examined nymphs or its derived adults remains unknown experimental studies would facilitate to determine the transmission efficiency from host to nymph however we are not aware of any such studies therefore we assumed pn analogous to pl and used the same values 2 3 1 transmission efficiency from tick to host q the transmission efficiency from the respective tick stage to the host q is equivalent to the transmission coefficient βt v according to randolph 1998 this transmission coefficient describes the probability of a host individual acquiring infection by a single bite of an infected tick and can be determined solely in laboratory studies by investigating the proportion of host individuals which become infectious after one infected tick bite it is important to also consider the subsequent infectivity of the host individual because only an infectious host contributes to r0 and therefore perpetuates the pathogen thus q may be calculated according to eq 2 2 q n i n f e c t i o u s h o s t s n e x a m i n e d h o s t s to our knowledge the transmission efficiency from nymph to host qn has been determined only for rodents matuschka et al 1992 richter et al 2011 in experimental infection studies generally more than one nymph is permitted to attach to a host individual to ensure that the host acquires an infection even if the population of infecting nymphs is only partially infected the data available from literature cannot be adapted to the parameter qn according to the definition of randolph 1998 therefore we adopted the value of 0 8 used by hartemink et al 2008 for genospecies host combinations where transmission from host to larva was possible pl 0 for combinations with pl 0 we used qn 0 to analyse whether this parameter affects r0 in particular genospecies host combinations we added a separate modelling approach varying qn in steps of 0 2 in a set of next generation matrices the transmission efficiency from the adult stage qa is zero because no adult ticks feed on the relevant host species 2 3 2 period of infectivity of the host ih the parameter ih is defined as systemic infection duration by hartemink et al 2008 who used a value of 120 days in their model instead of systemic infection duration we prefer to use the period when a host is infectious to ticks feeding on it which we assume to be more relevant to the pathogen s transmission cycle therefore we chose the term period of host infectivity for the parameter ih this parameter may solely be determined by extensive laboratory studies to determine this parameter despite a lack of laboratory derived data we assumed that the maximum period of infectivity is a function of the host s mean life span lsh restricted to the period of seasonal tick activity at ixodes ricinus ticks are mainly active from march to october in central europe schulz et al 2014 therefore we used a period of tick activity of 243 days per year fig 1b assuming that a host individual is born at the beginning of the period of tick activity and susceptible to infestation and infection we used the host s life span as an equivalent to the period of host infectivity as long as the host s life span is shorter than the period of tick activity as soon as the host s life span exceeds the period of tick activity but is shorter than one year we used the period of tick activity as the period of host infectivity only if the host s life span exceeds one year we multiplied the lifespan by the period of tick activity in proportion to one year the period of host infectivity may therefore be derived as a partial function eq 3 for the calculated values see table 3 3 i h l s h l s h l s h a t a t l s h a t l s h 365 l s h a t 1 365 l s h 365 for the edible dormouse we used its activity period instead of that of the tick because this rodent s activity period is shorter than and within the tick s period of activity fietz et al 2014 2 3 3 co feeding transmission efficiency θ hartemink et al 2008 defined the parameter θ as transmission efficiency from tick to tick and used a value of 0 56 in their model the transmission of spirochaetes between co feeding ticks θ appears negligible in perpetuating the transmission cycle of b burgdorferi s l richter et al 2002 to parameterise the adapted next generation matrix fig 1b we used laboratory derived data describing the temporal and spatial infection rates in larvae after co feeding with one single b afzelii infected nymph on hairless mice mus musculus richter et al 2002 we averaged these rates to eliminate the temporal and spatial components because the next generation matrix does not contain these dimensions the resulting value for the efficiency of co feeding transmission from nymph to larva θnl is 0 1 we analogously used this value for θnl and θnn for all host groups since data for birds or lizards are lacking the co feeding transmission efficiency from adults θal und θan is zero as no adults feed on the selected hosts 2 3 4 mean number of ticks per host n the parameter n is defined as the mean number of ticks feeding on a competent host according to hartemink et al 2008 who used nlh 6 for larvae and nnh 0 2 for nymphs respectively feeding on a competent host this parameter may be expressed by two different quantities the abundance of infestation or the mean intensity of infestation according to hanincová et al 2003a we used the abundance of infestation instead of the mean intensity of infestation since the definition of nlh or nnh as average number of larvae or nymphs respectively feeding on a competent host implies a mean value over all examined hosts thus we applied eq 4 to calculate the mean number of larvae or nymphs per host by averaging the number of ticks over the respective hosts over all studies included in this analysis table 4 4 a b u n d a n c e o f i n f e s t a t i o n n t i c k s n h o s t s 2 3 5 number of co feeding ticks c the parameter cij characterises the number of ticks at type at birth i co feeding with one tick at type at birth j the number of larvae or nymphs co feeding with an adult cla or cna respectively is zero since no adults feed on the relevant host species for the number of larvae co feeding with a nymph cln hartemink et al 2008 used a value of 20 based on data derived from bank voles and yellow necked mice randolph et al 1999 a value of one nymph co feeding with another nymph cnn is based on unpublished data by randolph hartemink et al 2008 because data on these parameters are limited to these studies and transmission among co feeding ticks appears to play a minor part in the transmission cycle of b burgdorferi s l richter et al 2002 we adopted the values for cln and cnn used by hartemink et al 2008 2 3 6 tick feeding period d for the mean feeding period of larvae dl and nymphs dn hartemink et al 2008 used a value of 2 5 days and 3 5 days for larval and nymphal attachment respectively based on unpublished data by randolph lacking host specification the mean feeding period of the various tick stages on particular host species is rarely examined a mean larval feeding period of 3 89 days and a mean nymphal feeding period of 4 34 days were determined by observing 34 503 larvae and of 8506 nymphs respectively feeding on mongolian jirds richter et al unpublished data and were assumed for all rodents to parameterise the next generation matrix for birds we used data by heylen et al 2014 revealing 3 67 days and 3 84 days for larvae and nymphs respectively feeding on great tits parus major since the feeding period of ticks on lizards has not been examined we applied the feeding periods of ticks on rodents 2 3 7 probability of tick survival s the parameters sn and sa according to hartemink et al 2008 include the survival probability from one stage to another as well as the feeding and moulting success they used theoretical values of 0 1 for sn and sa derived from randolph and craine 1995 we adopted these values due to a lack of studies determining these parameters 2 3 8 fraction of blood meals on a host species hc the parameter hc is defined as the probability of feeding on a competent host or the fraction of blood meals taken on competent hosts hartemink et al 2008 we varied this parameter analogously to hartemink et al 2008 for each respective host species 3 results we adapted and expanded an existing next generation matrix to include the diverse central european genospecies of b burgdorferi s l as well as the various central european hosts of i ricinus in order to compare their transmission dynamics in selected host species focussing on the basic reproduction number r0 for the perpetuation of b afzelii in rodents r0 exceeded the threshold value of 1 based on both field derived and laboratory derived data differences in r0 resulting from the use of either type of data were marginal whereas the application of different rodent species resulted in a wide range in lizards and birds on the other hand the basic reproduction number of b afzelii did not even reach the threshold value fig 2 and table 5 for b burgdorferi s s r0 reached values 1 only in the laboratory rodents in case of b spielmanii r0 1 was also reached for the garden dormouse with field derived parameters table 5 and appendix c fig c 1 in supplementary material r0 of b garinii exceeded the threshold value only for the perpetuation in the two turdus spp and in experimentally infected rats table 5 and appendix c fig c 1 in supplementary material for b valaisiana however values of r0 1 are only reached for the two turdus spp table 5 and appendix c fig c 1 in supplementary material in the case of b lusitaniae r0 exceeded the threshold value of 1 for the perpetuation only in lizards overall r0 of b afzelii reached higher values in rodents than b garinii or b valaisiana in birds and b lusitaniae in lizards to compare the influence of the parameters on the basic reproduction number r0 we calculated the elasticities of r0 to the particular parameters based on sensitivities appendix c fig c 2 in supplementary material for the combination of b afzelii with rodents fig 3 and analogous for combinations of b garinii and b valaisiana with birds and b lusitaniae with lizards appendix c fig c 3 in supplementary material r0 showed elasticities of approximately 0 5 to the survival probability from larva to nymph as well as to the parameters of horizontal transmission from host to larva and from nymph infected in the larval stage to host no differences occurred in the elasticities when the calculations were based on field derived and laboratory derived data parameters appearing only as a product in matrix elements have equal elasticities hartemink et al 2008 furthermore for the host species that do not permit any horizontal transmission from host to larvae i e p 0 r0 had an elasticity of 1 to the co feeding parameters whereas the elasticity to the horizontal transmission were 0 this applies to the common wall lizard as well as to the european robin the common blackbird and the song thrush for b afzelii fig 3 when comparing the elasticities for each genospecies host combination we recognized three patterns fig 4 and appendix fig c 3 in supplementary material a for r0 1 elasticities to the survival probability from larva to nymph sn and to the parameters of horizontal transmission varied around 0 5 whereas elasticities to parameters of co feeding transmission approached 0 b for r0 1 and pl 0 elasticities behaved similarly to a but with decreasing transmission efficiency from host to larva pl the elasticities to sn and the co feeding parameters increase whereas the elasticities to the parameters of horizontal transmission decrease c for r0 1 and pl 0 elasticities to sn and to the parameters of co feeding transmission were 1 whereas elasticities to the parameters of horizontal transmission were 0 for the well adapted combinations of genospecies and host species the survival probability from larva to nymphs and the parameters relevant for horizontal transmission most strongly influence r0 since no laboratory derived data exist for the transmission efficiency from nymph to host qn we varied qn in steps of 0 2 different lines in fig 5 the smaller this value the higher the fraction of blood meals on this host species i hc needs to be in order to reach r0 1 appendix d in supplementary material the strongest effect of qn on r0 was evident for the combination of b afzelii and the bank vole fig 5 with qn 0 2 r0 did not exceed 1 and with qn 0 4 the threshold was only exceeded if 90 of the blood meals were taken on bank voles for well adapted associations of hosts and genospecies such as rodents with b afzelii turdus spp with b garinii or b valaisiana and lizards with b lusitaniae any variation of qn failed to decrease r0 substantially except if qn equals zero 4 discussion the association of the central european borrelia genospecies and the respective host species observed in field and laboratory studies was well reflected by the basic reproduction number r0 resulting from the adapted next generation matrix klyme in our model b afzelii was perpetuated by all six selected rodent species based on both field and laboratory data the omnipresent prevalence of b afzelii in questing ticks in nature rauter and hartung 2005 may result from the fact that b afzelii is maintained by ubiquitous rodents such as wood mouse yellow necked mouse and bank vole when calculating r0 for b burgdorferi s s only experimentally infected rodents appeared to support the perpetuation borrelia burgdorferi s s is rarely detected in host associated ticks in europe among the field studies on which our parameterisation is based only 8 of 1710 larvae harboured this genospecies all feeding on yellow necked mice borrelia afzelii and b burgdorferi s s are detected to co infect questing nymphs significantly more frequently than expected by chance herrmann et al 2013 which suggests that the larvae had acquired b burgdorferi s s simultaneously with b afzelii from rodents the lack of b burgdorferi s s in field derived rodents supports an experimental observation that b burgdorferi s s is not as well adapted to these rodents as is b afzelii richter et al 2004a nevertheless based on our experimental parameterisation r0 of b burgdorferi s s should be only about a third smaller than that of b afzelii possibly small rodents do not come in contact with tick borne b burgdorferi s s as efficiently as with b afzelii maybe because its transmission efficiency from nymph to host qn is impaired and or the density of questing nymphs infected with b burgdorferi s s is insufficient for an efficient contact indeed a larger rodent the red squirrel appears to be readily infected with b burgdorferi s s and may be considered as ubiquitous reservoir rodent for this genospecies humair and gern 1998 pisanu et al 2014 our model differentiated two ubiquitous genospecies infecting rodents and emphasized the differences between laboratory and field observations the other ubiquitous genospecies b garinii and b valaisiana are bird associated hanincová et al 2003b heylen et al 2014 humair et al 1998 taragel ová et al 2008 in our model the black bird and the song thrush efficiently maintained these genospecies whereas the european robin and the great tit failed to do so of the selected bird species for which sufficient data for parametrization of our model were available the thrushes had a higher transmission efficiency and a higher overall tick load than the other two bird species also the ratio of larvae to nymphs feeding on these thrushes favoured nymphs the chance to acquire a borrelia infection increases with the number of nymphal ticks feeding on a host hofmeester et al 2016 these thrushes appear to be attractive to nymphs due to their body mass and or come into contact due to their behaviour foraging in tick habitat heylen et al 2017a hofmeester et al 2016 in both avian hosts b garinii seemed to be perpetuated somewhat more efficiently than b valaisiana reflecting a higher transmission efficiency from the infected bird to larvae the r0 values of these bird associated genospecies maintained by particular bird species are similar to those of b afzelii maintained by ubiquitous species of small rodents predominance of rodent associated or bird associated genospecies in questing ticks varies from site to site rauter and hartung 2005 the fraction of blood meals that larvae take on particular host species appendix c in supplementary material due to their local abundance likely influences the proportion of each of the ubiquitous genospecies in questing nymphs locally restricted genospecies in questing ticks depend entirely or partially on associations with particular hosts in central europe b lusitaniae infects ticks only in lizard habitats richter et al 2013 tarageľová et al 2016 regarding r0 in our model the association between lizards and b lusitaniae appears as strong as for the ubiquitous genospecies in their respective host groups if the proportion of blood meals on lizards increases r0 of the lizard b lusitaniae association appears to increase almost as strongly as that of b afzelii and small rodents appendix c fig c 1 in supplementary material the predominance of b lusitaniae in questing ticks observed in lizard habitats richter et al 2013 richter and matuschka 2006 demonstrates a somewhat more efficient transmission cycle to the extent that b lusitaniae is not pathogenic for people the presence of lizards may substitute the infection of pathogenic borrelia in questing ticks only two studies detected genospecies other than b lusitaniae in larvae feeding on european green lizards földvári et al 2009 majláthová et al 2006 in these studies one larva each of a total of 197 examined ticks was infected by b garinii or b valaisiana and two or three larvae of a total of 521 examined ticks were infected by b afzelii or b burgdorferi s s respectively whether this observation derives from methodological differences or whether only green lizards occasionally harbour these genospecies is not known in our hands none of 818 examined larvae obtained from various lizard species in germany l agilis p muralis l bilineata zootoca vivipara harboured any lyme disease spirochaetes other than b lusitaniae richter unpublished data borrelia spielmanii is similarly locally restricted in sites where garden dormice occur b spielmanii may infect questing ticks as frequently as does b afzelii due to this efficient genospecies host association richter et al 2004b in these sites no wood mice or yellow necked mice were infected by b spielmanii although larvae acquire b spielmanii from experimentally infected wood and yellow necked mice richter et al 2011 it is unknown which parameter prevents mice and voles which live sympatrically with garden dormice to become infected with b spielmanii the efficiency of the transmission cycles of these particular associations results in a local predominance of these genospecies where their respective competent hosts are abundant for b burgdorferi s s american robins serve as competent reservoir hosts in north america battaly and fish 1993 richter et al 2000 in great britain a study examining pheasants detected b burgdorferi s s in feeding larvae kurtenbach et al 2002b in central europe however none of about 2000 larvae obtained while feeding on birds common blackbird turdus merula common chaffinch fringilla coelebs dunnock prunella modularis eurasian blackcap sylvia atricapilla eurasian jay garrulus glandarius european robin erithacus rubecula great tit parus major hawfinch coccothraustes coccothraustes and song thrush turdus philomelos was infected with b burgdorferi s s table 2 this genospecies is similarly scarce in rodent associated larvae whether b burgdorferi s s is less efficiently adapted to abundant birds and rodents in central europe or it is potentially outcompeted by the diversity of the european genospecies remains to be determined particular rodents may be highly efficient reservoir hosts because they frequently encounter nymphs and consequently are more likely to become infected larger hosts seem to feed somewhat more nymphal ticks matuschka et al 1992 the reservoir capacity of rats for lyme disease spirochaetes is higher than that of mice and voles matuschka et al 1996 but the array of genospecies naturally supported by rats remains unclear our modelling based on the available laboratory derived data suggests that they may efficiently perpetuate b afzelii b burgdorferi s s b spielmanii and b garinii as rats are synurbanized matuschka et al 1996 they may maintain some of the rarer genospecies in urban green infrastructures reservoir hosts with a relatively long lifespan may contribute more infected larvae to the tick population than short lived hosts hibernating rodents with their increased lifespan such as garden dormice edible dormice and hazel dormice would thus potentially produce more infected ticks over longer periods edible dormice however appear to lose their spirochaetal infection during hibernation fietz et al 2014 due to the short activity period of edible dormice about 4 months in germany their contribution of infected ticks may be even smaller than that of non hibernating rodents our model does not account for the loss of infection and subsequently appears to overestimate r0 for edible dormice birds too lose their experimental infection with lyme disease spirochaetes richter et al 2000 to realistically estimate the contribution of hosts with longer lifespans such as birds lizards and hibernating rodents the period of infectivity would need to be experimentally determined our next generation matrix model suggests that the maintenance of the various genospecies of lyme disease spirochaetes in nature depends mainly on horizontal transmission relying on reservoir hosts very low elasticities to the parameters that describe co feeding transmission in well adapted genospecies host associations were accompanied in our model with high values of r0 resulting from parameters important to the horizontal transmission we based the value for co feeding transmission efficiency θ on experimental observations for a well adapted genospecies host association b afzelii and mice and averaged the spatial and temporal influence of co feeding transmission richter et al 2002 applying a somewhat larger value for θ derived from another experimental study using various strains of b afzelii in inbred mice tonetti et al 2015 affected r0 only very marginally appendix e in supplementary material due to the unavailability of data we extrapolated these values to the other associations in genospecies host associations which are considered uncommon the somewhat higher elasticities to the co feeding transmission parameters increase with a declining transmission efficiency from host to larvae pl in genospecies host associations without any experimentally or field observed horizontal transmission the model generates high elasticities to the co feeding transmission parameters and a r0 value of 0 1 reflecting the co feeding transmission efficiency θ the effect of the transmission of lyme disease spirochaetes between co feeding ticks on hosts that are not considered reservoir hosts is evidenced in our model e g for b afzelii b burgdorferi s s b garinii b valaisiana in green lizards where r0 approaches 1 if the fraction of blood meals is almost exclusively taken on green lizards and the mean value from data published in tonetti et al 2015 for θ is applied appendix e fig e 3 in supplementary material transmission between co feeding ticks appears to facilitate persistence in the transmission cycle of particular strains of b afzelii and b burgdorferi s s which fail to establish a systemic infection and are rapidly cleared from the rodent host tonetti et al 2015 states et al 2017 based on our current knowledge such experimental observations cannot be extrapolated to other genospecies the model by hartemink et al 2008 disregards the effect of transstadial transmission of lyme disease spirochaetes from a fed larva to its moulted nymph because it is implicitly included and not varied we were unable to clarify this assumption because most parameterizing data derived from field observations for which feeding larvae were analysed instead of nymphs resulting from fully engorged larvae or the feeding status failed to be specified infection rates in fed larvae may be higher than in moulted nymphs derived from these larvae heylen et al 2017b it needs to be considered that complement activity in serum of hosts eliminates potentially non adapted lyme disease spirochaetes in the midgut of ticks feeding on non adapted hosts during the blood meal or during the subsequent transstadial development kurtenbach et al 2002a our model may therefore overestimate r0 for any of the genospecies host associations the mean number of larvae feeding on a host nlh and the transmission efficiency from host to larva pl and from nymph to host qn appear to affect the variation of r0 around its threshold this is irrespective of their ratio in the elasticity analysis because an elasticity analysis focuses on relative differences independent of any thresholds when examining and comparing any possible genospecies host associations the transmission efficiency between tick and host and vice versa appears to differentiate between well adapted and non adapted combinations in our model pl is the major differentiating parameter because numerous experimental and field studies provide data for this parameter whereas few or none exist for qn in well adapted genospecies host associations hosts are particularly efficient when they are numerous and feed numerous larvae if the transmission efficiency from host to larvae is relatively small i e in less adapted combinations the transmission efficiency of nymph to host qn would appear to gain importance e g b afzelii in bank voles a larger number of feeding nymphs on less adapted hosts may compensate for a lower transmission efficiency from that host to larvae because the likelihood that these hosts become infested by an infected nymph is increased thus more hosts would acquire infection as suggested by hofmeester et al 2016 because our model is based on one index case either tick or host its perspective disregards population dynamics and the number of feeding nymphs it may thereby underestimate the effect of qn in nature subadult stages of i ricinus appear to differ in their preference for hosts according to published larval nymphal ratios larvae generally favour small rodents and nymphs the relevant bird species for references see table 4 furthermore the transmission efficiency from host to nymph pn seems negligible to the selected genospecies host systems since a type at birth nymph is not capable to infect the selected host species during the next blood meal as adult the transmission efficiency from host to nymph pn had an elasticity of 0 and may therefore be considered less important thus the same value may be applied as for the transmission efficiency from host to larva pl as we did in our parameterisation it becomes evident that particular parameters such as ih or qn require more precise input values from future research efforts in the field or the laboratory our model and its parameterisation constitute a qualitative base for further modelling approaches considering dynamic interrelationships and processes in the environment that may facilitate the development of intervention strategies to reduce the infection risk of lyme disease the observation that r0 depends on the genospecies host association and differs even within host groups not only justifies but explicitly calls for distinguishing both genospecies and host species in further modelling studies funding this work was supported by the deutsche bundesstiftung umwelt to swg az 20015 388 declaration of competing

24981,in order to analyse the efficiency of the transmission cycles of six lyme disease genospecies and diverse potential reservoir hosts in central europe we modelled each possible genospecies host relationship using a next generation matrix approach in particular we determined the basic reproduction number r0 of any combination of each genospecies and various species of rodents birds and lizards based on a thorough literature analysis we parameterized the model with field derived and laboratory derived values although r0 of borrelia afzelii varied widely with the rodent species analysed the association of this genospecies with rodents overall reached higher r0 values than the association of b garinii or b valaisiana with birds or of b lusitaniae with lizards for such well adapted combinations of genospecies and host species the survival probability from larva to nymphs and the parameters relevant for horizontal transmission most strongly influenced r0 the model differentiated the transmission efficiency of the two ubiquitous genospecies infecting rodents b afzelii and b burgdorferi s s and emphasized differences between experimental and field derived observations it appears that the fraction of blood meals that larvae take on particular omnipresent host species influences the local proportion of each of the ubiquitous genospecies b afzelii b garinii and b valaisiana in questing nymphs the efficiency of the transmission cycles of locally restricted genospecies b spielmanii and b lusitaniae on the other hand appears to result in their predominance in sites where their respective competent hosts occur we observed that r0 varies around its threshold value of 1 depending on the genospecies host association and differs for species even within host groups this justifies and calls for distinguishing both genospecies and host species in further modelling studies in central europe keywords tick host spirochaete interaction lyme disease next generation matrix ixodes ricinus borrelia burgdorferi elasticity 1 introduction a wide range of pathogens are transmitted by ticks the major tick borne disease in temperate zones lyme disease is caused by the bacterial agent borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato wormser et al 2006 this vector borne pathogen is transmitted mainly horizontally i e non infected ticks become infected when feeding on an infected reservoir host these hosts must be attractive to ticks susceptible to tick borne infection maintain the pathogen and become infectious to ticks estrada peña et al 2013 richter et al 2000 after moulting to the next stage these ticks are able to transmit the pathogen to their subsequent hosts other transmission routes are possible but appear rare such as the transmission between co feeding ticks by a locally and temporally limited infection of a tick s host with b burgdorferi s l richter et al 2002 no appreciable extent of vertical transmission of b burgdorferi s l from one tick generation to the next has been observed richter et al 2012 rollend et al 2013 to understand and quantify the interaction between a host and a tick borne pathogen the basic reproduction number r0 is a useful concept randolph and craine 1995 r0 characterises the number of secondary cases caused by one single infected individual over the entire period of its infectivity in a population completely susceptible to the pathogen diekmann et al 1990 generally it provides a threshold quantity of the pathogen s maintenance in its natural transmission cycle the pathogen s transmission cycle is maintained if r0 1 otherwise the pathogen becomes extinct r0 has been calculated in models describing lyme disease spirochaetes and rodents these models focus on the relationship between b burgdorferi sensu stricto and the white footed mouse i e the north american system davis and bent 2011 dunn et al 2013 nonaka et al 2010 in contrast to the north american transmission cycle the transmission of lyme disease spirochaetes in central europe is somewhat more complex in europe b burgdorferi s l transmitted by ixodes ricinus are differentiated into several genospecies b afzelii b bavariensis b burgdorferis s b garinii b lusitaniae b spielmanii and b valaisiana and each of them is maintained in a natural transmission cycle involving a different host group b afzelii b bavariensis and b spielmanii use rodent species to reproduce hanincová et al 2003a richter et al 2012 2004a 2004b whereas b garinii and b valaisiana appear to be associated with birds hanincová et al 2003b b burgdorferi s s may be maintained by both rodents and birds richter et al 2004a 2000 b lusitaniae is the only genospecies perpetuated by lizards majláthová et al 2008 2006 richter and matuschka 2006 an existing model captures the european situation without differentiating the distinct genospecies of b burgdorferi s l and the various host species i ricinus feeds on hartemink et al 2008 we expect that modelling the variety of individual combinations of hosts and genospecies helps to identify which genospecies host association is most efficiently transmitted and whether particular parameters influence its efficiency to compare the efficiency of transmission of the several genospecies host associations we addressed the complex relationships of the central european genospecies with various reservoir hosts in particular we developed a next generation matrix model based on a previous model by hartemink et al 2008 for an in depth analysis differentiating six genospecies and various species of rodents birds and lizards we parametrized our model with a wide range of laboratory derived and field derived data furthermore we performed an elasticity analysis for each of the model parameters 2 methods we adapted the 5 5 next generation matrix model designed for various tick borne disease agents tbd with different transmission routes hartemink et al 2008 to the specific conditions of the european system of hosts and genospecies of lyme disease spirochaetes the underlying model includes five distinct types at birth each of which representing a stage that may potentially acquire an infection egg e larva l nymph n adult a host h fig 1 a each matrix element kij describes the expected number of individuals at stage i infected by one individual infected at stage j because the agents of lyme disease b burgdorferi s l cannot be vertically transmitted the columns and rows corresponding to the egg of hartemink s 5 5 next generation matrix ktbd equal zero i e row k11 through k15 in fig 1a since we limited our analysis to hosts on which subadult ticks feed the columns and rows corresponding to the adult type at birth equal zero too i e column k14 through k54 in fig 1a in order to avoid operating with a rank deficient matrix resulting from a zero determinant we employed an adapted 3 3 matrix klyme fig 1b recognizing the characteristic polynomials it is evident that both matrices have the same eigenvalues although ktbd has two extra trivial zero points over klyme hence k refers to klyme and kij to its matrix elements each of which is defined by an equation fig 1 and appendix a in supplementary material consisting of tick related and pathogen related parameters table 1 2 1 sensitivity and elasticity analysis the change of the basic reproduction number r0 resulting from a change of single matrix elements or lower level parameters see table 1 and appendix a in supplementary material of the next generation matrix plays a key role in the analysis of transmission dynamics this change may be quantified by means of sensitivities and elasticities in order to evaluate the importance of particular parameters and transmission paths therefore we calculated local sensitivities and elasticities to the single matrix elements as well as to the lower level tick related and pathogen related parameters analogous to hartemink et al 2008 according to caswell 2001 cf appendix a in supplementary material 2 2 parameterisation to calculate r0 as well as the sensitivities and elasticities we thoroughly evaluated the tick related and pathogen related parameters table 1 for the genospecies of b burgdorferi s l and host species since field derived and experimental data for some parameter values are lacking we adopted these from the existing model we calculated all other parameter values from data derived from a thorough literature analysis and describe the approach and rationale for each of the parameters in detail 2 3 transmission efficiency from host to tick p the parameter p is defined as the transmission efficiency from a competent host to a tick according to hartemink et al 2008 who used a value of 0 5 for both pl and pn the transmission efficiency pl quantifies the ratio of larvae acquiring the pathogen from an infected host and may be based on standardized laboratory studies or on field studies in laboratory studies a host is infected by tick borne lyme disease spirochaetes and subsequently non infected unfed larvae are permitted to feed on it during a so called xenodiagnosis richter et al 2000 the ratio of the number of infected larvae to the number of all fed larvae indicates the transmission efficiency from host to larva matuschka et al 1997 alternatively the transmission efficiency may also be derived from larvae naturally infesting field captured hosts because lyme disease spirochaetes are not transmitted vertically richter et al 2012 rollend et al 2013 thus questing unfed larvae are not infected and acquire infection only during their first blood meal on an infected host these larvae may similarly be regarded as xenodiagnostic ticks experimental studies capture the transmission efficiency of a host species more precisely because the status of the infection of the examined hosts is known and may be standardized ideally xenodiagnostic ticks are examined for spirochaetal presence in the moulted nymphal stage because this also includes the likelihood of the tick s development and of the spirochaetal survival during moulting standardized laboratory studies provide values for the transmission efficiency under ideal conditions which may result in somewhat overestimated values compared to data derived from field studies with varying conditions therefore sufficiently large long term sampling in various environments throughout several seasons is necessary to obtain a representative mean parameter value to calculate the efficiency of pathogen transmission from host to larva pl for the parameterisation of the next generation matrix fig 1b we used the proportion of infected larvae averaged over all analysed laboratory studies eq 1 which concurs with the specific host infectivity according to kahl et al 2002 1 p l n i n f e c t e d l a r v a e n e x a m i n e d l a r v a e for field derived data we used the examined larvae of all examined hosts although the number of examined larvae on infected hosts would be more accurate because it is similar to the calculation using experimentally infected hosts the number of infected hosts is not provided in most publications the transmission efficiency from host to larva may also be calculated as the specific infectivity is according to mather et al 1989 or the host to larval transmission coefficient βh t according to hanincová et al 2003a these calculations however require that the proportion of the infected larvae is known in respect to a particular host individual which is rarely published in some publications the specific infectivity is and or the host to larval transmission coefficient βh t is presented without the input values e g hanincová et al 2003a not permitting to calculate the transmission efficiency according to eq 1 to ensure comparability and because differences between the host species are more important than absolute values randolph and craine 1995 we focused on publications that permit the calculation using eq 1 field studies providing data on the transmission efficiency from host to larva are more numerous than laboratory studies table 2 presumably due to animal welfare regulations and feasibility of experimentation on lizards and birds laboratory studies mainly focus on rodents therefore we calculated the mean transmission efficiency from host to larva pl according to eq 1 mainly based on results of published and unpublished field studies table 2 whenever possible we additionally parameterised the next generation matrix using the transmission efficiency results of laboratory studies to compare the transmission efficiencies of field and laboratory studies for particular rodent species table 2 because of the ideal experimental conditions the transmission efficiency based on laboratory derived values will most likely be overestimated whereas the use of field derived values will result in an underestimation because larvae feeding on non infected hosts enter into the calculation of the major host species in central europe we selected those species which permitted us to parameterise the next generation matrix on thorough data fig 1b table 2 the transmission efficiency from host to nymph cannot be determined in field studies because the nymph may have already acquired infection during its larval blood meal thus the source of infection of the examined nymphs or its derived adults remains unknown experimental studies would facilitate to determine the transmission efficiency from host to nymph however we are not aware of any such studies therefore we assumed pn analogous to pl and used the same values 2 3 1 transmission efficiency from tick to host q the transmission efficiency from the respective tick stage to the host q is equivalent to the transmission coefficient βt v according to randolph 1998 this transmission coefficient describes the probability of a host individual acquiring infection by a single bite of an infected tick and can be determined solely in laboratory studies by investigating the proportion of host individuals which become infectious after one infected tick bite it is important to also consider the subsequent infectivity of the host individual because only an infectious host contributes to r0 and therefore perpetuates the pathogen thus q may be calculated according to eq 2 2 q n i n f e c t i o u s h o s t s n e x a m i n e d h o s t s to our knowledge the transmission efficiency from nymph to host qn has been determined only for rodents matuschka et al 1992 richter et al 2011 in experimental infection studies generally more than one nymph is permitted to attach to a host individual to ensure that the host acquires an infection even if the population of infecting nymphs is only partially infected the data available from literature cannot be adapted to the parameter qn according to the definition of randolph 1998 therefore we adopted the value of 0 8 used by hartemink et al 2008 for genospecies host combinations where transmission from host to larva was possible pl 0 for combinations with pl 0 we used qn 0 to analyse whether this parameter affects r0 in particular genospecies host combinations we added a separate modelling approach varying qn in steps of 0 2 in a set of next generation matrices the transmission efficiency from the adult stage qa is zero because no adult ticks feed on the relevant host species 2 3 2 period of infectivity of the host ih the parameter ih is defined as systemic infection duration by hartemink et al 2008 who used a value of 120 days in their model instead of systemic infection duration we prefer to use the period when a host is infectious to ticks feeding on it which we assume to be more relevant to the pathogen s transmission cycle therefore we chose the term period of host infectivity for the parameter ih this parameter may solely be determined by extensive laboratory studies to determine this parameter despite a lack of laboratory derived data we assumed that the maximum period of infectivity is a function of the host s mean life span lsh restricted to the period of seasonal tick activity at ixodes ricinus ticks are mainly active from march to october in central europe schulz et al 2014 therefore we used a period of tick activity of 243 days per year fig 1b assuming that a host individual is born at the beginning of the period of tick activity and susceptible to infestation and infection we used the host s life span as an equivalent to the period of host infectivity as long as the host s life span is shorter than the period of tick activity as soon as the host s life span exceeds the period of tick activity but is shorter than one year we used the period of tick activity as the period of host infectivity only if the host s life span exceeds one year we multiplied the lifespan by the period of tick activity in proportion to one year the period of host infectivity may therefore be derived as a partial function eq 3 for the calculated values see table 3 3 i h l s h l s h l s h a t a t l s h a t l s h 365 l s h a t 1 365 l s h 365 for the edible dormouse we used its activity period instead of that of the tick because this rodent s activity period is shorter than and within the tick s period of activity fietz et al 2014 2 3 3 co feeding transmission efficiency θ hartemink et al 2008 defined the parameter θ as transmission efficiency from tick to tick and used a value of 0 56 in their model the transmission of spirochaetes between co feeding ticks θ appears negligible in perpetuating the transmission cycle of b burgdorferi s l richter et al 2002 to parameterise the adapted next generation matrix fig 1b we used laboratory derived data describing the temporal and spatial infection rates in larvae after co feeding with one single b afzelii infected nymph on hairless mice mus musculus richter et al 2002 we averaged these rates to eliminate the temporal and spatial components because the next generation matrix does not contain these dimensions the resulting value for the efficiency of co feeding transmission from nymph to larva θnl is 0 1 we analogously used this value for θnl and θnn for all host groups since data for birds or lizards are lacking the co feeding transmission efficiency from adults θal und θan is zero as no adults feed on the selected hosts 2 3 4 mean number of ticks per host n the parameter n is defined as the mean number of ticks feeding on a competent host according to hartemink et al 2008 who used nlh 6 for larvae and nnh 0 2 for nymphs respectively feeding on a competent host this parameter may be expressed by two different quantities the abundance of infestation or the mean intensity of infestation according to hanincová et al 2003a we used the abundance of infestation instead of the mean intensity of infestation since the definition of nlh or nnh as average number of larvae or nymphs respectively feeding on a competent host implies a mean value over all examined hosts thus we applied eq 4 to calculate the mean number of larvae or nymphs per host by averaging the number of ticks over the respective hosts over all studies included in this analysis table 4 4 a b u n d a n c e o f i n f e s t a t i o n n t i c k s n h o s t s 2 3 5 number of co feeding ticks c the parameter cij characterises the number of ticks at type at birth i co feeding with one tick at type at birth j the number of larvae or nymphs co feeding with an adult cla or cna respectively is zero since no adults feed on the relevant host species for the number of larvae co feeding with a nymph cln hartemink et al 2008 used a value of 20 based on data derived from bank voles and yellow necked mice randolph et al 1999 a value of one nymph co feeding with another nymph cnn is based on unpublished data by randolph hartemink et al 2008 because data on these parameters are limited to these studies and transmission among co feeding ticks appears to play a minor part in the transmission cycle of b burgdorferi s l richter et al 2002 we adopted the values for cln and cnn used by hartemink et al 2008 2 3 6 tick feeding period d for the mean feeding period of larvae dl and nymphs dn hartemink et al 2008 used a value of 2 5 days and 3 5 days for larval and nymphal attachment respectively based on unpublished data by randolph lacking host specification the mean feeding period of the various tick stages on particular host species is rarely examined a mean larval feeding period of 3 89 days and a mean nymphal feeding period of 4 34 days were determined by observing 34 503 larvae and of 8506 nymphs respectively feeding on mongolian jirds richter et al unpublished data and were assumed for all rodents to parameterise the next generation matrix for birds we used data by heylen et al 2014 revealing 3 67 days and 3 84 days for larvae and nymphs respectively feeding on great tits parus major since the feeding period of ticks on lizards has not been examined we applied the feeding periods of ticks on rodents 2 3 7 probability of tick survival s the parameters sn and sa according to hartemink et al 2008 include the survival probability from one stage to another as well as the feeding and moulting success they used theoretical values of 0 1 for sn and sa derived from randolph and craine 1995 we adopted these values due to a lack of studies determining these parameters 2 3 8 fraction of blood meals on a host species hc the parameter hc is defined as the probability of feeding on a competent host or the fraction of blood meals taken on competent hosts hartemink et al 2008 we varied this parameter analogously to hartemink et al 2008 for each respective host species 3 results we adapted and expanded an existing next generation matrix to include the diverse central european genospecies of b burgdorferi s l as well as the various central european hosts of i ricinus in order to compare their transmission dynamics in selected host species focussing on the basic reproduction number r0 for the perpetuation of b afzelii in rodents r0 exceeded the threshold value of 1 based on both field derived and laboratory derived data differences in r0 resulting from the use of either type of data were marginal whereas the application of different rodent species resulted in a wide range in lizards and birds on the other hand the basic reproduction number of b afzelii did not even reach the threshold value fig 2 and table 5 for b burgdorferi s s r0 reached values 1 only in the laboratory rodents in case of b spielmanii r0 1 was also reached for the garden dormouse with field derived parameters table 5 and appendix c fig c 1 in supplementary material r0 of b garinii exceeded the threshold value only for the perpetuation in the two turdus spp and in experimentally infected rats table 5 and appendix c fig c 1 in supplementary material for b valaisiana however values of r0 1 are only reached for the two turdus spp table 5 and appendix c fig c 1 in supplementary material in the case of b lusitaniae r0 exceeded the threshold value of 1 for the perpetuation only in lizards overall r0 of b afzelii reached higher values in rodents than b garinii or b valaisiana in birds and b lusitaniae in lizards to compare the influence of the parameters on the basic reproduction number r0 we calculated the elasticities of r0 to the particular parameters based on sensitivities appendix c fig c 2 in supplementary material for the combination of b afzelii with rodents fig 3 and analogous for combinations of b garinii and b valaisiana with birds and b lusitaniae with lizards appendix c fig c 3 in supplementary material r0 showed elasticities of approximately 0 5 to the survival probability from larva to nymph as well as to the parameters of horizontal transmission from host to larva and from nymph infected in the larval stage to host no differences occurred in the elasticities when the calculations were based on field derived and laboratory derived data parameters appearing only as a product in matrix elements have equal elasticities hartemink et al 2008 furthermore for the host species that do not permit any horizontal transmission from host to larvae i e p 0 r0 had an elasticity of 1 to the co feeding parameters whereas the elasticity to the horizontal transmission were 0 this applies to the common wall lizard as well as to the european robin the common blackbird and the song thrush for b afzelii fig 3 when comparing the elasticities for each genospecies host combination we recognized three patterns fig 4 and appendix fig c 3 in supplementary material a for r0 1 elasticities to the survival probability from larva to nymph sn and to the parameters of horizontal transmission varied around 0 5 whereas elasticities to parameters of co feeding transmission approached 0 b for r0 1 and pl 0 elasticities behaved similarly to a but with decreasing transmission efficiency from host to larva pl the elasticities to sn and the co feeding parameters increase whereas the elasticities to the parameters of horizontal transmission decrease c for r0 1 and pl 0 elasticities to sn and to the parameters of co feeding transmission were 1 whereas elasticities to the parameters of horizontal transmission were 0 for the well adapted combinations of genospecies and host species the survival probability from larva to nymphs and the parameters relevant for horizontal transmission most strongly influence r0 since no laboratory derived data exist for the transmission efficiency from nymph to host qn we varied qn in steps of 0 2 different lines in fig 5 the smaller this value the higher the fraction of blood meals on this host species i hc needs to be in order to reach r0 1 appendix d in supplementary material the strongest effect of qn on r0 was evident for the combination of b afzelii and the bank vole fig 5 with qn 0 2 r0 did not exceed 1 and with qn 0 4 the threshold was only exceeded if 90 of the blood meals were taken on bank voles for well adapted associations of hosts and genospecies such as rodents with b afzelii turdus spp with b garinii or b valaisiana and lizards with b lusitaniae any variation of qn failed to decrease r0 substantially except if qn equals zero 4 discussion the association of the central european borrelia genospecies and the respective host species observed in field and laboratory studies was well reflected by the basic reproduction number r0 resulting from the adapted next generation matrix klyme in our model b afzelii was perpetuated by all six selected rodent species based on both field and laboratory data the omnipresent prevalence of b afzelii in questing ticks in nature rauter and hartung 2005 may result from the fact that b afzelii is maintained by ubiquitous rodents such as wood mouse yellow necked mouse and bank vole when calculating r0 for b burgdorferi s s only experimentally infected rodents appeared to support the perpetuation borrelia burgdorferi s s is rarely detected in host associated ticks in europe among the field studies on which our parameterisation is based only 8 of 1710 larvae harboured this genospecies all feeding on yellow necked mice borrelia afzelii and b burgdorferi s s are detected to co infect questing nymphs significantly more frequently than expected by chance herrmann et al 2013 which suggests that the larvae had acquired b burgdorferi s s simultaneously with b afzelii from rodents the lack of b burgdorferi s s in field derived rodents supports an experimental observation that b burgdorferi s s is not as well adapted to these rodents as is b afzelii richter et al 2004a nevertheless based on our experimental parameterisation r0 of b burgdorferi s s should be only about a third smaller than that of b afzelii possibly small rodents do not come in contact with tick borne b burgdorferi s s as efficiently as with b afzelii maybe because its transmission efficiency from nymph to host qn is impaired and or the density of questing nymphs infected with b burgdorferi s s is insufficient for an efficient contact indeed a larger rodent the red squirrel appears to be readily infected with b burgdorferi s s and may be considered as ubiquitous reservoir rodent for this genospecies humair and gern 1998 pisanu et al 2014 our model differentiated two ubiquitous genospecies infecting rodents and emphasized the differences between laboratory and field observations the other ubiquitous genospecies b garinii and b valaisiana are bird associated hanincová et al 2003b heylen et al 2014 humair et al 1998 taragel ová et al 2008 in our model the black bird and the song thrush efficiently maintained these genospecies whereas the european robin and the great tit failed to do so of the selected bird species for which sufficient data for parametrization of our model were available the thrushes had a higher transmission efficiency and a higher overall tick load than the other two bird species also the ratio of larvae to nymphs feeding on these thrushes favoured nymphs the chance to acquire a borrelia infection increases with the number of nymphal ticks feeding on a host hofmeester et al 2016 these thrushes appear to be attractive to nymphs due to their body mass and or come into contact due to their behaviour foraging in tick habitat heylen et al 2017a hofmeester et al 2016 in both avian hosts b garinii seemed to be perpetuated somewhat more efficiently than b valaisiana reflecting a higher transmission efficiency from the infected bird to larvae the r0 values of these bird associated genospecies maintained by particular bird species are similar to those of b afzelii maintained by ubiquitous species of small rodents predominance of rodent associated or bird associated genospecies in questing ticks varies from site to site rauter and hartung 2005 the fraction of blood meals that larvae take on particular host species appendix c in supplementary material due to their local abundance likely influences the proportion of each of the ubiquitous genospecies in questing nymphs locally restricted genospecies in questing ticks depend entirely or partially on associations with particular hosts in central europe b lusitaniae infects ticks only in lizard habitats richter et al 2013 tarageľová et al 2016 regarding r0 in our model the association between lizards and b lusitaniae appears as strong as for the ubiquitous genospecies in their respective host groups if the proportion of blood meals on lizards increases r0 of the lizard b lusitaniae association appears to increase almost as strongly as that of b afzelii and small rodents appendix c fig c 1 in supplementary material the predominance of b lusitaniae in questing ticks observed in lizard habitats richter et al 2013 richter and matuschka 2006 demonstrates a somewhat more efficient transmission cycle to the extent that b lusitaniae is not pathogenic for people the presence of lizards may substitute the infection of pathogenic borrelia in questing ticks only two studies detected genospecies other than b lusitaniae in larvae feeding on european green lizards földvári et al 2009 majláthová et al 2006 in these studies one larva each of a total of 197 examined ticks was infected by b garinii or b valaisiana and two or three larvae of a total of 521 examined ticks were infected by b afzelii or b burgdorferi s s respectively whether this observation derives from methodological differences or whether only green lizards occasionally harbour these genospecies is not known in our hands none of 818 examined larvae obtained from various lizard species in germany l agilis p muralis l bilineata zootoca vivipara harboured any lyme disease spirochaetes other than b lusitaniae richter unpublished data borrelia spielmanii is similarly locally restricted in sites where garden dormice occur b spielmanii may infect questing ticks as frequently as does b afzelii due to this efficient genospecies host association richter et al 2004b in these sites no wood mice or yellow necked mice were infected by b spielmanii although larvae acquire b spielmanii from experimentally infected wood and yellow necked mice richter et al 2011 it is unknown which parameter prevents mice and voles which live sympatrically with garden dormice to become infected with b spielmanii the efficiency of the transmission cycles of these particular associations results in a local predominance of these genospecies where their respective competent hosts are abundant for b burgdorferi s s american robins serve as competent reservoir hosts in north america battaly and fish 1993 richter et al 2000 in great britain a study examining pheasants detected b burgdorferi s s in feeding larvae kurtenbach et al 2002b in central europe however none of about 2000 larvae obtained while feeding on birds common blackbird turdus merula common chaffinch fringilla coelebs dunnock prunella modularis eurasian blackcap sylvia atricapilla eurasian jay garrulus glandarius european robin erithacus rubecula great tit parus major hawfinch coccothraustes coccothraustes and song thrush turdus philomelos was infected with b burgdorferi s s table 2 this genospecies is similarly scarce in rodent associated larvae whether b burgdorferi s s is less efficiently adapted to abundant birds and rodents in central europe or it is potentially outcompeted by the diversity of the european genospecies remains to be determined particular rodents may be highly efficient reservoir hosts because they frequently encounter nymphs and consequently are more likely to become infected larger hosts seem to feed somewhat more nymphal ticks matuschka et al 1992 the reservoir capacity of rats for lyme disease spirochaetes is higher than that of mice and voles matuschka et al 1996 but the array of genospecies naturally supported by rats remains unclear our modelling based on the available laboratory derived data suggests that they may efficiently perpetuate b afzelii b burgdorferi s s b spielmanii and b garinii as rats are synurbanized matuschka et al 1996 they may maintain some of the rarer genospecies in urban green infrastructures reservoir hosts with a relatively long lifespan may contribute more infected larvae to the tick population than short lived hosts hibernating rodents with their increased lifespan such as garden dormice edible dormice and hazel dormice would thus potentially produce more infected ticks over longer periods edible dormice however appear to lose their spirochaetal infection during hibernation fietz et al 2014 due to the short activity period of edible dormice about 4 months in germany their contribution of infected ticks may be even smaller than that of non hibernating rodents our model does not account for the loss of infection and subsequently appears to overestimate r0 for edible dormice birds too lose their experimental infection with lyme disease spirochaetes richter et al 2000 to realistically estimate the contribution of hosts with longer lifespans such as birds lizards and hibernating rodents the period of infectivity would need to be experimentally determined our next generation matrix model suggests that the maintenance of the various genospecies of lyme disease spirochaetes in nature depends mainly on horizontal transmission relying on reservoir hosts very low elasticities to the parameters that describe co feeding transmission in well adapted genospecies host associations were accompanied in our model with high values of r0 resulting from parameters important to the horizontal transmission we based the value for co feeding transmission efficiency θ on experimental observations for a well adapted genospecies host association b afzelii and mice and averaged the spatial and temporal influence of co feeding transmission richter et al 2002 applying a somewhat larger value for θ derived from another experimental study using various strains of b afzelii in inbred mice tonetti et al 2015 affected r0 only very marginally appendix e in supplementary material due to the unavailability of data we extrapolated these values to the other associations in genospecies host associations which are considered uncommon the somewhat higher elasticities to the co feeding transmission parameters increase with a declining transmission efficiency from host to larvae pl in genospecies host associations without any experimentally or field observed horizontal transmission the model generates high elasticities to the co feeding transmission parameters and a r0 value of 0 1 reflecting the co feeding transmission efficiency θ the effect of the transmission of lyme disease spirochaetes between co feeding ticks on hosts that are not considered reservoir hosts is evidenced in our model e g for b afzelii b burgdorferi s s b garinii b valaisiana in green lizards where r0 approaches 1 if the fraction of blood meals is almost exclusively taken on green lizards and the mean value from data published in tonetti et al 2015 for θ is applied appendix e fig e 3 in supplementary material transmission between co feeding ticks appears to facilitate persistence in the transmission cycle of particular strains of b afzelii and b burgdorferi s s which fail to establish a systemic infection and are rapidly cleared from the rodent host tonetti et al 2015 states et al 2017 based on our current knowledge such experimental observations cannot be extrapolated to other genospecies the model by hartemink et al 2008 disregards the effect of transstadial transmission of lyme disease spirochaetes from a fed larva to its moulted nymph because it is implicitly included and not varied we were unable to clarify this assumption because most parameterizing data derived from field observations for which feeding larvae were analysed instead of nymphs resulting from fully engorged larvae or the feeding status failed to be specified infection rates in fed larvae may be higher than in moulted nymphs derived from these larvae heylen et al 2017b it needs to be considered that complement activity in serum of hosts eliminates potentially non adapted lyme disease spirochaetes in the midgut of ticks feeding on non adapted hosts during the blood meal or during the subsequent transstadial development kurtenbach et al 2002a our model may therefore overestimate r0 for any of the genospecies host associations the mean number of larvae feeding on a host nlh and the transmission efficiency from host to larva pl and from nymph to host qn appear to affect the variation of r0 around its threshold this is irrespective of their ratio in the elasticity analysis because an elasticity analysis focuses on relative differences independent of any thresholds when examining and comparing any possible genospecies host associations the transmission efficiency between tick and host and vice versa appears to differentiate between well adapted and non adapted combinations in our model pl is the major differentiating parameter because numerous experimental and field studies provide data for this parameter whereas few or none exist for qn in well adapted genospecies host associations hosts are particularly efficient when they are numerous and feed numerous larvae if the transmission efficiency from host to larvae is relatively small i e in less adapted combinations the transmission efficiency of nymph to host qn would appear to gain importance e g b afzelii in bank voles a larger number of feeding nymphs on less adapted hosts may compensate for a lower transmission efficiency from that host to larvae because the likelihood that these hosts become infested by an infected nymph is increased thus more hosts would acquire infection as suggested by hofmeester et al 2016 because our model is based on one index case either tick or host its perspective disregards population dynamics and the number of feeding nymphs it may thereby underestimate the effect of qn in nature subadult stages of i ricinus appear to differ in their preference for hosts according to published larval nymphal ratios larvae generally favour small rodents and nymphs the relevant bird species for references see table 4 furthermore the transmission efficiency from host to nymph pn seems negligible to the selected genospecies host systems since a type at birth nymph is not capable to infect the selected host species during the next blood meal as adult the transmission efficiency from host to nymph pn had an elasticity of 0 and may therefore be considered less important thus the same value may be applied as for the transmission efficiency from host to larva pl as we did in our parameterisation it becomes evident that particular parameters such as ih or qn require more precise input values from future research efforts in the field or the laboratory our model and its parameterisation constitute a qualitative base for further modelling approaches considering dynamic interrelationships and processes in the environment that may facilitate the development of intervention strategies to reduce the infection risk of lyme disease the observation that r0 depends on the genospecies host association and differs even within host groups not only justifies but explicitly calls for distinguishing both genospecies and host species in further modelling studies funding this work was supported by the deutsche bundesstiftung umwelt to swg az 20015 388 declaration of competing

24982,marine phytoplankton can regulate their stoichiometric composition in response to variations in the availability of nutrients light and the ph of seawater varying elemental composition of photoautotrophs affects several important ecological and biogeochemical processes e g primary and export production nutrient cycling calcification and grazing here we compare two plankton ecosystem models that consider regulatory mechanisms of cellular carbon and nitrogen driving the physiological acclimation of photoautotrophs the carbon nitrogen regulated ecosystem model cn recom and the optimality based model obm differ in their representation of phytoplankton dynamics i e nutrient acquisition synthesis of chlorophyll a and growth all other model compartments zooplankton detritus dissolved inorganic and organic matter and processes grazing aggregation remineralisation remain identical in both models we assess the skills of the two models against data from an ocean acidification mesocosm experiment with three co2 treatments neither model accounts for any carbon dioxide co2 effects explicitly instead we assimilate data of the different co2 treatments separately into the models thereby we aim at identifying optimal model parameter values that might correlate with differences in co2 conditions for the obm optimal parameter estimates of qmin subsistence n c ratio and v c 0 maximum potential photosynthesis rate of photoautotrophs turned out to be higher for mesocosms exposed to high co2 compared to those with low co2 concentrations by contrast a similar correlation is not observed for the cn recom a possible physiological interpretation of higher estimates of qmin and v c 0 according to the obm is that phytoplankton may experience environmental stress under more acidic conditions and hence must invest more energy resources for maintaining basic cellular functions our data assimilation reveals that the parameters of the obm are better constrained by the data than those of the cn recom furthermore the obm is better able than cn recom to reproduce data that were not used for parameter optimization keywords models acclimation

cebrian and lartigue 2004 orr et al 2005 and also food web dynamics across several trophic levels the chlorophyll a chla c and chla n ratios within photoautotrophic cells also vary because of complex interactions among light nutrients and temperature armstrong 2006 behrenfeld et al 2002 during the last two decades many marine biogeochemical models have been applied to study the response of primary and export production to changes in the physical environment of aquatic ecosystems over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales behrenfeld et al 2006 boyd and doney 2002 quere et al 2005 harley et

matear 1995 denman 2003 apart from the number of compartments resolved the performance of a plankton ecosystem model depends on how phytoplankton growth is mathematically described phytoplankton

the chain model of pahlow et al 2013 which is based on the ecological stoichiometry concept of sterner and elser 2002 and assumes that the limitation by n and p is biochemically dependent according to the scheme of saito et al 2008 in contrast flynn 2001 2008 assumed growth limitation by n and p to be independent quantifying model performance model assessment is a challenge evans 2003 friedrichs et al 2007 and is complicated by two aspects 1 data availability and 2 identification of the best parameter settings to explain these data model calibration in situ mesocosm perturbation studies provide an effective tool to study the impact of anthropogenic forcing on marine ecosystems vallino 2000 riebesell et al 2008 schartau et al 2017 whereby environmental conditions can be manipulated to investigate marine ecosystem responses sommer et al 2007 kim et al 2006 a series of three pelagic ecosystem co2 enrichment experiments peece i iii have been conducted between 2001 and 2005 to investigate effects of ocean acidification on marine plankton dynamics riebesell et al 2008 modelling studies have focussed on the peece i experiment described in delille et al 2005 and engel et al 2005 joassin et al 2011 applied a mechanistic model that resolves c n p fluxes of the peece i experiment with an explicit representation of calcification by e huxleyi and of microbial bacteria and viruses dynamics they found that the variability in the cellular c n ratio of e huxleyi drives the dynamics of most of the processes including calcification and the excretion of dissolved organic carbon doc in the mesocosms and attributed variations in calcification to differences in viral attack and lysis of e huxleyi recently using an optimality based model krishna and schartau 2017 showed that most of the variability in calcification between the mesocosms during the peece i experiment can be explained by small variations in the initial abundance and physiological state of coccolithophores rather than by acidification effects and viral lysis in this study we resort to the experimental data of peece i but with the objective of comparing the performance of two carbon nitrogen regulatory modelling approaches based on geider et al 1998 and optimality based that differ in their representation of the physiology of the phytoplankton in contrast to the studies of joassin et al 2011 and krishna and schartau 2017 we do not account for calcification and neither of the models explicitly resolves the effect of co2 on plankton growth or physiology the data assimilation method was designed to ascertain whether the growth dynamics described by the two models yield optimal parameter estimates that correlate with the co2 concentrations of the mesocosms a potential but unknown and unresolved co2 effect may then be reflected in systematic differences in parameter estimates when assimilating data of the respective mesocosms exposed to different levels of co2 2 methods in the following we will first provide background information about the experimental data and explain how the data were sorted and combined for our data assimilation procedure we will describe the common features and then highlight the differences between the two models cn recom and obm the definition of the cost function that evaluates discrepancies between the observational data and model results will be presented we will outline the five steps applied for the estimation of optimal parameter values minimisation of the cost function which includes a description of how uncertainty ranges and collinearities of the parameter estimates were derived 2 1 data a series of three experiments was conducted in the large scale mesocosm facilities at the marine field station of university of bergen raunefjorden between 2001 and 2005 to investigate effects of ocean acidification oa on plankton community dynamics peece riebesell and tortell 2011 peece i is the first of this series where nine mesocosms were treated with three different levels of initial partial pressure of co2 with three replicates each engel et al 2005 delille et al 2005 1 the fut treatment subject to high dissolved inorganic carbon dic levels 2119 2122 mmol m 3 or pco2 710 ppmv 2 the pre treatment with dic concentrations of 2040 2056 mmol m 3 and pco2 410 ppmv resembling present day conditions and 3 the gla treatment with dic between 1919 1929 mmol m 3 pco2 180 ppmv for our model simulations we consider the air above the mesocosms surface to be a mixture of 90 air with the target pco2 and 10 of air with ambient atmospheric pco2 krishna and schartau 2017 for model calibration and assessment we define three cases each comprising a combination of two out of the three co2 treatments 1 fut pre 2 fut gla and 3 pre gla this way we can better account for the variability within and between the mesocosms thereby reducing possible artificial biases towards one particular co2 treatment in our estimates daily measurements of salinity and temperature are available for the entire period 23 days of the peece i experiment which we interpolated to hourly values that are then used as boundary conditions we also include hourly photosynthetically active radiation par data from meteorological global irradiance measurements of the geophysical institute of the university of bergen norway skartveit et al 2001 we assume the mesocosms to be homogeneously mixed and we do not account for any vertical export of particulate organic matter in either model attenuation of light in the water column is estimated by lambert beer s law and depends on depth d the light absorption coefficients of seawater a w and chlorophyll a a c and the concentration of chlorophyll a chl all mesocosms were covered with tetrafluoroethylene films and allowed only 95 transmission for photosynthetically active radiation delille et al 2005 thus the vertically averaged irradiance i avg is calculated as 1 i avg 0 95 i κ d 1 e κ d κ a w a c chl where κ is the total light attenuation coefficient as pointed out before our candidate models do not explicitly resolve coccolithophores and calcification as done in krishna and schartau 2017 only a single phytoplankton compartment is used instead which reduces the number of parameters considerably and allows for a better comparison of the two models since calcification affects the amount of dissolved inorganic carbon dic utilized by the algae we employ corrected dic data which is the sum of observed concentrations of dic and pic particulate inorganic carbon thereby attempting to correct for the effect of calcification on dic 2 2 common structure of the candidate models we apply two carbon and nitrogen regulatory marine ecosystem models the carbon nitrogen regulated ecosystem model cn recom and the optimality based model obm the obm and the cn recom describe the regulation of c n and chl c ratios of algal cells in response to changes in external nutrient light and temperature conditions fig 1 illustrates the compartments and processes in both models effects of phosphorus are neglected and we need not simulate diazotrophy here both

phytoplankton dynamics formulations of all other model compartments zooplankton detritus ldom dccho and tep are identical for both models fig 1 2 2 1 phytoplankton algal growth is described in terms of three state variables representing carbon c nitrogen n and chlorophyll chl so that we can simulate variable stoichiometry cell quotas n c and chl c ratios dynamically the rates of change of these

variables and parameters are given in table 1 2 2 2 zooplankton in both models zooplankton grazing is described by a holling type iii function morozov 2010 of photoautotrophs phyn and loss in zooplankton biomass carbon and nitrogen is accounted for by mortality details on zooplankton and its odes are given in a 1 2 2 3 detritus sources of detrital c and n biomass are represented by phytoplankton aggregation and zooplankton mortality in both models chlorophyll of dead phytoplankton cells is treated as part of detritus thereby resolving the decay of chlorophyll within the detritus pool hydrolysis is regarded as the only sink of detrital carbon and nitrogen the degradation of detritus is thus assumed to be a source of dissolved organic matter dom the odes for detrital biomass n

appendices a 3 and a 4 2 2 5 dissolved labile organic matter ldom freshly exuded and leaked organic matter from phytoplankton hydrolysis of detritus and of carbon in transparent exopolymer particles

this physical chemical interaction is described as a process of particle coagulation engel et al 2004b schartau et al 2007 apart from coagulation the dccho are assumed to be also subject to remineralisation thus becoming a source for dic the odes for formation of dccho and for tepc are explained in appendix a 6 2 3 differences between cn recom and obm 2 3 1 growth and respiration phytoplankton growth in the cn recom is largely based on the assumptions of geider et al 1998 asserting that maximum photosynthetic rate is achieved by an algal cell when its n cell quota n c ratio q

proportional to v c n in cn recom 6 r ζ n v c n r ref in contrast to the cn recom the obm maximises phytoplankton net relative growth rate via optimal resource allocation between nutrient acquisition

and din 10 v c n v max n din din k din we apply the modified form for v max n introduced by schartau et al 2007 11 v max n v fact v 0 c t f q max 1 exp 100 q max q n where v 0 c is the maximum potential photosynthesis rate in d 1 and v fact is a factor relating the potential rate of nitrogen uptake to v 0 c t f is the temperature dependence of metabolic rates as in geider et al 1998 and qmax is the maximum cellular n c ratio in units of mol n mol c 1 the exponential term in the denominator of eq 11 avoids the singularity when v max n reaches 0 as q n approaches q max which allows cn recom to remain robust against various combinations of parameter values during parameter optimisation furthermore this small refinement makes the model also amenable to 1d and 2d modelling applications where an explicit representation of vertical mixing is required nitrogen assimilation in the obm is described by optimal uptake kinetics as proposed in pahlow et al 2013 v c n is given as a function of f v o din and t f furthermore an affinity based description of n assimilation is considered instead of eq 10 12 v c n f v o 1 t f v 0 n 1 a 0 din 2 where v 0 n is the maximum potential

al 2016 argued that the consideration of affinity introduces a better representation of the nutrient uptake mechanism of photoautotrophs than a half saturation constant details about the auxiliary variables and parameters related to nitrogen limitation for both models are given in tables 1 3 2 3 3 chlorophyll synthesis pigment synthesis s chl in the cn recom depends on light and on v c n synthesis of chlorophyll ceases as the chlorophyll a to nitrogen ratio of a cell θ n in g chl mol n 1 approaches its maximum θ max n which is a model parameter under high light conditions s chl is down regulated and becomes inversely proportional to the light dependent term α θ i avg 13 s chl v c n 1 2 θ max n θ n v c α θ i the description of chlorophyll synthesis in the obm is more complex as it depends on the trade off between carbon fixation and respiratory costs of photosynthesis within the chloroplast s chl depends on the optimised size of the chloroplast f lh o the rate of change in q

model parameters describing chlorophyll synthesis are listed in tables 1 3 2 3 4 control parameters the number of parameters considered for optimisation may affect the overall estimation of optimal parameter values denman 2003 friedrichs et al 2007 therefore we have reduced the number of model parameters to a meaningful minimum we have selected a total of 7 model parameters of the obm and 8 of the cn recom for the parameter optimisations 6 of which are common for both models pon 0 f det f zoo q min α and γ krishna and schartau 2017 have shown that collinearities exist between estimates of initial conditions and ecological model parameters in particular algal growth parameters and it is not possible to determine either of them independently hence we have decided to include initial conditions as parameters pon 0 f det and f zoo along with the growth parameters in our optimisations the definition of the parameter α slightly differs between obm and cn recom but in both models this parameter is crucial for determining carbon c uptake the units mol c g chl a 1m2 w 1 d 1 of α are same in obm and cn recom the subsistence cell quota q min turns out to be a critical physiological parameter in estimating c biomass krishna and schartau 2017 we assume identical exudation rates for organic c and n exudation and leakage γ for the photoautotrophs in both models the parameter γ drives tepc production and hence is an important determinant of poc peece i has a short post bloom period hence parameters like maximum grazing rate and aggregation rate are poorly constrained by the available data krishna and schartau 2017 schartau et al 2017 studies on skill assessment of models e g friedrichs et al 2006 2007 ward et al 2010 show that poorly constrained parameters can strongly affect model performance therefore we decided to adopt the same values for grazing and aggregation rate parameters as used in krishna and schartau 2017 2 3 5 initial conditions all mesocosms were enriched with similar concentrations of din dissolved inorganic nitrogen at the beginning of the experiment 15 mmol m 3 accordingly we assign 15 mmol m 3 as initial concentration of din for simulations of all nine mesocosms in obm and cn recom the initial conditions of some state variables are set by initial condition parameters total initial biomass is given by the parameter pon 0 the initial pon is distributed between living and non living detritus biomass the parameter f det determines the fraction of pon 0 that is attributed to initial detritus the remaining fraction 1 f det accounts for living biomass which is distributed between initial photoautotroph and zooplankton biomass this relative distribution is determined by the initial zooplankton fraction parameter f zoo with the remaining fraction 1 f zoo assigned to the initial biomass of photoautotrophs 15 pon 0 detn 0 zoon 0 phyn 0 with the individual fractions 16 detn 0 f det pon 0 17 zoon 0 f zoo pon 0 detn 0 18 phyn 0 1 f zoo pon 0 detn 0 we compute initial c biomass of zooplankton and photoautotrophs from their respective n biomasses by applying a c n ratio of 6 625 106 16 for the c biomass of detritus we assume a higher c n ratio 2 6 625 because mesocosms were filled with late post bloom nutrient depleted waters and hence all dead particulate organic matter should have a c n ratio that is typical for such post bloom conditions krishna and schartau 2017 initial dic ta tepc and dccho are taken from the data of the mesocosms whereas for labile dissolved organic matter we assume a c n ratio of 10 and low initial concentrations don 0 005 mmoln m 3 and doc 0 05 mmolc m 3 2 4 data assimilation according to the experimental design of our data assimilation approach we intentionally do not consider any direct effects of co2 concentration on nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth dynamics in both models obm and cn recom this is done because we aim at identifying differences between optimised parameter values and want to ascertain to what extend the obtained parameter estimates correlate with differences between the co2 treatment cases described in section 2 1 fut pre fut gla and pre gla each of the three data sets include measurements from six individual mesocosms table 4 we impose similar statistical assumptions for all three cases which leads to a single definition of a cost function that evaluates the discrepancy between mean model results and mean observations the major advantage of combining six mesocosms is that mean values can be derived for nearly all dates of sampling correlations and standard errors can then be reliably inferred from the observational data in the end we performed three separate optimisations of the obm and of the cn recom parameter values were optimised for each co2 treatment case separately thereby calibrating the models for the corresponding six mesocosms for all dates of sampling mean model results of the six mesocosms are used for the computation of a cost function that will be defined in the following 2 4 1 data model misfit function cost function the cost function applied in our study has been derived from probabilistic considerations as the underlying error model we employ a likelihood represented by a multivariate gaussian probability density function for describing the uncertainties standard errors and correlations of observational mean values see e g schartau et al 2017 the observations vector y contains five mean values with the components representing different types of measurements 1 dissolved inorganic carbon dic mmol m 3 2 dissolved inorganic nitrogen din nitrate nitrite mmol m 3 3 chlorophyll a chl a mg m 3 4 particulate organic nitrogen pon mmol m 3 and 5 particulate organic carbon poc mmol m 3 the vector h x consists of mean simulation results that act as the model s counterparts to the five different observational types simulation results of pon and poc concentrations are calculated from the model s state variables x combining the total biogenic mass of living organisms and of the non living detritus accordingly simulated pon ponmod is the sum of n concentrations of

mod pon i mod poc i mod model the definition of our cost function is based on a likelihood which is in our case the conditional probability of explaining the observational data given the model and its parameter values p y θ we impose a gaussian probability density function as a likelihood while considering variances squared standard errors and covariances r i of the observational means y i at dates i the standard errors represent uncertainties of the observational means thereby accounting for the number of available measurements since r i are exclusively determined by the observational data they remain independent of the values assigned to the models parameters θ knowing this we find that the likelihood p y θ is proportional to the exponential term of the gaussian probability density function 22 p y θ exp 1 2 i 1 n t d i t r i 1 d i parameter values components of θ that yield the maximum of the likelihood correspond to those that minimise the argument of the exponent in eq 22 instead of maximising eq 22 we use the cost function j θ for minimisation which is also equivalent to minimising the negative logarithm of the likelihood 23 j θ i 1 n t y i h i x t r i 1 y i h i x 2 ln p y θ constant thus maximum likelihood ml estimates of parameter values θ ˆ are obtained once the minimum of the manifold j θ θ has been identified with the aid of a search optimisation algorithm for all three co2 treatment cases we use eq 23 but with different data vectors y i and covariances r i for the period of n t 23 days the time varying covariance matrices r i were constructed from diagonal matrices s i containing σ i as diagonal elements at time t i and correlation matrices c y based on data from six mesocosms for each case table 4 24 r i s i c y s i because correlations between observations can change from the exponential growth period to the post bloom period schartau et al 2017 krishna and schartau 2017 we employ period specific covariance matrices r i in our data assimilation approach three c y were constructed for distinct periods 1 the exponential growth phase days 1 10 2 the bloom period days 11 14 and 3 the post bloom period days 15 23 for the bloom period we assume measurements to be uncorrelated because we do not have any information about the precise timing of the changes in correlation thus for the bloom period the off diagonal elements of the covariance matrices are set to zero as an example three period dependent c y for the fut pre mesocosms are given in appendix a 7 the daily residual standard errors σ i are calculated from the available measurements on each day for each case the estimation of residual standard errors for dic is not as straightforward as for the other variables krishna and schartau 2017 owing to the different initial dic concentrations of the three co2 treatments therefore we first compute the differences offsets between the mean initial dic concentrations for fut and gla compared to the pre treatment and subtract these offsets in dic from the fut and gla measurements thus the initial mean dic values become identical for all three treatments but the drawdown and variability with respect to the means of the dic observations between the treatments could then be retained 2 4 2 parameter optimisation and uncertainty estimation we apply functions from the r package fme soetaert and petzoldt 2010 for parameter optimisation and for the specification of uncertainties of respective parameter estimates for all three cases fut pre fut gla pre gla in a first step we adjust the parameter values to provide a model solution reference solution that gives a first good agreement with observations of the fut gla case thereafter we apply a simulated annealing algorithm sann see bélisle 1992 performing a stochastic search in parameter space in order to find the global minima of j θ in a subsequent third step the results of the sann algorithm are further refined by using the broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno bfgs algorithm broyden 1970 fletcher 1970 goldfarb 1970 shanno 1970 a gradient based search algorithm that gives best local parameter estimates θ ˆ the fourth step is to approximate the hessian matrix h point wise at θ ˆ by using the hessian function available in the numderiv package in r the covariance matrices of the parameter estimates u θ ˆ are then computed based on in the inverse of the hessian h 1 25 u θ ˆ 2 h 1 marginal errors u l around θ ˆ are derived from u θ ˆ as described in marsili libelli et al 2003 and schartau et al 2017 26 u l t df 1 α 2 u θ ll where t df 1 α 2 is the two tailed student s t distribution for a given number of degrees of freedom df and the quantile of the parametric probability density α see marsili libelli et al 2003 the final step of the optimisation procedure is the application of a markov chain monte carlo mcmc method harmon and challenor 1997 the mcmc method employed in this study is based on the metropolis hastings mh algorithm metropolis et al 1953 hastings 1970 with our approach we provide the point estimate θ ˆ and the corresponding uncertainty information to the mh algorithm the benefit is an improved performance of the mh algorithm in generating meaningful ensembles of model solutions application of the mcmc method serves three main purposes 1 estimating the credible range uncertainties of optimised parameter values 2 deriving collinearities correlations between the optimised parameter estimates and 3 providing refined optimised model solutions both plankton ecosystem models are coded and compiled as a shared library in fortran so that we can apply a fortran r wrapper function the wrapper allows us to take advantage of fast numerical euler forward integration of the model equations in fortran and at the same time we can benefit from the open source functions provided by the r platform 3 results 3 1 optimised parameter estimates and associated uncertainties the obm and cn recom parameters were optimised separately for the three co2 treatment cases fut gla fut pre and pre gla with our data assimilation approach we obtained parameter estimates that yield best model fits to data as well as uncertainty ranges of parameter values that correspond to an ensemble of model solutions for each co2 case table 5 shows the optimised parameter estimates and their associated uncertainties for both models our parameter estimates and their respective uncertainty ranges clearly differ between the models the optimised initial concentrations of pon pon 0 zooplankton zoon0 and detritus detn0 are similar between the co2 treatment cases for the obm but vary considerably for the cn recom fig 2 in addition zoon0 f zoo pon 0 detn0 and detn0 f det pon 0 estimates seem to be underestimated for cn recom for medium present day co2 levels fig 2 and table 5 low grazing pressure in the fut gla mesocosms promotes faster algal biomass build up which is corroborated by the strong negative correlation between the parameters α and f zoo for the cn recom table a 3 we expected to identify systematic differences in parameter estimates primarily growth parameters between the three co2 cases for both models which should point towards co2 effects on algal growth dynamics not explicitly resolved by the two models a distinct systematic pattern is only detectable for the estimates of q min and v 0 c of the obm the estimates of q min and v 0 c are highest for the high co2 treatment case and lowest for low co2 fig 3 the optimised estimates of v 0 c and q min for the fut pre mesocosms are 18 and 38 higher than those for the pre gla case the change in maximum potential photosynthesis rate as predicted for the obm from high co2 to low co2 mesocosms is comparable to estimates observed in in situ experiments for example modest increases in productivity rate about 10 of phytoplankton natural assemblages in response to elevated pco2 were observed in experiments of hein and sand jensen 1997 and tortell et al 2002 likewise photosynthesis rates of photoautotrophs were 25 higher in mesocosms treated with 700 ppm of co2 than in those treated with 350 ppm of co2 riebesell et al 2007 by contrast a similar relationship is not observed for the cn recom for the cn recom parameters α and q min seem to be poorly constrained by the data which is evident from the large uncertainties in the estimates of α and from rather unrealistically low values of q min for photoautotrophs fig 3 the estimates of q min are as low as 0 01 for the cn recom which is even below the extremely low minimum n c ratios found in species with high fat content e g nannochloropsis oculata flynn et al 1993 hoffmann et al 2010 estimates of α appear too high for the cn recom in all three cases fig 3 apparently cn recom minimises our cost function by overestimating α and underestimating q min on the contrary estimates of α and q min are well constrained for the obm by the data in all three cases fig 3 and the optimised values are well within ranges of previous calibrations for laboratory and field data pahlow et al 2013 fernández castro et al 2016 3 2 data model intercomparison the mcmc method can provide credible parameter values for model solutions that are statistically indistinguishable for each co2 perturbation case we obtained an ensemble of model solutions although the spread of ensemble solutions is similar between the two models we find the differences between cost function minima to be larger for cn recom than for the obm in general the obm appears to perform better than the cn recom in reproducing the data figs 4 and 5 which is substantiated by the overall lower cost function values obtained for the solutions of the obm compared to those of the cn recom table 6 both models reproduce dic pon and poc observations well in all three treatments figs 4 and 5 simulated post bloom poc concentrations tend to be lower for cn recom than for the obm the obm performs better with respect to the transformation of dic into organic carbon maintaining high photosynthetic rates in cn recom requires high values of the photosynthetic efficiency α 5 67 7 72 mol c g chla 1 m2 w 1 d 1 whereas optimal estimates of the maximum potential photosynthesis rate v 0 c are only slightly but significantly lower than those for the obm fig 3 a difficulty for both models is to resolve the differences between the decay of pon and poc concentrations during the post bloom period the introduction of gel formation to both models was expected to explain elevated post bloom poc concentrations while pon concentrations show a clear decline already after din has become depleted however since the obm yields higher c uptake rates than cn recom it shows an overall better fit to the observed pon and poc concentrations in addition lower estimates of the exudation leakage rate γ for cn recom fig 3 reduce the source for tepc production hence leading to lower poc concentrations the optimal parameter values for γ of the obm induce higher exudation of gel like carbohydrates thereby enhancing the formation of tepc the obm reproduces poc observations particularly well for the fut gla case the ensemble solutions of obm and cn recom show a systematic offset delay in the drawdown of din which is most pronounced between days 9 and 13 figs 4 and 5 this bias persists in all three co2 cases despite the differences in parameter estimates apparently our parameter estimates compensate for a noticeable phase lag temporal offset between the increase in pon and the drawdown of din during the exponential growth period thus a better model fit to pon data introduces a larger misfit in din with our data assimilation approach all model solutions show a trade off between the representations of pon and din which contributes substantially to the overall data model misfit furthermore in our cost function we impose a negative correlation between din and pon during the exponential growth period which particularly penalises situations where the models overestimate both din and pon this situation is most likely to occur during the first 7 to 9 days in our model simulations both models reveal a tendency to underestimate the observed chla concentrations in particular during the period shortly before the maxima of the blooms are reached a common feature in cn recom and obm is the unresolved initial albeit small peak in observed chla during the first 4 days during this initial phase of the peece i experiment some picoplankton was observed engel et al 2005 that grew shortly after the mesocosms had been filled but was eventually outcompeted by larger phytoplankton the models resolve only a single composite pool of phytoplankton and changes in phytoplankton community structure are not explicitly accounted for with this structural simplification both models are unable to resolve the initial peak during the beginning of the experiment krishna and schartau 2017 the best model representations of measured chla are found for the fut pre case although these do not yield the lowest cost function values which are instead associated with model solutions for the pre gla low co2 case where both models exhibit lower than observed chla concentrations during the bloom for the fut gla mesocosms the obm shows a pronounced discrepancy between the optimal solutions and the chla data this underestimation of chla concentration can be explained by a reduced rate of chla synthesis in combination with a fairly high exudation rate for phytoplankton in spite of identical conditions with respect to the irradiance in all mesocosm simulations we obtained high estimates of α in the fut gla case when high values are assigned to α it is possible to increase carbon fixation rates although chla concentrations may remain underestimated by the obm elevated values of α are typically found for low light adapted phytoplankton that also maintain a high chl c ratio falkowski 1980 in the fut gla case the minimum of the cost function is associated with a nearly perfect fit to the poc data that apparently compensates for a deficiency underestimation in chla this adverse trade off in our cost function can be expressed as the percentage model bias allen et al 2007 that turns out to be highest for chla 62 and lowest for poc 0 4 according to our best obm fit to the fut gla data 3 3 cellular ratios fig 6 shows photosynthetic rates as a function of cellular chl c ratios notably the optimal solutions of obm typically yield higher carbon fixation rates than the cn recom at similar chl c ratios during the growth period but chl c ratios become lower in the obm during the post bloom period the cn recom tends to generate solutions with chl c ratios 0 85 during the first days of the experiment which remain below those of the obm solutions it seems that the gross carbon fixation rates are high enough in the obm to explain the exponential increase in poc without any enhanced allocation of resources towards the light harvesting complex chla synthesis while cn recom requires more chla to come up with similar rates of c uptake mainly during the early phase of the experiment for the cn recom to obtain comparable gross carbon fixation rates it is necessary to have the cellular n c ratio q n converge towards q max n while the chl n ratio θ n is approaching θ max n armstrong 2006 pointed out a similar problem for the model of geider et al 1998 upon which cn recom is largely built 3 4 cross validation of optimised model solutions the cost function defined in eq 23 is a useful metric for quantifying the model data misfit and thus for model calibration however a comparison of the cost function minima does not necessarily indicate how robust the obtained model solutions are unless these solutions are also validated against data that were not used during parameter optimisation we therefore cross validate the optimised solutions from the respective co2 ensemble solutions against independent data of those mesocosms that were not considered in respective parameter optimisations but of the same experiment the model solutions optimised with data of the fut pre case are cross validated against data from the gla glacial mesocosms the solutions for pre gla case are compared with data of the fut future mesocosms and the optimised fut gla solutions are evaluated against the pre present mesocosms fig 7 shows the cost function of the optimised solutions for the three co2 treatment cases together with the corresponding misfits for the unassimilated data in general the obm generates lower misfits than the cn recom both for assimilated and unassimilated data as expected most of the cost function values are higher for the unassimilated than for the assimilated data except the cn recom solution optimised for fut gla likewise the obm results show the smallest increase in cost function value when optimised for fut gla and cross validated with pre data fig 7 thus the mean values derived from the high and low co2 mesocosms appear indeed representative for the mean values of the mesocosms with present day co2 conditions the stronger increase in model data discrepancy when cross validating with data outside the range of the assimilated data indicates that a co2 dependency is potentially missing in both models in addition to the already identified systematic differences in some parameter estimates 4 discussion a novel data assimilation approach is applied in this study to evaluate the performance of two plankton models cn recom and obm we combine data from mesocosms that were exposed to different co2 concentrations and use these for model calibration by parameter optimisation ideally we expect to find 1 similar optimised parameter values for both models in the respective co2 treatment cases and 2 systematic differences correlations between the three co2 cases and the corresponding parameter estimates however our results do not reflect a fully coherent picture in this respect although most of the parameters that we focus on have identical meanings in both models their estimates turn out to be rather model specific the definition of the cost function based on the negative logarithm of a likelihood is helpful for determining uncertainties in parameter estimates despite large uncertainties in the estimation of the initial condition parameters the parameters that determine the physiological changes of the phytoplankton are generally better constrained for the obm than for the cn recom in all three co2 treatment cases this can hardly be inferred from visual inspection of model solutions with optimised parameters based on the results of our data assimilation we identify systematic differences between estimates of a few parameters of the obm that correlate with co2 conditions which is not seen in estimates for the cn recom apparently the obm is better suited for shedding light on physiological interdependencies that involve co2 effects on critical physiological parameters 4 1 potential co2 effects on phytoplankton growth dynamics reports of effects of elevated co2 on marine phytoplankton have been ambiguous with observations of elevated rates of carbon fixation and growth riebesell et al 2007 hare et al 2007 engel et al 2013 as well as negative effects of increased co2 concentrations sciandra et al 2003 langer et al 2006 it appears unlikely that a relation between co2 concentration and poc build up can be inferred directly from changes in poc concentrations alone the main difficulty is that the temporal accumulation of poc in the mesocosms can be highly variable in particular under nutrient depleted conditions towards the end of the experiments the formation of gel like tepc and the concurrent coagulation and sinking of larger particles are considered one of the reasons for this variability e g engel et al 2014 estimates of potential carbon fixation rates v 0 c between co2 cases follow a consistent pattern for the obm i e v 0 c is highest for fut pre intermediate for fut gla and lowest for pre gla these parameter estimates suggest an enhancement of c fixation with elevated co2 concentration which corroborates findings of previous studies concerning impacts of ocean acidification oa on marine phytoplankton e g burkhardt et al 1999 riebesell et al 2007 gao et al 2012 burkhardt et al 1999 and gervais and riebesell 2001 have observed increased carbon fixation in a diatom in response to elevated co2 levels shi et al 2009 and barcelose ramos et al 2010 have found stimulating effects of oa on coccolithophores riebesell et al 2007 noted that primary production increased by 40 in mesocosms treated with high co2 a major source of energy expenditure in phytoplankton is the active transport of inorganic carbon across the membranes through the co2 concentrating mechanisms ccms hopkinson et al 2011 under elevated co2 conditions many species can effectively down regulate their ccm and use the energy saved for carbon fixation and growth raven and johnston 1991 gao et al 2012 for both models the optimal estimates of q min for fut pre high co2 are significantly higher than for pre gla low co2 fig 3 a possible physiological interpretation is that the phytoplankton in the high co2 mesocosms experienced environmental stress and hence had to invest more resources and energy for cellular maintenance the allocation of n and c for maintenance includes the synthesis of additional enzymes as well as structural compounds e g for cell walls in consequence less resources are available to support cell division higher n demand and enhanced n uptake rates of phytoplankton exposed to elevated co2 levels were reported by bowes 1993 and beardall et al 2009 the high maintenance cost apparently counteracts the effect of enhanced c fixation to promote algal growth in the high co2 mesocosms however this interpretation is in line with the finding that diatoms exposed to high co2 conditions show enhanced growth rates but also increased maintenance costs of ph homeostasis gao et al 2012 schlüter et al 2016 stressed that energetic costs of maintenance in phytoplankton are expected to rise in response to oa similarly the total energetic cost of calcification including maintenance costs for coccolithophores may increase with decreasing ph monteiro et al 2016 the obm simulates high gross c fixation rates for the fut pre mesocosms but the corresponding poc pon ratios are lower than those of the low co2 mesocosms fig 8 thus too large a fraction of organic c is either respired or enters the pool of labile doc this model behaviour discloses problems in defining and interpreting a correct model counterpart to the observed poc concentrations according to our modelling approach we distinguish between two fractions of doc that originate from phytoplankton the dissolved combined carbohydrates dccho and other labile doc the dccho can coagulate and eventually contribute to the formation of larger tepc mari and burd 1998 engel et al 2004a schartau et al 2007 as a model counterpart to the measured poc we assume that both are largely retained on the filters used for measuring poc some residual fraction of labile doc ldoc is not retained on the filters because it does not contain surface active compounds and is therefore not subject to coagulation the imposed fractionation between ldoc and dccho a 6 is identical in both models and has not been optimised whether this fractionation is affected by oa is unclear but the amount of tep formation may be sensitive to ambient co2 concentrations with more tepc being formed under high co2 engel 2002 riebesell et al 2007 to further unravel and constrain details of poc production and doc exudation it might be of advantage to introduce measurements of net community production into the cost function e g schartau et al 2007 or to include measurements of total doc dccho and tepc concentrations explicitly furthermore we believe that simulated rates of algal exudation and variations in poc pon can be improved by implementing growth limitation by phosphorus into the model according to the chain model of pahlow et al 2013 phosphorus limitation may first affect and reduce n uptake followed by a gradual reduction of c fixation as n availability becomes limiting such a chain of limitations in the obm could also alter the relative proportions of ldoc and dccho in exudates 4 2 model uncertainties plastic versus rigid model behaviours with our successive data assimilation approach we identified parameter values that yield individual best model representations of the data apart from these best model fits the ensembles shown in figs 4 and 5 represent the range of model solutions that correspond with the posterior uncertainties in optimal parameter estimates therefore the ensemble spread explains only a narrow range of the total variability seen in the data in our cost function we assimilate mean observational values of five different measurement types the imposed error model considers only uncertainties of these mean values and respective correlations between the observational types thus the design of our data assimilation method does not account for structural model errors treating these two models as if they were perfect the cross validation experiment allows us to specify model error information explicitly which can be helpful for subsequent studies if these models will be applied for simulations of other mesocosm experiments the remaining residuals data model mismatch of the best model solutions reflect structural model errors that differ between observational types and between the phytoplankton growth periods table 7 two major structural model deficiencies are evident for both model versions i the drawdown speed of din during the exponential growth phase and ii the maxima in chlorophyll a concentration during the bloom period for both model versions it is impossible to resolve the observed lag in phase between the build up of pon and the din drawdown since chlorophyll synthesis depends on din utilisation in both model formulations the two prevailing errors seem connected and they are not explicable by the range of uncertainty in our parameter estimates in general we found larger uncertainty ranges in parameter estimates for cn recom than for obm although both models yield ensembles of solutions that seem to fit the data similarly well differences with respect to the goodness of fit could only be determined by differences in cost function values with the obm achieving lower values than cn recom the large uncertainty ranges of parameter estimates in cn recom reflect a high degree of plasticity or flexibility in the combinations of parameter values that can generate good representations of the observational data however this plasticity is associated with some reduced skill in describing data other than those used for parameter optimisation as shown by the cross validation results modelling problems of similar kind are well known e g ward et al 2010 schartau et al 2017 for example friedrichs et al 2007 stressed that models with more parameters with high uncertainty may have lower skills in fitting observations under different environmental conditions the obm and cn recom differ only with respect to their formulations of phytoplankton growth with major differences in nutrient uptake dynamics synthesis of chla and respiration for cn recom we adopted equations from the model of geider et al 1998 structural deficiencies in the corresponding descriptions of phytoplankton acclimation dynamics have been noted before for example flynn et al 2001 calibrated four phytoplankton models with culture data from anning et al 2000 and found significant shortcomings in the parameterization of n assimilation armstrong 2006 pointed out that the model of geider et al 1998 does not fully reproduce the data of laws and bannister 1980 and hence generates deficient solutions of the chl c and n c ratios q n smith and yamanaka 2007 demonstrated that the limitation of the formulation proposed by geider et al 1998 is mainly expressed during exponential growth under nutrient repletion with a too low q n in combination with an apparently too high chl n ratio θ n the latter actually needs to be restricted by the value assigned to the maximum chl n ratio θ max n in contrast a parameter like θ max n is not needed in the obm formulation it is likely for these reasons that our estimates of α and q min for cn recom fall outside of their typical ranges compared to previous modelling studies with the cn recom we obtained higher estimates of α than for the obm in all three co2 cases such high values of α should ideally yield low chl c ratios and high primary production rates lewis and smith 1983 which is not consistent with our results with low carbon fixation rates and high chl c ratios for cn recom this apparently incoherent behaviour between the cn recom and the obm may be due to the different parameterisations of respiration the respiration of photoautotrophs is mainly determined by rates of n assimilation in cn recom whereas it also depends on the rate of chla synthesis in the obm pahlow and oschlies 2013 our optimised values of α and q min for the obm compare well with estimates obtained in previous studies in this regard the obm displays a more robust behaviour and appears to be rather rigid compared to cn recom as its formulation of optimal resource allocation appears to impose stronger constraints on possible combinations of parameter values during calibration 5 conclusion we apply a cost function that accounts for correlations between measurement types to calibrate the obm and the cn recom our results show that optimal estimates of physiological parameters vary significantly between the co2 cases both for the obm and the cn recom this illustrates the difficulty in finding robust optimised parameter values parameters are better constrained for the obm as we obtain lower parameter uncertainties for it compared to the cn recom for all three treatments besides large uncertainties some of the cn recom parameter estimates also seem spurious a systematic pattern in estimates of the phytoplankton maximum rate parameter v c 0 and subsistence quota q min for the obm is revealed the highest estimates of v c 0 and qmin are obtained for the mesocosms that were treated with high co2 concentrations and lowest for those with low co2 levels as an explicit co2 dependency of plankton growth is not considered by the models these differences in estimates of parameters for the obm between treatments may be attributable to potential co2 effects hence we suggest that according to the obm ocean acidification might stimulate carbon fixation rates in phytoplankton but at the cost of increased metabolic stress which could be one possible physiological interpretation of the high qmin estimates our results are supported by findings of other co2 perturbation studies but a more informed conclusion may only be inferred from explicitly describing co2 effects on nutrient uptake and algal growth in phytoplankton growth models in contrast to the obm we do not see any clear relation between parameter estimates and co2 concentration for the cn recom the cn recom is more flexible in generating possible model solutions to explain the assimilated observational data although requiring unrealistic parameter combinations in some cases this flexibility introduces a weaker performance during cross validation if compared with the performance of the obm the parameter estimates of the obm are constrained well within the ranges estimated in previous studies we conclude that the dynamics of the obm is inherently constrained by the physiological trade offs imposed which make the obm more rigid acknowledgement the modelling framework for mesocosm simulations and data assimilation was developed for the large integrated project surface ocean processes in the anthropocene

identical model compartments a 1 zooplankton for both models grazing by the single zooplankton compartment follows a holling type iii function morozov 2010 zooplankton homeostasis in c and n stoichiometry is approximately maintained by restoring to a constant n c ratio q zoo const of 0 19 with a restoring time scale τ of 24 h we assume that respiration and excretion by zooplankton form the means for restoring towards q zoo const buildup and decline of zooplankton biomass depend on prey concentration grazing and losses due to mortality respiration and excretion in contrast to joassin et al 2011 obm and cn recom do not explicitly resolve viral or bacterial biomass in both models the microbial activity is implicitly considered part of remineralisation and hydrolysis thus the rates

24982,marine phytoplankton can regulate their stoichiometric composition in response to variations in the availability of nutrients light and the ph of seawater varying elemental composition of photoautotrophs affects several important ecological and biogeochemical processes e g primary and export production nutrient cycling calcification and grazing here we compare two plankton ecosystem models that consider regulatory mechanisms of cellular carbon and nitrogen driving the physiological acclimation of photoautotrophs the carbon nitrogen regulated ecosystem model cn recom and the optimality based model obm differ in their representation of phytoplankton dynamics i e nutrient acquisition synthesis of chlorophyll a and growth all other model compartments zooplankton detritus dissolved inorganic and organic matter and processes grazing aggregation remineralisation remain identical in both models we assess the skills of the two models against data from an ocean acidification mesocosm experiment with three co2 treatments neither model accounts for any carbon dioxide co2 effects explicitly instead we assimilate data of the different co2 treatments separately into the models thereby we aim at identifying optimal model parameter values that might correlate with differences in co2 conditions for the obm optimal parameter estimates of qmin subsistence n c ratio and v c 0 maximum potential photosynthesis rate of photoautotrophs turned out to be higher for mesocosms exposed to high co2 compared to those with low co2 concentrations by contrast a similar correlation is not observed for the cn recom a possible physiological interpretation of higher estimates of qmin and v c 0 according to the obm is that phytoplankton may experience environmental stress under more acidic conditions and hence must invest more energy resources for maintaining basic cellular functions our data assimilation reveals that the parameters of the obm are better constrained by the data than those of the cn recom furthermore the obm is better able than cn recom to reproduce data that were not used for parameter optimization keywords models acclimation mesocosms ocean acidification photoacclimation optimality based 1 introduction several studies have shown significant deviations in cellular carbon to nitrogen c n and nitrogen to phosphorus n p

furthermore it has been well documented that phytoplankton acclimate to changes in their environment by varying their elemental composition of c n and p goldman et al 1979 healey 1985 rhee et al 1981 burkhardt and riebesell 1997 burkhardt et al 1999 these changes in cellular stoichiometry affect primary production nutrient cycling calcification and growth sterner 1990 urabe and sterner 1996 cebrian and lartigue 2004 orr et al 2005 and also food web dynamics across several trophic levels the chlorophyll a chla c and chla n ratios within photoautotrophic cells also vary because of complex interactions among light nutrients and temperature armstrong 2006 behrenfeld et al 2002 during the last two decades many marine biogeochemical models have been applied to study the response of primary and export production to changes in the physical environment of aquatic ecosystems over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales behrenfeld et al 2006 boyd and doney 2002 quere et al 2005 harley et al 2006 smith et al 2009 ayata et al 2013 these models cover a wide range of complexity ranging from simple nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton detritus npzd type models to ecosystem models with more than 20 compartments friedrichs et al 2007 increasing model complexity can improve realism but constraining large numbers of parameters is a major challenge especially when observations are sparse e g matear 1995 denman 2003 apart from the number of compartments resolved the performance of a plankton ecosystem model depends on how phytoplankton growth is mathematically described phytoplankton growth is often represented by a monod model of inorganic nitrogen concentration monod 1949 assuming constant c n ratios e g dugdale 1967 hurtt and armstrong 1999 fennel et al 2001 klausmeier et al

photoacclimation i e assuming constant chl c conflict with observations of nitrogen limited marine diatoms flynn et al 2001 accordingly including variable chl c and c n ratios improves the ability of

composition c n chlorophyll in response to ambient conditions pahlow 2005 and armstrong 2006 proposed optimality based regulations of chl c and n c ratios this approach was later extended toward p by the chain model of pahlow et al 2013 which is based on the ecological stoichiometry concept of sterner and elser 2002 and assumes that the limitation by n and p is biochemically dependent according to the scheme of saito et al 2008 in contrast flynn 2001 2008 assumed growth limitation by n and p to be independent quantifying model performance model assessment is a challenge evans 2003 friedrichs et al 2007 and is complicated by two aspects 1 data availability and 2 identification of the best parameter settings to explain these data model calibration in situ mesocosm perturbation studies provide an effective tool to study the impact of anthropogenic forcing on marine ecosystems vallino 2000 riebesell et al 2008 schartau et al 2017 whereby environmental conditions can be manipulated to investigate marine ecosystem responses sommer et al 2007 kim et al 2006 a series of three pelagic ecosystem co2 enrichment experiments peece i iii have been conducted between 2001 and 2005 to investigate effects of ocean acidification on marine plankton dynamics riebesell et al 2008 modelling studies have focussed on the peece i experiment described in delille et al 2005 and engel et al 2005 joassin et al 2011 applied a mechanistic model that resolves c n p fluxes of the peece i experiment with an explicit representation of calcification by e huxleyi and of microbial bacteria and viruses dynamics they found that the variability in the cellular c n ratio of e huxleyi drives the dynamics of most of the processes including calcification and the excretion of dissolved organic carbon doc in the mesocosms and attributed variations in calcification to differences in viral attack and lysis of e huxleyi recently using an optimality based model krishna and schartau 2017 showed that most of the variability in calcification between the mesocosms during the peece i experiment can be explained by small variations in the initial abundance and physiological state of coccolithophores rather than by acidification effects and viral lysis in this study we resort to the experimental data of peece i but with the objective of comparing the performance of two carbon nitrogen regulatory modelling approaches based on geider et al 1998 and optimality based that differ in their representation of the physiology of the phytoplankton in contrast to the studies of joassin et al 2011 and krishna and schartau 2017 we do not account for calcification and neither of the models explicitly resolves the effect of co2 on plankton growth or physiology the data assimilation method was designed to ascertain whether the growth dynamics described by the two models yield optimal parameter estimates that correlate with the co2 concentrations of the mesocosms a potential but unknown and unresolved co2 effect may then be reflected in systematic differences in parameter estimates when assimilating data of the respective mesocosms exposed to different levels of co2 2 methods in the following we will first provide background information about the experimental data and explain how the data were sorted and combined for our data assimilation procedure we will describe the common features and then highlight the differences between the two models cn recom and obm the definition of the cost function that evaluates discrepancies between the observational data and model results will be presented we will outline the five steps applied for the estimation of optimal parameter values minimisation of the cost function which includes a description of how uncertainty ranges and collinearities of the parameter estimates were derived 2 1 data a series of three experiments was conducted in the large scale mesocosm facilities at the marine field station of university of bergen raunefjorden between 2001 and 2005 to investigate effects of ocean acidification oa on plankton community dynamics peece riebesell and tortell 2011 peece i is the first of this series where nine mesocosms were treated with three different levels of initial partial pressure of co2 with three replicates each engel et al 2005 delille et al 2005 1 the fut treatment subject to high dissolved inorganic carbon dic levels 2119 2122 mmol m 3 or pco2 710 ppmv 2 the pre treatment with dic concentrations of 2040 2056 mmol m 3 and pco2 410 ppmv resembling present day conditions and 3 the gla treatment with dic between 1919 1929 mmol m 3 pco2 180 ppmv for our model simulations we consider the air above the mesocosms surface to be a mixture of 90 air with the target pco2 and 10 of air with ambient atmospheric pco2 krishna and schartau 2017 for model calibration and assessment we define three cases each comprising a combination of two out of the three co2 treatments 1 fut pre 2 fut gla and 3 pre gla this way we can better account for the variability within and between the mesocosms thereby reducing possible artificial biases towards one particular co2 treatment in our estimates daily measurements of salinity and temperature are available for the entire period 23 days of the peece i experiment which we interpolated to hourly values that are then used as boundary conditions we also include hourly photosynthetically active radiation par data from meteorological global irradiance measurements of the geophysical institute of the university of bergen norway skartveit et al 2001 we assume the mesocosms to be homogeneously mixed and we do not account for any vertical export of particulate organic matter in either model attenuation of light in the water column is estimated by lambert beer s law and depends on depth d the light absorption coefficients of seawater a w and chlorophyll a a c and the concentration of chlorophyll a chl all mesocosms were covered with tetrafluoroethylene films and allowed only 95 transmission for photosynthetically active radiation delille et al 2005 thus the vertically averaged irradiance i avg is calculated as 1 i avg 0 95 i κ d 1 e κ d κ a w a c chl where κ is the total light attenuation coefficient as pointed out before our candidate models do not explicitly resolve coccolithophores and calcification as done in krishna and schartau 2017 only a single phytoplankton compartment is used instead which reduces the number of parameters considerably and allows for a better comparison of the two models since calcification affects the amount of dissolved inorganic carbon dic utilized by the algae we employ corrected dic data which is the sum of observed concentrations of dic and pic particulate inorganic carbon thereby attempting to correct for the effect of calcification on dic 2 2 common structure of the candidate models we apply two carbon and nitrogen regulatory marine ecosystem models the carbon nitrogen regulated ecosystem model cn recom and the optimality based model obm the obm and the cn recom describe the regulation of c n and chl c ratios of algal cells in response to changes in external nutrient light and temperature conditions fig 1 illustrates the compartments and processes in both models effects of phosphorus are neglected and we need not simulate diazotrophy here both

phytoplankton dynamics formulations of all other model compartments zooplankton detritus ldom dccho and tep are identical for both models fig 1 2 2 1 phytoplankton algal growth is described in terms of three state variables representing carbon c nitrogen n and chlorophyll chl so that we can simulate variable stoichiometry cell quotas n c and chl c ratios dynamically the rates of change of these state variables are defined via ordinary differential equations odes below net phytoplankton c and n acquisition are obtained as the difference between assimilation and losses due to aggregation

variables and parameters are given in table 1 2 2 2 zooplankton in both models zooplankton grazing is described by a holling type iii function morozov 2010 of photoautotrophs phyn and loss in zooplankton biomass carbon and nitrogen is accounted for by mortality details on zooplankton and its odes are given in a 1 2 2 3 detritus sources of detrital c and n biomass are represented by phytoplankton aggregation and zooplankton mortality in both models chlorophyll of dead phytoplankton cells is treated as part of detritus thereby resolving the decay of chlorophyll within the detritus pool hydrolysis is regarded as the only sink of detrital carbon and nitrogen the degradation of detritus is thus assumed to be a source of dissolved organic matter dom the odes for detrital biomass n and chl can be found in a 2 2 2 4 dissolved inorganic compounds respiration by zooplankton remineralisation of labile dissolved organic carbon ldoc compounds and sugars and gas exchange with the atmosphere are sources of dissolved inorganic carbon dic the only sink of dic is carbon assimilation by photoautotrophs the sources of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din are zooplankton excretion and remineralisation of labile dissolved organic nitrogen ldon compounds nitrogen utilisation by the algal community is the primary sink of din in both models the odes for dic and din are given in appendices a 3 and a 4 2 2 5 dissolved labile organic matter ldom freshly exuded and leaked organic matter from phytoplankton hydrolysis of detritus and of carbon in transparent exopolymer particles tepc contribute to the formation of ldoc and ldon the odes are described in appendix a 6 2 2 6 dissolved combined carbohydrates dccho the dccho act as a precursors for the formation of gel like tepc this physical chemical interaction is described as a process of particle coagulation engel et al 2004b schartau et al 2007 apart from coagulation the dccho are assumed to be also subject to remineralisation thus becoming a source for dic the odes for formation of dccho and for tepc are explained in appendix a 6 2 3 differences between cn recom and obm 2 3 1 growth and respiration phytoplankton growth in the cn recom is largely based on the assumptions of geider et al 1998 asserting that maximum photosynthetic rate is achieved by an algal cell when its n cell quota n c ratio q n reaches its maximum q max n eq 5 v c is affected by the light saturated maximum photosynthesis rate v max c nutrient limitation light limitation and temperature geider et al 1998 5 v c v max c 1 exp α θ i avg v max c v max c v 0 c q n q min q max q min t f where i avg is the mean irradiance in wm 2 θ is the chlorophyll a to carbon ratio in units g chl mol c 1 and α is the photosynthetic efficiency of photoautotrophs in mol c g chla 1 m2 w 1 d 1 respiration in cn recom depends linearly on the nitrogen uptake and is subject to some basal respiration rref in units of d 1 respiration is proportional to v c n in cn recom 6 r ζ n v c n r ref in contrast to the cn recom the obm maximises phytoplankton net relative growth rate via optimal resource allocation between nutrient acquisition

variables and parameters associated with phytoplankton growth for both models are given in tables 1 3 the obm resolves explicitly respiration costs due to chlorophyll a synthesis cost of photosynthesis r chl 9 r ζ n v c n r chl r ref 2 3 2 nutrient limitation nutrient assimilation v c n in cn recom is a michaelis menten function of maximum carbon specific nitrogen uptake rate v max n and din 10 v c n v max n din din k din we apply the modified form for v max n introduced by schartau et al 2007 11 v max n v fact v 0 c t f q max 1 exp 100 q max q n where v 0 c is the maximum potential photosynthesis rate in d 1 and v fact is a factor relating the potential rate of nitrogen uptake to v 0 c t f is the temperature dependence of metabolic rates as in geider et al 1998 and qmax is the maximum cellular n c ratio in units of mol n mol c 1 the exponential term in the denominator of eq 11 avoids the singularity when v max n reaches 0 as q n approaches q max which allows cn recom to remain robust against various combinations of parameter values during parameter optimisation furthermore this small refinement makes the model also amenable to 1d and 2d modelling applications where an explicit representation of vertical mixing is required nitrogen assimilation in the obm is described by optimal uptake kinetics as proposed in pahlow et al 2013 v c n is given as a function of f v o din and t f furthermore an affinity based description of n assimilation is considered instead of eq 10 12 v c n f v o 1 t f v 0 n 1 a 0 din 2 where v 0 n is the maximum potential nitrogen uptake rate in mol n mol c 1 d 1 a 0 is the nutrient affinity in m3 mol c 1 d 1 and ζ n in mol c mol n 1 relates the cost of biosynthesis to n assimilation aksnes and egge 1991 and smith et al 2016 argued that the consideration of affinity introduces a better representation of the nutrient uptake mechanism of photoautotrophs than a half saturation constant details about the auxiliary variables and parameters related to nitrogen limitation for both models are given in tables 1 3 2 3 3 chlorophyll synthesis pigment synthesis s chl in the cn recom depends on light and on v c n synthesis of chlorophyll ceases as the chlorophyll a to nitrogen ratio of a cell θ n in g chl mol n 1 approaches its maximum θ max n which is a model parameter under high light conditions s chl is down regulated and becomes inversely proportional to the light dependent term α θ i avg 13 s chl v c n 1 2 θ max n θ n v c α θ i the description of chlorophyll synthesis in the obm is more complex as it depends on the trade off between carbon fixation and respiratory costs of photosynthesis within the chloroplast s chl depends on the optimised size of the chloroplast f lh o the rate of change in q n and on the light conditions pahlow et al 2013 14 s chl μ θ θ where the term θ θ is the optimal regulation term for chlorophyll a synthesis see pahlow et al 2013 for details auxiliary variables and model parameters describing chlorophyll synthesis are listed in tables 1 3 2 3 4 control parameters the number of parameters considered for optimisation may affect the overall estimation of optimal parameter values denman 2003 friedrichs et al 2007 therefore we have reduced the number of model parameters to a meaningful minimum we have selected a total of 7 model parameters of the obm and 8 of the cn recom for the parameter optimisations 6 of which are common for both models pon 0 f det f zoo q min α and γ krishna and schartau 2017 have shown that collinearities exist between estimates of initial conditions and ecological model parameters in particular algal growth parameters and it is not possible to determine either of them independently hence we have decided to include initial conditions as parameters pon 0 f det and f zoo along with the growth parameters in our optimisations the definition of the parameter α slightly differs between obm and cn recom but in both models this parameter is crucial for determining carbon c uptake the units mol c g chl a 1m2 w 1 d 1 of α are same in obm and cn recom the subsistence cell quota q min turns out to be a critical physiological parameter in estimating c biomass krishna and schartau 2017 we assume identical exudation rates for organic c and n exudation and leakage γ for the photoautotrophs in both models the parameter γ drives tepc production and hence is an important determinant of poc peece i has a short post bloom period hence parameters like maximum grazing rate and aggregation rate are poorly constrained by the available data krishna and schartau 2017 schartau et al 2017 studies on skill assessment of models e g friedrichs et al 2006 2007 ward et al 2010 show that poorly constrained parameters can strongly affect model performance therefore we decided to adopt the same values for grazing and aggregation rate parameters as used in krishna and schartau 2017 2 3 5 initial conditions all mesocosms were enriched with similar concentrations of din dissolved inorganic nitrogen at the beginning of the experiment 15 mmol m 3 accordingly we assign 15 mmol m 3 as initial concentration of din for simulations of all nine mesocosms in obm and cn recom the initial conditions of some state variables are set by initial condition parameters total initial biomass is given by the parameter pon 0 the initial pon is distributed between living and non living detritus biomass the parameter f det determines the fraction of pon 0 that is attributed to initial detritus the remaining fraction 1 f det accounts for living biomass which is distributed between initial photoautotroph and zooplankton biomass this relative distribution is determined by the initial zooplankton fraction parameter f zoo with the remaining fraction 1 f zoo assigned to the initial biomass of photoautotrophs 15 pon 0 detn 0 zoon 0 phyn 0 with the individual fractions 16 detn 0 f det pon 0 17 zoon 0 f zoo pon 0 detn 0 18 phyn 0 1 f zoo pon 0 detn 0 we compute initial c biomass of zooplankton and photoautotrophs from their respective n biomasses by applying a c n ratio of 6 625 106 16 for the c biomass of detritus we assume a higher c n ratio 2 6 625 because mesocosms were filled with late post bloom nutrient depleted waters and hence all dead particulate organic matter should have a c n ratio that is typical for such post bloom conditions krishna and schartau 2017 initial dic ta tepc and dccho are taken from the data of the mesocosms whereas for labile dissolved organic matter we assume a c n ratio of 10 and low initial concentrations don 0 005 mmoln m 3 and doc 0 05 mmolc m 3 2 4 data assimilation according to the experimental design of our data assimilation approach we intentionally do not consider any direct effects of co2 concentration on nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth dynamics in both models obm and cn recom this is done because we aim at identifying differences between optimised parameter values and want to ascertain to what extend the obtained parameter estimates correlate with differences between the co2 treatment cases described in section 2 1 fut pre fut gla and pre gla each of the three data sets include measurements from six individual mesocosms table 4 we impose similar statistical assumptions for all three cases which leads to a single definition of a cost function that evaluates the discrepancy between mean model results and mean observations the major advantage of combining six mesocosms is that mean values can be derived for nearly all dates of sampling correlations and standard errors can then be reliably inferred from the observational data in the end we performed three separate optimisations of the obm and of the cn recom parameter values were optimised for each co2 treatment case separately thereby calibrating the models for the corresponding six mesocosms for all dates of sampling mean model results of the six mesocosms are used for the computation of a cost function that will be defined in the following 2 4 1 data model misfit function cost function the cost function applied in our study has been derived from probabilistic considerations as the underlying error model we employ a likelihood represented by a multivariate gaussian probability density function for describing the uncertainties standard errors and correlations of observational mean values see e g schartau et al 2017 the observations vector y contains five mean values with the components representing different types of measurements 1 dissolved inorganic carbon dic mmol m 3 2 dissolved inorganic nitrogen din nitrate nitrite mmol m 3 3 chlorophyll a chl a mg m 3 4 particulate organic nitrogen pon mmol m 3 and 5 particulate organic carbon poc mmol m 3 the vector h x consists of mean simulation results that act as the model s counterparts to the five different observational types simulation results of pon and poc concentrations are calculated from the model s state variables x combining the total biogenic mass of living organisms and of the non living detritus accordingly simulated pon ponmod is the sum of n concentrations of photoautotrophs phyn zooplankton zoon and detritus detn for both models 19 pon mod phyn zoon detn modelled poc pocmod includes contributions from phytoplankton phyc zooplankton zooc detritus detc and tepc and dccho 20 poc mod phyc zooc detc tepc dccho eq 21 exemplifies the residual vector d i that reveals the differences between observations vector of mean values y i and model results vector of mean model counterparts to observations h i x with subscript i indicating days when samples were taken from the mesocosm 21 d i y i h i x dic i din i chl a i pon i poc i data dic i mod din i mod chl i mod pon i mod poc i mod model the definition of our cost function is based on a likelihood which is in our case the conditional probability of explaining the observational data given the model and its parameter values p y θ we impose a gaussian probability density function as a likelihood while considering variances squared standard errors and covariances r i of the observational means y i at dates i the standard errors represent uncertainties of the observational means thereby accounting for the number of available measurements since r i are exclusively determined by the observational data they remain independent of the values assigned to the models parameters θ knowing this we find that the likelihood p y θ is proportional to the exponential term of the gaussian probability density function 22 p y θ exp 1 2 i 1 n t d i t r i 1 d i parameter values components of θ that yield the maximum of the likelihood correspond to those that minimise the argument of the exponent in eq 22 instead of maximising eq 22 we use the cost function j θ for minimisation which is also equivalent to minimising the negative logarithm of the likelihood 23 j θ i 1 n t y i h i x t r i 1 y i h i x 2 ln p y θ constant thus maximum likelihood ml estimates of parameter values θ ˆ are obtained once the minimum of the manifold j θ θ has been identified with the aid of a search optimisation algorithm for all three co2 treatment cases we use eq 23 but with different data vectors y i and covariances r i for the period of n t 23 days the time varying covariance matrices r i were constructed from diagonal matrices s i containing σ i as diagonal elements at time t i and correlation matrices c y based on data from six mesocosms for each case table 4 24 r i s i c y s i because correlations between observations can change from the exponential growth period to the post bloom period schartau et al 2017 krishna and schartau 2017 we employ period specific covariance matrices r i in our data assimilation approach three c y were constructed for distinct periods 1 the exponential growth phase days 1 10 2 the bloom period days 11 14 and 3 the post bloom period days 15 23 for the bloom period we assume measurements to be uncorrelated because we do not have any information about the precise timing of the changes in correlation thus for the bloom period the off diagonal elements of the covariance matrices are set to zero as an example three period dependent c y for the fut pre mesocosms are given in appendix a 7 the daily residual standard errors σ i are calculated from the available measurements on each day for each case the estimation of residual standard errors for dic is not as straightforward as for the other variables krishna and schartau 2017 owing to the different initial dic concentrations of the three co2 treatments therefore we first compute the differences offsets between the mean initial dic concentrations for fut and gla compared to the pre treatment and subtract these offsets in dic from the fut and gla measurements thus the initial mean dic values become identical for all three treatments but the drawdown and variability with respect to the means of the dic observations between the treatments could then be retained 2 4 2 parameter optimisation and uncertainty estimation we apply functions from the r package fme soetaert and petzoldt 2010 for parameter optimisation and for the specification of uncertainties of respective parameter estimates for all three cases fut pre fut gla pre gla in a first step we adjust the parameter values to provide a model solution reference solution that gives a first good agreement with observations of the fut gla case thereafter we apply a simulated annealing algorithm sann see bélisle 1992 performing a stochastic search in parameter space in order to find the global minima of j θ in a subsequent third step the results of the sann algorithm are further refined by using the broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno bfgs algorithm broyden 1970 fletcher 1970 goldfarb 1970 shanno 1970 a gradient based search algorithm that gives best local parameter estimates θ ˆ the fourth step is to approximate the hessian matrix h point wise at θ ˆ by using the hessian function available in the numderiv package in r the covariance matrices of the parameter estimates u θ ˆ are then computed based on in the inverse of the hessian h 1 25 u θ ˆ 2 h 1 marginal errors u l around θ ˆ are derived from u θ ˆ as described in marsili libelli et al 2003 and schartau et al 2017 26 u l t df 1 α 2 u θ ll where t df 1 α 2 is the two tailed student s t distribution for a given number of degrees of freedom df and the quantile of the parametric probability density α see marsili libelli et al 2003 the final step of the optimisation procedure is the application of a markov chain monte carlo mcmc method harmon and challenor 1997 the mcmc method employed in this study is based on the metropolis hastings mh algorithm metropolis et al 1953 hastings 1970 with our approach we provide the point estimate θ ˆ and the corresponding uncertainty information to the mh algorithm the benefit is an improved performance of the mh algorithm in generating meaningful ensembles of model solutions application of the mcmc method serves three main purposes 1 estimating the credible range uncertainties of optimised parameter values 2 deriving collinearities correlations between the optimised parameter estimates and 3 providing refined optimised model solutions both plankton ecosystem models are coded and compiled as a shared library in fortran so that we can apply a fortran r wrapper function the wrapper allows us to take advantage of fast numerical euler forward integration of the model equations in fortran and at the same time we can benefit from the open source functions provided by the r platform 3 results 3 1 optimised parameter estimates and associated uncertainties the obm and cn recom parameters were optimised separately for the three co2 treatment cases fut gla fut pre and pre gla with our data assimilation approach we obtained parameter estimates that yield best model fits to data as well as uncertainty ranges of parameter values that correspond to an ensemble of model solutions for each co2 case table 5 shows the optimised parameter estimates and their associated uncertainties for both models our parameter estimates and their respective uncertainty ranges clearly differ between the models the optimised initial concentrations of pon pon 0 zooplankton zoon0 and detritus detn0 are similar between the co2 treatment cases for the obm but vary considerably for the cn recom fig 2 in addition zoon0 f zoo pon 0 detn0 and detn0 f det pon 0 estimates seem to be underestimated for cn recom for medium present day co2 levels fig 2 and table 5 low grazing pressure in the fut gla mesocosms promotes faster algal biomass build up which is corroborated by the strong negative correlation between the parameters α and f zoo for the cn recom table a 3 we expected to identify systematic differences in parameter estimates primarily growth parameters between the three co2 cases for both models which should point towards co2 effects on algal growth dynamics not explicitly resolved by the two models a distinct systematic pattern is only detectable for the estimates of q min and v 0 c of the obm the estimates of q min and v 0 c are highest for the high co2 treatment case and lowest for low co2 fig 3 the optimised estimates of v 0 c and q min for the fut pre mesocosms are 18 and 38 higher than those for the pre gla case the change in maximum potential photosynthesis rate as predicted for the obm from high co2 to low co2 mesocosms is comparable to estimates observed in in situ experiments for example modest increases in productivity rate about 10 of phytoplankton natural assemblages in response to elevated pco2 were observed in experiments of hein and sand jensen 1997 and tortell et al 2002 likewise photosynthesis rates of photoautotrophs were 25 higher in mesocosms treated with 700 ppm of co2 than in those treated with 350 ppm of co2 riebesell et al 2007 by contrast a similar relationship is not observed for the cn recom for the cn recom parameters α and q min seem to be poorly constrained by the data which is evident from the large uncertainties in the estimates of α and from rather unrealistically low values of q min for photoautotrophs fig 3 the estimates of q min are as low as 0 01 for the cn recom which is even below the extremely low minimum n c ratios found in species with high fat content e g nannochloropsis oculata flynn et al 1993 hoffmann et al 2010 estimates of α appear too high for the cn recom in all three cases fig 3 apparently cn recom minimises our cost function by overestimating α and underestimating q min on the contrary estimates of α and q min are well constrained for the obm by the data in all three cases fig 3 and the optimised values are well within ranges of previous calibrations for laboratory and field data pahlow et al 2013 fernández castro et al 2016 3 2 data model intercomparison the mcmc method can provide credible parameter values for model solutions that are statistically indistinguishable for each co2 perturbation case we obtained an ensemble of model solutions although the spread of ensemble solutions is similar between the two models we find the differences between cost function minima to be larger for cn recom than for the obm in general the obm appears to perform better than the cn recom in reproducing the data figs 4 and 5 which is substantiated by the overall lower cost function values obtained for the solutions of the obm compared to those of the cn recom table 6 both models reproduce dic pon and poc observations well in all three treatments figs 4 and 5 simulated post bloom poc concentrations tend to be lower for cn recom than for the obm the obm performs better with respect to the transformation of dic into organic carbon maintaining high photosynthetic rates in cn recom requires high values of the photosynthetic efficiency α 5 67 7 72 mol c g chla 1 m2 w 1 d 1 whereas optimal estimates of the maximum potential photosynthesis rate v 0 c are only slightly but significantly lower than those for the obm fig 3 a difficulty for both models is to resolve the differences between the decay of pon and poc concentrations during the post bloom period the introduction of gel formation to both models was expected to explain elevated post bloom poc concentrations while pon concentrations show a clear decline already after din has become depleted however since the obm yields higher c uptake rates than cn recom it shows an overall better fit to the observed pon and poc concentrations in addition lower estimates of the exudation leakage rate γ for cn recom fig 3 reduce the source for tepc production hence leading to lower poc concentrations the optimal parameter values for γ of the obm induce higher exudation of gel like carbohydrates thereby enhancing the formation of tepc the obm reproduces poc observations particularly well for the fut gla case the ensemble solutions of obm and cn recom show a systematic offset delay in the drawdown of din which is most pronounced between days 9 and 13 figs 4 and 5 this bias persists in all three co2 cases despite the differences in parameter estimates apparently our parameter estimates compensate for a noticeable phase lag temporal offset between the increase in pon and the drawdown of din during the exponential growth period thus a better model fit to pon data introduces a larger misfit in din with our data assimilation approach all model solutions show a trade off between the representations of pon and din which contributes substantially to the overall data model misfit furthermore in our cost function we impose a negative correlation between din and pon during the exponential growth period which particularly penalises situations where the models overestimate both din and pon this situation is most likely to occur during the first 7 to 9 days in our model simulations both models reveal a tendency to underestimate the observed chla concentrations in particular during the period shortly before the maxima of the blooms are reached a common feature in cn recom and obm is the unresolved initial albeit small peak in observed chla during the first 4 days during this initial phase of the peece i experiment some picoplankton was observed engel et al 2005 that grew shortly after the mesocosms had been filled but was eventually outcompeted by larger phytoplankton the models resolve only a single composite pool of phytoplankton and changes in phytoplankton community structure are not explicitly accounted for with this structural simplification both models are unable to resolve the initial peak during the beginning of the experiment krishna and schartau 2017 the best model representations of measured chla are found for the fut pre case although these do not yield the lowest cost function values which are instead associated with model solutions for the pre gla low co2 case where both models exhibit lower than observed chla concentrations during the bloom for the fut gla mesocosms the obm shows a pronounced discrepancy between the optimal solutions and the chla data this underestimation of chla concentration can be explained by a reduced rate of chla synthesis in combination with a fairly high exudation rate for phytoplankton in spite of identical conditions with respect to the irradiance in all mesocosm simulations we obtained high estimates of α in the fut gla case when high values are assigned to α it is possible to increase carbon fixation rates although chla concentrations may remain underestimated by the obm elevated values of α are typically found for low light adapted phytoplankton that also maintain a high chl c ratio falkowski 1980 in the fut gla case the minimum of the cost function is associated with a nearly perfect fit to the poc data that apparently compensates for a deficiency underestimation in chla this adverse trade off in our cost function can be expressed as the percentage model bias allen et al 2007 that turns out to be highest for chla 62 and lowest for poc 0 4 according to our best obm fit to the fut gla data 3 3 cellular ratios fig 6 shows photosynthetic rates as a function of cellular chl c ratios notably the optimal solutions of obm typically yield higher carbon fixation rates than the cn recom at similar chl c ratios during the growth period but chl c ratios become lower in the obm during the post bloom period the cn recom tends to generate solutions with chl c ratios 0 85 during the first days of the experiment which remain below those of the obm solutions it seems that the gross carbon fixation rates are high enough in the obm to explain the exponential increase in poc without any enhanced allocation of resources towards the light harvesting complex chla synthesis while cn recom requires more chla to come up with similar rates of c uptake mainly during the early phase of the experiment for the cn recom to obtain comparable gross carbon fixation rates it is necessary to have the cellular n c ratio q n converge towards q max n while the chl n ratio θ n is approaching θ max n armstrong 2006 pointed out a similar problem for the model of geider et al 1998 upon which cn recom is largely built 3 4 cross validation of optimised model solutions the cost function defined in eq 23 is a useful metric for quantifying the model data misfit and thus for model calibration however a comparison of the cost function minima does not necessarily indicate how robust the obtained model solutions are unless these solutions are also validated against data that were not used during parameter optimisation we therefore cross validate the optimised solutions from the respective co2 ensemble solutions against independent data of those mesocosms that were not considered in respective parameter optimisations but of the same experiment the model solutions optimised with data of the fut pre case are cross validated against data from the gla glacial mesocosms the solutions for pre gla case are compared with data of the fut future mesocosms and the optimised fut gla solutions are evaluated against the pre present mesocosms fig 7 shows the cost function of the optimised solutions for the three co2 treatment cases together with the corresponding misfits for the unassimilated data in general the obm generates lower misfits than the cn recom both for assimilated and unassimilated data as expected most of the cost function values are higher for the unassimilated than for the assimilated data except the cn recom solution optimised for fut gla likewise the obm results show the smallest increase in cost function value when optimised for fut gla and cross validated with pre data fig 7 thus the mean values derived from the high and low co2 mesocosms appear indeed representative for the mean values of the mesocosms with present day co2 conditions the stronger increase in model data discrepancy when cross validating with data outside the range of the assimilated data indicates that a co2 dependency is potentially missing in both models in addition to the already identified systematic differences in some parameter estimates 4 discussion a novel data assimilation approach is applied in this study to evaluate the performance of two plankton models cn recom and obm we combine data from mesocosms that were exposed to different co2 concentrations and use these for model calibration by parameter optimisation ideally we expect to find 1 similar optimised parameter values for both models in the respective co2 treatment cases and 2 systematic differences correlations between the three co2 cases and the corresponding parameter estimates however our results do not reflect a fully coherent picture in this respect although most of the parameters that we focus on have identical meanings in both models their estimates turn out to be rather model specific the definition of the cost function based on the negative logarithm of a likelihood is helpful for determining uncertainties in parameter estimates despite large uncertainties in the estimation of the initial condition parameters the parameters that determine the physiological changes of the phytoplankton are generally better constrained for the obm than for the cn recom in all three co2 treatment cases this can hardly be inferred from visual inspection of model solutions with optimised parameters based on the results of our data assimilation we identify systematic differences between estimates of a few parameters of the obm that correlate with co2 conditions which is not seen in estimates for the cn recom apparently the obm is better suited for shedding light on physiological interdependencies that involve co2 effects on critical physiological parameters 4 1 potential co2 effects on phytoplankton growth dynamics reports of effects of elevated co2 on marine phytoplankton have been ambiguous with observations of elevated rates of carbon fixation and growth riebesell et al 2007 hare et al 2007 engel et al 2013 as well as negative effects of increased co2 concentrations sciandra et al 2003 langer et al 2006 it appears unlikely that a relation between co2 concentration and poc build up can be inferred directly from changes in poc concentrations alone the main difficulty is that the temporal accumulation of poc in the mesocosms can be highly variable in particular under nutrient depleted conditions towards the end of the experiments the formation of gel like tepc and the concurrent coagulation and sinking of larger particles are considered one of the reasons for this variability e g engel et al 2014 estimates of potential carbon fixation rates v 0 c between co2 cases follow a consistent pattern for the obm i e v 0 c is highest for fut pre intermediate for fut gla and lowest for pre gla these parameter estimates suggest an enhancement of c fixation with elevated co2 concentration which corroborates findings of previous studies concerning impacts of ocean acidification oa on marine phytoplankton e g burkhardt et al 1999 riebesell et al 2007 gao et al 2012 burkhardt et al 1999 and gervais and riebesell 2001 have observed increased carbon fixation in a diatom in response to elevated co2 levels shi et al 2009 and barcelose ramos et al 2010 have found stimulating effects of oa on coccolithophores riebesell et al 2007 noted that primary production increased by 40 in mesocosms treated with high co2 a major source of energy expenditure in phytoplankton is the active transport of inorganic carbon across the membranes through the co2 concentrating mechanisms ccms hopkinson et al 2011 under elevated co2 conditions many species can effectively down regulate their ccm and use the energy saved for carbon fixation and growth raven and johnston 1991 gao et al 2012 for both models the optimal estimates of q min for fut pre high co2 are significantly higher than for pre gla low co2 fig 3 a possible physiological interpretation is that the phytoplankton in the high co2 mesocosms experienced environmental stress and hence had to invest more resources and energy for cellular maintenance the allocation of n and c for maintenance includes the synthesis of additional enzymes as well as structural compounds e g for cell walls in consequence less resources are available to support cell division higher n demand and enhanced n uptake rates of phytoplankton exposed to elevated co2 levels were reported by bowes 1993 and beardall et al 2009 the high maintenance cost apparently counteracts the effect of enhanced c fixation to promote algal growth in the high co2 mesocosms however this interpretation is in line with the finding that diatoms exposed to high co2 conditions show enhanced growth rates but also increased maintenance costs of ph homeostasis gao et al 2012 schlüter et al 2016 stressed that energetic costs of maintenance in phytoplankton are expected to rise in response to oa similarly the total energetic cost of calcification including maintenance costs for coccolithophores may increase with decreasing ph monteiro et al 2016 the obm simulates high gross c fixation rates for the fut pre mesocosms but the corresponding poc pon ratios are lower than those of the low co2 mesocosms fig 8 thus too large a fraction of organic c is either respired or enters the pool of labile doc this model behaviour discloses problems in defining and interpreting a correct model counterpart to the observed poc concentrations according to our modelling approach we distinguish between two fractions of doc that originate from phytoplankton the dissolved combined carbohydrates dccho and other labile doc the dccho can coagulate and eventually contribute to the formation of larger tepc mari and burd 1998 engel et al 2004a schartau et al 2007 as a model counterpart to the measured poc we assume that both are largely retained on the filters used for measuring poc some residual fraction of labile doc ldoc is not retained on the filters because it does not contain surface active compounds and is therefore not subject to coagulation the imposed fractionation between ldoc and dccho a 6 is identical in both models and has not been optimised whether this fractionation is affected by oa is unclear but the amount of tep formation may be sensitive to ambient co2 concentrations with more tepc being formed under high co2 engel 2002 riebesell et al 2007 to further unravel and constrain details of poc production and doc exudation it might be of advantage to introduce measurements of net community production into the cost function e g schartau et al 2007 or to include measurements of total doc dccho and tepc concentrations explicitly furthermore we believe that simulated rates of algal exudation and variations in poc pon can be improved by implementing growth limitation by phosphorus into the model according to the chain model of pahlow et al 2013 phosphorus limitation may first affect and reduce n uptake followed by a gradual reduction of c fixation as n availability becomes limiting such a chain of limitations in the obm could also alter the relative proportions of ldoc and dccho in exudates 4 2 model uncertainties plastic versus rigid model behaviours with our successive data assimilation approach we identified parameter values that yield individual best model representations of the data apart from these best model fits the ensembles shown in figs 4 and 5 represent the range of model solutions that correspond with the posterior uncertainties in optimal parameter estimates therefore the ensemble spread explains only a narrow range of the total variability seen in the data in our cost function we assimilate mean observational values of five different measurement types the imposed error model considers only uncertainties of these mean values and respective correlations between the observational types thus the design of our data assimilation method does not account for structural model errors treating these two models as if they were perfect the cross validation experiment allows us to specify model error information explicitly which can be helpful for subsequent studies if these models will be applied for simulations of other mesocosm experiments the remaining residuals data model mismatch of the best model solutions reflect structural model errors that differ between observational types and between the phytoplankton growth periods table 7 two major structural model deficiencies are evident for both model versions i the drawdown speed of din during the exponential growth phase and ii the maxima in chlorophyll a concentration during the bloom period for both model versions it is impossible to resolve the observed lag in phase between the build up of pon and the din drawdown since chlorophyll synthesis depends on din utilisation in both model formulations the two prevailing errors seem connected and they are not explicable by the range of uncertainty in our parameter estimates in general we found larger uncertainty ranges in parameter estimates for cn recom than for obm although both models yield ensembles of solutions that seem to fit the data similarly well differences with respect to the goodness of fit could only be determined by differences in cost function values with the obm achieving lower values than cn recom the large uncertainty ranges of parameter estimates in cn recom reflect a high degree of plasticity or flexibility in the combinations of parameter values that can generate good representations of the observational data however this plasticity is associated with some reduced skill in describing data other than those used for parameter optimisation as shown by the cross validation results modelling problems of similar kind are well known e g ward et al 2010 schartau et al 2017 for example friedrichs et al 2007 stressed that models with more parameters with high uncertainty may have lower skills in fitting observations under different environmental conditions the obm and cn recom differ only with respect to their formulations of phytoplankton growth with major differences in nutrient uptake dynamics synthesis of chla and respiration for cn recom we adopted equations from the model of geider et al 1998 structural deficiencies in the corresponding descriptions of phytoplankton acclimation dynamics have been noted before for example flynn et al 2001 calibrated four phytoplankton models with culture data from anning et al 2000 and found significant shortcomings in the parameterization of n assimilation armstrong 2006 pointed out that the model of geider et al 1998 does not fully reproduce the data of laws and bannister 1980 and hence generates deficient solutions of the chl c and n c ratios q n smith and yamanaka 2007 demonstrated that the limitation of the formulation proposed by geider et al 1998 is mainly expressed during exponential growth under nutrient repletion with a too low q n in combination with an apparently too high chl n ratio θ n the latter actually needs to be restricted by the value assigned to the maximum chl n ratio θ max n in contrast a parameter like θ max n is not needed in the obm formulation it is likely for these reasons that our estimates of α and q min for cn recom fall outside of their typical ranges compared to previous modelling studies with the cn recom we obtained higher estimates of α than for the obm in all three co2 cases such high values of α should ideally yield low chl c ratios and high primary production rates lewis and smith 1983 which is not consistent with our results with low carbon fixation rates and high chl c ratios for cn recom this apparently incoherent behaviour between the cn recom and the obm may be due to the different parameterisations of respiration the respiration of photoautotrophs is mainly determined by rates of n assimilation in cn recom whereas it also depends on the rate of chla synthesis in the obm pahlow and oschlies 2013 our optimised values of α and q min for the obm compare well with estimates obtained in previous studies in this regard the obm displays a more robust behaviour and appears to be rather rigid compared to cn recom as its formulation of optimal resource allocation appears to impose stronger constraints on possible combinations of parameter values during calibration 5 conclusion we apply a cost function that accounts for correlations between measurement types to calibrate the obm and the cn recom our results show that optimal estimates of physiological parameters vary significantly between the co2 cases both for the obm and the cn recom this illustrates the difficulty in finding robust optimised parameter values parameters are better constrained for the obm as we obtain lower parameter uncertainties for it compared to the cn recom for all three treatments besides large uncertainties some of the cn recom parameter estimates also seem spurious a systematic pattern in estimates of the phytoplankton maximum rate parameter v c 0 and subsistence quota q min for the obm is revealed the highest estimates of v c 0 and qmin are obtained for the mesocosms that were treated with high co2 concentrations and lowest for those with low co2 levels as an explicit co2 dependency of plankton growth is not considered by the models these differences in estimates of parameters for the obm between treatments may be attributable to potential co2 effects hence we suggest that according to the obm ocean acidification might stimulate carbon fixation rates in phytoplankton but at the cost of increased metabolic stress which could be one possible physiological interpretation of the high qmin estimates our results are supported by findings of other co2 perturbation studies but a more informed conclusion may only be inferred from explicitly describing co2 effects on nutrient uptake and algal growth in phytoplankton growth models in contrast to the obm we do not see any clear relation between parameter estimates and co2 concentration for the cn recom the cn recom is more flexible in generating possible model solutions to explain the assimilated observational data although requiring unrealistic parameter combinations in some cases this flexibility introduces a weaker performance during cross validation if compared with the performance of the obm the parameter estimates of the obm are constrained well within the ranges estimated in previous studies we conclude that the dynamics of the obm is inherently constrained by the physiological trade offs imposed which make the obm more rigid acknowledgement the modelling framework for mesocosm simulations and data assimilation was developed for the large integrated project surface ocean processes in the anthropocene

stoichiometry is approximately maintained by restoring to a constant n c ratio q zoo const of 0 19 with a restoring time scale τ of 24 h we assume that respiration and excretion by zooplankton form the means for restoring towards q zoo const buildup and decline of zooplankton biomass depend on prey concentration grazing and losses due to mortality respiration and excretion in contrast to joassin et al 2011 obm and cn recom do not explicitly resolve viral or bacterial biomass in both models the microbial activity is implicitly considered part of remineralisation and hydrolysis thus the rates

24983,inferring interactions between populations of different species is a challenging statistical endeavour which requires a large amount of data there is therefore some incentive to combine all available sources of data into a single analysis to do so in demography and single population studies integrated population models combine population counts capture recapture and reproduction data to fit matrix population models here we extend this approach to the community level in a stage structured predator prey context we develop integrated community models icms implemented in a bayesian framework to fit multispecies nonlinear matrix models to multiple data sources we assessed the value of the different sources of data using simulations of icms under different scenarios contrasting data availability we found that combining all data types capture recapture counts and reproduction allows the estimation of both demographic and interaction parameters unlike count only data which typically generate high bias and low precision in interaction parameter estimates for short time series moreover reproduction surveys informed the estimation of interactions particularly well when compared to capture recapture programs and have the advantage of being less costly overall icms offer an accurate representation of stage structure in community dynamics and foster the development of efficient observational study designs to monitor communities in the field keywords integrated population model matrix population model community dynamics predator prey density dependence identifiability 1 introduction although matrix population models mpms are well developed for single species they have received limited attention when it comes to modelling the intricate dynamics of interacting species nonlinear matrix population models cushing 1988 neubert and caswell 2000 which admit a standard mpm formulation at low densities are density dependent models with nonlinearities possibly incorporating interactions between classes e g stages or species as functions of the abundances of these classes hassell and comins 1976 travis et al 1980 cushing 1988 dennis et al 1995 however outside the celebrated study of the floor beetle dynamics dennis et al 1995 nonlinear mpms have been little used to estimate interactions between species or reproduce their joint dynamics nonlinear mpms could however contribute greatly to ecology strongly fluctuating dynamics are currently believed to be as often driven by stage structure than by predator prey interactions with possible interactions between both mechanisms murdoch et al 2002 de roos and persson 2013 fitting nonlinear mpms to data would allow ecologists to better understand the relative share and potential interactions of those mechanisms in generating population fluctuations barraquand et al 2017 another leading ecological question is how do many species coexist in spite of seemingly similar ecological requirements nonlinear mpms allow one to distinguish competition between several life stages fujiwara et al 2011 hence paving the way for a better understanding of coexistence than unstructured models e g there could be much stronger intraspecific density dependence at the seedling stage and yet similar intra vs inter specific competition at the adult stage chu and adler 2015 stage structure may also affect the strength of trophic cascades and has been proposed to be one of the main developments needed in community level models miller and rudolf 2011 given all this potential there is reason to reflect on the relative paucity of stage structured or age structured community level models fitted to data but see adler and hillerislambers 2008 chu and adler 2015 in plants there is a literature on stage structured consumer resource studies in continuous time de roos and persson 2013 yet it is largely theoretical the scarcity of empirically parameterized multi species and nonlinear mpms may partly be due to their increased dimensionality indeed a system with interactions between s species and l stages per species requires estimation of s l 2 interaction parameters this may be why unstructured statistical models for interaction between species have so far been preferred ives et al 2003 at least when a single type of data is used e g time series of counts dennis et al 1995 although nonlinear mpms have many parameters because of their internal age structure they also have advantages over unstructured discrete time models currently fitted to data i e discrete time lotka volterra or log linear autoregressive modelling ives et al 2008 mutshinda et al 2009 hampton et al 2013 indeed the survival rates expressed in mpms are well estimated by capture recapture techniques caswell 2001 lebreton et al 2009 this opens new avenues to fit nonlinear matrix models for multiple species by considering other types of data than just counts of species such as data on survival and development rates as well as reproduction one approach to incorporate such demographic datasets used in plant community dynamics is to fit separate models for reproduction and survival components of the demography adler and hillerislambers 2008 chu and adler 2015 and then simulate the community level model thus created to evaluate its prediction of the counts and spatial structure while this approach is sound it does not take full advantage of opportunities to combine vital rate data with counts which might be problematic for small datasets capture recapture and reproduction data can be combined advantageously with counts within the integrated population modelling framework besbeas et al 2002 which uses mpms as its core for integrating over several datasets through products of likelihoods this framework has recently been extended to density dependent mpms abadi et al 2012 to the best of our knowledge there has been only one comprehensive attempt to move integrated modelling from the population to the community level while including species interactions i e density dependent links from species j density to species i vital rates that of péron and koons 2012 other multi species ipms have been recently published but they do not model interactions e g lahoz monfort et al 2017 or include interactions but model the demography of one species only e g saunders et al 2018 although péron and koons 2012 did provide a proof of concept for community level integrated modelling their focus was on estimating parameters in a real two species duck community in order to understand species coexistence not performing a general assessment of the relevance of integrated community models icms the value of the different sources of data and combining them into icms has therefore not yet been evaluated which is what we attempt here to do this we start by developing a theoretical model which we then simulate under different scenarios to find out which combination of data sources allows the model to be identifiable in practice our model also differs from péron and koons 2012 in that it models predator prey interactions rather than competition or parasitism thus occupying a new and complementary niche in the vast space of under developed density dependent mpms we used the literature on nonlinear matrix models cushing 1988 neubert and caswell 2000 wikan 2001 fujiwara et al 2011 as an inspiration for model development and we therefore produced a model that is not only statistically friendly but also amenable to theoretical explorations i e it is permanent sensu kon et al 2004 benaïm and schreiber 2009 for a large swath of parameter space in the following we first formulate a nonlinear matrix model to represent predator prey interactions between two species inspired by earlier work on stage structured density dependent matrix models our model therefore connects to neubert and caswell 2000 single species density dependent models as well as dennis et al 1995 who modelled cannibalism within a single species we then bring nonlinear matrix models into a statistical framework combining multiple data sources instead of only counts our work has two main ramifications for population and community ecology from a theoretical standpoint we pave the way for a theory of predator prey interactions based on demography rather than biomass flow this takes into account not only direct effects of predation but also indirect effects that have been neglected for a long time preisser et al 2005 from a more empirical perspective we weight the information brought by the different sources of data that can be collected in the field which has major implications for study design when initiating a community level survey should one prioritize capture recapture reproduction or count data 2 models the two stage predator prey model studied here belongs to the class of models obeying the life cycle graph shown in fig 1 whereby adult predators negatively affect juvenile prey survival and any increase in juvenile prey density positively impacts predator fecundity predators are denoted by the symbol p and prey by v as in victim we chose to model an interaction where the predation by adult consumers affects the juvenile stage of the prey as this is common in the systems we have in mind birds and mammals for which count reproduction and capture recapture data are readily available our target system could feature a mammal or bird top predator eating ground breeding bird chicks as often do canids or birds of prey valkama et al 2005 or a carnivorous mammal eating preferentially juvenile ungulates e g 3 carnivores out of 4 in gervasi et al 2012 this adult predator juvenile prey interaction setting promotes rather mild fluctuations in numbers for the parameters that we considered as opposed to say predation on adults without a refuge generating a full blown limit predator prey cycle e g turchin and hanski 1997 this setting is all the more relevant to test our icm framework that interactions between predators and prey will be harder to detect from time series alone in the absence of large oscillations time series techniques for mechanistic predator prey models perform well for cyclic or chaotic dynamics e g turchin and ellner 2000 but it is not quite clear that model identification is always possible for milder dynamics from counts only it must be mentioned however that for other parameters than those considered here we tuned them to slow life histories of birds and mammals density dependent models can and do produce cycles resonances and chaos neubert and caswell 2000 greenman and benton 2004 this is especially likely for very large maximal fecundities see discussion and appendix a which may impact the estimation process for simplicity we set the maturation rates of juvenile prey γ v and predator γ p to 1 so that juveniles of the year mature at the end of one time period to adulthood note that if the maturation time is larger than a year the use of a different time unit e g 3 years may allow one to use this model parameterization even though γ p γ v 1 aggregating yearly reproduction into larger time intervals may be more or less appropriate depending on the speed of life histories other models with γ 1 could be generalized to a stochastic icm but are somewhat more complex to simulate and fit see discussion and appendix e in the following we first describe the baseline nonlinear stage and species structured matrix population model that forms the deterministic backbone of our work then we introduce stochasticity due to individual discreteness and formulate the integrated community model that will be fitted to the data 2 1 nonlinear matrix model with predator prey and stage structure the baseline predator prey model that we consider can be expressed as 1 n t 1 a n t n t for the abundances of the two species and the two stages per species with a n t 0 1 2 f v n v a t ϕ v j n p a t 0 0 ϕ v a ϕ v a 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 f p n v j t ϕ p j n p a t 0 0 ϕ p a ϕ p a the population projection matrix and the population abundance vector n t n v j t n v a t n p j t n p a t this model is a pre breeding model which assumes that population census is taken right before reproduction cooch et al 2003 we assume that all adults and only adults are able to reproduce and can do so every year we use the following notations n v j n v a n p j n p a are the abundances of juvenile prey adult prey juvenile predators and adult predators respectively f v f p are the number of prey juveniles respectively predator juveniles produced by a prey adult resp predator during one time unit ϕ v j ϕ v a ϕ p j and ϕ p a are the fractions of the juvenile prey adult prey juvenile predator and adult predator surviving between t and t 1 the model encapsulates the following ecological relationships prey reproduction f v decreases with the number of adult prey individuals juvenile prey survival ϕ v j decreases with adult predator density predator juvenile survival ϕ p j decreases with adult predator density predator reproduction f p increases with juvenile prey numbers these relationships are modelled with the following functions ϕ p j n 1 1 exp α 1 α 2 n ϕ p j n 1 1 exp α 3 α 4 n f p n exp α 5 α 7 n f v n exp α 7 α 8 n the exponential function for fecundity log link function is classical for ipm modelling schaub and abadi 2011 and maintains a much needed connection to theoretical work on such density dependent models neubert and caswell 2000 although a sigmoid shaped survival rate makes empirical sense this choice was motivated by statistical estimation purposes identical choices of functional forms have been made by péron and koons 2012 for the parameter values that we consider table 5 representing mammal or bird demographies the deterministic model produces a stable fixed point appendix a the intraspecific density dependent feedbacks have been included so as to produce a relatively stable model with minimal complexity by stable we mean here that the model converges over time either towards a stable fixed point or a stable manifold some attractor being a k point cycle an invariant loop or a strange attractor see e g caswell 2001 chapter 16 where trajectories are bounded when time tends to infinity only considering interspecific density dependent links by contrast would lead instead to an unstable model reminiscent of the behaviour of the nicholson bailey model also in discrete time and without any intrinsic regulation between prey species kot 2001 chapter 11 in other words without intra specific density dependence the model trajectories would eventually blow up and head towards zero or infinity appendix a simulating from the fitted model for instance would become meaningless and interaction estimates would be hard to interpret a stable fixed point in a multispecies model is usually a scenario where the low amount of fluctuations in the time series generates in turn little information in the count data alone this is therefore a parameter scenario that is both realistic for the study system we have in mind birds and mammals with slow dynamics and relevant to incorporate capture recapture and reproduction together with count data cases where the deterministic age structured model itself produces a limit cycle an invariant loop or strange attractor neubert and caswell 2000 are left for further work that said one should keep in mind that all forms of stochasticity including demographic stochasticity do interact with the deterministic skeleton of the model which has been especially well shown in predator prey models nisbet and gurney 1976 mckane and newman 2005 therefore a stable fixed point in the deterministic model does not guarantee that the dynamical behaviour of a stochastic model will consist only of small fluctuations around the fixed point although this seemed to be the case for the first parameter set that we considered see below the second showed more variability with some oscillations when simulated for long times appendix a 2 2 stochastic integrated community model here we first highlight the population level predator prey model with added demographic stochasticity which produces discrete valued counts we then add the statistical part of the capture recapture and reproduction submodels that require some individual based definitions and are overlayed on top of the stochastic mpm it is the general combination of the dynamic process model with the count model the capture recapture model and the reproduction model that makes the integrated community model icm the icm was both simulated and fitted by monte carlo markov chain mcmc methods in jags plummer et al 2003 the computer code is provided at https github com oliviergimenez predator prey icm 2 2 1 stochastic multispecies nonlinear model now we consider a discrete valued state vector n t at each time step adult predators survive with probability ϕ p a together with juveniles of the previous year pre breeding census eq 1 so that 2 n p a t 1 n t binomial ϕ p a n p a t n p j t which is just a binomial sampling of eq 1 the expected mean number of juveniles produced by an adult at t 1 m p t 1 combines adult fecundity f p and newborn survival through the year with probability ϕ p j both of which are function of n t so that m p t 1 1 2 f p n v j t ϕ p j n p a t see eq 1 the number of juveniles is then updated as 3 n p j t 1 n t poisson m p t 1 n p a t the equations are similar for prey counts 4 n v a t 1 n t binomial ϕ v a n v a t n v j t with m v t 1 1 2 f v n v a t ϕ v j n p a t see eq 1 the number of juveniles at t 1 is then 5 n v j t 1 n t poisson m v t 1 n v a t this ends the mechanistic dynamic process model part of the stochastic icm 2 2 2 statistical part of the icm the icm combines data from counts capture recapture and reproduction which implies a statistical model for each the model for counts assumes that juveniles and adults are aggregated not distinguishable we overimpose an additional observation error customary in population ecology which leads to the equation 6 y p t n t n n p j t n p a t σ y 2 the equation for the prey is obtained by symmetry in practice this observation error is set to a very small value table 5 because of issues with unknown count observation error see discussion the capture recapture model is a standard cormack jolly seber model with two age classes see e g lebreton et al 1992 kéry and schaub 2011 for a detailed exposition the model for fecundity also called productivity in bird studies is a poisson regression the total number of newborns counted in year t follows a poisson distribution with rate r f where r is the number of surveyed broods and f the fecundity this assumes that each mother produces a poisson distributed number of offspring so that any sum of reproductive output over a number of mothers is also poisson distributed each model was fitted using two mcmc chains 10 000 iterations for burn in and 20 000 additional time steps to ensure convergence in the baseline scenario all priors were taken as vague flat or weakly informative e g standard gaussian in order to provide an estimation setting not too dissimilar to frequentist approaches our goal here was to develop icms not to favour any inferential framework for hierarchical models and to be able to assess easily a first aspect of identifiability a relatively flat prior allows one to check graphically if there is overlap between prior and posterior which is a main proxy for identifiability in a bayesian context gimenez et al 2009 more specifically all a priori probabilities of capture and constant probabilities were taken as unif 0 1 we used priors α i n 0 1 that being said in extensions of this model for which the combination of data sources still led to substantial bias in estimates we also considered more informative priors see discussion 3 simulation study in order to show the potential benefits of combining data into integrated community models we fitted icms in four contrasted scenarios of data availability we constructed those to mimic what is observed in the field where count data are usually more available schaub and abadi 2011 even though less informative of vital rates directly zipkin and saunders 2018 there is also often more demographic information on longer lived large predators than on their prey an asymmetry in data availability which we incorporated here although we did not try to reproduce the observational data design of any species pair in particular our data scenarios are as follows 1 all data available for both predator and prey table 1 2 only counts available for both species table 2 3 reproduction missing for prey table 3 4 capture recapture missing for prey table 4 the scenario 1 helps to verify that the statistical model is working properly when all the information is available scenario 2 is then helpful to pinpoint identifiability issues whenever only counts are available in scenario 3 predators are assumed to be easier to monitor both species undergo capture recapture whilst prey reproduction is unknown in scenario 4 predators are assumed to be easier to monitor whilst prey capture recapture data are not possible to obtain comparison of the last two scenarios will be useful to assess the value of a costly capture recapture program for prey monitoring the four scenarios are crossed with two population monitoring durations t 10 years and t 30 years assuming the time unit is a year we assumed that 100 juvenile individuals are marked each year for t 10 and 20 juvenile individuals are marked each year for t 30 for both species therefore t 30 is not merely more data but a different observational design the capture recapture study design implicitly assumes that it is easier to mark the predator because they are less numerous than prey and the numbers of juveniles marked therefore represent a higher fraction of the predator population the annual number of surveyed broods in set to 20 for the predator and 50 for the prey hence for both species fecundity is sampled only for a fraction of the population table 5 describes all other models parameters that have been used for simulation for scenarios 2 and 4 the fitted models are without capture recapture in scenario 4 only for the prey we kept a probability of capture in the code but it has nearly equal priors and posteriors and cannot affect other estimates it only enters the capture recapture submodel which is absent 4 results a typical simulation of the population counts for one model run together with their estimates under the fitted icm scenario 1 is presented in fig 2 we see that the predator and prey fitted trajectories match well the simulated trajectories this is in fact true in all scenarios not shown and probably attributable to the high dimensionality of icms during model fitting the algorithm always finds a combination of vital rates that at least match the count trajectories however reproducing the shape of density dependent relationships is a much harder task as we show below in the scenario 1 the statistical fit does also reproduce well the four density dependent vital rates eq 1 fig 3 show one typical statistical fit this is true for most simulations in scenario 1 however in the scenario 2 the fitted model could not reproduce density dependencies in many cases this bad match between simulated and fitted parameters in scenario 2 is made explicit by the examination of the bias and precision in α i estimates fig 4 note that fig 4 does not present bayesian credible intervals though these exist as well and we have examined them in fig 4 we summarize the information provided by each of the 100 simulations by keeping the posterior mean of the parameter α i which we denote α ˆ i presenting α ˆ i for many simulations allows us to study the properties of this estimator of α i in a similar manner to a frequentist study of the estimator bias is given by e α ˆ i α i and precision by the dispersion variance of α ˆ i we see that the count only scenario 2 generates large bias and low precision in particular for interaction parameters even indices for α i i 2 4 6 8 both scenarios 3 and 4 generate relatively good performances of the estimators for most α i interestingly scenario 4 has almost identical performance to scenario 1 almost the same precision fig 4 and similar bias which means that prey fecundity data is in fact of more value than prey capture recapture data at least for the parameters considered here to be thorough we have considered our second parameter set with stronger predator prey coupling α 5 0 5 α 6 0 01 α 7 1 5 and it shows similar results fig b 1 in appendix b the slight systematic bias that exists for α 5 in data scenarios 1 3 and 4 vanishes for this other parameter set this new parameter set also confirms the fact that scenario 4 is almost indistinguishable from scenario 1 the same figure for the simulated t 30 years observational study is presented in appendix b fig b 2 combining data types still improves model performances scenario 2 has the least precise estimates for most parameters however for t 30 we observe less precise interaction estimates for scenarios 1 3 and 4 α 2 α 4 or with a little more bias α 6 α 8 than for t 10 the benefits of capture recapture and fecundity data for the t 30 setting with a longer study but a less intense capture effort are a little lower than for t 10 this is logical and can be interpreted as a presence of proportionally more information in the counts for t 30 the scenario 4 still brings low bias and estimates of similar quality to scenario 1 which confirms the good behaviour of this observational design for a different capture effort and time series length 5 discussion building on integrated population modelling and combining it with nonlinear multispecies matrix models we have developed a predator prey integrated community model icm the density dependent relationships in the icm were designed to allow the model to persist for extended periods of time this implied to not only consider density dependent vital rates linking different species but also density dependencies within the same species this resulted in four density dependencies fig 3 the model was structured and parameterized to correspond to a stage structured predator prey system composed of relatively large birds and or mammals using simulations of the icm under contrasted data availability scenarios we found that for a moderate study duration 10 years the information contained within counts may be enough to reproduce the time series but not the density dependencies inference about interactions therefore requires either longer time series e g 30 years or much more which are often not available to practitioners or a combination with other data types the combination of all data types yielded estimates of vital rates and interaction parameters density dependent slope parameters that had low bias and good precision especially when compared to count only estimates although our results are promising and definitely show that combining data sources can be worthwhile to estimate species joint dynamics much remains to be done we sketch below several areas for further research 5 1 identifiability of the predator prey icm we have shown that using all data types allowed estimating parameters with less bias and more precision weak identifiability sensu gimenez et al 2009 seemed approximately satisfied an additional question is whether there are some redundant parameters in the model cole and mccrea 2016 this issue can be explored to some degree using pairwise joint posterior plots appendix c see cole and mccrea 2016 for other ideas on how to pinpoint identifiability pair posterior densities show that parameters are pairwise uncorrelated unless they belong to the same density dependency function for instance we see that α 1 and α 2 correlate negatively in the posterior distributions appendix c these negative correlations between the two parameters of a single density dependency are a likely consequence of the parameterization of the model the overall shape of the density dependence curves can still remain unchanged using several parameter combinations whilst correlation between parameters as well as ridges in the likelihood or joint posterior distribution are in many cases worrying we show here that in this context negative correlation in the posteriors for parameters of the same density dependent curve is good rather than poor statistical behaviour the correlation produces more precise estimated density dependent relationships appendix c this could be explained by re parameterizing ϕ v p 1 1 exp α 3 α 4 n 1 1 exp γ n n n being the equilibrium population size we obtain α 3 γn and α 4 γ which produces a negative correlation assuming that γ is estimated less precisely than n we obtain the result a similar argument for negative correlations in the posteriors can be made for the fecundity parameters if f p n exp α 5 α 6 n then an increase of δ in α 5 will produce a decrease of nδ if f p is to stay approximately at the same value 5 2 refining the icm 5 2 1 saturating functional forms for density dependencies in the current model we consider a potentially unlimited increase in the predator fecundity accelerating relationship for the range of parameter values that we considered this poses no problem because both prey and predator densities stay within reasonable bounds but if the model is fitted or simulated in other contexts this could become problematic a surge in prey abundance would then allow for completely unrealistic predator fecundities an avenue for improvement is therefore to implement a saturating predator fecundity i e f p n v j α 5 1 exp α 6 n v j so far all our attempts to do this ended with some notable bias on α 6 appendix d with the model estimating a flat rather than decelerating predator fecundity clearly more work in that area is needed 5 2 2 observation error on the counts in this article our fitted models did not include observation error on the counts we actually planned to do so and our computer code allows this observation error to be implemented but we found out through preliminary model fits that an unknown information error seems to induce major identifiability issues the trajectories of predator and prey counts can still be reproduced when a poorly estimated observation error is present but the density dependent functions cannot in other words the model then produces good in sample forecasts but for the wrong reasons all α i values are estimated with strong bias in this case including when all data types are used our model belong to the general family of state space models or ssms newman et al 2014 and as such suffers from the same difficulties in implementing unknown observation errors in such models indeed several modelling studies have reported that unknown observation errors in ssms in absence of multiple samples per time step see in this case dennis et al 2010 can be quite problematic without prior information observation error variances are often poorly identified which then creates bias in other estimates knape 2008 lebreton and gimenez 2013 auger méthé et al 2016 certain et al 2018 such biases are likely to be even stronger if the dynamics contains large fluctuations especially chaotic ones and more refined model fitting techniques may have to be employed wood 2010 hartig and dormann 2013 unless the observation error on the counts is known to some degree e g because counts are estimated by a method reporting that error such as distance sampling and can be specified as an informative prior given the already high complexity of icms we suggest to neglect it however if some degree of replication within a time step is available it may be possible to estimate it dennis et al 2010 we note in passing that although assuming an observation error on the counts is customary in population ecology and we have followed this modelling tradition here there is no special reason to think that counting animals is more subject to error than resighting or fecundity estimation e g this may be true for ringed birds but not necessarily for mammals identified by fur patterns decision of including observation error on counts or not in a hierarchical model will therefore be best made on a case by case basis 5 2 3 model structure we have considered for now a pre breeding census mpm for the icm however we have also written out a post breeding census version of the nonlinear matrix model with a juvenile stage duration of potentially multiple years appendix e comparison of the timing of censuses and events implied by the two versions of the model pre vs post breeding e g cooch et al 2003 has revealed that only minor differences in interpretation are involved this may be partly because our model where vital rates are related to densities by nonlinear phenomenological functions does not rely on explicit biomass conversion of prey into predators i e litteral conversion of killed prey into newborn predators zhou et al 2013 suggested that such discrete time systems with biomass conversion might be more stable because of the ordering of events assuming that predation occurs before reproduction however even though event ordering reproduction vs survival can affect stability in these models census timing may not weide et al 2018 show that for models with explicit biomass conversion census timing only imply minor quantitative differences in model outputs for difference equations major qualitative differences only occur between models that assume biomass conversion to happen before reproduction more stable or after more oscillating as shown by weide et al 2018 a post breeding census model brings our framework closer to a multi species version of the density dependent models of neubert and caswell 2000 this formulation which we use for ongoing theoretical work was more internally consistent appendix e but also more difficult to adapt directly in the ipm framework which we adapted from previous equations and existing computer code for pre breeding census models abadi et al 2012 on empirical grounds both pre breeding and post breeding model can make sense depending on the timing of the census if there are only two classes juveniles and adults in both the pre and post breeding census version the corresponding individual based community model can be described by a sequences of stochastic events involving only poisson and binomial distributions appendix e binomial for death rates and poisson for recruitment there is a good mapping between the icm and the fully explicit stochastic ibm because the binomial sampling of a poisson distributed count still follows a poisson distribution and the binomial sampling of a binomial distributed count is still a binomial distribution however real recruitment distributions might have added variance e g zero inflated poisson or negative binomial and these may be considered in future icm work it is possible to extend the formulation of our model so that juveniles are able to stay several years within the juvenile class appendix e this may be a useful first step to model a longer lived juvenile stage i e more than a year indeed using more than two classes requires to use multinomial distributions for transitions watkins 2000 which amounts to specify the community level ibm as a multi type density dependent branching process haccou et al 2005 instead of using poisson and binomial random variates as in section 2 2 1 this adds considerable complexity to the stochastic model and is left for further work another layer of complexity that we have not tackled here is spatial structure the spatial structure itself can contain information about interactions although power can be an issue with spatial only data rajala et al 2018 spatio temporal data could be of great use in helping to identify interactions if only count data are spatial counts might become increasingly important in identifying the model potentially changing some of the results that we show here tredennick et al 2017 show for instance that demographic data might not be needed to predict spatiotemporal quadrat level plant community dynamics with that in mind it is also important to realize that for many birds and mammals count data are usually scarce and the spatial scales at which a count value can be defined can be very large so that spatial replication in count data might be very hard to achieve in some cases it might even be easier to obtain spatially dependent survival or recruitment data since those can be individual based chandler and clark 2014 5 2 4 more intricate or challenging dynamics we have considered thus far that the predator prey system exhibited a fixed point equilibrium a consequence of slow bird and mammal life histories and predation on juveniles only with added noise due to demographic stochasticity section 2 2 1 there is therefore only a moderate signal in the counts themselves changing parameters could allow for cycles or chaos to develop neubert and caswell 2000 wikan 2001 which could then provide more signal and make the count information more relevant at least for long time series both neubert and caswell 2000 and wikan 2001 have shown that these dynamics tend to occur for large fecundities different systems than birds and mammals involving for example fishes or plants might therefore have much wilder fluctuations we confirm this for our model in appendix a however a more fluctuating model can also be tricky to estimate because there can be multiple causation of oscillations e g interactions of stochasticity and age structure greenman and benton 2004 barraquand et al 2017 it is therefore unclear what changing completely the range of parameters in this model e g considering much faster life histories would do to the quality of parameter estimates in the icm aside from changing parameters one neat way to produce wilder dynamics would be to allow for predation on adults this can be done phenomenologically rather than mechanistically by simply having an adult prey survival rate that depends on predator adult density other options are proposed by zhou et al 2013 and weide et al 2018 this would allow for predator prey cycles we have seen this in explorations of the nonlinear matrix model but we note that we would need to change the time frames of simulation considered e g 30 100 years in order to see well these long period cycles such time frames may be useful to model long term ecological studies for which there is an historical time series of counts say 100 years at the end of which we perform capture recapture and fecundity estimation during say 10 or 20 years this fits relatively well the data that could be obtained on lynx and hare krebs et al 2018 another worthy exploration would be interaction estimates when there are actually no true linkages between the species population dynamics i e no interaction at all not even unmodelled indirect interactions in the present article we asked how different data combinations may or may not allow the model to recover interactions that are known to be present this fits well predator prey pairs for which there is prior knowledge about potential impacts of predators on their prey which is clearly the situation we placed ourselves in however for less well understood ecological configurations there is always a risk of error in assessing who interacts with whom and the question of what the icm would infer if two species have in fact independent dynamics may be paramount we think that such cases would be especially relevant when predator diet is poorly known or in a competition context as it can be difficult to evaluate whether or not two species truly share a similar niche 5 3 suggestions for empirical surveys aiming at parameterizing multi species models we would like to finally conclude on what data should be collected in the field if the aim is to parameterize multi species and stage structured dynamic models our results show first that longer time frames are not necessarily best assuming that there is a trade off between study duration and capture effort per year especially for vertebrates this is because 30 years of counts alone contain limited information to parameterize high dimensional models barraquand and nielsen 2018 and capture recapture and reproduction data add much needed independent information on parameters moreover for the parameter values that we considered tuned to birds and mammals a prey fecundity survey brought more precision to interaction and vital rate estimates than a capture recapture survey top predators are usually well studied notably due to conservation concerns but their more abundant prey could be difficult costly to follow through capture recapture and be simply counted our results suggests that a prey fecundity survey adds much value probably at a small fraction of the cost of a capture recapture program in a bayesian framework a priori knowledge on some of those parameters can also be gained from the mpm databases salguero gómez et al 2016 which will be especially important for poorly studied species which parameter s should be set with prior information will then depend on a trade off between the degree of phylogenetic conservatism of the parameter che castaldo et al 2018 and the ease which with the information can be collected in the field adult survival is a good target costly to infer probably fairly conserved between related species and the analyses that we performed could be attempted again using a mixture of real data and database derived a priori

for thoughtful remarks and references appendix a trajectories of deterministic and stochastic versions of the nonlinear mpm we present in fig a 1 simulations showing the convergence of the model to a fixed point for our first parameter set table 5 in main text and second parameter set with changed parameters α 5 0 5 α 6 0 01 α 7 1 5 see also appendix b demographic stochasticity does generate more or less fluctuations around this fixed point though fig a 1 b and d the stability of this model in the lyapunov sense cf kot 2001 for example is lost when intra specific density dependencies are removed fig a 2 where trajectories show diverging oscillations we now present different dynamics obtained by increasing maximal fecundity to exp 5 for parameter set 1 and exp 4 5 for parameter 2 in fig a 3 the model produces oscillations likely invariant loops or chaos more detailed investigations would be needed to distinguish between those for a mathematical investigation of similar dynamics see for instance wikan 2001 the stochastic versions are also oscillating fig a 3 b unless the high predator prey coupling generates extinction when combined to the demographic stochasticity small prey numbers and sampling create extinction fig a 3 d appendix b additional estimates of alpha parameters b 1 results for the second parameter set the second parameter set that we considered differed from

following plots describe the joint posterior distribution for pairs of parameters based on two mcmc chains considerable linkage between the parameters that belong to the same density dependent relationship are visible these manifest as an elongated ellipsoid instead of a circle shaped joint posterior for the pair we present these diagnostic plots for t 10 fig c 1 scenario 1 fig c 2 scenario 2 and t 30 fig c 3 scenario 1 fig c 4 scenario 2 for t 10 we have good convergence gelman and rubin s r 1 1 for t 30 convergence and chain mixing are less good which generates some bimodality on these posterior graphs the persistent correlation in the posterior distribution of α 1 α 2 α 3 α 4 etc for scenario 1 can be shown to have very little detrimental effect on the shape of the curves fig c 5 the correlation between parameters even contributes to increase the precision of the curve since randomizing shuffling both vectors for α 3 and α 4 independently decreases the precision of the curve fig c 6 in fig c 6 the inflection point of the curve is in fact less marked than in fig c 5 that incorporates the correlation in the joint posterior appendix d nonlinear predator fecundity we

fit for other relationships figs d 3 and d 4 but did not correct the problem of flat estimation of predator fecundity appendix e pre and post breeding census model for γ 1 e 1 pre and post breeding matrix model for γ 1 the general equation of our nonlinear matrix model is 7 n t 1 a n t n t for the counts of the two species and two stages per species with a n t 1 γ v ϕ v j n p a t 1 2 f v n v a t 0 0 γ v ϕ v j n p a t ϕ v a 0 0 0 0 1 γ p ϕ p j n p a t 1 2 f p n v j t 0 0 γ p ϕ p j n p a t ϕ p a in the post breeding case similar to neubert and caswell 2000 and in the pre breeding case this article a n t 1 γ v ϕ v j n p a t 1 2 f v n v a t ϕ v j n p a t 0 0 γ v ϕ v a ϕ v a 0 0 0 0 1 γ p ϕ p j n p a t 1 2 f p n v j t ϕ p j n p a t 0 0 γ p ϕ p a ϕ p a all other notations are similar to the main text these two formulations with different census dates lead interestingly to slightly different versions of the corresponding stochastic individual based model ibm we provide below a full derivation for the ibm e 2 order of events in the stochastic ibm all events can be ordered on a time arrow by introducing an intermediate time t between t and t 1 see also cooch et al 2003 weide et al 2018 we consider first the post breeding census scenario post breeding census we assume that before census reproduction occurs at some time t reasonably close to t 1 at time t starts the survival phase for both stages we will derive the ibm for the prey population dynamics we have the update equation for juvenile prey population size at time t 1 n v j t 1 n t b t 1 x t 1 jv where x t 1 jv is the number of juveniles born in the previous time period that survive up to t 1 it therefore includes all the juveniles from the previous time period that 1 have survived survival happens first 2 have not transitioned to adulthood transition happens second because t is very close to t 1 post breeding census we can neglect the survival fraction of juveniles of the year so that b t 1 b t and b t p 1 2 f v n v a t on the other hand we have the number of individuals staying juveniles after t x t 1 jv b x t jv 1 γ v and finally the number of survivors from n v j t x t jv b n v j t ϕ v j n p a t so that x t 1 jv b n v j t 1 γ v ϕ v j n p a t this follows from the fact that if x y b y p and y b n q then x b n pq let us denote x t 1 av the individuals that have matured to adulthood between t and t 1 then x t 1 av n v j t x t jv as we subtract from the previous population size of juveniles individuals that have not maturated 1 1 this important step is modelled simply using a binomial distribution because we have two stages with more stages it would require a multinomial distribution see watkins 2000 for details the number of adults at the next iteration is then obtained as n v a t 1 n t z t 1 av x t 1 av where z t 1 av b n v a t ϕ v a the prey part of the stochastic ibm is now fully specified similar arguments follow for the predator compartment the time ordering in this model means that from the prey point of view predation happen on juveniles born in the previous year if γ 1 these would be between a few months and a little more than a year old predation occurs continuously during the long survival phase birth is always in such discrete time models a pulse event i e occurring at once or almost at a given time t for the predator population dynamics predator reproduction which happens at t as well is driven by the abundance of the juvenile at the beginning of the survival process starting at t predator reproduction is therefore very much influenced by the prey individuals born last year the prey and predator parts of the model are therefore consistent pre breeding census now we consider a pre breeding census for which the time arrow is slightly differently organised with birth at t right after census at t as in the previous derivation we consider that the juvenile population size at time t 1 is given by the following update equation n v j t 1 n t b t 1 x t 1 jv this translates the fact that juveniles are composed of both newborns and surviving juveniles that did not mature between t and t 1 the difference now for the pre breeding census is that there is a long period during which the juveniles of the year need to survive so that b t 1 b t in fact b t 1 b b t ϕ v j n p a t with a production of chicks at t b t p 1 2 f v n v a t this leads to a marginal distribution of b t 1 b t 1 p 1 2 f v n v a t ϕ v j n p a t indeed if x y b y p and y p λ then x p p λ here predation modelled through the predator dependence of juvenile survival occurs as well on juveniles of the year 2 2 assuming that the year is defined by the change in year t of course which may be equivalent to start it around january with breeding occurring early in the spring so eggs or young chicks the surviving juveniles from the previous year are given by x t 1 jv b x t jv ϕ v j n p a t themselves picked from the individuals that did not mature x t jv b n v j t 1 γ v so that x t 1 jv b x t jv 1 γ v ϕ v j n p a t for the adults n v a t 1 n t z t 1 av x t 1 av with surviving old adults z t 1 av b n v a t ϕ v a and new adults x t 1 av b x t av ϕ v a this is because right after t x t av is the number of the individuals entering the adult compartment the transitioning adults are obtained with the equation x t av n v j t 1 x t jv as they are picked from the pool of previous juveniles this eventually leads to after a few simplifications x t 1 av b n v j t γ v ϕ v a similar arguments can be brought up for the predator because only the predator reproduction rate is affected by prey density at t in the predator submodel and predator reproduction occurs right at t predators are assumed to depend for reproduction on prey individuals born in the previous time step e 2 1 ecological consequences of the modelling assumptions from the predator reproduction perspective both post and pre breeding models are similar and predator depend for reproduction on individuals largely born the year before from the prey perspective the post breeding model assumes that older juvenile individuals born the year before suffer predation whilst the pre breeding model assumes that all prey including newborns suffer predation the post breeding model may therefore be a little more internally consistent only the older juveniles affect predator reproduction and predator only affect older juvenile survival not newborns however the pre breeding model where predator reproduction only depends on individuals born in the previous year but predation also impacts newborns is not unrealistic as well predators that reproduce on large juvenile individuals can also eat eggs or very young chicks for their basic sustenance 
24983,inferring interactions between populations of different species is a challenging statistical endeavour which requires a large amount of data there is therefore some incentive to combine all available sources of data into a single analysis to do so in demography and single population studies integrated population models combine population counts capture recapture and reproduction data to fit matrix population models here we extend this approach to the community level in a stage structured predator prey context we develop integrated community models icms implemented in a bayesian framework to fit multispecies nonlinear matrix models to multiple data sources we assessed the value of the different sources of data using simulations of icms under different scenarios contrasting data availability we found that combining all data types capture recapture counts and reproduction allows the estimation of both demographic and interaction parameters unlike count only data which typically generate high bias and low precision in interaction parameter estimates for short time series moreover reproduction surveys informed the estimation of interactions particularly well when compared to capture recapture programs and have the advantage of being less costly overall icms offer an accurate representation of stage structure in community dynamics and foster the development of efficient observational study designs to monitor communities in the field keywords integrated population model matrix population model community dynamics predator prey density dependence identifiability 1 introduction although matrix population models mpms are well developed for single species they have received limited attention when it comes to modelling the intricate dynamics of interacting species nonlinear matrix population models cushing 1988 neubert and caswell 2000 which admit a standard mpm formulation at low densities are density dependent models with nonlinearities possibly incorporating interactions between classes e g stages or species as functions of the abundances of these classes hassell and comins 1976 travis et al 1980 cushing 1988 dennis et al 1995 however outside the celebrated study of the floor beetle dynamics dennis et al 1995 nonlinear mpms have been little used to estimate interactions between species or reproduce their joint dynamics nonlinear mpms could however contribute greatly to ecology strongly fluctuating dynamics are currently believed to be as often driven by stage structure than by predator prey interactions with possible interactions between both mechanisms murdoch et al 2002 de roos and persson 2013 fitting nonlinear mpms to data would allow ecologists to better understand the relative share and potential interactions of those mechanisms in generating population fluctuations barraquand et al 2017 another leading ecological question is how do many species coexist in spite of seemingly similar ecological requirements nonlinear mpms allow one to distinguish competition between several life stages fujiwara et al 2011 hence paving the way for a better understanding of coexistence than unstructured models e g there could be much stronger intraspecific density dependence at the seedling stage and yet similar intra vs inter specific competition at the adult stage chu and adler 2015 stage structure may also affect the strength of trophic cascades and has been proposed to be one of the main developments needed in community level models miller and rudolf 2011 given all this potential there is reason to reflect on the relative paucity of stage structured or age structured community level models fitted to data but see adler and hillerislambers 2008 chu and adler 2015 in plants there is a literature on stage structured consumer resource studies in continuous time de roos and persson 2013 yet it is largely theoretical the scarcity of empirically parameterized multi species and nonlinear mpms may partly be due to their increased dimensionality indeed a system with interactions between s species and l stages per species requires estimation of s l 2 interaction parameters this may be why unstructured statistical models for interaction between species have so far been preferred ives et al 2003 at least when a single type of data is used e g time series of counts dennis et al 1995 although nonlinear mpms have many parameters because of their internal age structure they also have advantages over unstructured discrete time models currently fitted to data i e discrete time lotka volterra or log linear autoregressive modelling ives et al 2008 mutshinda et al 2009 hampton et al 2013 indeed the survival rates expressed in mpms are well estimated by capture recapture techniques caswell 2001 lebreton et al 2009 this opens new avenues to fit nonlinear matrix models for multiple species by considering other types of data than just counts of species such as data on survival and development rates as well as reproduction one approach to incorporate such demographic datasets used in plant community dynamics is to fit separate models for reproduction and survival components of the demography adler and hillerislambers 2008 chu and adler 2015 and then simulate the community level model thus created to evaluate its prediction of the counts and spatial structure while this approach is sound it does not take full advantage of opportunities to combine vital rate data with counts which might be problematic for small datasets capture recapture and reproduction data can be combined advantageously with counts within the integrated population modelling framework besbeas et al 2002 which uses mpms as its core for integrating over several datasets through products of likelihoods this framework has recently been extended to density dependent mpms abadi et al 2012 to the best of our knowledge there has been only one comprehensive attempt to move integrated modelling from the population to the community level while including species interactions i e density dependent links from species j density to species i vital rates that of péron and koons 2012 other multi species ipms have been recently published but they do not model interactions e g lahoz monfort et al 2017 or include interactions but model the demography of one species only e g saunders et al 2018 although péron and koons 2012 did provide a proof of concept for community level integrated modelling their focus was on estimating parameters in a real two species duck community in order to understand species coexistence not performing a general assessment of the relevance of integrated community models icms the value of the different sources of data and combining them into icms has therefore not yet been evaluated which is what we attempt here to do this we start by developing a theoretical model which we then simulate under different scenarios to find out which combination of data sources allows the model to be identifiable in practice our model also differs from péron and koons 2012 in that it models predator prey interactions rather than competition or parasitism thus occupying a new and complementary niche in the vast space of under developed density dependent mpms we used the literature on nonlinear matrix models cushing 1988 neubert and caswell 2000 wikan 2001 fujiwara et al 2011 as an inspiration for model development and we therefore produced a model that is not only statistically friendly but also amenable to theoretical explorations i e it is permanent sensu kon et al 2004 benaïm and schreiber 2009 for a large swath of parameter space in the following we first formulate a nonlinear matrix model to represent predator prey interactions between two species inspired by earlier work on stage structured density dependent matrix models our model therefore connects to neubert and caswell 2000 single species density dependent models as well as dennis et al 1995 who modelled cannibalism within a single species we then bring nonlinear matrix models into a statistical framework combining multiple data sources instead of only counts our work has two main ramifications for population and community ecology from a theoretical standpoint we pave the way for a theory of predator prey interactions based on demography rather than biomass flow this takes into account not only direct effects of predation but also indirect effects that have been neglected for a long time preisser et al 2005 from a more empirical perspective we weight the information brought by the different sources of data that can be collected in the field which has major implications for study design when initiating a community level survey should one prioritize capture recapture reproduction or count data 2 models the two stage predator prey model studied here belongs to the class of models obeying the life cycle graph shown in fig 1 whereby adult predators negatively affect juvenile prey survival and any increase in juvenile prey density positively impacts predator fecundity predators are denoted by the symbol p and prey by v as in victim we chose to model an interaction where the predation by adult consumers affects the juvenile stage of the prey as this is common in the systems we have in mind birds and mammals for which count reproduction and capture recapture data are readily available our target system could feature a mammal or bird top predator eating ground breeding bird chicks as often do canids or birds of prey valkama et al 2005 or a carnivorous mammal eating preferentially juvenile ungulates e g 3 carnivores out of 4 in gervasi et al 2012 this adult predator juvenile prey interaction setting promotes rather mild fluctuations in numbers for the parameters that we considered as opposed to say predation on adults without a refuge generating a full blown limit predator prey cycle e g turchin and hanski 1997 this setting is all the more relevant to test our icm framework that interactions between predators and prey will be harder to detect from time series alone in the absence of large oscillations time series techniques for mechanistic predator prey models perform well for cyclic or chaotic dynamics e g turchin and ellner 2000 but it is not quite clear that model identification is always possible for milder dynamics from counts only it must be mentioned however that for other parameters than those considered here we tuned them to slow life histories of birds and mammals density dependent models can and do produce cycles resonances and chaos neubert and caswell 2000 greenman and benton 2004 this is especially likely for very large maximal fecundities see discussion and appendix a which may impact the estimation process for simplicity we set the maturation rates of juvenile prey γ v and predator γ p to 1 so that juveniles of the year mature at the end of one time period to adulthood note that if the maturation time is larger than a year the use of a different time unit e g 3 years may allow one to use this model parameterization even though γ p γ v 1 aggregating yearly reproduction into larger time intervals may be more or less appropriate depending on the speed of life histories other models with γ 1 could be generalized to a stochastic icm but are somewhat more complex to simulate and fit see discussion and appendix e in the following we first describe the baseline nonlinear stage and species structured matrix population model that forms the deterministic backbone of our work then we introduce stochasticity due to individual discreteness and formulate the integrated community model that will be fitted to the data 2 1 nonlinear matrix model with predator prey and stage structure the baseline predator prey model that we consider can be expressed as 1 n t 1 a n t n t for the abundances of the two species and the two stages per species with a n t 0 1 2 f v n v a t ϕ v j n p a t 0 0 ϕ v a ϕ v a 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 f p n v j t ϕ p j n p a t 0 0 ϕ p a ϕ p a the population projection matrix and the population abundance vector n t n v j t n v a t n p j t n p a t this model is a pre breeding model which assumes that population census is taken right before reproduction cooch et al 2003 we assume that all adults and only adults are able to reproduce and can do so every year we use the following notations n v j n v a n p j n p a are the abundances of juvenile prey adult prey juvenile predators and adult predators respectively f v f p are the number of prey juveniles respectively predator juveniles produced by a prey adult resp predator during one time unit ϕ v j ϕ v a ϕ p j and ϕ p a are the fractions of the juvenile prey adult prey juvenile predator and adult predator surviving between t and t 1 the model encapsulates the following ecological relationships prey reproduction f v decreases with the number of adult prey individuals juvenile prey survival ϕ v j decreases with adult predator density predator juvenile survival ϕ p j decreases with adult predator density predator reproduction f p increases with juvenile prey numbers these relationships are modelled with the following functions ϕ p j n 1 1 exp α 1 α 2 n ϕ p j n 1 1 exp α 3 α 4 n f p n exp α 5 α 7 n f v n exp α 7 α 8 n the exponential function for fecundity log link function is classical for ipm modelling schaub and abadi 2011 and maintains a much needed connection to theoretical work on such density dependent models neubert and caswell 2000 although a sigmoid shaped survival rate makes empirical sense this choice was motivated by statistical estimation purposes identical choices of functional forms have been made by péron and koons 2012 for the parameter values that we consider table 5 representing mammal or bird demographies the deterministic model produces a stable fixed point appendix a the intraspecific density dependent feedbacks have been included so as to produce a relatively stable model with minimal complexity by stable we mean here that the model converges over time either towards a stable fixed point or a stable manifold some attractor being a k point cycle an invariant loop or a strange attractor see e g caswell 2001 chapter 16 where trajectories are bounded when time tends to infinity only considering interspecific density dependent links by contrast would lead instead to an unstable model reminiscent of the behaviour of the nicholson bailey model also in discrete time and without any intrinsic regulation between prey species kot 2001 chapter 11 in other words without intra specific density dependence the model trajectories would eventually blow up and head towards zero or infinity appendix a simulating from the fitted model for instance would become meaningless and interaction estimates would be hard to interpret a stable fixed point in a multispecies model is usually a scenario where the low amount of fluctuations in the time series generates in turn little information in the count data alone this is therefore a parameter scenario that is both realistic for the study system we have in mind birds and mammals with slow dynamics and relevant to incorporate capture recapture and reproduction together with count data cases where the deterministic age structured model itself produces a limit cycle an invariant loop or strange attractor neubert and caswell 2000 are left for further work that said one should keep in mind that all forms of stochasticity including demographic stochasticity do interact with the deterministic skeleton of the model which has been especially well shown in predator prey models nisbet and gurney 1976 mckane and newman 2005 therefore a stable fixed point in the deterministic model does not guarantee that the dynamical behaviour of a stochastic model will consist only of small fluctuations around the fixed point although this seemed to be the case for the first parameter set that we considered see below the second showed more variability with some oscillations when simulated for long times appendix a 2 2 stochastic integrated community model here we first highlight the population level predator prey model with added demographic stochasticity which produces discrete valued counts we then add the statistical part of the capture recapture and reproduction submodels that require some individual based definitions and are overlayed on top of the stochastic mpm it is the general combination of the dynamic process model with the count model the capture recapture model and the reproduction model that makes the integrated community model icm the icm was both simulated and fitted by monte carlo markov chain mcmc methods in jags plummer et al 2003 the computer code is provided at https github com oliviergimenez predator prey icm 2 2 1 stochastic multispecies nonlinear model now we consider a discrete valued state vector n t at each time step adult predators survive with probability ϕ p a together with juveniles of the previous year pre breeding census eq 1 so that 2 n p a t 1 n t binomial ϕ p a n p a t n p j t which is just a binomial sampling of eq 1 the expected mean number of juveniles produced by an adult at t 1 m p t 1 combines adult fecundity f p and newborn survival through the year with probability ϕ p j both of which are function of n t so that m p t 1 1 2 f p n v j t ϕ p j n p a t see eq 1 the number of juveniles is then updated as 3 n p j t 1 n t poisson m p t 1 n p a t the equations are similar for prey counts 4 n v a t 1 n t binomial ϕ v a n v a t n v j t with m v t 1 1 2 f v n v a t ϕ v j n p a t see eq 1 the number of juveniles at t 1 is then 5 n v j t 1 n t poisson m v t 1 n v a t this ends the mechanistic dynamic process model part of the stochastic icm 2 2 2 statistical part of the icm the icm combines data from counts capture recapture and reproduction which implies a statistical model for each the model for counts assumes that juveniles and adults are aggregated not distinguishable we overimpose an additional observation error customary in population ecology which leads to the equation 6 y p t n t n n p j t n p a t σ y 2 the equation for the prey is obtained by symmetry in practice this observation error is set to a very small value table 5 because of issues with unknown count observation error see discussion the capture recapture model is a standard cormack jolly seber model with two age classes see e g lebreton et al 1992 kéry and schaub 2011 for a detailed exposition the model for fecundity also called productivity in bird studies is a poisson regression the total number of newborns counted in year t follows a poisson distribution with rate r f where r is the number of surveyed broods and f the fecundity this assumes that each mother produces a poisson distributed number of offspring so that any sum of reproductive output over a number of mothers is also poisson distributed each model was fitted using two mcmc chains 10 000 iterations for burn in and 20 000 additional time steps to ensure convergence in the baseline scenario all priors were taken as vague flat or weakly informative e g standard gaussian in order to provide an estimation setting not too dissimilar to frequentist approaches our goal here was to develop icms not to favour any inferential framework for hierarchical models and to be able to assess easily a first aspect of identifiability a relatively flat prior allows one to check graphically if there is overlap between prior and posterior which is a main proxy for identifiability in a bayesian context gimenez et al 2009 more specifically all a priori probabilities of capture and constant probabilities were taken as unif 0 1 we used priors α i n 0 1 that being said in extensions of this model for which the combination of data sources still led to substantial bias in estimates we also considered more informative priors see discussion 3 simulation study in order to show the potential benefits of combining data into integrated community models we fitted icms in four contrasted scenarios of data availability we constructed those to mimic what is observed in the field where count data are usually more available schaub and abadi 2011 even though less informative of vital rates directly zipkin and saunders 2018 there is also often more demographic information on longer lived large predators than on their prey an asymmetry in data availability which we incorporated here although we did not try to reproduce the observational data design of any species pair in particular our data scenarios are as follows 1 all data available for both predator and prey table 1 2 only counts available for both species table 2 3 reproduction missing for prey table 3 4 capture recapture missing for prey table 4 the scenario 1 helps to verify that the statistical model is working properly when all the information is available scenario 2 is then helpful to pinpoint identifiability issues whenever only counts are available in scenario 3 predators are assumed to be easier to monitor both species undergo capture recapture whilst prey reproduction is unknown in scenario 4 predators are assumed to be easier to monitor whilst prey capture recapture data are not possible to obtain comparison of the last two scenarios will be useful to assess the value of a costly capture recapture program for prey monitoring the four scenarios are crossed with two population monitoring durations t 10 years and t 30 years assuming the time unit is a year we assumed that 100 juvenile individuals are marked each year for t 10 and 20 juvenile individuals are marked each year for t 30 for both species therefore t 30 is not merely more data but a different observational design the capture recapture study design implicitly assumes that it is easier to mark the predator because they are less numerous than prey and the numbers of juveniles marked therefore represent a higher fraction of the predator population the annual number of surveyed broods in set to 20 for the predator and 50 for the prey hence for both species fecundity is sampled only for a fraction of the population table 5 describes all other models parameters that have been used for simulation for scenarios 2 and 4 the fitted models are without capture recapture in scenario 4 only for the prey we kept a probability of capture in the code but it has nearly equal priors and posteriors and cannot affect other estimates it only enters the capture recapture submodel which is absent 4 results a typical simulation of the population counts for one model run together with their estimates under the fitted icm scenario 1 is presented in fig 2 we see that the predator and prey fitted trajectories match well the simulated trajectories this is in fact true in all scenarios not shown and probably attributable to the high dimensionality of icms during model fitting the algorithm always finds a combination of vital rates that at least match the count trajectories however reproducing the shape of density dependent relationships is a much harder task as we show below in the scenario 1 the statistical fit does also reproduce well the four density dependent vital rates eq 1 fig 3 show one typical statistical fit this is true for most simulations in scenario 1 however in the scenario 2 the fitted model could not reproduce density dependencies in many cases this bad match between simulated and fitted parameters in scenario 2 is made explicit by the examination of the bias and precision in α i estimates fig 4 note that fig 4 does not present bayesian credible intervals though these exist as well and we have examined them in fig 4 we summarize the information provided by each of the 100 simulations by keeping the posterior mean of the parameter α i which we denote α ˆ i presenting α ˆ i for many simulations allows us to study the properties of this estimator of α i in a similar manner to a frequentist study of the estimator bias is given by e α ˆ i α i and precision by the dispersion variance of α ˆ i we see that the count only scenario 2 generates large bias and low precision in particular for interaction parameters even indices for α i i 2 4 6 8 both scenarios 3 and 4 generate relatively good performances of the estimators for most α i interestingly scenario 4 has almost identical performance to scenario 1 almost the same precision fig 4 and similar bias which means that prey fecundity data is in fact of more value than prey capture recapture data at least for the parameters considered here to be thorough we have considered our second parameter set with stronger predator prey coupling α 5 0 5 α 6 0 01 α 7 1 5 and it shows similar results fig b 1 in appendix b the slight systematic bias that exists for α 5 in data scenarios 1 3 and 4 vanishes for this other parameter set this new parameter set also confirms the fact that scenario 4 is almost indistinguishable from scenario 1 the same figure for the simulated t 30 years observational study is presented in appendix b fig b 2 combining data types still improves model performances scenario 2 has the least precise estimates for most parameters however for t 30 we observe less precise interaction estimates for scenarios 1 3 and 4 α 2 α 4 or with a little more bias α 6 α 8 than for t 10 the benefits of capture recapture and fecundity data for the t 30 setting with a longer study but a less intense capture effort are a little lower than for t 10 this is logical and can be interpreted as a presence of proportionally more information in the counts for t 30 the scenario 4 still brings low bias and estimates of similar quality to scenario 1 which confirms the good behaviour of this observational design for a different capture effort and time series length 5 discussion building on integrated population modelling and combining it with nonlinear multispecies matrix models we have developed a predator prey integrated community model icm the density dependent relationships in the icm were designed to allow the model to persist for extended periods of time this implied to not only consider density dependent vital rates linking different species but also density dependencies within the same species this resulted in four density dependencies fig 3 the model was structured and parameterized to correspond to a stage structured predator prey system composed of relatively large birds and or mammals using simulations of the icm under contrasted data availability scenarios we found that for a moderate study duration 10 years the information contained within counts may be enough to reproduce the time series but not the density dependencies inference about interactions therefore requires either longer time series e g 30 years or much more which are often not available to practitioners or a combination with other data types the combination of all data types yielded estimates of vital rates and interaction parameters density dependent slope parameters that had low bias and good precision especially when compared to count only estimates although our results are promising and definitely show that combining data sources can be worthwhile to estimate species joint dynamics much remains to be done we sketch below several areas for further research 5 1 identifiability of the predator prey icm we have shown that using all data types allowed estimating parameters with less bias and more precision weak identifiability sensu gimenez et al 2009 seemed approximately satisfied an additional question is whether there are some redundant parameters in the model cole and mccrea 2016 this issue can be explored to some degree using pairwise joint posterior plots appendix c see cole and mccrea 2016 for other ideas on how to pinpoint identifiability pair posterior densities show that parameters are pairwise uncorrelated unless they belong to the same density dependency function for instance we see that α 1 and α 2 correlate negatively in the posterior distributions appendix c these negative correlations between the two parameters of a single density dependency are a likely consequence of the parameterization of the model the overall shape of the density dependence curves can still remain unchanged using several parameter combinations whilst correlation between parameters as well as ridges in the likelihood or joint posterior distribution are in many cases worrying we show here that in this context negative correlation in the posteriors for parameters of the same density dependent curve is good rather than poor statistical behaviour the correlation produces more precise estimated density dependent relationships appendix c this could be explained by re parameterizing ϕ v p 1 1 exp α 3 α 4 n 1 1 exp γ n n n being the equilibrium population size we obtain α 3 γn and α 4 γ which produces a negative correlation assuming that γ is estimated less precisely than n we obtain the result a similar argument for negative correlations in the posteriors can be made for the fecundity parameters if f p n exp α 5 α 6 n then an increase of δ in α 5 will produce a decrease of nδ if f p is to stay approximately at the same value 5 2 refining the icm 5 2 1 saturating functional forms for density dependencies in the current model we consider a potentially unlimited increase in the predator fecundity accelerating relationship for the range of parameter values that we considered this poses no problem because both prey and predator densities stay within reasonable bounds but if the model is fitted or simulated in other contexts this could become problematic a surge in prey abundance would then allow for completely unrealistic predator fecundities an avenue for improvement is therefore to implement a saturating predator fecundity i e f p n v j α 5 1 exp α 6 n v j so far all our attempts to do this ended with some notable bias on α 6 appendix d with the model estimating a flat rather than decelerating predator fecundity clearly more work in that area is needed 5 2 2 observation error on the counts in this article our fitted models did not include observation error on the counts we actually planned to do so and our computer code allows this observation error to be implemented but we found out through preliminary model fits that an unknown information error seems to induce major identifiability issues the trajectories of predator and prey counts can still be reproduced when a poorly estimated observation error is present but the density dependent functions cannot in other words the model then produces good in sample forecasts but for the wrong reasons all α i values are estimated with strong bias in this case including when all data types are used our model belong to the general family of state space models or ssms newman et al 2014 and as such suffers from the same difficulties in implementing unknown observation errors in such models indeed several modelling studies have reported that unknown observation errors in ssms in absence of multiple samples per time step see in this case dennis et al 2010 can be quite problematic without prior information observation error variances are often poorly identified which then creates bias in other estimates knape 2008 lebreton and gimenez 2013 auger méthé et al 2016 certain et al 2018 such biases are likely to be even stronger if the dynamics contains large fluctuations especially chaotic ones and more refined model fitting techniques may have to be employed wood 2010 hartig and dormann 2013 unless the observation error on the counts is known to some degree e g because counts are estimated by a method reporting that error such as distance sampling and can be specified as an informative prior given the already high complexity of icms we suggest to neglect it however if some degree of replication within a time step is available it may be possible to estimate it dennis et al 2010 we note in passing that although assuming an observation error on the counts is customary in population ecology and we have followed this modelling tradition here there is no special reason to think that counting animals is more subject to error than resighting or fecundity estimation e g this may be true for ringed birds but not necessarily for mammals identified by fur patterns decision of including observation error on counts or not in a hierarchical model will therefore be best made on a case by case basis 5 2 3 model structure we have considered for now a pre breeding census mpm for the icm however we have also written out a post breeding census version of the nonlinear matrix model with a juvenile stage duration of potentially multiple years appendix e comparison of the timing of censuses and events implied by the two versions of the model pre vs post breeding e g cooch et al 2003 has revealed that only minor differences in interpretation are involved this may be partly because our model where vital rates are related to densities by nonlinear phenomenological functions does not rely on explicit biomass conversion of prey into predators i e litteral conversion of killed prey into newborn predators zhou et al 2013 suggested that such discrete time systems with biomass conversion might be more stable because of the ordering of events assuming that predation occurs before reproduction however even though event ordering reproduction vs survival can affect stability in these models census timing may not weide et al 2018 show that for models with explicit biomass conversion census timing only imply minor quantitative differences in model outputs for difference equations major qualitative differences only occur between models that assume biomass conversion to happen before reproduction more stable or after more oscillating as shown by weide et al 2018 a post breeding census model brings our framework closer to a multi species version of the density dependent models of neubert and caswell 2000 this formulation which we use for ongoing theoretical work was more internally consistent appendix e but also more difficult to adapt directly in the ipm framework which we adapted from previous equations and existing computer code for pre breeding census models abadi et al 2012 on empirical grounds both pre breeding and post breeding model can make sense depending on the timing of the census if there are only two classes juveniles and adults in both the pre and post breeding census version the corresponding individual based community model can be described by a sequences of stochastic events involving only poisson and binomial distributions appendix e binomial for death rates and poisson for recruitment there is a good mapping between the icm and the fully explicit stochastic ibm because the binomial sampling of a poisson distributed count still follows a poisson distribution and the binomial sampling of a binomial distributed count is still a binomial distribution however real recruitment distributions might have added variance e g zero inflated poisson or negative binomial and these may be considered in future icm work it is possible to extend the formulation of our model so that juveniles are able to stay several years within the juvenile class appendix e this may be a useful first step to model a longer lived juvenile stage i e more than a year indeed using more than two classes requires to use multinomial distributions for transitions watkins 2000 which amounts to specify the community level ibm as a multi type density dependent branching process haccou et al 2005 instead of using poisson and binomial random variates as in section 2 2 1 this adds considerable complexity to the stochastic model and is left for further work another layer of complexity that we have not tackled here is spatial structure the spatial structure itself can contain information about interactions although power can be an issue with spatial only data rajala et al 2018 spatio temporal data could be of great use in helping to identify interactions if only count data are spatial counts might become increasingly important in identifying the model potentially changing some of the results that we show here tredennick et al 2017 show for instance that demographic data might not be needed to predict spatiotemporal quadrat level plant community dynamics with that in mind it is also important to realize that for many birds and mammals count data are usually scarce and the spatial scales at which a count value can be defined can be very large so that spatial replication in count data might be very hard to achieve in some cases it might even be easier to obtain spatially dependent survival or recruitment data since those can be individual based chandler and clark 2014 5 2 4 more intricate or challenging dynamics we have considered thus far that the predator prey system exhibited a fixed point equilibrium a consequence of slow bird and mammal life histories and predation on juveniles only with added noise due to demographic stochasticity section 2 2 1 there is therefore only a moderate signal in the counts themselves changing parameters could allow for cycles or chaos to develop neubert and caswell 2000 wikan 2001 which could then provide more signal and make the count information more relevant at least for long time series both neubert and caswell 2000 and wikan 2001 have shown that these dynamics tend to occur for large fecundities different systems than birds and mammals involving for example fishes or plants might therefore have much wilder fluctuations we confirm this for our model in appendix a however a more fluctuating model can also be tricky to estimate because there can be multiple causation of oscillations e g interactions of stochasticity and age structure greenman and benton 2004 barraquand et al 2017 it is therefore unclear what changing completely the range of parameters in this model e g considering much faster life histories would do to the quality of parameter estimates in the icm aside from changing parameters one neat way to produce wilder dynamics would be to allow for predation on adults this can be done phenomenologically rather than mechanistically by simply having an adult prey survival rate that depends on predator adult density other options are proposed by zhou et al 2013 and weide et al 2018 this would allow for predator prey cycles we have seen this in explorations of the nonlinear matrix model but we note that we would need to change the time frames of simulation considered e g 30 100 years in order to see well these long period cycles such time frames may be useful to model long term ecological studies for which there is an historical time series of counts say 100 years at the end of which we perform capture recapture and fecundity estimation during say 10 or 20 years this fits relatively well the data that could be obtained on lynx and hare krebs et al 2018 another worthy exploration would be interaction estimates when there are actually no true linkages between the species population dynamics i e no interaction at all not even unmodelled indirect interactions in the present article we asked how different data combinations may or may not allow the model to recover interactions that are known to be present this fits well predator prey pairs for which there is prior knowledge about potential impacts of predators on their prey which is clearly the situation we placed ourselves in however for less well understood ecological configurations there is always a risk of error in assessing who interacts with whom and the question of what the icm would infer if two species have in fact independent dynamics may be paramount we think that such cases would be especially relevant when predator diet is poorly known or in a competition context as it can be difficult to evaluate whether or not two species truly share a similar niche 5 3 suggestions for empirical surveys aiming at parameterizing multi species models we would like to finally conclude on what data should be collected in the field if the aim is to parameterize multi species and stage structured dynamic models our results show first that longer time frames are not necessarily best assuming that there is a trade off between study duration and capture effort per year especially for vertebrates this is because 30 years of counts alone contain limited information to parameterize high dimensional models barraquand and nielsen 2018 and capture recapture and reproduction data add much needed independent information on parameters moreover for the parameter values that we considered tuned to birds and mammals a prey fecundity survey brought more precision to interaction and vital rate estimates than a capture recapture survey top predators are usually well studied notably due to conservation concerns but their more abundant prey could be difficult costly to follow through capture recapture and be simply counted our results suggests that a prey fecundity survey adds much value probably at a small fraction of the cost of a capture recapture program in a bayesian framework a priori knowledge on some of those parameters can also be gained from the mpm databases salguero gómez et al 2016 which will be especially important for poorly studied species which parameter s should be set with prior information will then depend on a trade off between the degree of phylogenetic conservatism of the parameter che castaldo et al 2018 and the ease which with the information can be collected in the field adult survival is a good target costly to infer probably fairly conserved between related species and the analyses that we performed could be attempted again using a mixture of real data and database derived a priori

fixed point for our first parameter set table 5 in main text and second parameter set with changed parameters α 5 0 5 α 6 0 01 α 7 1 5 see also appendix b demographic stochasticity does generate more or less fluctuations around this fixed point though fig a 1 b and d the stability of this model in the lyapunov sense cf kot 2001 for example is lost when intra specific density dependencies are removed fig a 2 where trajectories show diverging oscillations we now present different dynamics obtained by increasing maximal fecundity to exp 5 for parameter set 1 and exp 4 5 for parameter 2 in fig a 3 the model produces oscillations likely invariant loops or chaos more detailed investigations would be needed to distinguish between those for a mathematical investigation of similar dynamics see for instance wikan 2001 the stochastic versions are also oscillating fig a 3 b unless the high predator prey coupling generates extinction when combined to the demographic stochasticity small prey numbers and sampling create extinction fig a 3 d appendix b additional estimates of alpha parameters b 1 results for the second parameter set the second parameter set that we considered differed from the first by the following α 5 0 5 α 6 0 01 α 7 1 5 which generated a stronger predator prey coupling b 2 results for the t 30 years observational design appendix c identifiability diagnostics the following plots describe the joint posterior distribution for pairs of parameters based on two mcmc chains considerable linkage between the parameters that belong to the same density dependent relationship are visible these manifest as an elongated ellipsoid instead of a circle shaped joint posterior for the pair we present these diagnostic plots for t 10 fig c 1 scenario 1 fig c 2 scenario 2 and t 30 fig c 3 scenario 1 fig c 4 scenario 2 for t 10 we have good convergence gelman and rubin s r 1 1 for t 30 convergence and chain mixing are less good which generates some bimodality on these posterior graphs the persistent correlation in the posterior distribution of α 1 α 2 α 3 α 4 etc for scenario 1 can be shown to have very little detrimental effect on the shape of the curves fig c 5 the correlation between parameters even contributes to increase the precision of the curve since randomizing shuffling both vectors for α 3 and α 4 independently decreases the precision of the curve fig c 6 in fig c 6 the inflection point of the curve is in fact less marked than in fig c 5 that incorporates the correlation in the joint posterior appendix d nonlinear predator fecundity we

fit for other relationships figs d 3 and d 4 but did not correct the problem of flat estimation of predator fecundity appendix e pre and post breeding census model for γ 1 e 1 pre and post breeding matrix model for γ 1 the general equation of our nonlinear matrix model is 7 n t 1 a n t n t for the counts of the two species and two stages per species with a n t 1 γ v ϕ v j n p a t 1 2 f v n v a t

main text these two formulations with different census dates lead interestingly to slightly different versions of the corresponding stochastic individual based model ibm we provide below a full derivation for the ibm e 2 order of events in the stochastic ibm all events can be ordered on a time arrow by introducing an intermediate time t between t and t 1 see also cooch et al 2003 weide et al 2018 we consider first the post breeding census scenario post breeding census we assume that before census reproduction occurs at some time t reasonably close to t 1 at time t starts the survival phase for both stages we will derive the ibm for the prey population dynamics we have the update equation for juvenile prey population size at time t 1 n v j t 1 n t b t 1 x t 1 jv where x t 1 jv is the number of juveniles born in the previous time period that survive up to t 1 it therefore includes all the juveniles from the previous time period that 1 have survived survival happens first 2 have not transitioned to adulthood transition happens second because t is very close to t 1 post breeding census we can neglect the survival fraction of juveniles of the year so that b t 1 b t and b t p 1 2 f v n v a t on the other hand we have the number of individuals staying juveniles after t x t 1 jv b x t jv 1 γ v and finally the number of survivors from n v j t x t jv b n v j t ϕ v j n p a t so that x t 1 jv b n v j t 1 γ v ϕ v j n p a t this follows from the fact that if x y b y p and y b n q then x b n pq let us denote x t 1 av the individuals that have matured to adulthood between t and t 1 then x t 1 av n v j t x t jv as we subtract from the previous population size of juveniles individuals that have not maturated 1 1 this important step is modelled simply using a binomial distribution because we have two stages with more stages it would require a multinomial distribution see watkins 2000 for details the number of adults at the next iteration is then obtained as n v a t 1 n t z t 1 av x t 1 av where z t 1 av b n v a t ϕ v a the prey part of the stochastic ibm is now fully specified similar arguments follow for the predator compartment the time ordering in this model means that from the prey point of view predation happen on juveniles born in the previous year if γ 1 these would be between a few months and a little more than a year old predation occurs continuously during the long survival phase birth is always in such discrete time models a pulse event i e occurring at once or almost at a given time t for the predator population dynamics predator reproduction which happens at t as well is driven by the abundance of the juvenile at the beginning of the survival process starting at t predator reproduction is therefore very much influenced by the prey individuals born last year the prey and predator parts of the model are therefore consistent pre breeding census now we consider a pre breeding census for which the time arrow is slightly differently organised with birth at t right after census at t as in the previous derivation we consider that the juvenile population size at time t 1 is given by the following update equation n v j t 1 n t b t 1 x t 1 jv this translates the fact that juveniles are composed of both newborns and surviving juveniles that did not mature between t and t 1 the difference now for the pre breeding census is that there is a long period during which the juveniles of the year need to survive so that b t 1 b t in fact b t 1 b b t ϕ v j n p a t with a production of chicks at t b t p 1 2 f v n v a t this leads to a marginal distribution of b t 1 b t 1 p 1 2 f v n v a t ϕ v j n p a t indeed if x y b y p and y p λ then x p p λ here predation modelled through the predator dependence of juvenile survival occurs as well on juveniles of the year 2 2 assuming that the year is defined by the change in year t of course which may be equivalent to start it around january with breeding occurring early in the spring so eggs or young chicks the surviving juveniles from the previous year are given by x t 1 jv b x t jv ϕ v j n p a t themselves picked from the individuals that did not mature x t jv b n v j t 1 γ v so that x t 1 jv b x t jv 1 γ v ϕ v j n p a t for the adults n v a t 1 n t z t 1 av x t 1 av with surviving old adults z t 1 av b n v a t ϕ v a and new adults x t 1 av b x t av ϕ v a this is because right after t x t av is the number of the individuals entering the adult compartment the transitioning adults are obtained with the equation x t av n v j t 1 x t jv as they are picked from the pool of previous juveniles this eventually leads to after a few simplifications x t 1 av b n v j t γ v ϕ v a similar arguments can be brought up for the predator because only the predator reproduction rate is affected by prey density at t in the predator submodel and predator reproduction occurs right at t predators are assumed to depend for reproduction on prey individuals born in the previous time step e 2 1 ecological consequences of the modelling assumptions from the predator reproduction perspective both post and pre breeding models are similar and predator depend for reproduction on individuals largely born the year before from the prey perspective the post breeding model assumes that older juvenile individuals born the year before suffer predation whilst the pre breeding model assumes that all prey including newborns suffer predation the post breeding model may therefore be a little more internally consistent only the older juveniles affect predator reproduction and predator only affect older juvenile survival not newborns however the pre breeding model where predator reproduction only depends on individuals born in the previous year but predation also impacts newborns is not unrealistic as well predators that reproduce on large juvenile individuals can also eat eggs or very young chicks for their basic sustenance 
24984,ecosystem models typically assume additive effects of predation and other natural mortality rates in prediction of net production for forage fishes resulting in prediction of substantial increase in forage fish production when predator abundances are reduced but if vulnerability to predation is determined by stress factors like hunger and parasite loads that would result in higher mortality rates of vulnerable forage fish individuals even if predators were removed there may be little decrease in forage fish natural mortality rates and hence little or no increase in net production rates we propose a vulnerability exchange model to account for such effects and this model predicts that under such conditions there may be little or no increase in forage fish productivity when predator abundances are reduced we present a case study of harbour seal predation on chinook and coho salmon which underlines that uncertainty about additive mortality is important for evaluating alternative hypotheses of direct predation and indirect environmental impacts the new model formulation will be implemented as an option in the ecopath with ecosim modelling approach and software keyword top down control predator control predation mortality additive mortality pinniped impact foraging arena 1 introduction ecosystem models that account for trophic interaction effects on prey e g forage fish mortality rates typically represent mortality rates as a sum of independent or additive component rates with a rate component for each predator type species size that is determined by prey and predator abundances and with some constant non predation or other mortality component such formulations ignore the strong possibility that prey individuals taken by predators are vulnerable to predation because of behavioral or physiological stress factors e g hunger parasite or disease load physiological effects of aging and or spawning that would kill a high proportion of the vulnerable individuals even if predators did not take them the existence of such stress factors and concentration of both predation and other mortality on individuals made vulnerable by them implies that mortality rate components should not be treated as additive parasites and pathogens in particular may exert strong regulatory effects on trophic interactions in general and predation mortality rates in particular hatcher et al 2012 krkošek 2017 sures et al 2017 another key stress factor leading to increased predation vulnerability may be contaminant loading gray et al 2006 explicit representation of how such stress factors can lead to increased mortality could lead to more realistic and useful models in cases where such effects are now represented by ad hoc approaches e g to starvation rates and quadratic mortality terms representing increasing mortality rate at higher abundances the assumption of additive predation mortality rate impacts on forage fish in particular results in predictions of substantial increase in surplus production of these small fish when piscivore abundances are reduced through fishing or appropriation of forage fish production by fisheries since a high proportion of the forage fish natural mortality rate is typically estimated to be due to predation see e g engelhard et al 2014 koehn et al 2016 this increase in predicted net production e g szuwalski et al 2017 walters et al 2005 occurs in both simple biomass dynamics models like ecosim walters et al 1997 and in more detailed size spectrum models jacobsen et al 2015 2019 scott et al 2014 and is a key reason for predicted increases in yield under balanced harvesting policies garcia et al 2012 here we propose a simple model based on the vulnerability exchange equations used in ecosim to represent foraging arena limitations on predation rates ahrens et al 2012 walters et al 1997 to account for non additive mortality effects we show that surplus production rate predictions for forage fish using this model can result in much weaker predicted responses of production rate to decreases in predator abundances than are now obtained with models like ecosim or size spectrum models we propose a simple way to represent non additivity hypotheses in ecosim and use an empirical example involving possible non additive effects of pinniped predation on juvenile chinook and coho salmon in the georgia strait british columbia to demonstrate how uncertain predictions of impact of changing predator abundance can be if measured predation rates are in fact limited by stress factors that would cause high mortality rates even if predator abundances were much reduced 2 vulnerability exchange model for predation and other mortality rates there are at least two alternative approaches to prediction of biomass flow rate along any ecosystem model link between a prey biomass component species size b and a predator biomass component species size p fig 1 in the mass action or spatially mixed approach used in existing size spectrum models and other approaches like the essington and munch 2014 equilibrium perturbation model flow to the predator consumption rate as mass per time is assumed proportional to prey biomass and predator biomass with proportionality constant pa where a is the predator rate of effective search and p is the proportion of time spent searching by the predator if the predator is assumed to have a type ii functional response where handling time may limit its feeding rate holling 1959 p is assumed to vary with the abundances bi of all prey types taken by the predator type as 1 p 1 1 h i a i b i where h is handling time lost from searching per unit of prey biomass consumed in the foraging arena or vulnerability exchange model prey are assumed to move or flow between invulnerable and vulnerable behavioral states at instantaneous rates v and v with predation and stress related loss rates predicted to occur only from the vulnerable biomass component v existing ecosim models assume this structure for all trophic links with the stress related mortality rate vs set to 0 and with the exchange process assumed to be created either by restricted predator activity mixing of prey into and out of restricted spatial areas foraging arenas where predators forage or by restricted prey activity where prey become vulnerable through foraging activities that force them to leave invulnerable refuge habitats walters et al 1997 walters and juanes 1993 in fig 1 we have added a direct stress related mortality component vsv to represent the possibility that the flow rate v b v into vulnerable states represents not just prey and predator foraging restrictions but also or only the rate at which prey become vulnerable through the action of stress agents like growing parasite loads and contraction of diseases to instantaneous mortality rate vs when v arises from such stressors v represents recovery rate due to processes like parasite shedding and recovery from disease whether or not there is a direct stress related mortality rate component dynamics of vulnerable biomass v can be represented by the continuous rate model 2 d v d t v b v v p a p v s v if the vulnerability exchange process is relatively rapid compared to rates of change in b i e if the instantaneous loss rate v pap vs is large then predicted v will vary with b so as to remain near the moving equilibrium given by setting dv dt 0 and solving eq 2 for v i e by 3 v v b v v p a p v s that is v will be proportional to b and inversely proportional to v plus the total instantaneous loss rate note that eq 3 predicts a maximum total biomass flow rate to predation and stress mortality pap vs v to have an upper bound vb i e a maximum rate set by how rapidly the prey become vulnerable to p and stress further it predicts that the flow rate to the predator papv should be inversely related to the stress mortality rate vs and the direct flow rate to stress mortality vsv should be inversely related to predator abundance p i e the two mortality rate components should not be independent of one another this tradeoff between mortality components can be very severe if both pap and vs are large fig 2 if we compare instantaneous mortality rates mp due to predator p for the mass action and vulnerability exchange formulations as in fig 2 where mp mass eaten per time total prey biomass we obtain very different predictions about how mp should vary with predator abundance 4a m a s s a c t i o n m o d e l m p p a p 4b v u l n e r a b i l i t y e x c h a n g e m o d e l m p p a p v b p a p v v v p a p v s that is we predict mortality rate to be additive to other mortality rate components and proportional to predator abundance only for cases where the prey are fully vulnerable to predation at all times and are not subject to stress related mortality i e for cases where v is very large and vs 0 for the vulnerability exchange case we predict the total instantaneous mortality rate for the b p flow link to vary as 5 m t o t a l p a p v s v b p a p v s v v v p a p v s for which the mortality flow components papv and vsv are very obviously not additive because of their joint interacting effect on v 3 predicted impact of reduced predator abundances on forage fish surplus production to examine how forage fish surplus production rates should vary when mtotal from eq 5 is used to predict the joint effects of predation and stress suppose we now consider a simple case where there is only a single aggregate predator abundance p and or all species size components of the total predation rate are assumed to covary so as to generate a single overall rate that is proportional to the sum of the predator biomass components suppose further that we assume the dynamics of b to involve a production recruitment component that can be adequately described by a beverton holt recruitment function minus a non predation mortality rate mob minus the total rate mtotalb predicted by eq 5 here mo is the direct non predation mortality rate as mtotal include indirect effects of disease stress contributions under these assumptions the dynamics of b are given by 6 d b d t r m a x b b h b m 0 m t o t a l b where rmax is maximum production rate mass time bh is the forage fish biomass needed to achieve ½ of this maximum rate and mtotal is given for varying p by eq 5 note in eq 6 that db dt represents the surplus production rate of the forage fish population very different patterns of variation in the surplus production vs biomass relationship are predicted by eq 6 depending on how predation and stress mortality is represented fig 3 for the mass action case mtotal pap and for vulnerability exchange dynamics without stress factor removal from the vulnerable biomass v eq 6 predicts substantial increase in surplus production when p is reduced but when mtotal includes a high mortality rate due to stress when p is low as in fig 2 there is almost no response of the predicted surplus production relationship due to reduction in predator abundance note that the patterns predicted in fig 3 depend importantly on the assumption that foraging time proportion p is stable i e that either there are no handling time effects or that b is a relatively small proportion of the total prey abundance that contributes to predator handling time when search time does increase substantially at low b there can be severe depensatory effects that cause reduced or even negative surplus production rates when prey biomass is low 4 simple approximation for non additive mortality effects in ecosim it would be a complex conceptual and programming task to fully represent non additive mortality patterns like the example in fig 1 in ecosim models because of issues about partitioning ecopath base unexplained mortality mo and whether to assume different stress related vulnerability and mortality patterns for each of many predator prey trophic links in typical ecosim models however the same basic effect as shown in the third panel of fig 3 can be obtained simply by first calculating the ecosim predicted predation mortality rate summed over predator types at each time step then adding a component to mo so as to prevent the total apparent predation mortality rate from decreasing to less than a user defined minimum proportion of the ecopath base predation mortality rate this simple convention allows users to explore alternative hypotheses about how much mo would increase in scenarios where total predator abundance is reduced using a single parameter proportion of base predation mortality rate when predation rate is 0 0 to represent hidden non additive stress factor effects effects of such a minimum mortality constraint on the predicted surplus production biomass relationship for the same parameter values used in fig 3 is shown in fig 4 setting the minimum hidden predation rate to 0 8 times the ecopath base rate causes the predicted surplus production pattern to look almost exactly like the full non additive mortality pattern in the bottom panel of fig 3 i e to predict very little increase in surplus production when predator abundance is low as the ratio of minimum to ecopath base apparent predation mortality rate is reduced from 0 8 to lower values for the fig 4 example the predicted surplus production pattern shifts to equal the pattern predicted in the middle panel of fig 3 as the ratio approaches zero we caution against using this single parameter approach just to generate multispecies scenarios where trophic interaction effects are omitted entirely by setting the additive proportion very low just to conform with single species modeling theory and experience 5 case study of uncertainty about additive mortality impact of harbour seal predation on chinook and coho salmon since the late 1970s there have been severe declines in first ocean year survival rates of coho oncorhynchus kisutch and chinook salmon oncorhynchus tschawytscha in the salish sea georgia strait in british columbia and puget sound in washington as measured by coded wire tagging and recovery for a variety of stocks ruff et al 2017 zimmerman et al 2015 resulting in a decline of roughly 90 in the number of smolts reaching harvestable ages from both hatchery and wild populations over this same period the harbour seal phoca vitulina population has increased from a few thousand to 40 000 50 000 olesiuk 2010 first year total mortality rates m measured as ln survival rates as recommended by bradford 1995 have increased by roughly 2 0 for both species and are strongly correlated with seal abundance fig 5 which would imply recent predation mortality rate mp near 2 0 if mortality rate caused by seals has been additive and proportional to seal abundance and if mortality rates due to other factors have not increased independent estimates of recent 2012 2013 seal mp from seal food consumption rates olesiuk 1993 diet compositions thomas et al 2017 and total smolt numbers hatchery plus wild are near 1 85 for both species seal proportion of total m estimated to be 0 46 for coho 0 39 for chinook so it is at least a credible assumption that most of the increase in m t has indeed been due to seal predation the correlation between m and seal abundance along with impact estimates from diet data have prompted calls for a commercial harvesting or culling program to reduce seal abundances by about 50 which the additive predation models predict fig 4 black lines would reduce m by about 1 0 implying improvement of e1 0 in survival rates and hence 2 7 times increase in the number of smolts reaching harvestable ages this effect on chinook abundance in particular would be much larger than proposed fishery

virulence mortality rate vs of such stress agents we can use the observed increases in total m t to back calculate changes in v simply by solving eq 5 for v while setting mtotal to the observed increases δm t m t mo setting p t to estimated seal abundance for each year t and adjusting pa to give mp 2 0 for recent years 7 v t m v p a p t v s δ m p a p t v s for this back calculation of apparent changes in v we set v 20 to which the estimates are not sensitive and varied vs from zero to 100 representing survival of infected vulnerable fish for only a few days the resulting pattern of change in apparent v t is very obviously correlated strongly with measured sea surface temperatures fig 6 for higher vs values 10 or larger if we then predict v t from the linear regression relationship in fig 6 between v and temperature and use these v t in eq 5 to predict changes in disease ms and seal predation mp rates we obtain total m t mo ms mp predictions that closely track observed increases in m t for high virulence vs 100 we predict much less decrease in m t with future decreases in seal abundance than with the additive model fig 5 but note that even if vs is as high as 10 the predicted reduction in total morality rate due to seal reduction is close to that predicted by the additive predation model i e the stress factor that causes increasing v t must also kill fish very quickly once they enter the vulnerable state v in order that additive effects of predation be much lower than expected from the additive mortality model we have attempted to obtain independent estimates of the seal rate of effective search a and proportion of time spent foraging from information on seal foraging patterns swimming speeds and likely reactive distances to prey nelson et al in prep these estimates of pa are nowhere near as high as would be required if vulnerable juvenile salmon densities v are as low as eq 5 predicts for high vs values i e high vs implies i e mp should be much lower than estimated from diet data given reasonable estimates of pa this argument lends credibility to the predictions in fig 5 of relatively large decreases in m t if seal abundance is reduced but despite such calculations we cannot rule out the possibility that there are non additive mortality agents that are not well represented by the vulnerability exchange framework of fig 1 that would cause coho and chinook salmon mortality rates to remain high despite seal reductions this means that the proposed seal reduction program should be viewed as an adaptive management experiment walters 1986 with a highly uncertain outcome that needs to be monitored closely through continued coded wire tagging to measure m t 6 discussion it is a very old idea in ecology going back at least to errington 1946 that predators may take mainly weak sick and old animals and that it therefore may be perilous to assume that predator control will increase productivity of valuable prey species in terms of modern terminology about top down predation versus bottom up prey productivity control of trophic interactions low values of the vulnerability exchange rate parameter v in the model presented above imply stronger bottom up control of predator abundances while high v values imply at least the possibility of strong top down control but with the caveat that high vs values may invalidate predictions based just on v and on predator abundance our models warn not to expect correct or reliable assessments of relative importance of top down vs bottom up effects from correlative studies of abundance variation over time e g boyce et al 2015 lynam et al 2017 ye and carocci 2019 because of possible interactive effects of predation and bottom up habitat factors like temperature as we estimate to be possible for the salmon example in evaluation of evidence about the relative importance of top down effects we should focus mainly on cases where there have been deliberate manipulations of top down effects e g borer et al 2006 mcclanahan et al 2011 that would reveal existence of vs effects if such effects are indeed present this warning holds as well for those rare cases where we have direct estimates of variation in natural mortality rates m over time from data such as survey relative abundances at age or tagging as in the salmon case good correlations of m with predator abundance do not imply top down control when stress factors have changed over time in patterns correlated with predator abundance modern molecular techniques offer considerable promise to screen for gene activation patterns gene expression profiles indicative of stress and hence to directly measure v and v i e whether the prey taken by predators are indeed mainly those that are stressed particularly by diseases e g jeffries et al 2014 miller et al 2014 tucker et al 2018 but unfortunately such techniques do not provide direct measures of the virulence of the stress factors i e of the direct stress mortality and recovery rate parameters vs and v predation impacts may still be essentially additive components of total m if vs is low another way to examine the credibility of hypotheses about non additive predation impacts is to compare estimates of predator rates of effective search a implied by high vs low v models with direct estimates of rates of search based on predator characteristics such direct estimates can be obtained from basic information on predator movement speeds reactive distances to prey and proportions of time spent foraging combined with information on the effective area or volume over which the search is distributed for the juvenile salmon seal example such calculations suggest much lower a parameter values for seals than would be necessary to explain the data under high vs assumptions as data sets accumulate with age specific survey estimates of abundance from which temporal variation in total natural mortality rate m can be estimated we will also be able to directly compare observed changes in m with predictions from additive predation models and direct estimates of search rates seeing lower slopes in m vs predator abundance plots than predicted under additive predation would be evidence of high stress dependent mortality rates vs as in the fig 2 example continued climate change will quite possibility result in substantial changes in trophic interaction patterns lynam et al 2017 through hidden effects due to temperature related changes in v and vs e g increases in disease expression or physiological impact but such changes may be masked when stressed individuals are rapidly removed by predators so as to only exert increasing effects when various factors like fishing lead to predator abundance declines this means that climate change is quite likely to produce some very nasty surprises that we will not anticipate through ecosystem models built around simplistic assumptions about additivity of mortality components nor can we be confident that simpler models based on statistical or correlative historical data will somehow give better predictions early versions of the ecopath with ecosim

24984,ecosystem models typically assume additive effects of predation and other natural mortality rates in prediction of net production for forage fishes resulting in prediction of substantial increase in forage fish production when predator abundances are reduced but if vulnerability to predation is determined by stress factors like hunger and parasite loads that would result in higher mortality rates of vulnerable forage fish individuals even if predators were removed there may be little decrease in forage fish natural mortality rates and hence little or no increase in net production rates we propose a vulnerability exchange model to account for such effects and this model predicts that under such conditions there may be little or no increase in forage fish productivity when predator abundances are reduced we present a case study of harbour seal predation on chinook and coho salmon which underlines that uncertainty about additive mortality is important for evaluating alternative hypotheses of direct predation and indirect environmental impacts the new model formulation will be implemented as an option in the ecopath with ecosim modelling approach and software keyword top down control predator control predation mortality additive mortality pinniped impact foraging arena 1 introduction ecosystem models that account for trophic interaction effects on prey e g forage fish mortality rates typically represent mortality rates as a sum of independent or additive component rates with a rate component for each predator type species size that is determined by prey and predator abundances and with some constant non predation or other mortality component such formulations ignore the strong possibility that prey individuals taken by predators are vulnerable to predation because of behavioral or physiological stress factors e g hunger parasite or disease load physiological effects of aging and or spawning that would kill a high proportion of the vulnerable individuals even if predators did not take them the existence of such stress factors and concentration of both predation and other mortality on individuals made vulnerable by them implies that mortality rate components should not be treated as additive parasites and pathogens in particular may exert strong regulatory effects on trophic interactions in general and predation mortality rates in particular hatcher et al 2012 krkošek 2017 sures et al 2017 another key stress factor leading to increased predation vulnerability may be contaminant loading gray et al 2006 explicit representation of how such stress factors can lead to increased mortality could lead to more realistic and useful models in cases where such effects are now represented by ad hoc approaches e g to starvation rates and quadratic mortality terms representing increasing mortality rate at higher abundances the assumption of additive predation mortality rate impacts on forage fish in particular results in predictions of substantial increase in surplus production of these small fish when piscivore abundances are reduced through fishing or appropriation of forage fish production by fisheries since a high proportion of the forage fish natural mortality rate is typically estimated to be due to predation see e g engelhard et al 2014 koehn et al 2016 this increase in predicted net production e g szuwalski et al 2017 walters et al 2005 occurs in both simple biomass dynamics models like ecosim walters et al 1997 and in more detailed size spectrum models jacobsen et al 2015 2019 scott et al 2014 and is a key reason for predicted increases in yield under balanced harvesting policies garcia et al 2012 here we propose a simple model based on the vulnerability exchange equations used in ecosim to represent foraging arena limitations on predation rates ahrens et al 2012 walters et al 1997 to account for non additive mortality effects we show that surplus production rate predictions for forage fish using this model can result in much weaker predicted responses of production rate to decreases in predator abundances than are now obtained with models like ecosim or size spectrum models we propose a simple way to represent non additivity hypotheses in ecosim and use an empirical example involving possible non additive effects of pinniped predation on juvenile chinook and coho salmon in the georgia strait british columbia to demonstrate how uncertain predictions of impact of changing predator abundance can be if measured predation rates are in fact limited by stress factors that would cause high mortality rates even if predator abundances were much reduced 2 vulnerability exchange model for predation and other mortality rates there are at least two alternative approaches to prediction of biomass flow rate along any ecosystem model link between a prey biomass component species size b and a predator biomass component species size p fig 1 in the mass action or spatially mixed approach used in existing size spectrum models and other approaches like the essington and munch 2014 equilibrium perturbation model flow to the predator consumption rate as mass per time is assumed proportional to prey biomass and predator biomass with proportionality constant pa where a is the predator rate of effective search and p is the proportion of time spent searching by the predator if the predator is assumed to have a type ii functional response where handling time may limit its feeding rate holling 1959 p is assumed to vary with the abundances bi of all prey types taken by the predator type as 1 p 1 1 h i a i b i where h is handling time lost from searching per unit of prey biomass consumed in the foraging arena or vulnerability exchange model prey are assumed to move or flow between invulnerable and vulnerable behavioral states at instantaneous rates v and v with predation and stress related loss rates predicted to occur only from the vulnerable biomass component v existing ecosim models assume this structure for all trophic links with the stress related mortality rate vs set to 0 and with the exchange process assumed to be created either by restricted predator activity mixing of prey into and out of restricted spatial areas foraging arenas where predators forage or by restricted prey activity where prey become vulnerable through foraging activities that force them to leave invulnerable refuge habitats walters et al 1997 walters and juanes 1993 in fig 1 we have added a direct stress related mortality component vsv to represent the possibility that the flow rate v b v into vulnerable states represents not just prey and predator foraging restrictions but also or only the rate at which prey become vulnerable through the action of stress agents like growing parasite loads and contraction of diseases to instantaneous mortality rate vs when v arises from such stressors v represents recovery rate due to processes like parasite shedding and recovery from disease whether or not there is a direct stress related mortality rate component dynamics of vulnerable biomass v can be represented by the continuous rate model 2 d v d t v b v v p a p v s v if the vulnerability exchange process is relatively rapid compared to rates of change in b i e if the instantaneous loss rate v pap vs is large then predicted v will vary with b so as to remain near the moving equilibrium given by setting dv dt 0 and solving eq 2 for v i e by 3 v v b v v p a p v s that is v will be proportional to b and inversely proportional to v plus the total instantaneous loss rate note that eq 3 predicts a maximum total biomass flow rate to predation and stress mortality pap vs v to have an upper bound vb i e a maximum rate set by how rapidly the prey become vulnerable to p and stress further it predicts that the flow rate to the predator papv should be inversely related to the stress mortality rate vs and the direct flow rate to stress mortality vsv should be inversely related to predator abundance p i e the two mortality rate components should not be independent of one another this tradeoff between mortality components can be very severe if both pap and vs are large fig 2 if we compare instantaneous mortality rates mp due to predator p for the mass action and vulnerability exchange formulations as in fig 2 where mp mass eaten per time total prey biomass we obtain very different predictions about how mp should vary with predator abundance 4a m a s s a c t i o n m o d e l m p p a p 4b v u l n e r a b i l i t y e x c h a n g e m o d e l m p p a p v b p a p v v v p a p v s that is we predict mortality rate to be additive to other mortality rate components and proportional to predator abundance only for cases where the prey are fully vulnerable to predation at all times and are not subject to stress related mortality i e for cases where v is very large and vs 0 for the vulnerability exchange case we predict the total instantaneous mortality rate for the b p flow link to vary as 5 m t o t a l p a p v s v b p a p v s v v v p a p v s for which the mortality flow components papv and vsv are very obviously not additive because of their joint interacting effect on v 3 predicted impact of reduced predator abundances on forage fish surplus production to examine how forage fish surplus production rates should vary when mtotal from eq 5 is used to predict the joint effects of predation and stress suppose we now consider a simple case where there is only a single aggregate predator abundance p and or all species size components of the total predation rate are assumed to covary so as to generate a single overall rate that is proportional to the sum of the predator biomass components suppose further that we assume the dynamics of b to involve a production recruitment component that can be adequately described by a beverton holt recruitment function minus a non predation mortality rate mob minus the total rate mtotalb predicted by eq 5 here mo is the direct non predation mortality rate as mtotal include indirect effects of disease stress contributions under these assumptions the dynamics of b are given by 6 d b d t r m a x b b h b m 0 m t o t a l b where rmax is maximum production rate mass time bh is the forage fish biomass needed to achieve ½ of this maximum rate and mtotal is given for varying p by eq 5 note in eq 6 that db dt represents the surplus production rate of the forage fish population very different patterns of variation in the surplus production vs biomass relationship are predicted by eq 6 depending on how predation and stress mortality is represented fig 3 for the mass action case mtotal pap and for vulnerability exchange dynamics without stress factor removal from the vulnerable biomass v eq 6 predicts substantial increase in surplus production when p is reduced but when mtotal includes a high mortality rate due to stress when p is low as in fig 2 there is almost no response of the predicted surplus production relationship due to reduction in predator abundance note that the patterns predicted in fig 3 depend importantly on the assumption that foraging time proportion p is stable i e that either there are no handling time effects or that b is a relatively small proportion of the total prey abundance that contributes to predator handling time when search time does increase substantially at low b there can be severe depensatory effects that cause reduced or even negative surplus production rates when prey biomass is low 4 simple approximation for non additive mortality effects in ecosim it would be a complex conceptual and programming task to fully represent non additive mortality patterns like the example in fig 1 in ecosim models because of issues about partitioning ecopath base unexplained mortality mo and whether to assume different stress related vulnerability and mortality patterns for each of many predator prey trophic links in typical ecosim models however the same basic effect as shown in the third panel of fig 3 can be obtained simply by first calculating the ecosim predicted predation mortality rate summed over predator types at each time step then adding a component to mo so as to prevent the total apparent predation mortality rate from decreasing to less than a user defined minimum proportion of the ecopath base predation mortality rate this simple convention allows users to explore alternative hypotheses about how much mo would increase in scenarios where total predator abundance is reduced using a single parameter proportion of base predation mortality rate when predation rate is 0 0 to represent hidden non additive stress factor effects effects of such a minimum mortality constraint on the predicted surplus production biomass relationship for the same parameter values used in fig 3 is shown in fig 4 setting the minimum hidden predation rate to 0 8 times the ecopath base rate causes the predicted surplus production pattern to look almost exactly like the full non additive mortality pattern in the bottom panel of fig 3 i e to predict very little increase in surplus production when predator abundance is low as the ratio of minimum to ecopath base apparent predation mortality rate is reduced from 0 8 to lower values for the fig 4 example the predicted surplus production pattern shifts to equal the pattern predicted in the middle panel of fig 3 as the ratio approaches zero we caution against using this single parameter approach just to generate multispecies scenarios where trophic interaction effects are omitted entirely by setting the additive proportion very low just to conform with single species modeling theory and experience 5 case study of uncertainty about additive mortality impact of harbour seal predation on chinook and coho salmon since the late 1970s there have been severe declines in first ocean year survival rates of coho oncorhynchus kisutch and chinook salmon oncorhynchus tschawytscha in the salish sea georgia strait in british columbia and puget sound in washington as measured by coded wire tagging and recovery for a variety of stocks ruff et al 2017 zimmerman et al 2015 resulting in a decline of roughly 90 in the number of smolts reaching harvestable ages from both hatchery and wild populations over this same period the harbour seal phoca vitulina population has increased from a few thousand to 40 000 50 000 olesiuk 2010 first year total mortality rates m measured as ln survival rates as recommended by bradford 1995 have increased by roughly 2 0 for both species and are strongly correlated with seal abundance fig 5 which would imply recent predation mortality rate mp near 2 0 if mortality rate caused by seals has been additive and proportional to seal abundance and if mortality rates due to other factors have not increased independent estimates of recent 2012 2013 seal mp from seal food consumption rates olesiuk 1993 diet compositions thomas et al 2017 and total smolt numbers hatchery plus wild are near 1 85 for both species seal proportion of total m estimated to be 0 46 for coho 0 39 for chinook so it is at least a credible assumption that most of the increase in m t has indeed been due to seal predation the correlation between m and seal abundance along with impact estimates from diet data have prompted calls for a commercial harvesting or culling program to reduce seal abundances by about 50 which the additive predation models predict fig 4 black lines would reduce m by about 1 0 implying improvement of e1 0 in survival rates and hence 2 7 times increase in the number of smolts reaching harvestable ages this effect on chinook abundance in particular would be much larger than proposed fishery

apparent changes in v we set v 20 to which the estimates are not sensitive and varied vs from zero to 100 representing survival of infected vulnerable fish for only a few days the resulting pattern of

observed increases in m t for high virulence vs 100 we predict much less decrease in m t with future decreases in seal abundance than with the additive model fig 5 but note that even if vs is as high
