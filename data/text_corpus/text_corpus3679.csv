a real water matrix three single small ultraviolet c diodes emitting light at two different wavelengths were tested 255 nm that is similar to the wavelength emitted by low pressure mercury lamps and 265 nm that is closer to the maximum absorbance wavelength of dna the ultraviolet c diodes emitting light at 265 nm were found to be more effective than the 255 nm achieving 3 log 1 log and 5 log

they are mercury free and therefore don t lead to the production of mercury waste compact and robust have longer lifetimes do not need stabilization time lead to a low energy consumption and can be constructed with a diversity of wavelengths chatterley and linden 2010 hamamoto et al 2007 song et al 2016 so if proven effective they can replace low pressure mercury lamps some studies have already reported the use of different led wavelengths for the inactivation of different microorganisms in water sources beck et al 2017 nyangaresi et al 2018 song et al 2016 2018 2019 the choice of the wavelength in each study differs according to the purpose wavelengths in the uv c range 100 280 nm such as 254 255 nm 265 269 nm and around 280 nm are chosen to be compared with the conventional treatment that uses low pressure mercury lamps bowker et al 2011 due to the absorption spectra of dna oguma et al 2013 and proteins li et al 2017 rattanakul and oguma 2018 song et al 2019 respectively most of the experiments using uv leds that have been reported were conducted using bacteria and bacteriophages spiked on laboratory grade water or phosphate buffered saline solution to the best of our knowledge no study has been performed using filamentous fungi in real water sources chen et al 2009 used aspergillus niger inoculated into wood surfaces while murdoch et al 2013 and vesper et al 2008

been described to be potential pathogenic species oliveira et al 2013 parveen et al 2011 and might have different disinfection resistances due to the conidial protection mechanisms against uv radiation braga et al 2015 these defense mechanisms can be due to the existence of pigments such as melanins that absorb the uv light enzymes like catalases that reduce the reactive oxidation species formed during disinfection braga et al 2015 existence of a thick cell wall containing chitin mannan glucan and various lipids donnelly et al 2008 as well as dna repair mechanisms the aim of this study

compared with the plate count results additionally scan electron microscopy sem was used to evaluate phenotypically the effect of the different wavelengths on the spore s morphology 2 methods 2 1 inoculum preparation to perform this study three different species from the genus aspergillus aspergillus fumigatus a niger and a terreus were chosen due to their reported occurrence in different drinking water sources potential pathogenicity different color of their pigments and spores resistance babič et al 2017 braga et al 2015 oliveira et al 2013 parveen et al 2011 pereira et al 2009 aspergillus fumigatus a niger and a terreus were grown on malt extract agar merck usa for 7 days at 27 c after growth the mycelium was removed from the plates using a saline solution 0 90 w v of nacl with tween 80 0 10 v v the obtained pellet was washed three times with saline solution the washed pellet was then resuspended in 150 ml of the study matrices saline solution and surface water characterized in section 2 3 and the concentration of the spores was determined using the neubauer chamber this solution was designated as concentrated inoculum in this work the experiments were conducted after inoculation with a mixture of mycelium and spores collected from the petri dishes instead of only spores the reason for this choice is that the expected living forms of filamentous fungi in the aquatic environment are as a mixture of spores and mycelium to understand this a preliminary experiment was performed aspergillus fumigatus a niger and a terreus spores 108 spores ml were spiked separately into a real water matrix sterile untreated surface water with air flow to simulate agitation from surface water for 3 weeks sem images obtained as detailed in section 2 4 2 before and after the experimental time show that in the beginning as expected there were only spores but after 3 weeks both mycelium and spores were present in solution fig 1 based on these observations fig 1 a mixture of mycelium and spores were inoculated in the experiments conducted so that any interference from the mycelium in the inactivation e g scavenging of light would be taken into consideration however the spores were used to evaluate the inactivation rates 2 2 led reactor description the led reactor used in this study is a triple wavelength pearl beam reactor aquisense technologies usa that contains a triple wavelength uvinaire a control box a uv homogenizing tube and an ac dc adapter 12 v 90 w the selected wavelengths were 255 nm and 265 nm 3 leds for each wavelength with an average

perform the inactivation assays the concentrated inoculum prepared as described in section 2 1 was diluted to prepare fungal working solutions with a final concentration of 108 spores ml these fungal working solutions of 50 ml were placed in a specially designed petri dish with a double walled glass that enables the circulation of cold water to maintain the temperature constant at 20 c the petri dish was placed bellow the led plate with a distance from the leds to the sample top surface of 4 cm inactivation experiments were conducted in saline solution 0 90 w v of nacl and in filtered surface water untreated surface water was collected and used in inactivation experiments after filtration with a 0 22 μm membrane filter pall ny usa to simulate the treatment processes performed in drinking water treatment facilities both waters before and after filtration were characterized in terms of temperature ph using a microph 2002 crison spain total organic carbon standard method 5310b using a

hach lange lck 514 100 2000 mg l o2 kits germany total solids standard method 2540b and total suspended solids standard method 2540d table 1 each of the fungal working solutions of 50 ml were analyzed at the beginning time zero and after the experimental exposure times of 0 5 1 5 10 15 30 45 and 60 min to each led wavelength two controls were performed to verify if the fungal concentration remained stable along the experimental time under natural light designated as natural light control and in the dark designated as dark control from the fungal working solutions collected at different exposure times 1 ml was used to determine colony forming units cfu ml and the rest of the volume was centrifuged resuspended in 10 ml of saline solution and kept at 20 c to be further analyzed 2 3 1 determination of the uv fluence to enable the comparison of inactivation experiments conducted with other setups the uv fluence mj cm2 was determined as the product of the fluence rate irradiance and the exposure time in seconds the average irradiance values in the water was determined after considering different correction factors reflection petri dish water and divergence as described by bolton and linden 2003 the following correction factors were used 0 98 for the reflection factor 0 90 for the petri factor and 0 64 for the divergence factor the water factor that takes into account the decrease in irradiance due to sample absorbance at the wavelengths of interest was also determined for each of the three fungi species tested 2 4 methods to determine the disinfection efficiency 2 4 1 plate count the concentration of fungi present in the samples collected at different contact times was quantified by colony forming units in cfu ml using the pour plate method through serial dilutions the medium used was malt extract agar merck usa and plates were incubated for 48 72 h at 27 c the results are presented as ln c c0 where c is the concentration of fungal spores obtained along the experimental time and c0 is the concentration of fungal spores obtained at the initial experimental time 2 4 2 scan electron microscopy scanning electron microscopy images were acquired before and after the inactivation assays with the different led wavelengths to assess the changes in the morphology of the different fungi species tested the samples were prepared for sem analysis using 2 ml of the initial and final collected after 60 min of uv led exposure samples that were kept frozen at 20 c samples preparation was performed according to panngom 2014 with some modifications briefly the samples were washed with phosphate buffer ph 7 for 5 min and fixed in karnovsky s fixative polysciences inc germany overnight following the protocol s recommendations 2 5 v v of glutaraldehyde 2 0 v v of paraformaldehyde and 0 1 m of phosphate buffered saline pbs solution samples were then washed three times with pbs for 10 min and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 min pellet was fixed with osmium tetroxide 1 0 v v for 2 h protected from light samples were then dehydrated using several ethanol solutions with a gradient increase in concentration 30 50 70 80 90 95 and 100 for 10 min being only the last dehydration step 100 performed twice for 15 min lastly the samples were freeze dried for 30 min and mounted in carbon conductive tape samples were then covered with a thin film of gold and palladium au pd on a quorum technologies sputter coater model q150t es observations were performed using a feg sem jeol jsm7001f with a 15 kv acceleration voltage and a pc sem by jeol used for image acquisition 2 4 3 flow cytometry analysis flow cytometry analyses were conducted using the cyflow cube 6 equipment sysmex partec gmbh germany with a 488 nm excitation from a blue solid state laser at 50 mw staining procedure followed the yeast control viability kit sysmex partec gmbh germany that contains fluorescein diacetate fda which by the action of enzymes esterases is converted into a fluorescent product combined with propidium iodide pi which intercalates in the dna of membrane damaged cells allowed the determination not only of metabolically active fda positive and dead pi positive spores but also quiescent fda and pi negative and damaged fda and pi positive spores a preliminary experiment was performed to define particle size fsc and spores granularity ssc selectivity gates using an untreated sample this gate includes the fungal spores and excludes the background mesquita et al 2013 additionally using an untreated sample and a sample subjected to medium pressure uv light for 60 min due to its higher radiation intensity and proven effectiveness to achieve inactivation the yeast control viability kit was used to define four gates quiescent left down quadrant metabolically active right down quadrant dead left upper quadrant and damaged right upper quadrant fig 2 the obtained cytograms were analyzed using a cyviewtm for cube 6 software partec gmbh germany 3 results and discussion 3 1 led inactivation experiments inactivation experiments were conducted using a fumigatus a niger and a terreus under the pearl beam reactor that was set at 2 different wavelengths 255 nm and 265 nm fig 3 the action of these different wavelengths was tested separately and samples were analyzed after several exposure times 0 0 5 1 5 10 15 30 45 and 60 min the correspondent uv fluences were calculated as detailed in section 2 3 1 fig 4 shows the results presented in uv fluences for the three fungi species using led 255 nm and 265 nm the experiments were conducted using saline solution supplementary fig 1 and filtered surface water fig 3 no notorious differences were observed between the two matrices showing that neither negative scavenging nor positive oh production effects of the matrix composition on photolysis were observed fig 3 shows that the concentration of the 3 fungi species in the control experiments was stable as can be seen in figs 3 and 4 for both uv leds the most resistant fungi species is a niger followed by a fumigatus and a terreus which is the less resistant considering the leds led 265 nm fig 4 b shows to be more efficient to inactivate the fungi species when compared to led 255 nm fig 4 a for instance to obtain a 2 log reduction of a fumigatus it is necessary an uv fluence of 2 33 mj cm2 10 min using led 265 nm and 11 66 mj cm2 60 min when led 255 nm is used for a terreus to obtain 3 log reduction it is necessary 1 64 mj cm2 5 min and 8 00 mj cm2 30 min for led 265 nm and 255 nm respectively for a niger less than 1 log reduction was obtained even for the highest uv fluence 60 min using both leds comparing with other studies nascimento et al 2010 used a fumigatus among other ascomycetes to perform uv inactivations with a 313 nm peak fluorescent lamp and their results show a higher uv fluence needed to obtain the same inactivations for a niger more studies have been performed due to its importance in different areas such as food chemical and medical industries chen et al 2009 murdoch et al 2013 however much higher uv fluences were used compared to the ones used in this study for example chen et al 2009 using a low pressure mercury lamp needs 42 30 j cm2 to reach 50 of a niger inactivation in this study using the led that emits at 255 nm for the same fungi species 1 23 mj cm2 were needed to inactivate 51 7 and using the led that emits at 265 nm 1 21 mj cm2 were needed to inactivate 60 0 to the best of authors knowledge no inactivation studies using a terreus were performed although some studies used uv radiation to study morphological and biochemically random mutations formed by its action hollaender et al 1945 the ideal curve observed for the inactivation of microorganisms is a first order curve however sometimes it is obtained a shoulder or a tailing off curve the latter can be obtained for several reasons such as the presence of clumps of spores genetic resistance or matrix interference that is able to protect a survival subpopulation with interfering substances like suspended organic matter gerba 2000 fig 4 using real water matrix and supplementary fig 1 using saline solution show a tailing off curve for a fumigatus and a terreus so there is no matrix interference the linear and polynomial regressions and the correspondent coefficients of determination obtained for each species after inactivation with leds emitting at 255 nm and 265 nm are presented in supplementary table 1 3 2 resistance to uv inactivation several studies have already reported the higher resistance of filamentous fungi when compared to other microorganisms like bacteria to uv light which could be explained by the presence of pigmented spores braga et al 2006 nascimento et al 2010 or enzymes that can inactivate the free radicals formed by the action of light avalos and carmen limón 2015 within the three target species the spores size can explain the order of resilience because bigger spores absorb more radiation and consequently reduces the radiation that goes to the nucleus nascimento et al 2010 a niger have bigger spores diameter 3 5 4 5 μm followed by a fumigatus 2 5 3 0 μm and then a terreus 1 5 2 5 μm oliveira et al 2013 samson et al 2004 regarding the growth rate analysis of spores before and after 60 min of uv inactivation the different species were grown in malt extract agar for 7 days and the colonies diameter measured along time it can be seen that the growth rate of the fungi spores remained the same so the resistance of few spores in the species itself may be due to genetic resistance supplementary fig 2 the 2 led wavelengths 255 nm and 265 nm were selected due to their similarity with the wavelength that low pressure mercury lamps widely used in drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities emit 254 nm and the maximum absorbance of dna approximately 264 nm bowker et al 2011 compared a uv led set at 255 nm with a low pressure mercury lamp and verified that the uv led showed lower inactivation effectiveness that started with a 0 25 log difference at 3 mj cm2 and reached 2 25 log difference at 7 mj cm2 the explanation given is that the absorption spectrum is not the only factor affecting inactivation effectiveness and in this case it might be due to the higher power output emitted by the low pressure lamp led 265 nm as it is shown in fig 4 promotes higher inactivation of the target fungi species chatterley and linden 2010 compared a 265 nm uv led with a low pressure mercury lamp and verified that the uv led is more effective to inactivate escherichia coli moreover uv led set at 265 nm also showed higher inactivation results when compared with 280 nm and 310 nm wavelengths to inactivate escherichia coli legionella pneumophila pseudomonas aeruginosa bacillus subtilis spores and bacteriophage qβ li et al 2017 rattanakul and oguma 2018 the higher inactivation results at 265 nm higher damages and inhibition of cell division and growth reported in this study and by other studies can be explained by the uv absorption curve of dna whose peak is at 264 nm 3 2 1 phenotypic effect on fungal spores scan electron microscopy was performed to monitor the spores morphology of the three different fungi species before and after 60 min of uv led exposure fig 5 a fumigatus have globose rough walled to echinulate conidia a niger have globose ornamented with irregular warts spines and ridges conidia and a terreus have globose smooth conidia samson et al 2004 when comparing the effect of the uv leds it can be seen that the led that emits light at 265 nm is able to cause deformation in all of the fungi spores regardless the species although there are differences in the species resistance to uv led inactivation fig 4 on the other hand the led that emits at 255 nm does not cause morphologically changes in the fungal spores although there is some inactivation of the different species as can be seen in fig 4 further studies should be performed to address deeply the spores morphology constituents that are being affected by the different uv led radiation although not using the same genera wen et al 2017 have also performed sem analysis after exposing filamentous fungi spores cladosporium sp penicillium sp acremonium sp and trichoderma sp to a uv dose of 40 mj cm2 and they showed less morphology damage when compared to the images obtained in this study using a lower uv dose maximum uv fluence for led 255 nm was 16 mj cm2 and for led 265 nm was 20 mj cm2 3 2 2 effect on membrane permeability and enzymatic activity flow cytometry analysis was performed using the three fungi species before and after 60 min of uv led exposure the analyses were performed using a final concentration of 1 106 spores ml and the results corrected according to the baseline background of the different solutions used pbs and filtered surface water fig 6 presents the results in triplicate as percentage bar charts that correspond to the percentages obtained for each quadrant of the cytogram in the no treatment section it can be seen that most of the spores are metabolically active and that there is a small percentage of spores that are damaged fig 6 this is important to establish the base line from which we can compare the action of the uv leds in the led 255 nm section there is a slight increase of damaged spores for the three fungi species and few dead spores appear using led 265 nm there is an increase of damaged and dead spores a fumigatus seams quite affected by led 265 nm showing damaged spores while a terreus having almost the same percentage of affected spores than the former has less damaged spores and more dead spores for a niger it can be seen that the spores are more resistant to disinfection although there is also a little increase of damaged and dead spores the spores that are damaged having a disrupted membrane but at the same time being still viable are potentially spores that might be able to repair their damages through dna repair mechanisms these results are consistent with fig 4 showing that the order of resistance is a niger followed by a fumigatus and a terreus moreover fig 6 also show that led at 265 nm is more efficient to damage and inactivate dead spores which can be related with the sem images presented in fig 5 with morphologically changes in the different fungi spores several studies have been conducted using plate count to analyze general water quality flow cytometry is a methodology that provides more information than plate count due to the addition of different lasers to the equipment and the utilization of different dyes in the samples nevel et al 2017 the establishment of correlations between these two techniques has not been defined yet since authors diverge ehgartner et al 2016 nescerecka et al 2014 for instance as it is known and as stated by nevel et al 2017 uv c radiation is able to inactivate microorganisms because it affects the nucleic acids leading to replication and transcription inhibition whereas the membrane cell wall may remain intact so microorganisms would not grow on plate but will be unstained by propidium iodide having more live metabolically active spores in flow cytometry than growing spores on plate the correlation between grown spores in plate and metabolically active spore counts in flow cytometry was determined to be 0 86 which means that there is a strong uphill correlation and the resulting linear regression represents the stated above supplementary fig 3 the linear regression and the coefficient of determination obtained in this study are similar to the coefficient of determination 0 80 reported by ehgartner et al 2016 the results obtained in this study are consistent since the higher inactivation efficiencies obtained using the uv led that emits light at 265 nm are reflected in the sem images of the spores that were morphologically damaged and in the flow cytometry results that show an increase in damaged and dead spores 4 conclusions this study performed using light emitting diodes with different wavelengths allowed to conclude that both leds set at 255 nm and at 265 nm were able to inactivate the fungi species understudy being the led that emits light at 265 nm the most efficient aspergillus niger was the most resistant fungi species followed by aspergillus fumigatus and by aspergillus terrreus it was possible to verify that the led that emits at 265 nm affected phenotypically all the fungi species tested which reflects biochemical modifications of the spores uv led inactivation led to changes in membrane permeability and enzymatic activity that was verified by a combination of flow cytometry with fluorescence based viability stains this technique may be useful to evaluate the effectiveness of the disinfectant treatments applied in a drinking water utility leds that emit light at 265 nm

dish was placed bellow the led plate with a distance from the leds to the sample top surface of 4 cm inactivation experiments were conducted in saline solution 0 90 w v of nacl and in filtered surface water untreated surface water was collected and used in inactivation experiments after filtration with a 0 22 μm membrane filter pall ny usa to simulate the treatment processes performed in drinking water treatment facilities both waters before and after filtration were characterized in terms of temperature ph using a microph 2002 crison spain total organic carbon standard method 5310b using a total organic carbon analyzer toc v shimadzu usa turbidity using a hanna portable turbidity meter hi98703 usa chemical oxygen demand using hach lange ht200s and hach lange dr2800 equipments with the hach lange lck 514 100 2000 mg l o2 kits germany total solids standard method 2540b and total suspended solids standard method 2540d table 1 each of the fungal working solutions of 50 ml were analyzed at the beginning time zero and after the experimental exposure times of 0 5 1 5 10 15 30 45 and 60 min to each led wavelength two controls were performed to verify if the fungal concentration remained stable along the experimental time under natural light designated as natural light control and in the dark designated as dark control from the fungal working solutions collected at different exposure times 1 ml was used to determine colony forming units cfu ml and the rest of the volume was centrifuged resuspended in 10 ml of saline solution and kept at 20 c to be further analyzed 2 3 1 determination of the uv fluence to enable the comparison of inactivation experiments conducted with other setups the uv fluence mj cm2 was determined as the product of the fluence rate irradiance and the exposure time in seconds the average irradiance values in the water was determined after considering different correction factors reflection petri dish water and divergence as described by bolton and linden 2003 the following correction factors were used 0 98 for the reflection factor 0 90 for the petri factor and 0 64 for the divergence factor the water factor that takes into account the decrease in irradiance due to sample absorbance at the wavelengths of interest was also determined for each of the three fungi species tested 2 4 methods to determine the disinfection efficiency 2 4 1 plate count the concentration of fungi present in the samples collected at different contact times was quantified by colony forming units in cfu ml using the pour plate method through serial dilutions the medium used was malt extract agar merck usa and plates were incubated for 48 72 h at 27 c the results are presented as ln c c0 where c is the concentration of fungal spores obtained along the experimental time and c0 is the concentration of fungal spores obtained at the initial experimental time 2 4 2 scan electron microscopy scanning electron microscopy images were acquired before and after the inactivation assays with the different led wavelengths to assess the changes in the morphology of the different fungi species tested the samples were prepared for sem analysis using 2 ml of the initial and final collected after 60 min of uv led exposure samples that were kept frozen at 20 c samples preparation was performed according to panngom 2014 with some modifications briefly the samples were washed with phosphate buffer ph 7 for 5 min and fixed in karnovsky s fixative polysciences inc germany overnight following the protocol s recommendations 2 5 v v of glutaraldehyde 2 0 v v of paraformaldehyde and 0 1 m of phosphate buffered saline pbs solution samples were then washed three times with pbs for 10 min and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 min pellet was fixed with osmium tetroxide 1 0 v v for 2 h protected from light samples were then dehydrated using several ethanol solutions with a gradient increase in concentration 30 50 70 80 90 95 and 100 for 10 min being only the last dehydration step 100 performed twice for 15 min lastly the samples were freeze dried for 30 min and mounted in carbon conductive tape samples were then covered with a thin film of gold and palladium au pd on a quorum technologies sputter coater model q150t es observations were performed using a feg sem jeol jsm7001f with a 15 kv acceleration voltage and a pc sem by jeol used for image acquisition 2 4 3 flow cytometry analysis flow cytometry analyses were conducted using the cyflow cube 6 equipment sysmex partec gmbh germany with a 488 nm excitation from a blue solid state laser at 50 mw staining procedure followed the yeast control viability kit sysmex partec gmbh germany that contains fluorescein diacetate fda which by the action of enzymes esterases is converted into a fluorescent product combined with propidium iodide pi which intercalates in the dna of membrane damaged cells allowed the determination not only of metabolically active fda positive and dead pi positive spores but also quiescent fda and pi negative and damaged fda and pi positive spores a preliminary experiment was performed to define particle size fsc and spores granularity ssc selectivity gates using an untreated sample this gate includes the fungal spores and excludes the background mesquita et al 2013 additionally using an untreated sample and a sample subjected to medium pressure uv light for 60 min due to its higher radiation intensity and proven effectiveness to achieve inactivation the yeast control viability kit was used to define four gates quiescent left down quadrant metabolically active right down quadrant dead left upper quadrant and damaged right upper quadrant fig 2 the obtained cytograms were analyzed using a cyviewtm for cube 6 software partec gmbh germany 3 results and discussion 3 1 led inactivation experiments inactivation experiments were conducted using a fumigatus a niger and a terreus under the pearl beam reactor that was set at 2 different wavelengths 255 nm and 265 nm fig 3 the action of these different wavelengths was tested separately and samples were analyzed after several exposure times 0 0 5 1 5 10 15 30 45 and 60 min the correspondent uv fluences were calculated as detailed in section 2 3 1 fig 4 shows the results presented in uv fluences for the three fungi species using led 255 nm and 265 nm the experiments were conducted using saline solution supplementary fig 1 and filtered surface water fig 3 no notorious differences were observed between the two matrices showing that neither negative scavenging nor positive oh production effects of the matrix composition on photolysis were observed fig 3 shows that the concentration of the 3 fungi species in the control experiments was stable as can be seen in figs 3 and 4 for both uv leds the most resistant fungi species is a niger followed by a fumigatus and a terreus which is the less resistant considering the leds led 265 nm fig 4 b shows to be more efficient to inactivate the fungi species when compared to led 255 nm fig 4 a for instance to obtain a 2 log reduction of a fumigatus it is necessary an uv fluence of 2 33 mj cm2 10 min using led 265 nm and 11 66 mj cm2 60 min when led 255 nm is used for a terreus to obtain 3 log reduction it is necessary 1 64 mj cm2 5 min and 8 00 mj cm2 30 min for led 265 nm and 255 nm respectively for a niger less than 1 log reduction was obtained even for the highest uv fluence 60 min using both leds comparing with other studies nascimento et al 2010 used a fumigatus among other ascomycetes to perform uv inactivations with a 313 nm peak fluorescent lamp and their results show a higher uv fluence needed to obtain the same inactivations for a niger more studies have been performed due to its importance in different areas such as food chemical and medical industries chen et al 2009 murdoch et al 2013 however much higher uv fluences were used compared to the ones used in this study for example chen et al 2009 using a low pressure mercury lamp needs 42 30 j cm2 to reach 50 of a niger inactivation in this study using the led that emits at 255 nm for the same fungi species 1 23 mj cm2 were needed to inactivate 51 7 and using the led that emits at 265 nm 1 21 mj cm2 were needed to inactivate 60 0 to the best of authors knowledge no inactivation studies using a terreus were performed although some studies used uv radiation to study morphological and biochemically random mutations formed by its action hollaender et al 1945 the ideal curve observed for the inactivation of microorganisms is a first order curve however sometimes it is obtained a shoulder or a tailing off curve the latter can be obtained for several reasons such as the presence of clumps of spores genetic resistance or matrix interference that is able to protect a survival subpopulation with interfering substances like suspended organic matter gerba 2000 fig 4 using real water matrix and supplementary fig 1 using saline solution show a tailing off curve for a fumigatus and a terreus so there is no matrix interference the linear and polynomial regressions and the correspondent coefficients of determination obtained for each species after inactivation with leds emitting at 255 nm and 265 nm are presented in supplementary table 1 3 2 resistance to uv inactivation several studies have already reported the higher resistance of filamentous fungi when compared to other microorganisms like bacteria to uv light which could be explained by the presence of pigmented spores braga et al 2006 nascimento et al 2010 or enzymes that can inactivate the free radicals formed by the action of light avalos and carmen limón 2015 within the three target species the spores size can explain the order of resilience because bigger spores absorb more radiation and consequently reduces the radiation that goes to the nucleus nascimento et al 2010 a niger have bigger spores diameter 3 5 4 5 μm followed by a fumigatus 2 5 3 0 μm and then a terreus 1 5 2 5 μm oliveira et al 2013 samson et al 2004 regarding the growth rate analysis of spores before and after 60 min of uv inactivation the different species were grown in malt extract agar for 7 days and the colonies diameter measured along time it can be seen that the growth rate of the fungi spores remained the same so the resistance of few spores in the species itself may be due to genetic resistance supplementary fig 2 the 2 led wavelengths 255 nm and 265 nm were selected due to their similarity with the wavelength that low pressure mercury lamps widely used in drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities emit 254 nm and the maximum absorbance of dna approximately 264 nm bowker et al 2011 compared a uv led set at 255 nm with a low pressure mercury lamp and verified that the uv led showed lower inactivation effectiveness that started with a 0 25 log difference at 3 mj cm2 and reached 2 25 log difference at 7 mj cm2 the explanation given is that the absorption spectrum is not the only factor affecting inactivation effectiveness and in this case it might be due to the higher power output emitted by the low pressure lamp led 265 nm as it is shown in fig 4 promotes higher inactivation of the target fungi species chatterley and linden 2010 compared a 265 nm uv led with a low pressure mercury lamp and verified that the uv led is more effective to inactivate escherichia coli moreover uv led set at 265 nm also showed higher inactivation results when compared with 280 nm and 310 nm wavelengths to inactivate escherichia coli legionella pneumophila pseudomonas aeruginosa bacillus subtilis spores and bacteriophage qβ li et al 2017 rattanakul and oguma 2018 the higher inactivation results at 265 nm higher damages and inhibition of cell division and growth reported in this study and by other studies can be explained by the uv absorption curve of dna whose peak is at 264 nm 3 2 1 phenotypic effect on fungal spores scan electron microscopy was performed to monitor the spores morphology of the three different fungi species before and after 60 min of uv led exposure fig 5 a fumigatus have globose rough walled to echinulate conidia a niger have globose ornamented with irregular warts spines and ridges conidia and a terreus have globose smooth conidia samson et al 2004 when comparing the effect of the uv leds it can be seen that the led that emits light at 265 nm is able to cause deformation in all of the fungi spores regardless the species although there are differences in the species resistance to uv led inactivation fig 4 on the other hand the led that emits at 255 nm does not cause morphologically changes in the fungal spores although there is some inactivation of the different species as can be seen in fig 4 further studies should be performed to address deeply the spores morphology constituents that are being affected by the different uv led radiation although not using the same genera wen et al 2017 have also performed sem analysis after exposing filamentous fungi spores cladosporium sp penicillium sp acremonium sp and trichoderma sp to a uv dose of 40 mj cm2 and they showed less morphology damage when compared to the images obtained in this study using a lower uv dose maximum uv fluence for led 255 nm was 16 mj cm2 and for led 265 nm was 20 mj cm2 3 2 2 effect on membrane permeability and enzymatic activity flow cytometry analysis was performed using the three fungi species before and after 60 min of uv led exposure the analyses were performed using a final concentration of 1 106 spores ml and the results corrected according to the baseline background of the different solutions used pbs and filtered surface water fig 6 presents the results in triplicate as percentage bar charts that correspond to the percentages obtained for each quadrant of the cytogram in the no treatment section it can be seen that most of the spores are metabolically active and that there is a small percentage of spores that are damaged fig 6 this is important to establish the base line from which we can compare the action of the uv leds in the led 255 nm section there is a slight increase of damaged spores for the three fungi species and few dead spores appear using led 265 nm there is an increase of damaged and dead spores a fumigatus seams quite affected by led 265 nm showing damaged spores while a terreus having almost the same percentage of affected spores than the former has less damaged spores and more dead spores for a niger it can be seen that the spores are more resistant to disinfection although there is also a little increase of damaged and dead spores the spores that are damaged having a disrupted membrane but at the same time being still viable are potentially spores that might be able to repair their damages through dna repair mechanisms these results are consistent with fig 4 showing that the order of resistance is a niger followed by a fumigatus and a terreus moreover fig 6 also show that led at 265 nm is more efficient to damage and inactivate dead spores which can be related with the sem images presented in fig 5 with morphologically changes in the different fungi spores several studies have been conducted using plate count to analyze general water quality flow cytometry is a methodology that provides more information than plate count due to the addition of different lasers to the equipment and the utilization of different dyes in the samples nevel et al 2017 the establishment of correlations between these two techniques has not been defined yet since authors diverge ehgartner et al 2016 nescerecka et al 2014 for instance as it is known and as stated by nevel et al 2017 uv c radiation is able to inactivate microorganisms because it affects the nucleic acids leading to replication and transcription inhibition whereas the membrane cell wall may remain intact so microorganisms would not grow on plate but will be unstained by propidium iodide having more live metabolically active spores in flow cytometry than growing spores on plate the correlation between grown spores in plate and metabolically active spore counts in flow cytometry was determined to be 0 86 which means that there is a strong uphill correlation and the resulting linear regression represents the stated above supplementary fig 3 the linear regression and the coefficient of determination obtained in this study are similar to the coefficient of determination 0 80 reported by ehgartner et al 2016 the results obtained in this study are consistent since the higher inactivation efficiencies obtained using the uv led that emits light at 265 nm are reflected in the sem images of the spores that were morphologically damaged and in the flow cytometry results that show an increase in damaged and dead spores 4 conclusions this study performed using light emitting diodes with different wavelengths allowed to conclude that both leds set at 255 nm and at 265 nm were able to inactivate the fungi species understudy being the led that emits light at 265 nm the most efficient aspergillus niger was the most resistant fungi species followed by aspergillus fumigatus and by aspergillus terrreus it was possible to verify that the led that emits at 265 nm affected phenotypically all the fungi species tested which reflects biochemical modifications of the spores uv led inactivation led to changes in membrane permeability and enzymatic activity that was verified by a combination of flow cytometry with fluorescence based viability stains this technique may be useful to evaluate the effectiveness of the disinfectant treatments applied in a drinking water utility leds that emit light at 265 nm

18396,aquatic ecosystems have been increasingly threatened by anthropogenic activities e g wastewater discharge and farm operation several methods are adopted to evaluate the effects of anthropogenic activities on biological risk in the environment such as qpcr and amplicon next generation sequencing however these methods fall short of providing genomic information of target species which is vital for risk assessment from genomic aspect here we developed a novel approach integrating metagenomic analysis and flow cytometry to identify and quantify potential pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria parb carrying both antibiotic resistance genes args and virulence factor genes vfgs in the environment which are of particular concern due to their infection ability and antibiotic resistance based on the abundance density of parb we evaluated microbiological risk in a river impacted by both municipal drainage and agriculture runoff we collected samples upstream mountainous area as the control results showed that 81 8 of dominant parb 33 recovered using our approach were related to known pathogenic taxa in addition intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns in the dominant pseudomonas genomes 20 out of 71 parb showed high similarity with the most closely related pseudomonas genomes from the ncbi refseq database these results reflect acceptable reliability of the approach for potential pathogen identification in environmental samples according to the parb density microbiological risk in samples from the agricultural area was significantly higher than in samples from the urban area we speculated that this was due to the higher antibiotic usage in agriculture as well as intragenomic args vfgs co evolution under antibiotic selective pressure this study provides an alternative approach for the identification and quantification of parb in aquatic environments which can be applied for microbiological risk assessment graphical abstract image 1 keywords pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria antibiotic resistance genes virulence factor genes microbiological risk aquatic ecosystem 1 introduction river water quality near cities and or agricultural regions tends to deteriorate due to anthropogenic activity concerns regarding biological risk resulting from anthropogenic activities have garnered increasing attention and several techniques have been used for identification and detection of bacterial pathogens such as culture and pcr based methods rovai et al 2014 traditional culture based method is the golden standard method for pathogens identification but it is time consuming and susceptible to culture conditions pcr based methods are of much higher throughput and culture independent but they rely heavily on specific primers for detection of target genes thus not applicable to detect novel target genes therefore new methods need to be developed to overcome the disadvantages mentioned above nowadays antibiotic resistance genes args pruden et al 2006 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 and virulence factor genes vfgs chen et al 2005 are important targets in microbiological risk assessment ben et al 2019 bondarczuk et al 2016 unc et al 2012 because vfgs enable their bacterial hosts to invade humans animals and cause disease and args allow their bacterial hosts to survive antibiotic therapy the use of antibiotics in clinical practice and agriculture including livestock and fish farming are two important drivers for the enrichment and dissemination of args in the environment many studies have assessed arg derived microbiological risk by quantifying these genes in the environment chereau et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 however the risk of microbiological contaminants not only relies on arg density but also the genetic context for example when args coexist with vfgs in a genome e g in chromosome plasmids and other mobile genetic elements mges the risk of the genome to humans animals will increase hence pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria parb carrying both args and vfgs in chromosome plasmids and other mges rather than args themselves are the final component for assessing the health risk of antibiotic resistance parb are an important issue in microbiological risk assessment for two main reasons 1 they have the capacity to cause disease and invalidate antibiotic therapy and 2 theoretically pathogenic strains containing vfgs tend to acquire args in genomes or plasmids because they are more likely compared with non pathogens to be exposed to high concentrations of antibiotics beceiro et al 2013 culture dependent methods are often used to identify parb elzen 2015 which are highly time consuming and thus not feasible in large scale environmental surveys hence time efficient methods are required for the identification and assessment of potential parb in the environment in this study we used a metagenomic based approach to identify and quantify potential parb in the environment the approach can assess abundance density and risk rank of potential parb and more importantly enable characterization of intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns in local samples which can reflect local influence the approach together with common risk assessment methods was used to investigate the influence of anthropogenic activities on args vfgs and parb in a typical anthropogenically disturbed river chaobai river which shows distinct land use partitioning i e less disturbed mountainous area upstream wastewater discharge urban area midstream and farming feeding agricultural area downstream we aimed to i identify and quantify parb using genome centric analysis ii investigate if intragenomic args vfgs coexistence is more likely in anthropogenically disturbed regions and iii examine if intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns respond to local anthropogenic activity 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites and water sample collection due to its distinct land use partitioning the chaobai river was selected as an appropriate system to study human impact on an aquatic ecosystem the river originates from north of the yanshan mountains it first flows through a less disturbed mountainous area ma then through an urban area ua where treated wastewater becomes a main source of river water and finally through an agricultural area aa where livestock and fish farming prevail before draining into bohai bay details on the sampling area have been described in our previous study liao et al 2018 surface water samples 1 50 cm in depth were collected from 34 sites along the river in december 2016 march 2017 june 2017 and september 2017 fig s1 in december samples from seven sites were not collected due to river water froze into thick ice in these sites in june and september samples from six sites were not collected due to river water dried up or other man made factors such as site operation a total of 123 water samples were obtained we loaded 1 ml of surface water into centrifuge tubes for microbial biomass collection in the field for microbial cell quantification using flow cytometry approximately 700 900 ml of surface water was filtered using 0 45 μm filter membranes in the field with a pump followed by the addition of lifeguard preservation solution mobio laboratories inc carlsbad ca usa and then dna sequencing all samples were transported to the laboratory on ice 2 2 microbial cell counts absolute cell counts in the water samples were determined in quadruplicate according to nescerecka et al 2016 with slight modification briefly staining solution was prepared using sybr green i 10 000 stock sigma aldrich trading co ltd usa diluted 100 in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide dmso the solution 10 μl was then added to water samples 100 μl and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark all samples were diluted 10 in te buffer 10 mm tris hcl ph 8 0 1 mm edta ph 8 0 solution fluorescent beads in trucount absolute count tubes becton dickinson and company usa with known density were spiked to the samples as a standard to determine cell density samples were analyzed using a flow cytometer facscalibur becton dickinson and company usa 2 3 metagenomic sequencing the filter membranes stored in mobio preservation solution were subjected to dna extraction using a powerwater dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the extracted dna samples were sent to the beijing genomics institute china for 150 bp paired end shotgun metagenomic sequencing on an illumina hiseq x ten sequencing platform after detection of dna density the amounts of dna in nine samples were found to be insufficient for metagenomic sequencing hence in total 114 dna samples were sequenced average size 6 1 gbp see table s1 for details the sequence data generated in this study were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive database with accession number prjna542960 2 4 classification and quantification of args to characterize and quantify args in the samples reads of each sample were processed using args oap v2 0 a standard online analysis pipeline yin et al 2018 the arg sequences were first identified by alignment against sarg v2 0 a structured database of args with the copy number of each arg sequence then normalized against the length of the reference sequences cell numbers of each sample were also estimated with the pipeline by estimating the copy numbers of 30 essential single copy marker genes finally the abundance of potential args in each sample was normalized based on cell numbers arg copies per cell at the sequence subtype and type level the absolute density of args in each sample was obtained by multiplying the total cell density of the sample by arg abundance arg copies per cell 2 5 classification and quantification of vfgs core vfg sequences from the virulence factor database vfdb file vfdb seta nt fas and corresponding protein database file vfdb seta pro fas chen et al 2005 were downloaded on 17 march 2019 http www mgc ac cn vfs download htm for analysis to classify all sequences in the vfdb into type and subtype functional information in the sequence header of each sequence in the file vfdb seta nt fas was searched as query keyword in virulence factors filed at http www mgc ac cn cgi bin vfs v5 main cgi we assigned classification information in the keywords field of the most relevant vfg as the type or subtype of the sequence finally we obtained a vfg classification table where all sequences in the vfdb were classified into four main types offensive vfgs defensive vfgs nonspecific vfgs and regulative vfgs and 17 main subtypes see supplementary excel 1 to quantify the vfgs reads of each sample were mapped to sequences of vfdb seta nt fas with an aligner in bbmap v38 43 bushnell 2014 using slow mode high sensitivity with coverage of the reference sequences then estimated using its in house script pileup sh with default parameters total copy number of each virulence factor type and subtype was calculated by adding the coverage value of all vfg sequences belonging to a specific subtype or type virulence factor abundance copy per cell at the type and subtype level was normalized based on the cell number estimated by the args oap v2 0 pipeline in each sample and virulence factor density copy per ml was obtained by multiplying the total cell density of the sample by vfg abundance 2 6 genome resolved metagenomic data analysis we took advantage of the metagenome assembled genomes mags for identification and quantification of potential parb as shown in fig 1 2 6 1 assembly and binning the 114 samples were first divided into 19 groups see table s2 based on their location and sampling time for co assembly using megahit v1 1 3 li et al 2015 to produce contigs then contigs of each group were then clustered to recover mags using three binning software with default parameters in the metawrap pipeline v1 2 uritskiy et al 2018 including metabat 2 kang et al 2019 maxbin 2 0 wu et al 2016 and concoct alneberg et al 2014 the mags recovered by the three software were collectively processed to produce consolidated mags criterion completeness 50 contamination 10 using bin refinement module in the metawrap v1 2 we then used drep olm et al 2017 to de replicate all consolidated mags with default parameters and finally a non redundant mag set was constructed 2 6 2 estimation of mag coverage the coverage of each non redundant mag in each sample was calculated using a mapping based method bbmap v38 43 under slow mode high sensitivity and customized script abundance and density of the mags in each sample were calculated according to equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 mag abundance reads mapping percentage mag coverage total mag coverage 2 mag density total cell density reads mapping percentage mag coverage total mag coverage where reads mapping percentage refers to the percentage of reads in a sample successfully mapped onto the non redundant mag reference mag coverage refers to coverage of a mag in a sample total mag coverage refers to the total coverage of all mags in a sample and total cell density refers to the total cell density determined by flow cytometry 2 6 3 identification of potential parb the open reading frames orfs in all contigs of each mag were predicted using prodigal v2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 to identify potential arg orfs the orfs were aligned against the arg database in arg oap v2 using blastp altschul et al 1990 an orf was regarded as a potential arg sequence when it shared at least 80 similarity over more than 70 of the length of its top hit in the database this criterion shows high accuracy hu et al 2013 potential vfg orfs were also identified using identical criterion for blastp alignment against protein sequences in the vfdb seta pro fas file mags containing potential args and vfgs were regarded as potential parb 2 6 4 average nucleotide identity calculation and taxonomic classification average nucleotide identity ani among mags was calculated using fastani v1 1 jain et al 2018 to estimate intergenomic similarity and mags of interest were hierarchically clustered by average linkage upgma taxonomic classification of mags was performed using gtdb tk v0 2 2 parks et al 2018 a software toolkit for assigning objective taxonomic classifications to bacterial and archaeal genomes 2 6 5 intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns in pseudomonas genomes intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns in the dominant pseudomonas mags 20 out of the 71 parb recovered were explored and compared with the most closely related ani based estimation by fastani jain et al 2018 complete pseudomonas genomes in the ncbi refseq database downloaded on 16 july 2019 and all complete pseudomonas genomes 502 in total the intragenomic args vfgs coexistence proportion at the type level was calculated by the pairwise relationship in an individual genome and statistically analyzed if an arg coexist with vfgs in a mag the coexistence event between the arg and each vfg will add one respectively the coexistence percentage of a specific arg vfg in a dataset was calculated by dividing its coexistence event count by the total coexistence event count of all arg vfg coexistence patterns within the three datasets 20 pseudomonas mags 20 complete pseudomonas genomes and 502 complete pseudomonas genomes respectively network analysis data were visualized by cytoscape v3 7 1 shannon et al 2003 3 results and discussion 3 1 args and vfgs respond to anthropogenic activities to conduct microbiological risk assessment based on args and vfgs we first investigated how args and vfgs respond to anthropogenic activities in the three areas respectively as shown in fig 2 a b the arg abundances and densities in the aa samples were significantly p 0 01 wilcoxon signed rank test higher than those in the ma and ua samples these results are not unexpected as most 84 3 antibiotics in china are used in veterinary and livestock medicine only 15 6 for humans zhang et al 2015 indeed the summed concentrations of sulfonamides 8 types tetracyclines 4 types fluoroquinolones 5 types and macrolides 4 types in the identical water samples were highest in aa samples su et al 2019 in press hence higher args abundance density in aa might partly attribute to higher antibiotic concentrations in aa the arg abundances in the ua were not significantly higher than that in ma but arg densities in the ua samples were higher than that in ma fig 2a b due to the higher microbial density the arg profiles changed markedly across the three areas fig 2c d reflecting the variable selective pressures on args in the different regions multidrug type args which are high risk due to their ability to resist multiple antimicrobial drugs were dominant 46 5 in aa the most dominant arg type in ma was bacitracin the abundance of which persistently decreased from ma 48 9 to ua 26 2 to aa 19 1 ma was less disturbed by anthropogenic activities thus the reason for bacitracin dominance in ma might be attributable to that it is widespread in up to 153 genera and considered to be intrinsic to bacteria hu et al 2013 similar to arg distribution vfg abundance and density in the aa samples were highest followed by abundance and density in the ua and ma samples fig 2e f offensive vfgs were the dominant type 76 on average in all samples fig 2g with dominant subtypes including toxin secretion system and adherence fig s2a percentages of minor vfg types such as defensive vfgs and nonspecific vfgs and subtype of dominant offensive vfgs such as toxin and secretion system changed obviously across the three areas fig 2h fig s2b offensive vfgs conferred infection ability of vfg hosts however hosts with higher proportions of offensive vfgs resulted in a lower proportion of defensive vfgs and thus an attenuated endurance capacity against host immunoreactions from this perspective the vfg hosts in the ma samples showed on average highly aggressive capability but lower resistance to immunoreactions of humans animals conversely the resistance ability of vfg hosts to human animal immunoreaction increased in the ua and aa samples by 189 and 342 proportion of defensive vfgs from fig 2g respectively with only a slight decrease in offensive capability 10 fig 2g hence the vfg hosts in the ua and aa samples exhibited higher risk due to the balanced composition of vfgs spearman correlation analysis on the abundance of args and vfgs revealed relatively strong correlation coefficients 0 6 p 0 01 between several arg types multidrug beta lactam unclassified and mls and vfg subtypes adherence secretion system and antiphagocytosis in all samples table s3 as well as increasing args vfgs correlation from ma to ua to aa table s4 similar results have been observed in previous research escudeiro et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 with theoretical support also found from the tendency of args and vfgs to coevolve in pathogenic genomes e g chromosome plasmids and other mges under antibiotic selective pressure beceiro et al 2013 in summary arg and vfg density increased significantly from ma to ua to aa suggesting that the probability of intragenomic args vfgs coexistence will likely increase from ma to ua to aa these results provide the basis for the integration of args and vfgs to evaluate health risks in the chaobai river 3 2 microbiological risk assessment based on mags carrying args and vfgs microbiological risk not only depends on the abundance and density of args and vfgs but also on their intragenomic coexistence patterns as explored below 3 2 1 identification quantification and taxa of potential parb in total 2 317 de replicated mags were recovered from all samples if a mag carried at least one arg and one vfg it was defined as a potential parb based on this criterion 71 mags were identified as potential parb see supplementary excel 2 of the 71 mags 8 came from 39 ma samples 8 39 0 21 14 came from 25 ua samples 14 25 0 56 and 49 came from 50 aa samples 49 50 0 98 before concluding on the results above we further examined whether the non redundant mags recovered from each area differed significantly in completeness and contamination because the two indexes might influence the probability of a mag to be identified to be a parb wilcoxon signed rank test revealed that no significant difference p 0 1 was observed among mags of the three areas fig s3 based on parb generated by our pipeline intragenomic args vfgs coexistence seemed more likely to occur in anthropogenically disturbed regions total abundance and density of the 71 parb in each sample were compared among the three areas fig 3 the results were highly similar to those of the args fig 2a b the abundance of parb was not significantly different between ua and ma fig 3b whereas the density of parb was higher in ua than in ma fig 3c the highest density of parb was observed in aa and ua p 0 01 wilcoxon signed rank test fig 3c generally microbiological risk was supposed to be positively correlated with parb density these results suggest that taking ma as the control the microbiological risk derived from parb increased in ua and again in aa the density of parb in june was highest p 0 01 wilcoxon signed rank test followed by march september and december fig s4 perhaps reflecting the contribution of higher temperature in june on parb density higher temperature can increase parb density via two aspects 1 directly promotes parb growth 2 enhances pathogenicity of pathogenic species via increasing their metabolic activity which results in higher incidence of infectious diseases and usage of antibiotics under selective pressure of antibiotics pathogenic species without args tend to acquire args pathogenic species with args tend to survive and be enriched the density and ani based cluster trees of dominant parb above 0 05 abundance in at least 20 of samples in any season are shown in fig 4 the most dominant parb genus was pseudomonas accounting for 36 of the 33 parb compared with the total number of args and vfgs in pseudomonas average 39 much higher values were observed in an aeromonas mag 117 on which special attention should be paid when assessing microbiological risk mags assigned to the same taxa were clustered together in the ani constructed tree suggesting high accuracy of the genome based taxonomic classification jain et al 2018 3 2 2 reliability of the approach the purpose of our approach is to recover and identify parb in the environmental samples and assess microbiological risk based on parb abundance density however existing methods such as qpcr and amplicon next generation sequencing cui et al 2017 can t provide such information to compare with our approach therefore we took advantage of the taxonomic information and intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns of the identified parb genomes to inspect the reliability of our approach first we checked whether the taxa of the identified potential parb fell into known pathogenic taxa of the 33 identified dominant parb figs 4 22 were taxonomically assigned to pathogen associated genera using gtdb tk jain et al 2018 including vibrio rozenblat and rosenberg 2003 shewanella janda and abbott 2014 acinetobacter bergogne bérézin and towner 1996 pseudomonas vance et al 2004 aeromonas merino et al 1995 pantoea cruz et al 2007 leclercia adapa et al 2019 and scgc aaa027 k21 coenye 2014 and five mags were taxonomically assigned to pathogen associated families including burkholderiaceae rieraruiz et al 2014 and sphingomonadaceae glaeser and kämpfer 2014 in total 81 8 27 out of 33 of identified dominant pathogenic parb were related to known pathogenic taxa reflecting acceptable reliability of the approach in identifying potential pathogens the 6 parb mags which didn t fall into the known pathogenic taxa may be novel potential pathogenic genomes which might reflect the advantage of mag based approach in identifying novel pathogens compared to the conventional microbial risk assessment approaches second intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns in the dominant pseudomonas mags 20 out of the 71 parb 16 3 and 1 pseudomonas mags were recovered from aa ma and ua respectively were explored and compared with the most closely related ani based estimation by fastani jain et al 2018 table s5 complete pseudomonas genomes in the ncbi refseq database downloaded on 16 july 2019 and all complete pseudomonas genomes 502 in total the proportion of intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns at the type level was calculated by their pairwise relationships in individual genomes and statistically analyzed within the three datasets respectively using the 502 complete pseudomonas genomes as the control the 20 pseudomonas parb were very similar to those in the closely related pseudomonas genomes with some specific patterns e g higher percentage of multidrug motility bacitracin offensive vfgs bacitracin motility and bacitracin defensive vfgs lower percentage of multidrug nonspecific vfgs fig 5 a these results demonstrated acceptable reliability of the approach in clustering contigs belonging to the same individual genome into the same mag compared to the conventional microbiological risk assessment methods our approach first introduced intragenomic coexistence analysis into microbiological risk assessment 3 2 3 risk assessment based on parb the mag based approach enabled microbiological risk assessment from three new aspects first total density of the identified parb could be used for microbiological risk assessment as shown in fig 3 second the mag based approach enabled more accurate genome resolved microbiological risk assessment the mag based approach clustered many more contigs belonging to an individual genome into one mag and recovered a high quality draft genome which guaranteed higher accuracy of taxonomic classification the draft genomes of the identified parb also helped on future microbial risk assessments e g future studies could focus on development of qpcr based microbial risk assessment tools that target the pseudomonas or aeromonas that were identified in this work third the mag based approach enabled analysis of intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns which could serve as a novel index to characterize local parb taking samples from the chaobai river as an example distinctive intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns preference were not only observed in the dominant parb genus pseudomonas fig 5a but also in genera of aeromonas 8 in total and acinetobacter 7 in total fig s5 suggesting that args vfgs coexistence patterns might be shaped by both the environment and genomic context based on the risk ranking of args and vfgs the risk ranking of intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns and their bacterial hosts becomes available which further helps to identify high risk parb in addition coexistence pattern analysis could be conducted on the whole parb community thus characterizing the overall response to local anthropogenic activities the args vfgs coexistence patterns based on the 71 parb showed that bacitracin offensive vfgs and multidrug motility were the top two correlation patterns fig 5b consistent with results of the 20 pseudomonas parb fig 5a 3 2 4 comparison with existing methods for microbiological risk assessment existing methods for microbiological risk assessment mainly include qpcr based and amplicon next generation sequencing qpcr demonstrates highest sensitivity and thus enables the detection of ultra low level target genes it is also the most time efficient method however it relies heavily on specific primers for detection of target genes which restricts its application in the identification of novel target genes it also only provides information at the genetic level with genomic context of the target genes missing amplicon next generation sequencing was used to quantify bacterial 16s rrna genes fungal rrna internal transcribed spacer its and other marker genes exhibit higher throughput than q pcr and only rely on few universal primers these merits enable its application in high throughput detection and quantification of known pathogens via various marker genes but genomic context of the target gene is also missing by comparison the mag based approach provides genome resolved information of target genes thus enabling identification of novel target genomes and further genome based analysis which fills the existing gap for identification of potential parb in the environment there are several limitations of the mag based approach 1 our pipeline enables parb based risk assessment and exploration on environmental selection for parbs it focuses on health related microbes but can t provide more comprehensive risk assessment compared to the conventional microbial risk assessment approaches e g qpcr and amplicon next generation sequencing hence it is not likely a practical approach for microbial risk assessment on its own 2 due to the short read length of the second generation high throughput sequencing technology assembly is necessary to obtain longer sequences contigs however some frequent repetitive sequences in genomes and plasmids are difficult to assemble ashton et al 2014 hence mag based approach prevented recovery of all complete plasmids or other mges upon which vfgs and args can co occur therefore the mag based approach cannot capture the complete risk as hosts which are virulent and resistant due to carriage of e g a plasmid carrying these genes will not be characterized however with the development of new sequencing technology e g pacbio and oxford nanopore which provides much longer read lengths up to 50 k bp for pacbio and 1 m bp for oxford nanopore reads could be directly used to recover target genomes which will substantially decrease this limitation of the mag based approach 4 conclusions conventional microbial risk assessment approaches such as qpcr and amplicon next generation sequencing can t provide genomic information of potential pathogens to address this issue we developed a mag based approach to identify and quantify microbial genomes carrying args and vfgs and further verified its reliability taking an anthropogenically disturbed river as the study object we used this approach to identify and quantify potential parb for microbiological risk assessment our study reached three main conclusions first the mag based approach exhibited acceptable reliability at identifying potential parb in the environment and thus could be used to identify and quantify health related strains for microbiological risk assessment second the mag based approach enabled the analysis of intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns which could serve as a novel index to characterize local influence third intragenomic args vfgs coexistence seemed more likely to occur in anthropogenically disturbed regions and args vfgs coexistence patterns were probably shaped by both the environment and genomic context although our approach depends on bioinformatics skills and high performance computing resources the fast growing in computing capacity together with integrated and user friendly pipeline will facilitate its application in both academic research and the routine environmental monitoring in the future

18396,aquatic ecosystems have been increasingly threatened by anthropogenic activities e g wastewater discharge and farm operation several methods are adopted to evaluate the effects of anthropogenic activities on biological risk in the environment such as qpcr and amplicon next generation sequencing however these methods fall short of providing genomic information of target species which is vital for risk assessment from genomic aspect here we developed a novel approach integrating metagenomic analysis and flow cytometry to identify and quantify potential pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria parb carrying both antibiotic resistance genes args and virulence factor genes vfgs in the environment which are of particular concern due to their infection ability and antibiotic resistance based on the abundance density of parb we evaluated microbiological risk in a river impacted by both municipal drainage and agriculture runoff we collected samples upstream mountainous area as the control results showed that 81 8 of dominant parb 33 recovered using our approach were related to known pathogenic taxa in addition intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns in the dominant pseudomonas genomes 20 out of 71 parb showed high similarity with the most closely related pseudomonas genomes from the ncbi refseq database these results reflect acceptable reliability of the approach for potential pathogen identification in environmental samples according to the parb density microbiological risk in samples from the agricultural area was significantly higher than in samples from the urban area we speculated that this was due to the higher antibiotic usage in agriculture as well as intragenomic args vfgs co evolution under antibiotic selective pressure this study provides an alternative approach for the identification and quantification of parb in aquatic environments which can be applied for microbiological risk assessment graphical abstract image 1 keywords pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria antibiotic resistance genes virulence factor genes microbiological risk aquatic ecosystem 1 introduction river water quality near cities and or agricultural regions tends to deteriorate due to anthropogenic activity concerns regarding biological risk resulting from anthropogenic activities have garnered increasing attention and several techniques have been used for identification and detection of bacterial pathogens such as culture and pcr based methods rovai et al 2014 traditional culture based method is the golden standard method for pathogens identification but it is time consuming and susceptible to culture conditions pcr based methods are of much higher throughput and culture independent but they rely heavily on specific primers for detection of target genes thus not applicable to detect novel target genes therefore new methods need to be developed to overcome the disadvantages mentioned above nowadays antibiotic resistance genes args pruden et al 2006 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 and virulence factor genes vfgs chen et al 2005 are important targets in microbiological risk assessment ben et al 2019 bondarczuk et al 2016 unc et al 2012 because vfgs enable their bacterial hosts to invade humans animals and cause disease and args allow their bacterial hosts to survive antibiotic therapy the use of antibiotics in clinical practice and agriculture including livestock and fish farming are two important drivers for the enrichment and dissemination of args in the environment many studies have assessed arg derived microbiological risk by quantifying these genes in the environment chereau et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 however the risk of microbiological contaminants not only relies on arg density but also the genetic context for example when args coexist with vfgs in a genome e g in chromosome plasmids and other mobile genetic elements mges the risk of the genome to humans animals will increase hence pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria parb carrying both args and vfgs in chromosome plasmids and other mges rather than args themselves are the final component for assessing the health risk of antibiotic resistance parb are an important issue in microbiological risk assessment for two main reasons 1 they have the capacity to cause disease and invalidate antibiotic therapy and 2 theoretically pathogenic strains containing vfgs tend to acquire args in genomes or plasmids because they are more likely compared with non pathogens to be exposed to high concentrations of antibiotics beceiro et al 2013 culture dependent methods are often used to identify parb elzen 2015 which are highly time consuming and thus not feasible in large scale environmental surveys hence time efficient methods are required for the identification and assessment of potential parb in the environment in this study we used a metagenomic based approach to identify and quantify potential parb in the environment the approach can assess abundance density and risk rank of potential parb and more importantly enable characterization of intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns in local samples which can reflect local influence the approach together with common risk assessment methods was used to investigate the influence of anthropogenic activities on args vfgs and parb in a typical anthropogenically disturbed river chaobai river which shows distinct land use partitioning i e less disturbed mountainous area upstream wastewater discharge urban area midstream and farming feeding agricultural area downstream we aimed to i identify and quantify parb using genome centric analysis ii investigate if intragenomic args vfgs coexistence is more likely in anthropogenically disturbed regions and iii examine if intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns respond to local anthropogenic activity 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites and water sample collection due to its distinct land use partitioning the chaobai river was selected as an appropriate system to study human impact on an aquatic ecosystem the river originates from north of the yanshan mountains it first flows through a less disturbed mountainous area ma then through an urban area ua where treated wastewater becomes a main source of river water and finally through an agricultural area aa where livestock and fish farming prevail before draining into bohai bay details on the sampling area have been described in our previous study liao et al 2018 surface water samples 1 50 cm in depth were collected from 34 sites along the river in december 2016 march 2017 june 2017 and september 2017 fig s1 in december samples from seven sites were not collected due to river water froze into thick ice in these sites in june and september samples from six sites were not collected due to river water dried up or other man made factors such as site operation a total of 123 water samples were obtained we loaded 1 ml of surface water into centrifuge tubes for microbial biomass collection in the field for microbial cell quantification using flow cytometry approximately 700 900 ml of surface water was filtered using 0 45 μm filter membranes in the field with a pump followed by the addition of lifeguard preservation solution mobio laboratories inc carlsbad ca usa and then dna sequencing all samples were transported to the laboratory on ice 2 2 microbial cell counts absolute cell counts in the water samples were determined in quadruplicate according to nescerecka et al 2016 with slight modification briefly staining solution was prepared using sybr green i 10 000 stock sigma aldrich trading co ltd usa diluted 100 in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide dmso the solution 10 μl was then added to water samples 100 μl and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark all samples were diluted 10 in te buffer 10 mm tris hcl ph 8 0 1 mm edta ph 8 0 solution fluorescent beads in trucount absolute count tubes becton dickinson and company usa with known density were spiked to the samples as a standard to determine cell density samples were analyzed using a flow cytometer facscalibur becton dickinson and company usa 2 3 metagenomic sequencing the filter membranes stored in mobio preservation solution were subjected to dna extraction using a powerwater dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the extracted dna samples were sent to the beijing genomics institute china for 150 bp paired end shotgun metagenomic sequencing on an illumina hiseq x ten sequencing platform after detection of dna density the amounts of dna in nine samples were found to be insufficient for metagenomic sequencing hence in total 114 dna samples were sequenced average size 6 1 gbp see table s1 for details the sequence data generated in this study were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive database with accession number prjna542960 2 4 classification and quantification of args to characterize and quantify args in the samples reads of each sample were processed using args oap v2 0 a standard online analysis pipeline yin et al 2018 the arg sequences were first identified by alignment against sarg v2 0 a structured database of args with the copy number of each arg sequence then normalized against the length of the reference sequences cell numbers of each sample were also estimated with the pipeline by estimating the copy numbers of 30 essential single copy marker genes finally the abundance of potential args in each sample was normalized based on cell numbers arg copies per cell at the sequence subtype and type level the absolute density of args in each sample was obtained by multiplying the total cell density of the sample by arg abundance arg copies per cell 2 5 classification and quantification of vfgs core vfg sequences from the virulence factor database vfdb file vfdb seta nt fas and corresponding protein database file vfdb seta pro fas chen et al 2005 were downloaded on 17 march 2019 http www mgc ac cn vfs download htm for analysis to classify all sequences in the vfdb into type and subtype functional information in the sequence header of each sequence in the file vfdb seta nt fas was searched as query keyword in virulence factors filed at http www mgc ac cn cgi bin vfs v5 main cgi we assigned classification information in the keywords field of the most relevant vfg as the type or subtype of the sequence finally we obtained a vfg classification table where all sequences in the vfdb were classified into four main types offensive vfgs defensive vfgs nonspecific vfgs and regulative vfgs and 17 main subtypes see supplementary excel 1 to quantify the vfgs reads of each sample were mapped to sequences of vfdb seta nt fas with an aligner in bbmap v38 43 bushnell 2014 using slow mode high sensitivity with coverage of the reference sequences then estimated using its in house script pileup sh with default parameters total copy number of each virulence factor type and subtype was calculated by adding the coverage value of all vfg sequences belonging to a specific subtype or type virulence factor abundance copy per cell at the type and subtype level was normalized based on the cell number estimated by the args oap v2 0 pipeline in each sample and virulence factor density copy per ml was obtained by multiplying the total cell density of the sample by vfg abundance 2 6 genome resolved metagenomic data analysis we took advantage of the metagenome assembled genomes mags for identification and quantification of potential parb as shown in fig 1 2 6 1 assembly and binning the 114 samples were first divided into 19 groups see table s2 based on their location and sampling time for co assembly using megahit v1 1 3 li et al 2015 to produce contigs then contigs of each group were then clustered to recover mags using three binning software with default parameters in the metawrap pipeline v1 2 uritskiy et al 2018 including metabat 2 kang et al 2019 maxbin 2 0 wu et al 2016 and concoct alneberg et al 2014 the mags recovered by the three software were collectively processed to produce consolidated mags criterion completeness 50 contamination 10 using bin refinement module in the metawrap v1 2 we then used drep olm et al 2017 to de replicate all consolidated mags with default parameters and finally a non redundant mag set was constructed 2 6 2 estimation of mag coverage the coverage of each non redundant mag in each sample was calculated using a mapping based method bbmap v38 43 under slow mode high sensitivity and customized script abundance and density of the mags in each sample were calculated according to equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 mag abundance reads mapping percentage mag coverage total mag coverage 2 mag density total cell density reads mapping percentage mag coverage total mag coverage where reads mapping percentage refers to the percentage of reads in a sample successfully mapped onto the non redundant mag reference mag coverage refers to coverage of a mag in a sample total mag coverage refers to the total coverage of all mags in a sample and total cell density refers to the total cell density determined by flow cytometry 2 6 3 identification of potential parb the open reading frames orfs in all contigs of each mag were predicted using prodigal v2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 to identify potential arg orfs the orfs were aligned against the arg database in arg oap v2 using blastp altschul et al 1990 an orf was regarded as a potential arg sequence when it shared at least 80 similarity over more than 70 of the length of its top hit in the database this criterion shows high accuracy hu et al 2013 potential vfg orfs were also identified using identical criterion for blastp alignment against protein sequences in the vfdb seta pro fas file mags containing potential args and vfgs were regarded as potential parb 2 6 4 average nucleotide identity calculation and taxonomic classification average nucleotide identity ani among mags was calculated using fastani v1 1 jain et al 2018 to estimate intergenomic similarity and mags of interest were hierarchically clustered by average linkage upgma taxonomic classification of mags was performed using gtdb tk v0 2 2 parks et al 2018 a software toolkit for assigning objective taxonomic classifications to bacterial and archaeal genomes 2 6 5 intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns in pseudomonas genomes intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns in the dominant pseudomonas mags 20 out of the 71 parb recovered were explored and compared with the most closely related ani based estimation by fastani jain et al 2018 complete pseudomonas genomes in the ncbi refseq database downloaded on 16 july 2019 and all complete pseudomonas genomes 502 in total the intragenomic args vfgs coexistence proportion at the type level was calculated by the pairwise relationship in an individual genome and statistically analyzed if an arg coexist with vfgs in a mag the coexistence event between the arg and each vfg will add one respectively the coexistence percentage of a specific arg vfg in a dataset was calculated by dividing its coexistence event count by the total coexistence event count of all arg vfg coexistence patterns within the three datasets 20 pseudomonas mags 20 complete pseudomonas genomes and 502 complete pseudomonas genomes respectively network analysis data were visualized by cytoscape v3 7 1 shannon et al 2003 3 results and discussion 3 1 args and vfgs respond to anthropogenic activities to conduct microbiological risk assessment based on args and vfgs we first investigated how args and vfgs respond to anthropogenic activities in the three areas respectively as shown in fig 2 a b the arg abundances and densities in the aa samples were significantly p 0 01 wilcoxon signed rank test higher than those in the ma and ua samples these results are not unexpected as most 84 3 antibiotics in china are used in veterinary and livestock medicine only 15 6 for humans zhang et al 2015 indeed the summed concentrations of sulfonamides 8 types tetracyclines 4 types fluoroquinolones 5 types and macrolides 4 types in the identical water samples were highest in aa samples su et al 2019 in press hence higher args abundance density in aa might partly attribute to higher antibiotic concentrations in aa the arg abundances in the ua were not significantly higher than that in ma but arg densities in the ua samples were higher than that in ma fig 2a b due to the higher microbial density the arg profiles changed markedly across the three areas fig 2c d reflecting the variable selective pressures on args in the different regions multidrug type args which are high risk due to their ability to resist multiple antimicrobial drugs were dominant 46 5 in aa the most dominant arg type in ma was bacitracin the abundance of which persistently decreased from ma 48 9 to ua 26 2 to aa 19 1 ma was less disturbed by anthropogenic activities thus the reason for bacitracin dominance in ma might be attributable to that it is widespread in up to 153 genera and considered to be intrinsic to bacteria hu et al 2013 similar to arg distribution vfg abundance and density in the aa samples were highest followed by abundance and density in the ua and ma samples fig 2e f offensive vfgs were the dominant type 76 on average in all samples fig 2g with dominant subtypes including toxin secretion system and adherence fig s2a percentages of minor vfg types such as defensive vfgs and nonspecific vfgs and subtype of dominant offensive vfgs such as toxin and secretion system changed obviously across the three areas fig 2h fig s2b offensive vfgs conferred infection ability of vfg hosts however hosts with higher proportions of offensive vfgs resulted in a lower proportion of defensive vfgs and thus an attenuated endurance capacity against host immunoreactions from this perspective the vfg hosts in the ma samples showed on average highly aggressive capability but lower resistance to immunoreactions of humans animals conversely the resistance ability of vfg hosts to human animal immunoreaction increased in the ua and aa samples by 189 and 342 proportion of defensive vfgs from fig 2g respectively with only a slight decrease in offensive capability 10 fig 2g hence the vfg hosts in the ua and aa samples exhibited higher risk due to the balanced composition of vfgs spearman correlation analysis on the abundance of args and vfgs revealed relatively strong correlation coefficients 0 6 p 0 01 between several arg types multidrug beta lactam unclassified and mls and vfg subtypes adherence secretion system and antiphagocytosis in all samples table s3 as well as increasing args vfgs correlation from ma to ua to aa table s4 similar results have been observed in previous research escudeiro et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 with theoretical support also found from the tendency of args and vfgs to coevolve in pathogenic genomes e g chromosome plasmids and other mges under antibiotic selective pressure beceiro et al 2013 in summary arg and vfg density increased significantly from ma to ua to aa suggesting that the probability of intragenomic args vfgs coexistence will likely increase from ma to ua to aa these results provide the basis for the integration of args and vfgs to evaluate health risks in the chaobai river 3 2 microbiological risk assessment based on mags carrying args and vfgs microbiological risk not only depends on the abundance and density of args and vfgs but also on their intragenomic coexistence patterns as explored below 3 2 1 identification quantification and taxa of potential parb in total 2 317 de replicated mags were recovered from all samples if a mag carried at least one arg and one vfg it was defined as a potential parb based on this criterion 71 mags were identified as potential parb see supplementary excel 2 of the 71 mags 8 came from 39 ma samples 8 39 0 21 14 came from 25 ua samples 14 25 0 56 and 49 came from 50 aa samples 49 50 0 98 before concluding on the results above we further examined whether the non redundant mags recovered from each area differed significantly in completeness and contamination because the two indexes might influence the probability of a mag to be identified to be a parb wilcoxon signed rank test revealed that no significant difference p 0 1 was observed among mags of the three areas fig s3 based on parb generated by our pipeline intragenomic args vfgs coexistence seemed more likely to occur in anthropogenically disturbed regions total abundance and density of the 71 parb in each sample were compared among the three areas fig 3 the results were highly similar to those of the args fig 2a b the abundance of parb was not significantly different between ua and ma fig 3b whereas the density of parb was higher in ua than in ma fig 3c the highest density of parb was observed in aa and ua p 0 01 wilcoxon signed rank test fig 3c generally microbiological risk was supposed to be positively correlated with parb density these results suggest that taking ma as the control the microbiological risk derived from parb increased in ua and again in aa the density of parb in june was highest p 0 01 wilcoxon signed rank test followed by march september and december fig s4 perhaps reflecting the contribution of higher temperature in june on parb density higher temperature can increase parb density via two aspects 1 directly promotes parb growth 2 enhances pathogenicity of pathogenic species via increasing their metabolic activity which results in higher incidence of infectious diseases and usage of antibiotics under selective pressure of antibiotics pathogenic species without args tend to acquire args pathogenic species with args tend to survive and be enriched the density and ani based cluster trees of dominant parb above 0 05 abundance in at least 20 of samples in any season are shown in fig 4 the most dominant parb genus was pseudomonas accounting for 36 of the 33 parb compared with the total number of args and vfgs in pseudomonas average 39 much higher values were observed in an aeromonas mag 117 on which special attention should be paid when assessing microbiological risk mags assigned to the same taxa were clustered together in the ani constructed tree suggesting high accuracy of the genome based taxonomic classification jain et al 2018 3 2 2 reliability of the approach the purpose of our approach is to recover and identify parb in the environmental samples and assess microbiological risk based on parb abundance density however existing methods such as qpcr and amplicon next generation sequencing cui et al 2017 can t provide such information to compare with our approach therefore we took advantage of the taxonomic information and intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns of the identified parb genomes to inspect the reliability of our approach first we checked whether the taxa of the identified potential parb fell into known pathogenic taxa of the 33 identified dominant parb figs 4 22 were taxonomically assigned to pathogen associated genera using gtdb tk jain et al 2018 including vibrio rozenblat and rosenberg 2003 shewanella janda and abbott 2014 acinetobacter bergogne bérézin and towner 1996 pseudomonas vance et al 2004 aeromonas merino et al 1995 pantoea cruz et al 2007 leclercia adapa et al 2019 and scgc aaa027 k21 coenye 2014 and five mags were taxonomically assigned to pathogen associated families including burkholderiaceae rieraruiz et al 2014 and sphingomonadaceae glaeser and kämpfer 2014 in total 81 8 27 out of 33 of identified dominant pathogenic parb were related to known pathogenic taxa reflecting acceptable reliability of the approach in identifying potential pathogens the 6 parb mags which didn t fall into the known pathogenic taxa may be novel potential pathogenic genomes which might reflect the advantage of mag based approach in identifying novel pathogens compared to the conventional microbial risk assessment approaches second intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns in the dominant pseudomonas mags 20 out of the 71 parb 16 3 and 1 pseudomonas mags were recovered from aa ma and ua respectively were explored and compared with the most closely related ani based estimation by fastani jain et al 2018 table s5 complete pseudomonas genomes in the ncbi refseq database downloaded on 16 july 2019 and all complete pseudomonas genomes 502 in total the proportion of intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns at the type level was calculated by their pairwise relationships in individual genomes and statistically analyzed within the three datasets respectively using the 502 complete pseudomonas genomes as the control the 20 pseudomonas parb were very similar to those in the closely related pseudomonas genomes with some specific patterns e g higher percentage of multidrug motility bacitracin offensive vfgs bacitracin motility and bacitracin defensive vfgs lower percentage of multidrug nonspecific vfgs fig 5 a these results demonstrated acceptable reliability of the approach in clustering contigs belonging to the same individual genome into the same mag compared to the conventional microbiological risk assessment methods our approach first introduced intragenomic coexistence analysis into microbiological risk assessment 3 2 3 risk assessment based on parb the mag based approach enabled microbiological risk assessment from three new aspects first total density of the identified parb could be used for microbiological risk assessment as shown in fig 3 second the mag based approach enabled more accurate genome resolved microbiological risk assessment the mag based approach clustered many more contigs belonging to an individual genome into one mag and recovered a high quality draft genome which guaranteed higher accuracy of taxonomic classification the draft genomes of the identified parb also helped on future microbial risk assessments e g future studies could focus on development of qpcr based microbial risk assessment tools that target the pseudomonas or aeromonas that were identified in this work third the mag based approach enabled analysis of intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns which could serve as a novel index to characterize local parb taking samples from the chaobai river as an example distinctive intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns preference were not only observed in the dominant parb genus pseudomonas fig 5a but also in genera of aeromonas 8 in total and acinetobacter 7 in total fig s5 suggesting that args vfgs coexistence patterns might be shaped by both the environment and genomic context based on the risk ranking of args and vfgs the risk ranking of intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns and their bacterial hosts becomes available which further helps to identify high risk parb in addition coexistence pattern analysis could be conducted on the whole parb community thus characterizing the overall response to local anthropogenic activities the args vfgs coexistence patterns based on the 71 parb showed that bacitracin offensive vfgs and multidrug motility were the top two correlation patterns fig 5b consistent with results of the 20 pseudomonas parb fig 5a 3 2 4 comparison with existing methods for microbiological risk assessment existing methods for microbiological risk assessment mainly include qpcr based and amplicon next generation sequencing qpcr demonstrates highest sensitivity and thus enables the detection of ultra low level target genes it is also the most time efficient method however it relies heavily on specific primers for detection of target genes which restricts its application in the identification of novel target genes it also only provides information at the genetic level with genomic context of the target genes missing amplicon next generation sequencing was used to quantify bacterial 16s rrna genes fungal rrna internal transcribed spacer its and other marker genes exhibit higher throughput than q pcr and only rely on few universal primers these merits enable its application in high throughput detection and quantification of known pathogens via various marker genes but genomic context of the target gene is also missing by comparison the mag based approach provides genome resolved information of target genes thus enabling identification of novel target genomes and further genome based analysis which fills the existing gap for identification of potential parb in the environment there are several limitations of the mag based approach 1 our pipeline enables parb based risk assessment and exploration on environmental selection for parbs it focuses on health related microbes but can t provide more comprehensive risk assessment compared to the conventional microbial risk assessment approaches e g qpcr and amplicon next generation sequencing hence it is not likely a practical approach for microbial risk assessment on its own 2 due to the short read length of the second generation high throughput sequencing technology assembly is necessary to obtain longer sequences contigs however some frequent repetitive sequences in genomes and plasmids are difficult to assemble ashton et al 2014 hence mag based approach prevented recovery of all complete plasmids or other mges upon which vfgs and args can co occur therefore the mag based approach cannot capture the complete risk as hosts which are virulent and resistant due to carriage of e g a plasmid carrying these genes will not be characterized however with the development of new sequencing technology e g pacbio and oxford nanopore which provides much longer read lengths up to 50 k bp for pacbio and 1 m bp for oxford nanopore reads could be directly used to recover target genomes which will substantially decrease this limitation of the mag based approach 4 conclusions conventional microbial risk assessment approaches such as qpcr and amplicon next generation sequencing can t provide genomic information of potential pathogens to address this issue we developed a mag based approach to identify and quantify microbial genomes carrying args and vfgs and further verified its reliability taking an anthropogenically disturbed river as the study object we used this approach to identify and quantify potential parb for microbiological risk assessment our study reached three main conclusions first the mag based approach exhibited acceptable reliability at identifying potential parb in the environment and thus could be used to identify and quantify health related strains for microbiological risk assessment second the mag based approach enabled the analysis of intragenomic args vfgs coexistence patterns which could serve as a novel index to characterize local influence third intragenomic args vfgs coexistence seemed more likely to occur in anthropogenically disturbed regions and args vfgs coexistence patterns were probably shaped by both the environment and genomic context although our approach depends on bioinformatics skills and high performance computing resources the fast growing in computing capacity together with integrated and user friendly pipeline will facilitate its application in both academic research and the routine environmental monitoring in the future

18397,worldwide it is common that the drinking water distribution systems dwdss may be subjected to changes of supply water quality due to the needs of upgrading the treatment processes or switching the source water however the potential impacts of quality changed supply water on the stabilized ecological niches within dwdss and the associated water quality deterioration risks were poorly documented in the present study such transition effects caused by changing the supply water quality that resulted from destabilization of biofilm and loose deposits in dwds were investigated by analyzing the physiochemical and microbiological characteristics of suspended particles before t0 during t3 weeks and after upgrading the treatments t6 months in an unchlorinated dwds in the netherlands our results demonstrated that after 6 months time the upgraded treatments significantly improved the water quality remarkably water quality deterioration was observed at the initial stage when the quality improved treated water distributed into the network at t3 weeks observed as a spike of total suspended solids tss 50 260 active biomass atp 95 230 and inorganic elements e g mn 130 250 furthermore pyrosequencing results revealed sharp differences in microbial community composition and structure for the bacteria associated with suspended particles between t0 and t3 weeks which re stabilized after 6 months at t6 months the successful capture of transition effects was especially confirmed by the domination of nitrospira spp and polaromonas spp in the distribution system at t3 weeks which were detected at rather low relative abundance at treatment plant though the transitional effects were captured this study shows that the introduction of softening and additional filtration did not have an effect on the water quality for the consumer which improved considerably after 6 months period the methodology of monitoring suspended particles with mupfiss and additional analysis is capable of detecting transitional effects by monitoring the dynamics of suspended particles and its physiochemical and microbiological composition graphical abstract image 1 keywords upgrading treatments drinking water distribution system transition effects suspended solids water quality deterioration risks 1 introduction drinking water treatments remove contaminants present in source water to make water potable in both developing and industrialized nations a growing number of contaminants are entering water supplies from human activity from pathogen virus heavy metals to micropollutants shannon et al 2008 ternes et al 2015 consequently public health environmental concerns and growing constraint to optimize the esthetical and comfort quality for the consumers e g drinking water without chlorine taste and low in hardness drive efforts to further treat waters previously considered clean which has greatly promoted the development of water treatment science and technology over past decades shannon et al 2008 in practice the developments have been focusing on the upgrades of treatments and improvements of supply water quality regarding physiochemical and microbiological parameters e g the concentrations of elements composition nutrients concentration cell number and microbial community liu et al 2019 xing et al 2018b however the quality changed drinking water still has to be delivered to customers taps through the old distribution systems in which biofilm and loose deposits have been established for decades liu et al 2013b in drinking water distribution systems dwdss over 98 of the total biomass was found to be contributed by the bacteria accumulated within loose deposits and biofilm liu et al 2014 in particular the biofilm in dwdss has been widely documented because of its potential health risks batté et al 2003 chaves simões and simões 2013 flemming et al 2002 van der wende et al 1989 wingender and flemming 2011 as reported biofilm can be as much as 108 cfu cm 2 batté et al 2003 107 cells cm 2 lehtola et al 2006 or 103 pg atp cm 2 lehtola et al 2006 depending on the measuring methods the presence of biofilm promoted the deposition of elements such as manganese mn and calcium ca in a distribution system liu et al 2017a sly et al 1990 similarly loose deposits reported to be reservoirs for inorganic elements organic nutrients and bacteria gauthier et al 1999 lehtola et al 2004 liu et al 2017a zacheus et al 2001 can be as much as 24 5 g m 1 in a full scale distribution system carrière et al 2005 and harbor comparable biomass 671 3738 ng m 1 atp to biofilm 534 23 ng m 1 atp liu et al 2014 under the regular water supply conditions there is an equilibrium between the water and the solid phases in the network e g loose deposits and biofilm it is a common sense that water quality may deteriorate during distribution the extreme cases have been observed and reported as dirty water sly et al 1990 and discoloration vreeburg and boxall 2007 xing et al 2018a for distribution of quality changed water through old pipes the equilibrium will be disturbed and material harbored by distribution pipes e g pipe scales biofilm and loose deposits will be destabilized and released into water column which can be potentially harmful feazel et al 2009 li et al 2010 liu et al 2017b torvinen et al 2004 as previously defined such destabilization may be caused by physiochemical and microbiological water quality changes that break the established forces balance in pipe scales biofilm and loose deposits such as physical destabilization e g reducing the weight of particles causing loose deposits resuspension chemical destabilization e g changes of ph redox and ion composition can remobilize contaminants bound by pipe scales on metal pipes via desorption and or dissolution and microbiological destabilization e g changes of nutrients concentration and composition can influence the microbial community and function in biofilm liu et al 2017b it has been quantified that the release of 20 of either biofilm or loose deposits will cause significant changes in the bulk water bacterial community liu et al 2017a in practice one example is the occurrence of red water in large areas of beijing in 2008 when the city switched to better source water transported 1400 km from southern china where increased sulfate in supply water caused microbial community composition changes revealed by increase in sulfur oxidizing bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria and iron oxidizing bacteria and red water events associated with high iron concentrations li et al 2010 recently in the flint drinking water crisis in michigan u s elevated blood lead levels were detected in children after water source changes hanna attisha et al 2016 which has been attributed to the missing of orthophosphate corrosion inhibitor and lead leaching from the aging pipes into water column however until now our understanding of the water quality deterioration risk associated with biofilm and loose deposits destabilization in distribution systems during switching supply water quality is limited this has been mainly attributed to the lack of accessibility of real distribution systems for study berry et al 2006 and the dilution effects of large volumes of water that keep flowing through the system increasing the difficulty of detection liu et al 2017b the suspended particles especially the associated bacteria have been used to study the effects of mixing water on bacterial community liu et al 2016 and used as sourcetracker to study the contribution of biofilm detachment and loose deposits resuspension to the tap water bacteria liu et al 2018 to overcome the above mentioned difficulties monitoring the variations of suspended solids characteristics can be used as an indirect approach without deconstructing distribution pipes or interrupting water supply services while still being able to detect the changes with serious implications for health risks and esthetical water quality this study followed the upgrade of treatments in an unchlorinated drinking water supply system in the netherlands monitored the suspended solids in treated and distributed water before t0 during t3 weeks and after the treatment upgrade t6 months the objective was to capture and study the potential release of elements and biomass caused by biofilm and loose deposits destabilization subjected to the changes in the supply water quality caused by the introduction of new softening and rapid sand filtration steps for example decrease of hardness and suspended particle load through monitoring and characterizing suspended particles in the drinking water leaves treatment plant and distributed water at the customers taps 2 material and methods 2 1 treatment plant and sampling locations the drinking water treatment plant produces drinking water from anoxic groundwater 3 8 mm3 year before introducing new treatment steps softening second rapid sand filtration and adding carbon dioxide the water was treated by aeration and rapid sand filtration before being pumped into the distribution system the sampling locations were selected at the treatment plant before the water entered the distribution system tp 0 km locations at customers taps at ds1 5 km to tp ds2 11 km to tp and ds3 17 km to tp the distribution networks in the study area is 110 mm pvc u pipes water main pipe the treatment processes and sampling locations are illustrated in fig s1 the produced water quality before and after treatment changes is given in table 1 2 2 sampling of suspended solids the suspended solids ss were sampled by multiple particle filtration systems mupfiss as previously described liu et al 2013a in short the system has four filtration lines in parallel with water meters in each line to measure the volume of water flow filtrated the ss were sampled by filtering approximately 200 l of water through glass fiber filters whatman 1822 047 1 2 μm over a period of 3 h under tap pressure 2 0 bar the filter pore size was selected according to our previous study liu et al 2013a before each sampling the water tap was flushed until a constant temperature at the tap to make sure the water from distribution system was taken 5 min s for a typical dutch household the sampling of suspended solids was conducted over three time periods before 1 month t0 in march during at the 1st 2nd and 3rd week immediately after the introduction of new treatment steps t3 weeks in april and stabilized after treatment upgrades 6 months t6 months in october comply with the stable climate temperature in the three different sampling periods at the study area in the netherlands the temperature in the distribution system were also comparable 11 15 c therefore the samples from both the source ground water and the distribution sites were not subjected to the potential influences of temperature fluctuations from seasons for each period triplicate samples were obtained by running mupfiss on the same day of the week for three consecutive weeks at all sampling locations for each run of mupfiss four filters were collected in parallel three of which were sent for tss elements and atp dna analysis respectively the 4th filter was set as back up in case of any filter broken during the sampling for t6 months the third time sampling was contaminated therefore results from duplicate samples were presented in total 32 samples were collected for the whole period of this study at each location 12 from t0 12 from t3 weeks 8 from t6 month which resulted in 128 filters from all locations 32 4 128 for each parameter of tss elements and atp dna sequencing 32 filters have been analyzed every time water samples were collected together with the mupfis run from the nearest tap 32 water samples along with the filter samples 2 3 sample preparation four samples can be obtained by each mupfis run for different analyses the filters for particle associated bacteria analysis were inverted and submerged into 5 ml of autoclaved tap water with glass beads immediately after filtration as described previously liu et al 2013a 2016 all of the samples were maintained in a cooling box and transported to the laboratory within 2 h after sampling the bacteria were detached from the particles by a low energy ultrasonic treatment performed 3 times for 2 min each branson ultrasonic water bath 43 khz 180 w power output 10 l sonication chamber the obtained suspensions were used for particle associated bacteria pab quantification and dna extraction the other filters were kept for total suspended solids tss and elemental composition analyses 2 4 sample analysis 2 4 1 total and volatile suspended solids analysis tss and vss suspended material is collected on the filter for mass measurement prior to filtration filters were pre dried in the oven for 2 h at 105 c gravimetric analyses were conducted by weighing the filters before and after filtration drying at 105 c providing the tss and after a second filtration combusting in a muffle furnace at 550 c for 2 h providing the vss american water works association 1998 2 4 2 inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms concentrations of several elements in the samples generated using sequential extractions and filtration experiments utilizing filters with varying sizes were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms perkinelmer elan drc e icp ms the elements quantified in these measurements included iron fe calcium ca and manganese mn quality control samples including laboratory fortified blanks and laboratory fortified samples were performed for every 10 samples analyzed average elemental recoveries ranged from 85 2 to 92 8 for the laboratory fortified samples 2 4 3 adenosine triphosphate atp to study the biological properties of collected suspended solids ss the suspension obtained after the above described pre treatment was analyzed according to adenosine triphosphate atp content the atp of ss was defined as attached atp a atp and measured as previously described liu et al 2013a in short the released atp from cells by nucleotide releasing buffer nrb celsis was measured by the intensity of the emitted light in a luminometer celsis advance calibrated with solutions of free atp celsis in autoclaved tap water following the procedure as given by the manufacturer 2 4 4 dna extraction and 454 pyrosequencing dna was extracted from the suspension using the fastdna spin kit for soil q biogene mp biomedicals solon oh usa according to the manufacturer s instructions hwang et al 2011 tamaki et al 2011 and was amplified with the bacterium specific forward primer 27 f and the reverse primer 534r hong et al 2010 dna extraction were formed on unused filters to be used as blank none of which contained sufficient dna performing downstream sequencing analysis the 454 pyrosequencing was performed with a 454 life sciences gs flx series genome sequencer roche switzerland the obtained dna sequences were deposited in the ddbj sequence read archive accession number prjna498802 2 4 5 sequencing data processing the sequences generated from pyrosequencing were processed by removing low quality sequence ends threshold q 20 primers and singleton uchime software was used to identify and remove chimeras edgar et al 2011 afterwards the sequences were trimmed resulting in an average sequence length of 230 bp the merged alignments of the sequences were obtained via the infernal aligner from the ribosomal database project rdp pyrosequencing pipeline http pyro cme msu edu and the nast alignment tool from greengenes based on the software developed by the biotechnology center at the university of illinois ui http acai igb uiuc edu bio merge nast infernal html the rdp classifier was used for the taxonomical assignments of the aligned 454 pyrosequences at the 97 sequence similarity cut off the total pab communities from the different sampling points were analyzed for the number of operational taxonomic units otus species richness and biodiversity using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime program caporaso et al 2010 core otus were defined as the otus with a cutoff of relative abundance 1 in each sampling period the core genus is defined corresponded to taxonomy information of the core otus alpha diversity indices were calculated based on the rarefied otu table at a depth of 5000 sequences per sample rarefaction analysis beta diversity comparison was calculated at sequence depth of 1046 which could cover all the sequenced samples the unweighted and weighted unifrac distance matrices were constructed from the phylogenetic tree and used to conduct the principal coordinate analyses pcoa using r vegan package noyce et al 2016 venn diagrams were drawn using r venndiagram package to analyze overlapped and unique otus among different sampling locations at each sampling period chen and boutros 2011 heatmap was implemented by r heatmap packages kolde 2013 2 4 6 statistically analysis different statistical tools were applied using past and r vegan package including 1 one way analysis of variance anova tests to determine the significance of differences on physicochemical and microbiological parameters 2 one way permutational analysis of variance permanova based on bray curtis similarity matrices to test the significance of differences regarding the beta diversity of bacterial communities anderson and walsh 2013 the differences were considered significant when the p value was lower than 0 05 p 0 05 3 results 3 1 water quality improvements generally the water quality clearly improved after upgrading the treatments table 1 turbidity removal improved by more than 50 p 0 05 meanwhile 15 35 p 0 05 and 7 more toc ca and mg were further removed respectively the nh4 fe and mn that were detected before were under the detection limit after upgraded treatments p 0 05 about 20 extra active biomass reduction p 0 05 as quantified by both atp and tcc was achieved by the introduction of additional treatments a stable ph was maintained by co2 dosing thus the most noticeable water quality improvement is the ca concentration reduction 3 2 suspended particles in this drinking water supply system up to 40 μg l 1 tss was detected fig 1 the value of tss at the treatment plant decreased slightly after introducing the additional treatments t3 weeks by 11 p 0 05 another significant decrease was further achieved when the additional treatments were applied for 6 months t6 months by 91 p 0 05 during the distribution of water under the regular conditions at t0 the tss decreased along the distribution network from treatment plant 40 μg l 1 to ds3 10 μg l 1 after introducing additional treatments although tss reduction was achieved after 6 months at the three locations in the distribution system at t6 months by 3 13 comparing to t0 p 0 05 at t3 weeks the tss levels were comparable between treatment plants and distribution sites while at t6 months the tss levels increased slightly from treatment plant to distribution sites not significant p 0 05 a remarkable initial increase was observed during the switching of the supply water quality at t3 weeks by 50 260 comparing to t0 p 0 05 based on the change of tss at the same locations in time one could see an increase at t3 weeks compared to t0 which might indicate remobilization of tss from the network due to destabilization processes looking into the fractions of tss fss and vss fig 1 it is observed that the vss at t0 and t3 weeks was higher than the concentration of vss at t6 months at the treatment plant meanwhile in distribution system the vss fraction at t3 weeks is higher than at t0 and t6 months indicating the biological nature of destabilization and remobilization of suspended solids during the transitional period consistent with the observations on tss changes the elemental analysis showed the same decrease along distribution system under regular distribution conditions at t0 sum of fe mn and ca showed as concentrations for each element in fig 2 the elemental composition results revealed that the decreased tss may relate to the decrease of fe from treatment plant to ds3 where ca and mn remained the similar concentrations during the introduction of additional treatments t3 weeks there was no significant changes regarding the concentrations of fe ca and mn at treatment plant where all concentrations decreased significantly at t6 months p 0 05 in the distribution system clear improvements were observed as decrease of fe mn and ca concentrations at all distribution sites at t6 months after 6 months operation of introduced treatments similar as observed at t0 at t6 months concentrations of fe decreased while the concentrations of mn and ca remained similar from treatment plant to locations in distribution system in the distribution system at t3 weeks mn increased by 130 250 when fe and ca remained stable especially at ds1 the mn concentration was more than 3 times higher than at treatment plant but decreased to the similar concentrations as treatment plant at ds2 and ds3 which were still much higher than mn concentration at the same location at t0 and t6 months 3 3 quantification of suspended particle associated bacteria a atp the active biomass associated with suspended solids were measured by atp and represented as attached atp a atp per mass of suspended solids ng mg 1 fig 3 the a atp concentration increased during distribution at the three time slots however at t3 weeks shortly after treatment adaption the initial a atp increased at the treatment and subsequently the increase of a atp was significantly higher compared to t0 and t6 months generally a atp initially increased at t3 weeks by 95 230 compared to t0 and then decreased at t6 months below its original values by 25 46 compared to t0 regardless of the sampling period it was observed that the further going into the distribution system the higher the a atp of the suspended solids at the treatment plant the changes of a atp in time t0 t3 weeks and t6 months were different from observations on tss that the a atp already showed an increase at t3 weeks when tss slightly decreased not significant while the changes of a atp at the distribution sites were consistent with that of tss in space the constant and significant increases of a atp from treatment plant to distribution sites were also different from the changes of tss which was especially true for the observations at t0 3 4 communities of bacteria associated with suspended particles in total 148 922 16s rrna pyrosequences were obtained and further assigned as 4918 otus based on a similarity cutoff of 97 the rarefaction curve reached a plateau after 5000 sequence reads were obtained indicating that enough sample coverage was obtained for most of the samples fig s2 the obtained sequences were assigned to 20 phyla fig s3 proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum which accounted for 42 93 of the total otus across all samples within proteobacteria alphaproteobacteria 4 78 gammaproteobacteria 4 53 and betaproteobacteria 1 41 were the most abundant classes at the genus level the detected otus were mainly composed of sphingomonas spp 0 43 polaromonas spp 0 35 legionella spp 0 29 nitrospira spp 0 27 sphingobium spp 0 22 and pseudomonas spp 0 21 fig 4 at t0 before upgrading the treatments polaromonas spp 35 and pseudomonas spp 21 were the most abundant genera at the treatment plant the microbial community remained relatively stable during distribution within which methylosinus spp 6 10 was the main member when it comes to the core otus defined as otus with relative abundance greater than 1 23 otus were found across all samples among the core otus at ds1 ds2 and ds3 9 17 10 17 and 9 18 otus were present respectively in the treated water 11 core otus fig s4a in the distribution system 14 17 core otus were shared by all locations ds1 ds2 and ds3 in contrast at t3 weeks during the treatment upgrading legionella spp 28 was the most abundant genus at the treatment plant comparing this to t0 the microbial community of suspended particle associated bacteria in the distribution system showed a wider variation fig 4 nitrospira spp 27 legionella spp 29 and polaromonas spp 31 were the dominating genera at ds1 ds2 and ds3 respectively fig 4 in total 33 core otus were found in all samples among which 6 18 12 16 and 5 17 core otus at ds1 ds2 and ds3 were present at the treatment plant 15 core otus fig s4b however only 7 17 core otus were shared by the three locations at t6 months sphingomonas spp 43 and sphingobium spp 22 were dominant at the treatment plant compared to t3 weeks the bacterial communities became relatively stable after 6 months operation of the upgraded treatments figs 4 and 5 among the 3 locations sphingomonas spp 17 23 was the main member except acinetobacter spp 38 accounted for the highest abundance at ds3 regarding the core otus 23 core otus were found in all samples 11 19 9 13 and 6 8 core otus at ds1 ds2 and ds3 were present at treatment plant 11 core otus respectively fig s4c moreover 6 core otus were shared by the three locations in the distribution system average 13 core otus the principal coordinates analysis pcoa using unweighted and weighted unifrac distance showed clear differences among the three periods of t0 t3 weeks and t6 months permanova f 9 643 p 0 001 which fell into three clusters fig 5 and fig s6 the cluster of t6 months showed an undeniable distance from the other two clusters dt0 t3 weeks 0 34 0 06 dt0 t6 months 0 47 0 05 dt3 weeks t6 months 0 47 0 05 noticeably the communities of bacteria associated with suspended particles at the treatment plant at t0 were similar to that of t3 weeks permanova f 22 71 p 0 100 which were significantly different from those of t6 months permanova f 18 06 p 0 003 moreover across the three locations in the distribution system high similarity was found for bacterial communities before treatment upgrades at t0 permanova f 2 002 p 0 05 and 6 months after treatment upgrades at t6 months permanova f 1 671 p 0 05 while sharp variations were observed right after treatment upgrading at t3 weeks permanova f 8 381 p 0 003 figs 4 and 5 4 discussion from a long perspective in this case after 6 months the upgrading of treatments clearly improved the water quality however it is important to notice the so called transition effects during the initial stage of switching i e during the first 3 weeks which is defined as water quality deterioration caused by the physiochemical and microbiological characteristic changes of the supply water quality liu et al 2017b wu et al 2015 for the very first time this study captured the effects of changing supply water quality on the water quality deterioration indirectly through studying the suspended particles over three periods t0 before upgrade treatments t3 weeks during upgrade treatments and t6 months after upgrade treatments 4 1 t0 suspended particles from treatment plant settled during distribution comparing the suspended particle associated bacteria pab at the treatment plant and distribution sites the sharing of core membership up to 75 and high similarity of the bacterial community pcoa fig 5 revealed that under regular operation at t0 the pab present in the distribution system mainly originated from the pab in the treated water this finding is consistent with our previous studies in the dutch unchlorinated drinking water supply system that assessed the formation of different niches in the distribution system liu et al 2014 and the origin of bacteria in drinking water liu et al 2018 illustrating that the suspended particles in the distribution system are part of the suspended particles entering and flowing through the distribution networks meanwhile the total suspended solids tss decreased from the treatment plant along the distance in the distribution system this indicated that the suspended solids ss in the treated water entering the distribution system partly settled in the network because of the precipitation of metal oxides or calcium carbonates post flocculation or biological growth that led to particle aggregation gauthier et al 1999 the elemental composition results revealed the possible precipitation of fe and mn by a decrease in fe and mn concentrations while the a atp results revealed the possible biological growth by an increase of atp when going further into the distribution system from treatment plant to ds3 4 2 t3 weeks changing supply water quality and transition effects during changes to the supply water quality t3 weeks previously reported discolored water events li et al 2010 and public health problems hanna attisha et al 2016 were not found in the present study the transition effects caused by the changing of supply water quality and the destabilization of established physiochemical and microbiological equilibrium in dwds were captured by monitoring the pre concentrated suspended solids regarding the timeline of destabilization it happened right after the introduction of the new treatments within 1st week which lasted three weeks or longer 4 2 1 physicochemical deterioration at t3 weeks after introducing upgraded treatments one of the clear improvements was the decreased tss at the treatment plant compared to the tss at t0 at t3 weeks when there is slightly less tss entering the distribution system it is remarkable to observe that more tss were collected in the distribution system compared to tss collected at t0 suggesting the potential contribution of suspended particles release from the distribution system such release of suspended particles may come from destabilization of biofilm loose deposits or pipe scales caused by changes in the water characteristics liu et al 2017b makris et al 2014 the loss of clear trend of tss in space from treatment plant to ds3 and the large variations of tss values measured at each distribution site at t3 weeks might be caused by the destabilization of uneven distributed loose deposits and biofilm in the network and the variable local hydraulics douterelo et al 2013 liu et al 2014 regarding the chemical parameters the same trend as seen for the tss was observed for mn less particulate mn entered the distribution system but a dramatic increase in particulate mn was observed in the distribution system at t3 weeks compared to at t0 especially at ds1 together the increase of tss and particulate mn in the distribution system indicates that the release of suspended particles from the distribution system likely comes from the resuspension of loose deposits and or the detachment of biofilm as previous studies have found that loose deposits and biofilms were hotspots for mn accumulation cerrato et al 2006 liu et al 2017a 4 2 2 microbiological deterioration at each location in the distribution system the a atp was much higher at t3 weeks than at t0 which is consistent with the observation on vss representing biological particulates fig 1 and mn as mentioned above however because the a atp at the treatment plant was also increased due to the destabilization of treatments e g last step sand filtration it is difficult to distinguish the observed increases of a atp at distribution sites at t3 weeks were caused by either higher a atp in the treated water or the release of a atp from the distribution system the latter should be the case because the community of bacteria associated with suspended particles at the treatment plant remained very similar to t0 both of which may originate from the release of particles from the last step sand filters but the increased a atp in the distribution system has a totally different community compared to that of t0 pcoa clusters fig 5 p 0 05 which contributed by the release of biomass from loose deposits or biofilm this can also be supported by the fact that leg ionella spp which was commonly detected in drinking water biofilms richards et al 2015 rodríguez martínez et al 2015 was most abundant in the treated water at t3 weeks regarding the increase of a atp at the treatment plant most likely it was caused by biomass detachment from the sand filters during the application of new treatments pinto et al 2012 while the high similarity among bacterial communities does not mean no changes on the bacterial community composition because the changes of certain member otus in the community might not be revealed by the similarity analysis of pcoa legendre and anderson 1999 the community of suspended particle associated bacteria across different locations clustered together demonstrated stable microbial community composition and structure at t0 however at t3 weeks the observation of different dominant genera and the dissimilarity across different locations in the distribution system especially the dissimilarity observed for each location between t0 and t3 weeks indicated the occurrence of pronounced disturbances because of the distribution of quality improved water this is because the microbial communities in drinking water are sensitive to water quality changes i e disinfectants nutrients concentration and composition which inducing different selection pressures on microbial population and community diversification gomez alvarez et al 2016 for example in cases of water quality improvements e g aoc reduction the biological activity in the water and the biofilm will decrease van der kooij 1992 van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 liu et al 2013b as a result the biomass and eps production will be reduced which will lead to a reduction of the bio adhesion to the attached surface and cause the release of biofilm into bulk water liu et al 2017a such release of biofilm into drinking water can be problematic since biofilm is reservoir for pathogens in drinking water wingender and flemming 2011 although the loose deposits and biofilm sampling was not included in this study the changes in core community members at t3 weeks gives a possible indication for the destabilization of dwds microbial ecology e g legionella spp polaromonas spp and nitrospira spp legionella spp was commonly detected in drinking water biofilms richards et al 2015 rodríguez martínez et al 2015 the increase in its relative abundance and a atp at t3 weeks indicates the possible release of biofilm from the distribution system into bulk water subjected to the changes in supply water quality legionella spp a member of this genus widely known to be an opportunistic pathogen i e legionella pneumphila falkinham et al 2015 richards et al 2015 however the detection of legionella spp at the genus level does not indicate bio safety problems especially in the case in the netherlands because the detected member may not be the pathogenic species as scanned earlier in dutch drinking water systems van der wielen and van der kooij 2013 polaromonas spp have been widely observed in ultraoligotrophic freshwater environments magic knezev et al 2009 at t0 polaromonas spp was detected in high abundance 35 at the treatment plant while they decreased to below 5 in the distribution system our previous study of the dutch unchlorinated drinking water system found that polaromonas spp in bulk water in which study it is also found that polaromonas spp was detected in loose deposits sampled by flushing distribution pipes through hydrant but not in pipe wall biofilms in terms of core genus liu et al 2014 when it comes to t3 weeks the relative abundance of polaromonas spp lessened 2 at the treatment plant but was much greater 2 31 in the distribution system compared to t0 especially at ds3 confirming the potential contribution release of loose deposits to the increase in tss at the taps similarly nitrospira spp which accounted for an abundance in the distribution system at t3 weeks especially at ds1 was only detected in loose deposits and suspended solids as core genus liu et al 2014 indicating the possible release of loose deposits contributing to the increase in tss after introducing quality improved supply water 4 3 t6 months re stabilizing of dwds microbial ecology at t6 months after 6 months operation of the upgraded treatments the spike in tss at t3 weeks faded away together with the related particulate mn turbidity a atp and the sudden changes in the community composition and structure comparing the results from t6 months to t0 clear improvements were observed with the decrease in tss particulate mn and a atp the less particle load entering distribution system will limit the accumulation of loose deposits in distribution system which will reduce the flushing frequency jan vreeburg et al 2008 the achieved stable improvements together with the stable bacterial community associated with particles from the treatment plant to the locations across the distribution systems indicated that the dependence among treatment plant and distribution sites and the stabilization of the drinking water distribution system has been re established it is known that the destabilization and re stabilization of microbial ecology may take time allison and martiny 2008 liu et al 2017b but no information is available from real cases on how long it will take based on the present study it is clear that the destabilization occurred right after introducing new treatments lasting for more than three weeks while the re stabilization was achieved after 6 months further investigation is needed to determine whether a shorter period for re stabilization can be achieved in contrast to the trend of tss decrease along the distances at t0 the tss became slightly higher while going further into the distribution system the different trends observed may be because of the better removal of particles after introducing new treatments when the particles in the treated water reduced in size and number the dominating process during distribution was no longer particle sedimentation but the growing of attached bacteria on the suspended particles liu et al 2014 this is consistent with the corresponding slight increase in a atp and a similar community of suspended particle associated bacteria from the treatment plant to different sampling sites in the distribution system at t6 months in the re stabilized water supply system the top five dominant genera became sphingomonas spp pseudomonas spp sphingobium spp sphingopyxis spp and novosphingobium spp in descending order all of which are commonly found in drinking water systems douterelo et al 2017 ling et al 2016 liu et al 2014 2016 the different core genera can be explained by the new treatments and different operations of the treatment steps filters pinto et al 2012 which further indicate the possibility of managing drinking water microbes through engineering approaches liu et al 2018 pinto et al 2012 wang et al 2013 4 4 capture and investigate transition effects through studying suspended solids based on this study the transitional effects can be generally summarized as 1 de stabilization observed as a spike in the tss after switching to upgraded treatments which might associate with the release from biofilm and or loose deposits in a distribution system 2 re stabilization observed as improvements after operating the upgraded treatments for a period of six months special attention should be given to the de stabilization and release of loose deposits and biofilm into bulk water because both niches are hotspots for heavy metals and opportunistic pathogens torvinen et al 2004 wang et al 2012 the analysis on opportunistic pathogens was not included in this study it is highly recommended to be investigated in future studies worldwide changing supply water quality may cause transitional effects which could lead to serious water quality problems from an esthetic quality perspective e g discoloration to biological and chemical safety issues e g pb and legionnaires disease liu et al 2017b zahran et al 2018 such transitional effects deserve more attention yet there is no methodology illustrating how the transition effects can be captured and investigated the present study demonstrated an indirect approach by studying the physiochemical and microbiological characteristics of suspended solids over the different periods t0 t3 weeks and t6 months from treatment plant to distribution sites in a full scale drinking water supply system which successfully overcame the challenges of field distribution network accessibility non destructive and dilution effects concentrated liu et al 2017b from a broader perspective this methodology can be adapted and applied for transitional effects evaluation in other drinking water supply systems subjected to changes of either source water or treatment processes by characterizing suspended particles in time t0 t3 weeks t6 months and space from treatment plant to distribution sites the following critical questions that correlated with important drinking water quality issues for customers can be answered 1 whether transitional effects occur have the distribution system loose deposits and biofilm destabilized and released into bulk water and how much these questions can be answered by comparing the load of suspended particles tss 2 what has been released into bulk water will the release lead to serious water quality problems risks e g pb opportunistic pathogens are there any suggestions should be given to water utility managers and or customers these questions can be answered by analyzing the changes on physiochemical and microbiological composition regarding the suspended particles 3 where the released tss may originate from how should the problem be managed finding the origin of released tss will be very important for the utility to find proper managing strategy to prevent unwanted water quality problems at customers taps the source of released tss can be tracked using the bacterial community fingerprint by sourcetracker method we have demonstrated the application of sourcetracker method to assess the origin of bacteria in distribution system and tap water in our early work liu et al 2018 for future applications it is recommended that when the distribution system is accessible studying the suspended solids generated by de stabilization together with the sampling of loose deposits and biofilm from the target distribution network by such complete study the spiked tss can be source tracked to its origin based on which the corresponding strategy can be selected such as flushing the distribution system if the tss originated from loose deposits or ice pigging if the tss originated from pipe wall biofilm another recommendation is that the suspended solids should be monitored and sampled online online filtration every 1 h or 2 3 h because both the quantity and characteristics of suspended solids in the distribution system are highly dependent on the hydraulic conditions fish et al 2017 matsui et al 2007 sekar et al 2012 it has been reported that the diurnal hydraulic changes had significant effects on the bulk water bacterial community bautista de los santos et al 2016 besides the obtained online results will be able to offer high resolution background to distinguish the irregular de stabilization from regular hydraulic disturbances considering the non periodic release of biofilm and loose deposits the online system will increase the success rate and avoid the possibility of missing the release events comparing to take suspended solids samples offline 5 conclusions through characterizing the suspended particles before during and after introducing additional treatment steps we have indirectly investigated the transitional effects at three locations in field distribution network the following conclusions were drawn from this study despite the difficulties for conducting field studies it is encouraged to have more sampling locations for a global understanding throughout the network the water quality significantly improved after 6 months time operation of the additional treatments remarkably temporarily water quality deterioration with no consumers effect was observed at the initial stage when the quality improved treated water distributed into the network at t3 weeks observed as a spike of total suspended solids tss 50 260 active biomass atp 95 230 and inorganic elements e g mn 130 250 pyrosequencing results revealed sharp differences in microbial community composition and structure for the bacteria associated with suspended particles between t0 and t3 weeks which re stabilized after 6 months at t6 months though the transitional effects were captured the study shows that the introduction of softening and additional filtration did not have an effect on water quality for the consumer which improved considerably after 6 months

18397,worldwide it is common that the drinking water distribution systems dwdss may be subjected to changes of supply water quality due to the needs of upgrading the treatment processes or switching the source water however the potential impacts of quality changed supply water on the stabilized ecological niches within dwdss and the associated water quality deterioration risks were poorly documented in the present study such transition effects caused by changing the supply water quality that resulted from destabilization of biofilm and loose deposits in dwds were investigated by analyzing the physiochemical and microbiological characteristics of suspended particles before t0 during t3 weeks and after upgrading the treatments t6 months in an unchlorinated dwds in the netherlands our results demonstrated that after 6 months time the upgraded treatments significantly improved the water quality remarkably water quality deterioration was observed at the initial stage when the quality improved treated water distributed into the network at t3 weeks observed as a spike of total suspended solids tss 50 260 active biomass atp 95 230 and inorganic elements e g mn 130 250 furthermore pyrosequencing results revealed sharp differences in microbial community composition and structure for the bacteria associated with suspended particles between t0 and t3 weeks which re stabilized after 6 months at t6 months the successful capture of transition effects was especially confirmed by the domination of nitrospira spp and polaromonas spp in the distribution system at t3 weeks which were detected at rather low relative abundance at treatment plant though the transitional effects were captured this study shows that the introduction of softening and additional filtration did not have an effect on the water quality for the consumer which improved considerably after 6 months period the methodology of monitoring suspended particles with mupfiss and additional analysis is capable of detecting transitional effects by monitoring the dynamics of suspended particles and its physiochemical and microbiological composition graphical abstract image 1 keywords upgrading treatments drinking water distribution system transition effects suspended solids water quality deterioration risks 1 introduction drinking water treatments remove contaminants present in source water to make water potable in both developing and industrialized nations a growing number of contaminants are entering water supplies from human activity from pathogen virus heavy metals to micropollutants shannon et al 2008 ternes et al 2015 consequently public health environmental concerns and growing constraint to optimize the esthetical and comfort quality for the consumers e g drinking water without chlorine taste and low in hardness drive efforts to further treat waters previously considered clean which has greatly promoted the development of water treatment science and technology over past decades shannon et al 2008 in practice the developments have been focusing on the upgrades of treatments and improvements of supply water quality regarding physiochemical and microbiological parameters e g the concentrations of elements composition nutrients concentration cell number and microbial community liu et al 2019 xing et al 2018b however the quality changed drinking water still has to be delivered to customers taps through the old distribution systems in which biofilm and loose deposits have been established for decades liu et al 2013b in drinking water distribution systems dwdss over 98 of the total biomass was found to be contributed by the bacteria accumulated within loose deposits and biofilm liu et al 2014 in particular the biofilm in dwdss has been widely documented because of its potential health risks batté et al 2003 chaves simões and simões 2013 flemming et al 2002 van der wende et al 1989 wingender and flemming 2011 as reported biofilm can be as much as 108 cfu cm 2 batté et al 2003 107 cells cm 2 lehtola et al 2006 or 103 pg atp cm 2 lehtola et al 2006 depending on the measuring methods the presence of biofilm promoted the deposition of elements such as manganese mn and calcium ca in a distribution system liu et al 2017a sly et al 1990 similarly loose deposits reported to be reservoirs for inorganic elements organic nutrients and bacteria gauthier et al 1999 lehtola et al 2004 liu et al 2017a zacheus et al 2001 can be as much as 24 5 g m 1 in a full scale distribution system carrière et al 2005 and harbor comparable biomass 671 3738 ng m 1 atp to biofilm 534 23 ng m 1 atp liu et al 2014 under the regular water supply conditions there is an equilibrium between the water and the solid phases in the network e g loose deposits and biofilm it is a common sense that water quality may deteriorate during distribution the extreme cases have been observed and reported as dirty water sly et al 1990 and discoloration vreeburg and boxall 2007 xing et al 2018a for distribution of quality changed water through old pipes the equilibrium will be disturbed and material harbored by distribution pipes e g pipe scales biofilm and loose deposits will be destabilized and released into water column which can be potentially harmful feazel et al 2009 li et al 2010 liu et al 2017b torvinen et al 2004 as previously defined such destabilization may be caused by physiochemical and microbiological water quality changes that break the established forces balance in pipe scales biofilm and loose deposits such as physical destabilization e g reducing the weight of particles causing loose deposits resuspension chemical destabilization e g changes of ph redox and ion composition can remobilize contaminants bound by pipe scales on metal pipes via desorption and or dissolution and microbiological destabilization e g changes of nutrients concentration and composition can influence the microbial community and function in biofilm liu et al 2017b it has been quantified that the release of 20 of either biofilm or loose deposits will cause significant changes in the bulk water bacterial community liu et al 2017a in practice one example is the occurrence of red water in large areas of beijing in 2008 when the city switched to better source water transported 1400 km from southern china where increased sulfate in supply water caused microbial community composition changes revealed by increase in sulfur oxidizing bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria and iron oxidizing bacteria and red water events associated with high iron concentrations li et al 2010 recently in the flint drinking water crisis in michigan u s elevated blood lead levels were detected in children after water source changes hanna attisha et al 2016 which has been attributed to the missing of orthophosphate corrosion inhibitor and lead leaching from the aging pipes into water column however until now our understanding of the water quality deterioration risk associated with biofilm and loose deposits destabilization in distribution systems during switching supply water quality is limited this has been mainly attributed to the lack of accessibility of real distribution systems for study berry et al 2006 and the dilution effects of large volumes of water that keep flowing through the system increasing the difficulty of detection liu et al 2017b the suspended particles especially the associated bacteria have been used to study the effects of mixing water on bacterial community liu et al 2016 and used as sourcetracker to study the contribution of biofilm detachment and loose deposits resuspension to the tap water bacteria liu et al 2018 to overcome the above mentioned difficulties monitoring the variations of suspended solids characteristics can be used as an indirect approach without deconstructing distribution pipes or interrupting water supply services while still being able to detect the changes with serious implications for health risks and esthetical water quality this study followed the upgrade of treatments in an unchlorinated drinking water supply system in the netherlands monitored the suspended solids in treated and distributed water before t0 during t3 weeks and after the treatment upgrade t6 months the objective was to capture and study the potential release of elements and biomass caused by biofilm and loose deposits destabilization subjected to the changes in the supply water quality caused by the introduction of new softening and rapid sand filtration steps for example decrease of hardness and suspended particle load through monitoring and characterizing suspended particles in the drinking water leaves treatment plant and distributed water at the customers taps 2 material and methods 2 1 treatment plant and sampling locations the drinking water treatment plant produces drinking water from anoxic groundwater 3 8 mm3 year before introducing new treatment steps softening second rapid sand filtration and adding carbon dioxide the water was treated by aeration and rapid sand filtration before being pumped into the distribution system the sampling locations were selected at the treatment plant before the water entered the distribution system tp 0 km locations at customers taps at ds1 5 km to tp ds2 11 km to tp and ds3 17 km to tp the distribution networks in the study area is 110 mm pvc u pipes water main pipe the treatment processes and sampling locations are illustrated in fig s1 the produced water quality before and after treatment changes is given in table 1 2 2 sampling of suspended solids the suspended solids ss were sampled by multiple particle filtration systems mupfiss as previously described liu et al 2013a in short the system has four filtration lines in parallel with water meters in each line to measure the volume of water flow filtrated the ss were sampled by filtering approximately 200 l of water through glass fiber filters whatman 1822 047 1 2 μm over a period of 3 h under tap pressure 2 0 bar the filter pore size was selected according to our previous study liu et al 2013a before each sampling the water tap was flushed until a constant temperature at the tap to make sure the water from distribution system was taken 5 min s for a typical dutch household the sampling of suspended solids was conducted over three time periods before 1 month t0 in march during at the 1st 2nd and 3rd week immediately after the introduction of new treatment steps t3 weeks in april and stabilized after treatment upgrades 6 months t6 months in october comply with the stable climate temperature in the three different sampling periods at the study area in the netherlands the temperature in the distribution system were also comparable 11 15 c therefore the samples from both the source ground water and the distribution sites were not subjected to the potential influences of temperature fluctuations from seasons for each period triplicate samples were obtained by running mupfiss on the same day of the week for three consecutive weeks at all sampling locations for each run of mupfiss four filters were collected in parallel three of which were sent for tss elements and atp dna analysis respectively the 4th filter was set as back up in case of any filter broken during the sampling for t6 months the third time sampling was contaminated therefore results from duplicate samples were presented in total 32 samples were collected for the whole period of this study at each location 12 from t0 12 from t3 weeks 8 from t6 month which resulted in 128 filters from all locations 32 4 128 for each parameter of tss elements and atp dna sequencing 32 filters have been analyzed every time water samples were collected together with the mupfis run from the nearest tap 32 water samples along with the filter samples 2 3 sample preparation four samples can be obtained by each mupfis run for different analyses the filters for particle associated bacteria analysis were inverted and submerged into 5 ml of autoclaved tap water with glass beads immediately after filtration as described previously liu et al 2013a 2016 all of the samples were maintained in a cooling box and transported to the laboratory within 2 h after sampling the bacteria were detached from the particles by a low energy ultrasonic treatment performed 3 times for 2 min each branson ultrasonic water bath 43 khz 180 w power output 10 l sonication chamber the obtained suspensions were used for particle associated bacteria pab quantification and dna extraction the other filters were kept for total suspended solids tss and elemental composition analyses 2 4 sample analysis 2 4 1 total and volatile suspended solids analysis tss and vss suspended material is collected on the filter for mass measurement prior to filtration filters were pre dried in the oven for 2 h at 105 c gravimetric analyses were conducted by weighing the filters before and after filtration drying at 105 c providing the tss and after a second filtration combusting in a muffle furnace at 550 c for 2 h providing the vss american water works association 1998 2 4 2 inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms concentrations of several elements in the samples generated using sequential extractions and filtration experiments utilizing filters with varying sizes were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms perkinelmer elan drc e icp ms the elements quantified in these measurements included iron fe calcium ca and manganese mn quality control samples including laboratory fortified blanks and laboratory fortified samples were performed for every 10 samples analyzed average elemental recoveries ranged from 85 2 to 92 8 for the laboratory fortified samples 2 4 3 adenosine triphosphate atp to study the biological properties of collected suspended solids ss the suspension obtained after the above described pre treatment was analyzed according to adenosine triphosphate atp content the atp of ss was defined as attached atp a atp and measured as previously described liu et al 2013a in short the released atp from cells by nucleotide releasing buffer nrb celsis was measured by the intensity of the emitted light in a luminometer celsis advance calibrated with solutions of free atp celsis in autoclaved tap water following the procedure as given by the manufacturer 2 4 4 dna extraction and 454 pyrosequencing dna was extracted from the suspension using the fastdna spin kit for soil q biogene mp biomedicals solon oh usa according to the manufacturer s instructions hwang et al 2011 tamaki et al 2011 and was amplified with the bacterium specific forward primer 27 f and the reverse primer 534r hong et al 2010 dna extraction were formed on unused filters to be used as blank none of which contained sufficient dna performing downstream sequencing analysis the 454 pyrosequencing was performed with a 454 life sciences gs flx series genome sequencer roche switzerland the obtained dna sequences were deposited in the ddbj sequence read archive accession number prjna498802 2 4 5 sequencing data processing the sequences generated from pyrosequencing were processed by removing low quality sequence ends threshold q 20 primers and singleton uchime software was used to identify and remove chimeras edgar et al 2011 afterwards the sequences were trimmed resulting in an average sequence length of 230 bp the merged alignments of the sequences were obtained via the infernal aligner from the ribosomal database project rdp pyrosequencing pipeline http pyro cme msu edu and the nast alignment tool from greengenes based on the software developed by the biotechnology center at the university of illinois ui http acai igb uiuc edu bio merge nast infernal html the rdp classifier was used for the taxonomical assignments of the aligned 454 pyrosequences at the 97 sequence similarity cut off the total pab communities from the different sampling points were analyzed for the number of operational taxonomic units otus species richness and biodiversity using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime program caporaso et al 2010 core otus were defined as the otus with a cutoff of relative abundance 1 in each sampling period the core genus is defined corresponded to taxonomy information of the core otus alpha diversity indices were calculated based on the rarefied otu table at a depth of 5000 sequences per sample rarefaction analysis beta diversity comparison was calculated at sequence depth of 1046 which could cover all the sequenced samples the unweighted and weighted unifrac distance matrices were constructed from the phylogenetic tree and used to conduct the principal coordinate analyses pcoa using r vegan package noyce et al 2016 venn diagrams were drawn using r venndiagram package to analyze overlapped and unique otus among different sampling locations at each sampling period chen and boutros 2011 heatmap was implemented by r heatmap packages kolde 2013 2 4 6 statistically analysis different statistical tools were applied using past and r vegan package including 1 one way analysis of variance anova tests to determine the significance of differences on physicochemical and microbiological parameters 2 one way permutational analysis of variance permanova based on bray curtis similarity matrices to test the significance of differences regarding the beta diversity of bacterial communities anderson and walsh 2013 the differences were considered significant when the p value was lower than 0 05 p 0 05 3 results 3 1 water quality improvements generally the water quality clearly improved after upgrading the treatments table 1 turbidity removal improved by more than 50 p 0 05 meanwhile 15 35 p 0 05 and 7 more toc ca and mg were further removed respectively the nh4 fe and mn that were detected before were under the detection limit after upgraded treatments p 0 05 about 20 extra active biomass reduction p 0 05 as quantified by both atp and tcc was achieved by the introduction of additional treatments a stable ph was maintained by co2 dosing thus the most noticeable water quality improvement is the ca concentration reduction 3 2 suspended particles in this drinking water supply system up to 40 μg l 1 tss was detected fig 1 the value of tss at the treatment plant decreased slightly after introducing the additional treatments t3 weeks by 11 p 0 05 another significant decrease was further achieved when the additional treatments were applied for 6 months t6 months by 91 p 0 05 during the distribution of water under the regular conditions at t0 the tss decreased along the distribution network from treatment plant 40 μg l 1 to ds3 10 μg l 1 after introducing additional treatments although tss reduction was achieved after 6 months at the three locations in the distribution system at t6 months by 3 13 comparing to t0 p 0 05 at t3 weeks the tss levels were comparable between treatment plants and distribution sites while at t6 months the tss levels increased slightly from treatment plant to distribution sites not significant p 0 05 a remarkable initial increase was observed during the switching of the supply water quality at t3 weeks by 50 260 comparing to t0 p 0 05 based on the change of tss at the same locations in time one could see an increase at t3 weeks compared to t0 which might indicate remobilization of tss from the network due to destabilization processes looking into the fractions of tss fss and vss fig 1 it is observed that the vss at t0 and t3 weeks was higher than the concentration of vss at t6 months at the treatment plant meanwhile in distribution system the vss fraction at t3 weeks is higher than at t0 and t6 months indicating the biological nature of destabilization and remobilization of suspended solids during the transitional period consistent with the observations on tss changes the elemental analysis showed the same decrease along distribution system under regular distribution conditions at t0 sum of fe mn and ca showed as concentrations for each element in fig 2 the elemental composition results revealed that the decreased tss may relate to the decrease of fe from treatment plant to ds3 where ca and mn remained the similar concentrations during the introduction of additional treatments t3 weeks there was no significant changes regarding the concentrations of fe ca and mn at treatment plant where all concentrations decreased significantly at t6 months p 0 05 in the distribution system clear improvements were observed as decrease of fe mn and ca concentrations at all distribution sites at t6 months after 6 months operation of introduced treatments similar as observed at t0 at t6 months concentrations of fe decreased while the concentrations of mn and ca remained similar from treatment plant to locations in distribution system in the distribution system at t3 weeks mn increased by 130 250 when fe and ca remained stable especially at ds1 the mn concentration was more than 3 times higher than at treatment plant but decreased to the similar concentrations as treatment plant at ds2 and ds3 which were still much higher than mn concentration at the same location at t0 and t6 months 3 3 quantification of suspended particle associated bacteria a atp the active biomass associated with suspended solids were measured by atp and represented as attached atp a atp per mass of suspended solids ng mg 1 fig 3 the a atp concentration increased during distribution at the three time slots however at t3 weeks shortly after treatment adaption the initial a atp increased at the treatment and subsequently the increase of a atp was significantly higher compared to t0 and t6 months generally a atp initially increased at t3 weeks by 95 230 compared to t0 and then decreased at t6 months below its original values by 25 46 compared to t0 regardless of the sampling period it was observed that the further going into the distribution system the higher the a atp of the suspended solids at the treatment plant the changes of a atp in time t0 t3 weeks and t6 months were different from observations on tss that the a atp already showed an increase at t3 weeks when tss slightly decreased not significant while the changes of a atp at the distribution sites were consistent with that of tss in space the constant and significant increases of a atp from treatment plant to distribution sites were also different from the changes of tss which was especially true for the observations at t0 3 4 communities of bacteria associated with suspended particles in total 148 922 16s rrna pyrosequences were obtained and further assigned as 4918 otus based on a similarity cutoff of 97 the rarefaction curve reached a plateau after 5000 sequence reads were obtained indicating that enough sample coverage was obtained for most of the samples fig s2 the obtained sequences were assigned to 20 phyla fig s3 proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum which accounted for 42 93 of the total otus across all samples within proteobacteria alphaproteobacteria 4 78 gammaproteobacteria 4 53 and betaproteobacteria 1 41 were the most abundant classes at the genus level the detected otus were mainly composed of sphingomonas spp 0 43 polaromonas spp 0 35 legionella spp 0 29 nitrospira spp 0 27 sphingobium spp 0 22 and pseudomonas spp 0 21 fig 4 at t0 before upgrading the treatments polaromonas spp 35 and pseudomonas spp 21 were the most abundant genera at the treatment plant the microbial community remained relatively stable during distribution within which methylosinus spp 6 10 was the main member when it comes to the core otus defined as otus with relative abundance greater than 1 23 otus were found across all samples among the core otus at ds1 ds2 and ds3 9 17 10 17 and 9 18 otus were present respectively in the treated water 11 core otus fig s4a in the distribution system 14 17 core otus were shared by all locations ds1 ds2 and ds3 in contrast at t3 weeks during the treatment upgrading legionella spp 28 was the most abundant genus at the treatment plant comparing this to t0 the microbial community of suspended particle associated bacteria in the distribution system showed a wider variation fig 4 nitrospira spp 27 legionella spp 29 and polaromonas spp 31 were the dominating genera at ds1 ds2 and ds3 respectively fig 4 in total 33 core otus were found in all samples among which 6 18 12 16 and 5 17 core otus at ds1 ds2 and ds3 were present at the treatment plant 15 core otus fig s4b however only 7 17 core otus were shared by the three locations at t6 months sphingomonas spp 43 and sphingobium spp 22 were dominant at the treatment plant compared to t3 weeks the bacterial communities became relatively stable after 6 months operation of the upgraded treatments figs 4 and 5 among the 3 locations sphingomonas spp 17 23 was the main member except acinetobacter spp 38 accounted for the highest abundance at ds3 regarding the core otus 23 core otus were found in all samples 11 19 9 13 and 6 8 core otus at ds1 ds2 and ds3 were present at treatment plant 11 core otus respectively fig s4c moreover 6 core otus were shared by the three locations in the distribution system average 13 core otus the principal coordinates analysis pcoa using unweighted and weighted unifrac distance showed clear differences among the three periods of t0 t3 weeks and t6 months permanova f 9 643 p 0 001 which fell into three clusters fig 5 and fig s6 the cluster of t6 months showed an undeniable distance from the other two clusters dt0 t3 weeks 0 34 0 06 dt0 t6 months 0 47 0 05 dt3 weeks t6 months 0 47 0 05 noticeably the communities of bacteria associated with suspended particles at the treatment plant at t0 were similar to that of t3 weeks permanova f 22

communities before treatment upgrades at t0 permanova f 2 002 p 0 05 and 6 months after treatment upgrades at t6 months permanova f 1 671 p 0 05 while sharp variations were observed right after treatment upgrading at t3 weeks permanova f 8 381 p 0 003 figs 4 and 5 4 discussion from a long perspective in this case after 6 months the upgrading of treatments clearly improved the water quality however it is important to notice the so called transition effects during the initial stage of switching i e during the first 3 weeks which is defined as water quality deterioration caused by the physiochemical and microbiological characteristic changes of the supply water quality liu et al 2017b wu et al 2015 for the very first time this study captured the effects of changing supply water quality on the water quality deterioration indirectly through studying the suspended particles over three periods t0 before upgrade treatments t3 weeks during upgrade treatments and t6 months after upgrade treatments 4 1 t0 suspended particles from treatment plant settled during distribution comparing the suspended particle associated bacteria pab at the treatment plant and distribution sites the sharing of core membership up to 75 and high similarity of the bacterial community pcoa fig 5 revealed that under regular operation at t0 the pab present in the distribution system mainly originated from the pab in the treated water this finding is consistent with our previous studies in the dutch unchlorinated drinking water supply system that assessed the formation of different niches in the distribution system liu et al 2014 and the origin of bacteria in drinking water liu et al 2018 illustrating that the suspended particles in the distribution system are part of the suspended particles entering and flowing through the distribution networks meanwhile the total suspended solids tss decreased from the treatment plant along the distance in the distribution system this indicated that the suspended solids ss in the treated water entering the distribution system partly settled in the network because of the precipitation of metal oxides or calcium carbonates post flocculation or biological growth that led to particle aggregation gauthier et al 1999 the elemental composition results revealed the possible precipitation of fe and mn by a decrease in fe and mn concentrations while the a atp results revealed the possible biological growth by an increase of atp when going further into the distribution system from treatment plant to ds3 4 2 t3 weeks changing supply water quality and transition effects during changes to the supply water quality t3 weeks previously reported discolored water events li et al 2010 and public health problems hanna attisha et al 2016 were not found in the present study the transition effects caused by the changing of supply water quality and the destabilization of established physiochemical and microbiological equilibrium in dwds were captured by monitoring the pre concentrated suspended solids regarding the timeline of destabilization it happened right after the introduction of the new treatments within 1st week which lasted three weeks or longer 4 2 1 physicochemical deterioration at t3 weeks after introducing upgraded treatments one of the clear improvements was the decreased tss at the treatment plant compared to the tss at t0 at t3 weeks when there is slightly less tss entering the distribution system it is remarkable to observe that more tss were collected in the distribution system compared to tss collected at t0 suggesting the potential contribution of suspended particles release from the distribution system such release of suspended particles may come from destabilization of biofilm loose deposits or pipe scales caused by changes in the water characteristics liu et al 2017b makris et al 2014 the loss of clear trend of tss in space from treatment plant to ds3 and the large variations of tss values measured at each distribution site at t3 weeks might be caused by the destabilization of uneven distributed loose deposits and biofilm in the network and the variable local hydraulics douterelo et al 2013 liu et al 2014 regarding the chemical parameters the same trend as seen for the tss was observed for mn less particulate mn entered the distribution system but a dramatic increase in particulate mn was observed in the distribution system at t3 weeks compared to at t0 especially at ds1 together the increase of tss and particulate mn in the distribution system indicates that the release of suspended particles from the distribution system likely comes from the resuspension of loose deposits and or the detachment of biofilm as previous studies have found that loose deposits and biofilms were hotspots for mn accumulation cerrato et al 2006 liu et al 2017a 4 2 2 microbiological deterioration at each location in the distribution system the a atp was much higher at t3 weeks than at t0 which is consistent with the observation on vss representing biological particulates fig 1 and mn as mentioned above however because the a atp at the treatment plant was also increased due to the destabilization of treatments e g last step sand filtration it is difficult to distinguish the observed increases of a atp at distribution sites at t3 weeks were caused by either higher a atp in the treated water or the release of a atp from the distribution system the latter should be the case because the community of bacteria associated with suspended particles at the treatment plant remained very similar to t0 both of which may originate from the release of particles from the last step sand filters but the increased a atp in the distribution system has a totally different community compared to that of t0 pcoa clusters fig 5 p 0 05 which contributed by the release of biomass from loose deposits or biofilm this can also be supported by the fact that leg ionella spp which was commonly detected in drinking water biofilms richards et al 2015 rodríguez martínez et al 2015 was most abundant in the treated water at t3 weeks regarding the increase of a atp at the treatment plant most likely it was caused by biomass detachment from the sand filters during the application of new treatments pinto et al 2012 while the high similarity among bacterial communities does not mean no changes on the bacterial community composition because the changes of certain member otus in the community might not be revealed by the similarity analysis of pcoa legendre and anderson 1999 the community of suspended particle associated bacteria across different locations clustered together demonstrated stable microbial community composition and structure at t0 however at t3 weeks the observation of different dominant genera and the dissimilarity across different locations in the distribution system especially the dissimilarity observed for each location between t0 and t3 weeks indicated the occurrence of pronounced disturbances because of the distribution of quality improved water this is because the microbial communities in drinking water are sensitive to water quality changes i e disinfectants nutrients concentration and composition which inducing different selection pressures on microbial population and community diversification gomez alvarez et al 2016 for example in cases of water quality improvements e g aoc reduction the biological activity in the water and the biofilm will decrease van der kooij 1992 van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 liu et al 2013b as a result the biomass and eps production will be reduced which will lead to a reduction of the bio adhesion to the attached surface and cause the release of biofilm into bulk water liu et al 2017a such release of biofilm into drinking water can be problematic since biofilm is reservoir for pathogens in drinking water wingender and flemming 2011 although the loose deposits and biofilm sampling was not included in this study the changes in core community members at t3 weeks gives a possible indication for the destabilization of dwds microbial ecology e g legionella spp polaromonas spp and nitrospira spp legionella spp was commonly detected in drinking water biofilms richards et al 2015 rodríguez martínez et al 2015 the increase in its relative abundance and a atp at t3 weeks indicates the possible release of biofilm from the distribution system into bulk water subjected to the changes in supply water quality legionella spp a member of this genus widely known to be an opportunistic pathogen i e legionella pneumphila falkinham et al 2015 richards et al 2015 however the detection of legionella spp at the genus level does not indicate bio safety problems especially in the case in the netherlands because the detected member may not be the pathogenic species as scanned earlier in dutch drinking water systems van der wielen and van der kooij 2013 polaromonas spp have been widely observed in ultraoligotrophic freshwater environments magic knezev et al 2009 at t0 polaromonas spp was detected in high abundance 35 at the treatment plant while they decreased to below 5 in the distribution system our previous study of the dutch unchlorinated drinking water system found that polaromonas spp in bulk water in which study it is also found that polaromonas spp was detected in loose deposits sampled by flushing distribution pipes through hydrant but not in pipe wall biofilms in terms of core genus liu et al 2014 when it comes to t3 weeks the relative abundance of polaromonas spp lessened 2 at the treatment plant but was much greater 2 31 in the distribution system compared to t0 especially at ds3 confirming the potential contribution release of loose deposits to the increase in tss at the taps similarly nitrospira spp which accounted for an abundance in the distribution system at t3 weeks especially at ds1 was only detected in loose deposits and suspended solids as core genus liu et al 2014 indicating the possible release of loose deposits contributing to the increase in tss after introducing quality improved supply water 4 3 t6 months re stabilizing of dwds microbial ecology at t6 months after 6 months operation of the upgraded treatments the spike in tss at t3 weeks faded away together with the related particulate mn turbidity a atp and the sudden changes in the community composition and structure comparing the results from t6 months to t0 clear improvements were observed with the decrease in tss particulate mn and a atp the less particle load entering distribution system will limit the accumulation of loose deposits in distribution system which will reduce the flushing frequency jan vreeburg et al 2008 the achieved stable improvements together with the stable bacterial community associated with particles from the treatment plant to the locations across the distribution systems indicated that the dependence among treatment plant and distribution sites and the stabilization of the drinking water distribution system has been re established it is known that the destabilization and re stabilization of microbial ecology may take time allison and martiny 2008 liu et al 2017b but no information is available from real cases on how long it will take based on the present study it is clear that the destabilization occurred right after introducing new treatments lasting for more than three weeks while the re stabilization was achieved after 6 months further investigation is needed to determine whether a shorter period for re stabilization can be achieved in contrast to the trend of tss decrease along the distances at t0 the tss became slightly higher while going further into the distribution system the different trends observed may be because of the better removal of particles after introducing new treatments when the particles in the treated water reduced in size and number the dominating process during distribution was no longer particle sedimentation but the growing of attached bacteria on the suspended particles liu et al 2014 this is consistent with the corresponding slight increase in a atp and a similar community of suspended particle associated bacteria from the treatment plant to different sampling sites in the distribution system at t6 months in the re stabilized water supply system the top five dominant genera became sphingomonas spp pseudomonas spp sphingobium spp sphingopyxis spp and novosphingobium spp in descending order all of which are commonly found in drinking water systems douterelo et al 2017 ling et al 2016 liu et al 2014 2016 the different core genera can be explained by the new treatments and different operations of the treatment steps filters pinto et al 2012 which further indicate the possibility of managing drinking water microbes through engineering approaches liu et al 2018 pinto et al 2012 wang et al 2013 4 4 capture and investigate transition effects through studying suspended solids based on this study the transitional effects can be generally summarized as 1 de stabilization observed as a spike in the tss after switching to upgraded treatments which might associate with the release from biofilm and or loose deposits in a distribution system 2 re stabilization observed as improvements after operating the upgraded treatments for a period of six months special attention should be given to the de stabilization and release of loose deposits and biofilm into bulk water because both niches are hotspots for heavy metals and opportunistic pathogens torvinen et al 2004 wang et al 2012 the analysis on opportunistic pathogens was not included in this study it is highly recommended to be investigated in future studies worldwide changing supply water quality may cause transitional effects which could lead to serious water quality problems from an esthetic quality perspective e g discoloration to biological and chemical safety issues e g pb and legionnaires disease liu et al 2017b zahran et al 2018 such transitional effects deserve more attention yet there is no methodology illustrating how the transition effects can be captured and investigated the present study demonstrated an indirect approach by studying the physiochemical and microbiological characteristics of suspended solids over the different periods t0 t3 weeks and t6 months from treatment plant to distribution sites in a full scale drinking water supply system which successfully overcame the challenges of field distribution network accessibility non destructive and dilution effects concentrated liu et al 2017b from a broader perspective this methodology can be adapted and applied for transitional effects evaluation in other drinking water supply systems subjected to changes of either source water or treatment processes by characterizing suspended particles in time t0 t3 weeks t6 months and space from treatment plant to distribution sites the following critical questions that correlated with important drinking water quality issues for customers can be answered 1 whether transitional effects occur have the distribution system loose deposits and biofilm destabilized and released into bulk water and how much these questions can be answered by comparing the load of suspended particles tss 2 what has been released into bulk water will the release lead to serious water quality problems risks e g pb opportunistic pathogens are there any suggestions should be given to water utility managers and or customers these questions can be answered by analyzing the changes on physiochemical and microbiological composition regarding the suspended particles 3 where the released tss may originate from how should the problem be managed finding the origin of released tss will be very important for the utility to find proper managing strategy to prevent unwanted water quality problems at customers taps the source of released tss can be tracked using the bacterial community fingerprint by sourcetracker method we have demonstrated the application of sourcetracker method to assess the origin of bacteria in distribution system and tap water in our early work liu et al 2018 for future applications it is recommended that when the distribution system is accessible studying the suspended solids generated by de stabilization together with the sampling of loose deposits and biofilm from the target distribution network by such complete study the spiked tss can be source tracked to its origin based on which the corresponding strategy can be selected such as flushing the distribution system if the tss originated from loose deposits or ice pigging if the tss originated from pipe wall biofilm another recommendation is that the suspended solids should be monitored and sampled online online filtration every 1 h or 2 3 h because both the quantity and characteristics of suspended solids in the distribution system are highly dependent on the hydraulic conditions fish et al 2017 matsui et al 2007 sekar et al 2012 it has been reported that the diurnal hydraulic changes had significant effects on the bulk water bacterial community bautista de los santos et al 2016 besides the obtained online results will be able to offer high resolution background to distinguish the irregular de stabilization from regular hydraulic disturbances considering the non periodic release of biofilm and loose deposits the online system will increase the success rate and avoid the possibility of missing the release events comparing to take suspended solids samples offline 5 conclusions through characterizing the suspended particles before during and after introducing additional treatment steps we have indirectly investigated the transitional effects at three locations in field distribution network the following conclusions were drawn from this study despite the difficulties for conducting field studies it is encouraged to have more sampling locations for a global understanding throughout the network the water quality significantly improved after 6 months time operation of the additional treatments remarkably temporarily water quality deterioration with no consumers effect was observed at the initial stage when the quality improved treated water distributed into the network at t3 weeks observed as a spike of total suspended solids tss 50 260 active biomass atp 95 230 and inorganic elements e g mn 130 250 pyrosequencing results revealed sharp differences in microbial community composition and structure for the bacteria associated with suspended particles between t0 and t3 weeks which re stabilized after 6 months at t6 months though the transitional effects were captured the study shows that the introduction of softening and additional filtration did not have an effect on water quality for the consumer which improved considerably after 6 months period the methodology of monitoring suspended particles with mupfiss and additional analysis is capable of detecting transitional effects by monitoring the dynamics of suspended particles and its

18398,elevated concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs have been observed with rapid agricultural and industrial development in the songnen plain northeast china but the prospective sources have not been yet apportioned the concentration of pahs was measured in 31 sediment samples from 11 songnen plain lakes in 2015 the background flux of pahs in these lake sediments is 463 μg m 2 year 1 the maximal concentration of 16 u s epa priority pahs 599 ng g 1 recorded in this study is lower or similar to that found in most of the lake sediments across china but higher than remote areas such as north america rocky mountains both concentration and flux of pahs increased after the 1950s which correspond to the industrial development in this area and would probably mark the beginning of the anthropocene in this region a chemical mass balance model estimated that straw burning was a major source of σ13pah 3 6 rings during the past 200 years with an average contribution of 22 1 followed by forest fire 21 2 burning of gasoline 19 1 coal 12 2 coke 4 8 and diesel 3 9 whereas the contribution from crude oil and natural gas was negligible 1 straw burning 20 2 25 2 and forest fire 16 7 30 6 were major sources of pahs and contributed increasing flux in the past 200 years the elevated level of pah recorded after 1950s in this region are also from burning of gasoline 26 1 26 4 coal 15 3 15 8 and coke 5 1 9 0 the contribution of petrogenic sources e g direct oil spill to the concentration of σ13pah seemed to be ignorable at least in these lakes graphical abstract image 1 keywords polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons chemical mass balance model daqing oil field anthropocene 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are known carcinogens and mutagens iarc 1983 and they are widespread in the environment pahs are classified as toxic substances and 16 pahs are listed as priority pollutants by the u s environmental protection agency epa pahs can be generated from natural processes such as naturally exposed bitumen giesy et al 2010 as well as forest and prairie fires menzie et al 1992 but they are also emitted from anthropogenic sources in industrial urban and rural areas chen et al 2017 kelly et al 2009 wang et al 2017 they have been recently used as a proxy to track anthropogenic impacts on the environment during the anthropocene chang et al 2018 leorri et al 2014 liu et al 2018 the term anthropocene proposed by the atmospheric chemist paul crutzen and the limnologist eugene stoermer crutzen and stoermer 2000 has been widely applied to characterize the environmental disturbances caused by human practices exceeded the natural variability lewis and maslin 2015 steffen et al 2016 waters et al 2016 williams et al 2016 zalasiewicz et al 2017 the northeast plain is the greatest plain in china and includes songnen plain sanjiang plain and liaohe plain human occupation and land reclamation of the songnen plain began around the 1900s mackenzie et al 2018 the grain production in this area started to increase in the 1950s and then significantly increased after 1995 especially for the rice output zhang et al 2012 biomass residues were traditionally used as fuel for heating or cooking and are still used today in some rural areas in china chen et al 2017 li et al 2016 estimated the contributions of the various sources to chinese pahs air emissions in 2012 their results showed that neither wheat straw burning nor corn straw burning but rice straw burning was the dominant source of pahs straw burning in field and domestic is also the largest emission source of various pollutants 79 97 not including pahs in heilongjiang province which had the highest biomass burning emission across china in 2012 also in this case rice straw and corn straw burning were the major emission sources zhou et al 2017 a natural colour image collected in 2017 by the national aeronautics and space administration clearly shows the plumes of smoke and hot spots from in field biomass burning during harvest time in the province of heilongjiang fig s1 in addition forest fire has been identified as an important source of pahs in lake sediments ahad et al 2015 although there are no significant increases in fire occurrence at the national level in china during 1988 2012 there was a significant increasing numbers of forest fires in northeast china especially after 2000 zhang et al 2016a consequently it becomes extremely necessary to assess the influence of straw burning and forest fire to pah depositions in this region the songnen plain is one of the most significantly altered biological hotspots on earth huang et al 2012 with a surface of 1 0 105 km2 and a population of 13 million in 2000 this region is also home to some large heavy industrial cities such as daqing ca 3 2 million inhabitants in 2018 and qiqihar ca 5 3 million inhabitants in 2018 fig 1 the metal deposition rates have been increased rapidly since the 1950s in this region pratte et al 2018 the daqing oil field established in songnen plain in 1960 is currently the largest base of petroleum producing and processing in china therefore oil exploitation may result in a further increase of pahs release in this region via direct oil spill during drilling transportation and extraction processes or indirect fuel gasoline diesel and coal burning besides substantial petroleum reserves this area has also lots of lakes fig 1 approximately 284 lakes within daqing city sediment cores have been often used as reliable natural archives of pah contamination kurek et al 2013 although the concentration of pahs in lake sediments from songnen plain has been reported in previous studies sun and zang 2012 2013 sun et al 2011 2014 the corresponding historical depositional flux of pahs in these lakes is not available here we analyzed 16 epa priority pahs in sediment cores collected from 11 songnen plain lakes in 2015 a chemical mass balance cmb model was used to quantify the contribution of various sources to sediment contamination the objectives of this study were 1 to determine the background flux of pahs in songnen plain 2 to estimate the historic influence of straw burning and oil development on pahs deposition and 3 to apportion the prospective sources of pah deposition in this region 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling sediment cores were collected using a gravity corer from 11 lakes located in songnen plain in july 2015 fig 1 and cut into 1 cm slices one aliquot of each sample was then wrapped using aluminum foil and finally packed into labelled zip lock polyethylene bag for further preparation one sample from the top the middle and the bottom layer was selected from each sediment core and included in this study for two sediment cores only the middle and bottom layers were analyzed table 1 some details about lakes and corresponding sediment cores investigated in this study are reported in table 1 2 2 determination of pah concentrations and fluxes a mixed 16 priority u s epa pahs standard was purchased from sigma aldrich pahs were analyzed by the wenhan testing company limited jinlin china the epa8100 method was used in this work pre frozen sediment samples were freeze dried over 48 h and milled into fine powder three grams of sediment powder and 3 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate were mixed then 20 ml of solvent acetone hexane 1 1 v v were added and ultrasonic extracted for 15 min this extraction cycle was repeated once approximately 40 ml of total extract were then gently

0 938 ng g 1 table s1 fifteen deuterium labelled epa pahs purchased from wellington lab on canada were spiked into 3 sediment samples as surrogate for the recovery test the recovery in all sediment samples was 80 110 for almost all measured pahs with the exception of the three 2 3 ring pahs naphthalene acenaphthene and acenaphthylene which showed a relatively lower recovery table s1 in addition a certified reference material era 722 low level pahs in soil a waters company co usa was used to check the quality of the method measured and certified values are comparable table s1 sediment cores were age dated by 210pb and 137cs techniques at the state key laboratory of lake science and environment nanjing institute of geography and limnology chinese academy of sciences nanjing using a low background γ ray spectrometer with a high pure ge semiconductor ortec instruments ltd oak ridge tn usa the approximate ages of the sediments were determined using the constant rate of supply model appleby and oldfield 1978 and sediment mass accumulation rates were calculated based on estimated calendar years bulk density and layer depth details of core dating and sediment accumulation rates have been reported elsewhere pratte et al 2019 the 210pb and 137cs activities and the age depth models are reported in fig s2 the flux of pahs was calculated using mass accumulation rate of sediment multiplied by measured concentration 2 3 statistical analysis for the purpose of descriptive statistics concentrations mdl were substituted by mdl divided by the square root of 2 and related data were log transformed before statistical tests anova followed by bonferroni s test was used to assess differences in concentration of pahs flux of pahs and profile of pahs i e the fraction of each individual pah to the 16pah among three periods i e prior to 1950 1951 2000 and 2001 2014 statistical analyses were performed with ibm spss statistics version 20 chicago il usa and significance was set as p 0 05 2 4 cmb model the epa cmb model is appropriate to apportion localized sources of pahs lee and kim 2007 li et al 2003 and detailed information on the analysis has been described elsewhere zhang et al 2016b in brief concentrations of 13 individual pahs 3 6 rings ng g 1 in sediment samples were used as the ambient environmental data and the relative uncertainty was assumed to be 20 prospective source profiles of pahs from the literature were summarized in table s2 as suggested by li et al 2003 the relative uncertainty for all source profiles was set to 40 and when the values for any individual pahs are below the limit of detection or not available an uncertainty of 0 001 was assigned naphthalene acenaphthene and acenaphthylene are not included in the modelling because of their relatively high volatility and degradation wilson and jones 1993 when the percent mass explained fell within the range 60 140 the coefficient of determination r2 0 8 and the goodness fit parameters χ2 4 the quality of the cmb results was considered acceptable 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations and fluxes of pahs the concentrations of pahs in 31 sediment samples from 11 lakes are shown in fig 2 a and table s3 in general the 16pah concentration decreases with depth in almost all lake sediments the corresponding depositional fluxes of 16pah fig 2b and table s4 also feature a similar trend showing highest concentrations in surface layers the only significant exception was found in a sediment core from a rural area hyp according to the history of human activities in songnen plain three periods were identified during the last 200 years 1 prior to 1950 2 between 1951 and 2000 and 3 after 2000 fig 3 the 16pah concentrations in the studied sediment cores were generally 250 ng g 1 prior to the 1950s i e the period of industrial development in this region with an average concentration of 148 ng g 1 n 11 the 16pah concentrations significantly increased p 0 001 during the periods 1951 2000 mean value 322 ng g 1 n 14 and 2001 2014 353 ng g 1 n 6 similarly the average flux of 16pah before 1950 168 μg m 2 year 1 n 11 was also significantly p 0 001 lower than that recorded during the period 1950 2000 1010 μg m 2 year 1 n 14 and after 2000 1790 μg m 2 year 1 n 6 the increase of pahs concentration and fluxes during 1951 2000 fig 3 seems to be linked to the establishment of the daqing oil field which also promoted the increase of population in this region sun et al 2014 the annual oil production of the daqing oil field increased rapidly reaching 410 5 million barrels in 1986 and 413 9 million barrels in 1997 with about 410 million barrels per year during 1987 1997 hu et al 2011 comparing the periods 1951 2000 and 2001 2014 no significant differences were observed in terms of both concentration of 16pah fig 3a and corresponding fluxes fig 3b albeit rice production increased sharply in songnen plain during 1995 2008 zhang et al 2012 this suggests that there was no extra pahs emissions from rice straw burning in this region in recent years especially considering that it was estimated as the dominant source of pahs to national emissions among main biomass sources li et al 2016 3 1 1 comparing pahs data in sediment and peat cores both sediment and peat cores could represent reliable archives of atmospheric pah deposition thuens et al 2013 harner et al 2018 although sediments could be influenced by processes in the catchment e g hydrological changes evans et al 2016 while overlying snow on peat bogs and run off during spring melt may result in an underestimate of flux harner et al 2018 comparing the flux of pahs in the sediment with that recorded in a peat core from sanjiang plain approximately 300 km east of daqing gao et al 2018 it is possible to observe that they are in strong agreement in fact the 16pah flux before the 1930s estimated using both peat gao et al 2018 and sediment cores this study was 500 μg m 2 year 1 with fluxes in sediment cores ranging from 43 9 hsp layer 22 to 463 μg m 2 year 1 hyp layer 19 fig 2b in brief the estimated historical background of 16pah deposition recorded by both sediment and peat cores from northeast china is 500 μg m 2 year 1 3 1 2 pah in sediment cores across china and other countries the minimum concentration of 16pah in sediment cores across china was recorded in the current study i e 78 9 ng g 1 xlhp layer 24 table 2 thus resulting in the possible background value for this region this value is similar to those reported for other lakes in north america and sweden 15 137 ng g 1 table 2 the maximum concentration found in the present study 599 ng g 1 kqp layer 3 is similar or often lower 2 4 than that found in other lake sediment cores in china this value is also lower than maximum concentrations found in lake sediments from industrial regions in north america such as alberta oil sands region 1024 ng g 1 and great lakes 6386 ng g 1 but higher than remote areas in north american rocky mountains table 2 the highest concentrations of 16pah for all lake sediments in china are recorded during the past 30 years underlining the link with its quite recent and rapid economic growth 3 2 profiles and ratios of pahs the profiles of 16 individual pahs for the 3 periods are shown in fig 4 the contribution of low molecular weight 2 3 rings pahs except acenaphthene in the period prior to the 1950s n 11 is significantly p 0 05 higher than in the periods 1951 2000 n 14 and 2001 2014 n 6 oppositely the proportion of high molecular weight 5 6 rings pahs except dibenz a h anthracene in the period prior to the 1950s is significantly p 0 01 lower than the periods 1951 2000 and 2001 2014 for middle molecular weight 4 ring pahs no significant differences among the 3 periods are found for fluoranthene and pyrene whereas significantly p 0 01 lower proportions of benz a anthracene and chrysene are observed in the period before the 1950s compared to the periods 1951 2000 and 2001 2014 pahs from biomass burning consist predominantly of those with lower molecular weights 2 3 rings navarro et al 2017 tao et al 2006 although their possible generation during biological processes e g plant and microbial related sources of naphthalene and phenanthrene cannot be excluded krauss et al 2005 zaccone et al 2009 on the opposite pahs from fossil fuels industrial oil and domestic coal combustion normally have higher molecular weights 4 6 rings tao et al 2006 thus the observed changes of proportions of pahs suggest that major sources of pahs shifted from combustion of biomass to fossil fuels since the 1950s furthermore diagnostic ratios based on fluoranthene fl pyrene py indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene ip and benzo g h i perylene bghi were examined to infer possible pahs sources fig 5 according to yunker et al 2002 a fl fl py ratio 0 4 indicates petroleum based sources a ratio 0 5 means grass wood and coal combustion based sources whereas a ratio between 0 4 and 0 5 suggests combustion source of oil related products based on the fl fl py ratio 25 of the 31 sediment samples fall within the grass wood coal combustion zone 5 within the petroleum combustion zone and one within the petroleum zone another diagnostic indicator is the ip ip bghi ratio yunker et al 2002 values of this ratio 0 2 suggest petroleum based sources ratios 0 5 grass wood and coal combustion based sources whereas values between 0 2 and 0 5 combustion source of oil related products according to this ratio 24 sediment samples fall within the petroleum combustion zone and 7 within the petroleum zone in brief grass wood and coal combustion and oil related products combustion could be the most important sources of pahs in songnen plain however the resolution of these diagnostic ratios is not high enough to identify clearly each single source of pahs 3 3 sources apportionment of pahs a cmb receptor model was used to apportion pahs sources according to the potential pah input from the oil industries in songnen plain hu et al 2016 and the historical production of the grains in songnen plain zhang et al 2012 we run the model considering the oil contaminated soil source and straw burning sources i e wheat and bean straw the percent pah mass explained by the model ranged from 62 to 97 8 table s5 with 28 of the 31 samples being in the acceptable range defined previously as 60 140 r2 ranged from 0 66 to 0 97 with 25 of 31 samples having r2 80 and χ2 ranged from 0 58 to 5 81 with 27 of 31 samples having acceptable fit to the data i e χ2 4 table s6 almost all top and middle layers of the sediment cores had good r2 χ2 and yielded good results for percent pah mass explained due to the collinearity we could not obtain the output from the model for 3 of 31 samples i e two bottom layers xlhp2 24 and hsp 4 22 and one middle layer kqp5 1 12 among the remaining 28 sediment samples the cmb model indicated that during the last 200 years straw burning including rice corn and wheat straw was a major source of σ13pah with an average contribution of 22 1 followed by forest fire 21 2 gasoline burning 19 1 coal burning 12 2 including residential and power plant coke oven 5 and diesel burning 4 whereas the contribution from crude oil and natural gas seemed to be negligible 1 fig 6 in detail straw burning was estimated as a major source of σ13pah for almost all sediment samples fig 7 although the fraction of straw burning decreased from 25 2 before 1950 to 20 2 1951 2000 and 21 5 after 2001 the contribution to the pahs flux increased during the 3 periods from 36 1 to 178 and 331 μg m 2 year 1 fig 8 this suggested that the straw burning in this region became more serious and the control of straw burning could be an effective solution for reduction of pah deposition for nenjiang plain interestingly rice corn and wheat straw burning contributions to pah deposition are comparable mean values 17 8 12 2 and 6 04 μg m 2 year 1 respectively before 1950 while rice straw burning became the major straw related source after 1950 fig 8 and table s6 this agrees with li et al 2016 who estimated that rice straw not corn and wheat straw burning was the dominant source of pahs to national pahs air emissions in 2012 rice production increased sharply from 1950 to 2008 in songnen plain zhang et al 2012 and straw used to be traditional fuel in rural area in china chen et al 2017 like the straw burning the fraction of forest fire another major source decreased from 30 6 before 1950 to 16 7 1951 2000 and after 2000 however the contribution to the pahs flux increased during the 3 periods from 39 2 to 141 and 236 μg m 2 year 1 fig 8 forest fires are very common in northeast china and occurred every 7 years during the 1700s to 1947 yao et al 2017 the numbers of forest fires and corresponding carbon emissions are increasing after 2000 in northeast china zhang et al 2016a which is consistent with the trend of the pah flux in this region contribution from residential coal burning increased from 3 15 μg m 2 year 1 prior 1950 to 33 1 μg m 2 year 1 1951 2000 and 66 7 μg m 2 year 1 2001 2014 with a stable fraction 4 4 4 9 figs 6 and 8 coal combustion in power generation occurred and became an important pah source after 1950 128 and 218 μg m 2 year 1 in the periods 1951 2000 and 2001 2014 respectively fig 8 accounting for 10 6 11 4 of the total fig 6 sun and zang 2012 studying a sediment core collected from south lianhuan lake here amt lake estimated that coal combustion became the dominant fuel in this region since the 1940s gasoline burning appeared as an important source of pahs in most middle and top layers of all sediment cores with acceptable model results fig 7 together with the industrial development including the daqing oil field development gasoline burning elevated to a major source 26 1 26 4 during the periods 1951 2000 225 μg m 2 year 1 and 2001 2014 369 μg m 2 year 1 figs 6 and 8 minor sources of pahs consisted of diesel burning 3 1 5 3 and coke burning 1 4 9 0 during the whole period figs 6 and 8 as coke burning is usually used for steelmaking the increased contribution from coke burning may link to the establishment of heilongjiang jianlong steel company in shuangyashan city about 350 km east of daqing in 2000s two limitations of this study are acknowledged one is that pahs profiles used in model are not from local prospective sources which will lead to some uncertainty in the quantitative cmb results lee and kim 2007 nevertheless the output from the cmb model is reasonable based on the development history of this region the other one is that we selected 3 layers top middle bottom layers for each sediment core for pahs analysis which may not well represent each sediment profile however it is a fact that the comparisons of pahs flux recorded by the top and bottom layers reveal a robust trend of contamination status 3 4 anthropocene beginning in northeast china despite the widely application of the term anthropocene the exact start date of this epoch is still under debate and much more evidences from palaeoenvironmental studies are needed to identify its lower boundary steffen et al 2016 sun et al 2017 lake sediments may constitute reliable records of natural versus human induced environmental changes during anthropocene crutzen 2002 steffen et al 2015 in this study the increase of pahs concentrations and fluxes observed after the 1950s mirrors the increasing anthropogenic impacts on the environment since the new china foundation 1949 ce this temporal pahs record is consistent with the cadmium and lead enrichment in the same lake sediments pratte et al 2019 and in agreement with the geochemical records of motianling peat bao et al 2015 fenghuang mountain peat bao et al 2016 and changbai mountain peat gao et al 2016 hence the significant elevated pattern of the pahs after the 1950s might mark the beginning of the anthropocene in songnen plain northeast china 4 conclusions the maximum concentrations of pahs reported in this study are generally lower than those found in most of the lake sediments across china but higher than remote area such as north american rocky mountains the background flux of pahs in songnen plain northeast china is lower than 463 μg m 2 year 1 which is similar to sanjiang plain 500 μg m 2 year 1 estimated using a peat core both concentration and flux of pahs increased after 1950 which linked to the industrial development especially following the establishment of daqing oil field in this region however σ13pah contamination by direct oil spill from daqing oil field seems to be ignorable in these lakes straw burning and forest fire were major sources of σ13pah and contributed increasing their flux in the past 200 years in addition the elevated flux of pahs after 1950 could also be from burning of gasoline coal both residence and power plant and coke which provided a possible evidence for defining the

18398,elevated concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs have been observed with rapid agricultural and industrial development in the songnen plain northeast china but the prospective sources have not been yet apportioned the concentration of pahs was measured in 31 sediment samples from 11 songnen plain lakes in 2015 the background flux of pahs in these lake sediments is 463 μg m 2 year 1 the maximal concentration of 16 u s epa priority pahs 599 ng g 1 recorded in this study is lower or similar to that found in most of the lake sediments across china but higher than remote areas such as north america rocky mountains both concentration and flux of pahs increased after the 1950s which correspond to the industrial development in this area and would probably mark the beginning of the anthropocene in this region a chemical mass balance model estimated that straw burning was a major source of σ13pah 3 6 rings during the past 200 years with an average contribution of 22 1 followed by forest fire 21 2 burning of gasoline 19 1 coal 12 2 coke 4 8 and diesel 3 9 whereas the contribution from crude oil and natural gas was negligible 1 straw burning 20 2 25 2 and forest fire 16 7 30 6 were major sources of pahs and contributed increasing flux in the past 200 years the elevated level of pah recorded after 1950s in this region are also from burning of gasoline 26 1 26 4 coal 15 3 15 8 and coke 5 1 9 0 the contribution of petrogenic sources e g direct oil spill to the concentration of σ13pah seemed to be ignorable at least in these lakes graphical abstract image 1 keywords polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons chemical mass balance model daqing oil field anthropocene 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are known carcinogens and mutagens iarc 1983 and they are widespread in the environment pahs are classified as toxic substances and 16 pahs are listed as priority pollutants by the u s environmental protection agency epa pahs can be generated from natural processes such as naturally exposed bitumen giesy et al 2010 as well as forest and prairie fires menzie et al 1992 but they are also emitted from anthropogenic sources in industrial urban and rural areas chen et al 2017 kelly et al 2009 wang et al 2017 they have been recently used as a proxy to track anthropogenic impacts on the environment during the anthropocene chang et al 2018 leorri et al 2014 liu et al 2018 the term anthropocene proposed by the atmospheric chemist paul crutzen and the limnologist eugene stoermer crutzen and stoermer 2000 has been widely applied to characterize the environmental disturbances caused by human practices exceeded the natural variability lewis and maslin 2015 steffen et al 2016 waters et al 2016 williams et al 2016 zalasiewicz et al 2017 the northeast plain is the greatest plain in china and includes songnen plain sanjiang plain and liaohe plain human occupation and land reclamation of the songnen plain began around the 1900s mackenzie et al 2018 the grain production in this area started to increase in the 1950s and then significantly increased after 1995 especially for the rice output zhang et al 2012 biomass residues were traditionally used as fuel for heating or cooking and are still used today in some rural areas in china chen et al 2017 li et al 2016 estimated the contributions of the various sources to chinese pahs air emissions in 2012 their results showed that neither wheat straw burning nor corn straw burning but rice straw burning was the dominant source of pahs straw burning in field and domestic is also the largest emission source of various pollutants 79 97 not including pahs in heilongjiang province which had the highest biomass burning emission across china in 2012 also in this case rice straw and corn straw burning were the major emission sources zhou et al 2017 a natural colour image collected in 2017 by the national aeronautics and space administration clearly shows the plumes of smoke and hot spots from in field biomass burning during harvest time in the province of heilongjiang fig s1 in addition forest fire has been identified as an important source of pahs in lake sediments ahad et al 2015 although there are no significant increases in fire occurrence at the national level in china during 1988 2012 there was a significant increasing numbers of forest fires in northeast china especially after 2000 zhang et al 2016a consequently it becomes extremely necessary to assess the influence of straw burning and forest fire to pah depositions in this region the songnen plain is one of the most significantly altered biological hotspots on earth huang et al 2012 with a surface of 1 0 105 km2 and a population of 13 million in 2000 this region is also home to some large heavy industrial cities such as daqing ca 3 2 million inhabitants in 2018 and qiqihar ca 5 3 million inhabitants in 2018 fig 1 the metal deposition rates have been increased rapidly since the 1950s in this region pratte et al 2018 the daqing oil field established in songnen plain in 1960 is currently the largest base of petroleum producing and processing in china therefore oil exploitation may result in a further increase of pahs release in this region via direct oil spill during drilling transportation and extraction processes or indirect fuel gasoline diesel and coal burning besides substantial petroleum reserves this area has also lots of lakes fig 1 approximately 284 lakes within daqing city sediment cores have been often used as reliable natural archives of pah contamination kurek et al 2013 although the concentration of pahs in lake sediments from songnen plain has been reported in previous studies sun and zang 2012 2013 sun et al 2011 2014 the corresponding historical depositional flux of pahs in these lakes is not available here we analyzed 16 epa priority pahs in sediment cores collected from 11 songnen plain lakes in 2015 a chemical mass balance cmb model was used to quantify the contribution of various sources to sediment contamination the objectives of this study were 1 to determine the background flux of pahs in songnen plain 2 to estimate the historic influence of straw burning and oil development on pahs deposition and 3 to apportion the prospective sources of pah deposition in this region 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling sediment cores were collected using a gravity corer from 11 lakes located in songnen plain in july 2015 fig 1 and cut into 1 cm slices one aliquot of each sample was then wrapped using aluminum foil and finally packed into labelled zip lock polyethylene bag for further preparation one sample from the top the middle and the bottom layer was selected from each sediment core and included in this study for two sediment cores only the middle and bottom layers were analyzed table 1 some details about lakes and corresponding sediment cores investigated in this study are reported in table 1 2 2 determination of pah concentrations and fluxes a mixed 16 priority u s epa pahs standard was purchased from sigma aldrich pahs were analyzed by the wenhan testing company limited jinlin china the epa8100 method was used in this work pre frozen sediment samples were freeze dried over 48 h and milled into fine powder three grams of sediment powder and 3 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate were mixed then 20 ml of solvent acetone hexane 1 1 v v were added and ultrasonic extracted for 15 min this extraction cycle was repeated once approximately 40 ml of total extract were then gently concentrated to 1 ml by nitrogen gas evaporation and 4 ml of cyclohexane were added and re concentrated to 2 ml for extract clean up 1 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate upon 5 g of silica gel 100 200 mesh were filled into glass columns 1 cm diameter and purged with 40 ml of n pentane the extract 2 ml was transferred to the columns and purged with 25 ml of n pentane then eluted with 25 ml of dichloromethane n pentane 2 3 v v the extract was concentrated and reconstituted with 1 ml of hexane for gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis gc ms analysis was carried out by split less injection of 1 μl from all extracts chromatographic separation was accomplished with a hp 5ms column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm with a helium flow of 1 ml min 1 targeted analytes were determined in single ion monitoring mode injector program 80 c held for 2 min 20 c min 1 to 180 c hold for 5 min and 10 c min 1 to 290 c held for 5 min three blank samples were measured with the same method reported above without sediment samples method detection limit mdl defined as the mean blank concentration plus three times the standard deviation of the 3 method blank samples was in the range 0 256 0 938 ng g 1 table s1 fifteen deuterium labelled epa pahs purchased from wellington lab on canada were spiked into 3 sediment samples as surrogate for the recovery test the recovery in all sediment samples was 80 110 for almost all measured pahs with the exception of the three 2 3 ring pahs naphthalene acenaphthene and acenaphthylene which showed a relatively lower recovery table s1 in addition a certified reference material era 722 low level pahs in soil a waters company co usa was used to check the quality of the method measured and certified values are comparable table s1 sediment cores were age dated by 210pb and 137cs techniques at the state key laboratory of lake science and environment nanjing institute of geography and limnology chinese academy of sciences nanjing using a low background γ ray spectrometer with a high pure ge semiconductor ortec instruments ltd oak ridge tn usa the approximate ages of the sediments were determined using the constant rate of supply model appleby and oldfield 1978 and sediment mass accumulation rates were calculated based on estimated calendar years bulk density and layer depth details of core dating and sediment accumulation rates have been reported elsewhere pratte et al 2019 the 210pb and 137cs activities and the age depth models are reported in fig s2 the flux of pahs was calculated using mass accumulation rate of sediment multiplied by measured concentration 2 3 statistical analysis for the purpose of descriptive statistics concentrations mdl were substituted by mdl divided by the square root of 2 and related data were log transformed before statistical tests anova followed by bonferroni s test was used to assess differences in concentration of pahs flux of pahs and profile of pahs i e the fraction of each individual pah to the 16pah among three periods i e prior to 1950 1951 2000 and 2001 2014 statistical analyses were performed with ibm spss statistics version 20 chicago il usa and significance was set as p 0 05 2 4 cmb model the epa cmb model is appropriate to apportion localized sources of pahs lee and kim 2007 li et al 2003 and detailed information on the analysis has been described elsewhere zhang et al 2016b in brief concentrations of 13 individual pahs 3 6 rings ng g 1 in sediment samples were used as the ambient environmental data and the relative uncertainty was assumed to be 20 prospective source profiles of pahs from the literature were summarized in table s2 as suggested by li et al 2003 the relative uncertainty for all source profiles was set to 40 and when the values for any individual pahs are below the limit of detection or not available an uncertainty of 0 001 was assigned naphthalene acenaphthene and acenaphthylene are not included in the modelling because of their relatively high volatility and degradation wilson and jones 1993 when the percent mass explained fell within the range 60 140 the coefficient of determination r2 0 8 and the goodness fit parameters χ2 4 the quality of the cmb results was considered acceptable 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations and fluxes of pahs the concentrations of pahs in 31 sediment samples from 11 lakes are shown in fig 2 a and table s3 in general the 16pah concentration decreases with depth in almost all lake sediments the corresponding depositional fluxes of 16pah fig 2b and table s4 also feature a similar trend showing highest concentrations in surface layers the only significant exception was found in a sediment core from a rural area hyp according to the history of human activities in songnen plain three periods were identified during the last 200 years 1 prior to 1950 2 between 1951 and 2000 and 3 after 2000 fig 3 the 16pah concentrations in the studied sediment cores were generally 250 ng g 1 prior to the 1950s i e the period of industrial development in this region with an average concentration of 148 ng g 1 n 11 the 16pah concentrations significantly increased p 0 001 during the periods 1951 2000 mean value 322 ng g 1 n 14 and 2001 2014 353 ng g 1 n 6 similarly the average flux of 16pah before 1950 168 μg m 2 year 1 n 11 was also significantly p 0 001 lower than that recorded during the period 1950 2000 1010 μg m 2 year 1 n 14 and after 2000 1790 μg m 2 year 1 n 6 the increase of pahs concentration and fluxes during 1951 2000 fig 3 seems to be linked to the establishment of the daqing oil field which also promoted the increase of population in this region sun et al 2014 the annual oil production of the daqing oil field increased rapidly reaching 410 5 million barrels in 1986 and 413 9 million barrels in 1997 with about 410 million barrels per year during 1987 1997 hu et al 2011 comparing the periods 1951 2000 and 2001 2014 no significant differences were observed in terms of both concentration of 16pah fig 3a and corresponding fluxes fig 3b albeit rice production increased sharply in songnen plain during 1995 2008 zhang et al 2012 this suggests that there was no extra pahs emissions from rice straw burning in this region in recent years especially considering that it was estimated as the dominant source of pahs to national emissions among main biomass sources li et al 2016 3 1 1 comparing pahs data in sediment and peat cores both sediment and peat cores could represent reliable archives of atmospheric pah deposition thuens et al 2013 harner et al 2018 although sediments could be influenced by processes in the catchment e g hydrological changes evans et al 2016 while overlying snow on peat bogs and run off during spring melt may result in an underestimate of flux harner et al 2018 comparing the flux of pahs in the sediment with that recorded in a peat core from sanjiang plain approximately 300 km east of daqing gao et al 2018 it is possible to observe that they are in strong agreement in fact the 16pah flux before the 1930s estimated using both peat gao et al 2018 and sediment cores this study was 500 μg m 2 year 1 with fluxes in sediment cores ranging from 43 9 hsp layer 22 to 463 μg m 2 year 1 hyp layer 19 fig 2b in brief the estimated historical background of 16pah deposition recorded by both sediment and peat cores from northeast china is 500 μg m 2 year 1 3 1 2 pah in sediment cores across china and other countries the minimum concentration of 16pah in sediment cores across china was recorded in the current study i e 78 9 ng g 1 xlhp layer 24 table 2 thus resulting in the possible background value for this region this value is similar to those reported for other lakes in north america and sweden 15 137 ng g 1 table 2 the maximum concentration found in the present study 599 ng g 1 kqp layer 3 is similar or often lower 2 4 than that found in other lake sediment cores in china this value is also lower than maximum concentrations found in lake sediments from industrial regions in north america such as alberta oil sands region 1024 ng g 1 and great lakes 6386 ng g 1 but higher than remote areas in north american rocky mountains table 2 the highest concentrations of 16pah for all lake sediments in china are recorded during the past 30 years underlining the link with its quite recent and rapid economic growth 3 2 profiles and ratios of pahs the profiles of 16 individual pahs for the 3 periods are shown in fig 4 the contribution of low molecular weight 2 3 rings pahs except acenaphthene in the period prior to the 1950s n 11 is significantly p 0 05 higher than in the periods 1951 2000 n 14 and 2001 2014 n 6 oppositely the proportion of high molecular weight 5 6 rings pahs except dibenz a h anthracene in the period prior to the 1950s is significantly p 0 01 lower than the periods 1951 2000 and 2001 2014 for middle molecular weight 4 ring pahs no significant differences among the 3 periods are found for fluoranthene and pyrene whereas significantly p 0 01 lower proportions of benz a anthracene and chrysene are observed in the period before the 1950s compared to the periods 1951 2000 and 2001 2014 pahs from biomass burning consist predominantly of those with lower molecular weights 2 3 rings navarro et al 2017 tao et al 2006 although their possible generation during biological processes e g plant and microbial related sources of naphthalene and phenanthrene cannot be excluded krauss et al 2005 zaccone et al 2009 on the opposite pahs from fossil fuels industrial oil and domestic coal combustion normally have higher molecular weights 4 6 rings tao et al 2006 thus the observed changes of proportions of pahs suggest that major sources of pahs shifted from combustion of biomass to fossil fuels since the 1950s furthermore diagnostic ratios based on fluoranthene fl pyrene py indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene ip and benzo g h i perylene bghi were examined to infer possible pahs sources fig 5 according to yunker et al 2002 a fl fl py ratio 0 4 indicates petroleum based sources a ratio 0 5 means grass wood and coal combustion based sources whereas a ratio between 0 4 and 0 5 suggests combustion source of oil related products based on the fl fl py ratio 25 of the 31 sediment samples fall within the grass wood coal combustion zone 5 within the petroleum combustion zone and one within the petroleum zone another diagnostic indicator is the ip ip bghi ratio yunker et al 2002 values of this ratio 0 2 suggest petroleum based sources ratios 0 5 grass wood and coal combustion based sources whereas values between 0 2 and 0 5 combustion source of oil related products according to this ratio 24 sediment samples fall within the petroleum combustion zone and 7 within the petroleum zone in brief grass wood and coal combustion and oil related products combustion could be the most important sources of pahs in songnen plain however the resolution of these diagnostic ratios is not high enough to identify clearly each single source of pahs 3 3 sources apportionment of pahs a cmb receptor model was used to apportion pahs sources according to the potential pah input from the oil industries in songnen plain hu et al 2016 and the historical production of the grains in songnen plain zhang et al 2012 we run the model considering the oil contaminated soil source and straw burning sources i e wheat and bean straw the percent pah mass explained by the model ranged from 62 to 97 8 table s5 with 28 of the 31 samples being in the acceptable range defined previously as 60 140 r2 ranged from 0 66 to 0 97 with 25 of 31 samples having r2 80 and χ2 ranged from 0 58 to 5 81 with 27 of 31 samples having acceptable fit to the data i e χ2 4 table s6 almost all top and middle layers of the sediment cores had good r2 χ2 and yielded good results for percent pah mass explained due to the collinearity we could not obtain the output from the model for 3 of 31 samples i e two bottom layers xlhp2 24 and hsp 4 22 and one middle layer kqp5 1 12 among the remaining 28 sediment samples the cmb model indicated that during the last 200 years straw burning including rice corn and wheat straw was a major source of σ13pah with an average contribution of 22 1 followed by forest fire 21 2 gasoline burning 19 1 coal burning 12 2 including residential and power plant coke oven 5 and diesel burning 4 whereas the contribution from crude oil and natural gas seemed to be negligible 1 fig 6 in detail straw burning was estimated as a major source of σ13pah for almost all sediment samples fig 7 although the fraction of straw burning decreased from 25 2 before 1950 to 20 2 1951 2000 and 21 5 after 2001 the contribution to the pahs flux increased during the 3 periods from 36 1 to 178 and 331 μg m 2 year 1 fig 8 this suggested that the straw burning in this region became more serious and the control of straw burning could be an effective solution for reduction of pah deposition for nenjiang plain interestingly rice corn and wheat straw burning contributions to pah deposition are comparable mean values 17 8 12 2 and 6 04 μg m 2 year 1 respectively before 1950 while rice straw burning became the major straw related source after 1950 fig 8 and table s6 this agrees with li et al 2016 who estimated that rice straw not corn and wheat straw burning was the dominant source of pahs to national pahs air emissions in 2012 rice production increased sharply from 1950 to 2008 in songnen plain zhang et al 2012 and straw used to be traditional fuel in rural area in china chen et al 2017 like the straw burning the fraction of forest fire another major source decreased from 30 6 before 1950 to 16 7 1951 2000 and after 2000 however the contribution to the pahs flux increased during the 3 periods from 39 2 to 141 and 236 μg m 2 year 1 fig 8 forest fires are very common in northeast china and occurred every 7 years during the 1700s to 1947 yao et al 2017 the numbers of forest fires and corresponding carbon emissions are increasing after 2000 in northeast china zhang et al 2016a which is consistent with the trend of the pah flux in this region contribution from residential coal burning increased from 3 15 μg m 2 year 1 prior 1950 to 33 1 μg m 2 year 1 1951 2000 and 66 7 μg m 2 year 1 2001 2014 with a stable fraction 4 4 4 9 figs 6 and 8 coal combustion in power generation occurred and became an important pah source after 1950 128 and 218 μg m 2 year 1 in the periods 1951 2000 and 2001 2014 respectively fig 8 accounting for 10 6 11 4 of the total fig 6 sun and zang 2012 studying a sediment core collected from south lianhuan lake here amt lake estimated that coal combustion became the dominant fuel in this region since the 1940s gasoline burning appeared as an important source of pahs in most middle and top layers of all sediment cores with acceptable model results fig 7 together with the industrial development including the daqing oil field development gasoline burning elevated to a major source 26 1 26 4 during the periods 1951 2000 225 μg m 2 year 1 and 2001 2014 369 μg m 2 year 1 figs 6 and 8 minor sources of pahs consisted of diesel burning 3 1 5 3 and coke burning 1 4 9 0 during the whole period figs 6 and 8 as coke burning is usually used for steelmaking the increased contribution from coke burning may link to the establishment of heilongjiang jianlong steel company in shuangyashan city about 350 km east of daqing in 2000s two limitations of this study are acknowledged one is that pahs profiles used in model are not from local prospective sources which will lead to some uncertainty in the quantitative cmb results lee and kim 2007 nevertheless the output from the cmb model is reasonable based on the development history of this region the other one is that we selected 3 layers top middle bottom layers for each sediment core for pahs analysis which may not well represent each sediment profile however it is a fact that the comparisons of pahs flux recorded by the top and bottom layers reveal a robust trend of contamination status 3 4 anthropocene beginning in northeast china despite the widely application of the term anthropocene the exact start date of this epoch is still under debate and much more evidences from palaeoenvironmental studies are needed to identify its lower boundary steffen et al 2016 sun et al 2017 lake sediments may constitute reliable records of natural versus human induced environmental changes during anthropocene crutzen 2002 steffen et al 2015 in this study the increase of pahs concentrations and fluxes observed after the 1950s mirrors the increasing anthropogenic impacts on the environment since the new china foundation 1949 ce this temporal pahs record is consistent with the cadmium and lead enrichment in the same lake sediments pratte et al 2019 and in agreement with the geochemical records of motianling peat bao et al 2015 fenghuang mountain peat bao et al 2016 and changbai mountain peat gao et al 2016 hence the significant elevated pattern of the pahs after the 1950s might mark the beginning of the anthropocene in songnen plain northeast china 4 conclusions the maximum concentrations of pahs reported in this study are generally lower than those found in most of the lake sediments across china but higher than remote area such as north american rocky mountains the background flux of pahs in songnen plain northeast china is lower than 463 μg m 2 year 1 which is similar to sanjiang plain 500 μg m 2 year 1 estimated using a peat core both concentration and flux of pahs increased after 1950 which linked to the industrial development especially following the establishment of daqing oil field in this region however σ13pah contamination by direct oil spill from daqing oil field seems to be ignorable in these lakes straw burning and forest fire were major sources of σ13pah and contributed increasing their flux in the past 200 years in addition the elevated flux of pahs after 1950 could also be from burning of gasoline coal both residence and power plant and coke which provided a possible evidence for defining the onset of the anthropocene epoch in this region declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

18399,hemodialysis is one of the therapies for patients with kidney failure hemodialysis requires large amounts of pure water and is one of the most water hungry medical procedures and thus represents a clear opportunity where improvements should be made concerning the consumption and wastage of water in this paper we explored the potential of forward osmosis fo membrane for recycling the spent dialysate using the dialysis concentrate as the draw solution partially diluted dialysis concentrate could be further diluted with pure water to form dialysate for further dialysis process using commercial cellulose triacetate cta fo membranes the water recovery of approximately 64 was achieved and the final volume of the partially diluted dialysis concentrate was about four times the initial volume flux decline of the fo process was observed mainly due to concentration of synthetic spent dialysate and dilution of dialysis concentrate while membrane scaling had little impact on the flux decline the urea rejection was found to be relatively low owing to the small size and electroneutral nature of the urea molecule obvious membrane scaling was observed after three fo cycles the energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis of the scaling layer indicated that the scalants were phosphates and carbonates the scaling was removed via osmotic backwash and almost completely recovery of fo flux was obtained economic analysis showed that the centralized treatment of spent dialysate in a dialysis center using the proposed osmotic dilution process could greatly save water resources and cost improving the urea rejection of fo membrane was identified as an important research focus for future research on the potential application of fo technology for recycling the spent dialysate in

nonetheless without introducing any foreign matters membrane technologies are of potential interest to the medical industry forward osmosis fo is an osmotically driven membrane process without utilization of external hydraulic pressure cath et al 2006 compared with conventional ro the energy consumption is significantly lower for fo when draw solution regeneration is not needed shaffer et

concentrated nacl solution as the draw solution talaat 2009 potassium calcium magnesium phosphate creatinine and uric acid were completely rejected systematic experimental analysis of the feasibility of fo in recovery of spent dialysate has not been reported yet in this paper we investigated the feasibility of fo in recycling the spent dialysate using the dialysis concentrate a highly saline liquid with extremely high osmotic pressure as the draw solution fig 1 schematically shows the water recovery from the spent dialysate by fo by spontaneously extracting water from the spent dialysate the dialysis concentrate is diluted and the spent dialysate is concentrated since part of the water in the spent dialysate is recovered pure water for diluting dialysis concentrate to suitable salinity is reduced and the discharge volume of the spent dialysate decreases if feasible this osmotic dilution process would suffice as an ideal application of the fo technology to explore the possibility of such a process the water flux and urea rejection of a commercial cellulose triacetate cta fo membrane were investigated the fouling scaling during concentration was analyzed and osmotic backwash was evaluated to recover the membrane performance finally the economic feasibility of the process was estimated this work opens a new potential application for fo 2 materials and methods 2 1

permeability coefficient b were determined using a cross flow ro filtration system sterlitech corporation the effective membrane area was 42 cm2 the tests were performed under cross flow condition with a cross flow velocity of 25 cm s at 10 bar the temperature was maintained at 25 0 5 c the salt rejection and salt permeability coefficient were measured by using 1 g l nacl as the feed solution the detailed procedure for the determination of a r and b can be found in s1 of the supplementary information the basic fo performance of the membrane was evaluated based on the fo water flux j v and specific reverse salt flux j s j v the schematic diagram of the fo system is shown in fig s1 the membranes were tested under fo mode with the active layer against the feed solution the effective area

v specific reverse salt flux j s j v and membrane support structural parameter s are given in s1 of the supplementary information 2 3 osmotic dilution synthetic spent dialysate ssd was used as the feed solution and dialysis concentrate was used as the draw solution the fo process here can also be specifically referred to as the osmotic dilution process because the diluted draw solution is directly utilized without regeneration the compositions of ssd and dialysis concentrate used in this study are listed in table 1 the ph of ssd was adjusted to 7 0 using hcl the same fo setup fig s1 was used in fo mode at 25 0 5 c the cross flow velocity for both feed and draw solutions was 25 cm s the feed solution was concentrated from 1400 ml to 500 ml and the draw solution was diluted from 300 ml to 1200 ml samples were taken from the feed and draw solutions for the measurement of creatinine uric acid and total nitrogen a baseline flux was determined by utilizing an ssd feed without organics po4 3 and hco3 as the basis for comparison if the membrane fouling occurred concentration factor was defined as the ratio of the initial feed volume v f0 to the feed volume at time t v ft water recovery was calculated by dividing the accumulated volume of permeate v p by the initial feed volume v f0 1 c o n c e n t r a t i o n f a c t o r v f 0 v f t v f 0 v f 0 v p 2 r e c o v e r y v p v f 0 100 the urea nitrogen concentration was obtained by subtracting the nitrogen concentration of creatinine and uric acid from the total nitrogen then the urea concentration was acquired from the urea nitrogen concentration the average urea rejection r u was calculated according to the following method dou et al 2019 jin et al 2011a 3 r u 1 c u p c u f 100 where c u f is the urea concentration in the feed solution and can be calculated by the average of the urea concentration in the feed solution at the time of sampling c u f t and previous sampling c u f 0 c u f c u f 0 c u f t 2 c u p is the average urea concentration in the permeate and is calculated by 4 c u p m u p v p where m u p is the amount of urea diffusing from the feed into draw solution during the period between two adjacent samplings v p is the permeate volume between the two adjacent samplings 300 ml in this study m u p was calculated by 5 m u p c u d t v d t c u d 0 v d 0 where c u d t and v d t are the urea concentration and volume of the draw solution respectively at the time of sampling c u d 0 and v d 0 are the urea concentration and volume of the draw solution respectively at the time of previous

in long term operation the osmotic dilution experiment was repeated for several cycles in each fo cycle 900 ml water was allowed to permeate across the fo membrane for 40 60 h after these cycles the membrane was cleaned using osmotic backwash the feed and draw solutions were replaced with 3 m nacl and di water respectively the cleaning process was with the same operational parameters as the fo operation for 30 min the baseline flux was then determined again to assess the fouling reversibility the ratio of the recovered flux after cleaning to initial was assessed as a flux recovery rate 2 4

results and discussion 3 1 fo performance in concentrating ssd the basic performances of the commercially available cta membrane are shown in table s1 the pure water permeability of the cta membrane is 0 38 l m2 h bar and the membrane has a nacl rejection of 97 4 fig s2 shows that the cta membrane has a smooth surface and is reinforced by an embedded polyester mesh fig 2 presents the fo flux and the water recovery from the spent dialysate following the concentration factor the fo flux declined from 18 6 to 4 4 l m2 h following the increase of the concentration factor a water recovery of 64 was obtained as the concentration factor reached 2 8 the decline in the fo flux could be attributed to the reduced effective osmotic pressure gradient across the membrane and the membrane fouling the initial feed solution of the spent dialysate was clean with a turbidity of near zero fig 2 as the osmotic dilution proceeded the feed transformed to a slightly turbid solution fig 2 photo in the middle at the end the feed appeared completely cloudy with a turbidity of 188 ntu fig 2 the last photo at the right bottom the increase in the feed turbidity was due to the dispersive particles in the solution particle analysis indicated that the particle size of ssd at the end was mainly in the range of 0 7 1 8 μm and the average particle size was 1 18 μm inset in fig 2 another interesting observation was that the ph of the feed solution increased from 7 0 to 8 5 although the draw solution was acidic ph 2 2 4 4 at the presence of acetic acid increase of the feed ph was initiated from the loss of co2 from the feed solution at ph 7 0 the feed solution contains co2 and hco3 harrison 2007 skoog et al 2013 during the experiment the dissolved co2 in the feed solution will escape into the air according to the equilibrium co2 aq co2 g which obeys henry s law harrison 2007 the co2 loss from the feed solution will promote the conversion of hco3 into co2 hco3 h3o co2 aq 2h2o harrison 2007 skoog et al 2013 the feed ph will then go up the ph increase of the feed solution was also observed by other researchers phuntsho et al 2014 zach maor et al 2008 we found the presence of hco3 in the feed solutions they used accordingly in many cases the relatively high concentration of hco3 will give rise to the ph increase of the feed solution increase of ph may favour the formation of inorganic scale we analyzed the removal of three major nitrogen containing metabolites i e urea creatinine and uric acid which are also hemodialysis markers by the fo membrane during the osmotic dilution process creatinine and uric acid were not detected in draw solution therefore creatinine and uric acid were rejected by the fo membrane the variation of the urea concentration in the feed and draw solution with concentration factor is given in fig 3 a as osmotic dilution proceeded the urea concentration in the feed and draw solution increased gradually and reached 49 39 and 17 46 mmol l respectively at the end of the experiment fig 3b shows the change of the average urea rejection as a function of the accumulated permeate volume the average urea rejection declined as more water permeated across the fo membrane the average urea rejection was 78 0 when the accumulated permeate volume was 0 300 ml concentration factor 1 0 1 3 the value declined from 78 0 to 36 4 when the accumulated permeate volume was 300 600 ml concentration factor 1 3 1 8 when the permeate volume was 600 900 ml concentration factor 1 8 2 8 the average urea rejection continued to decline slightly from 36 4 to 34 6 the decrease of urea rejection may be related to several factors the urea rejection r u in the fo process can be expressed by r u 1 j u j v c f u where j u and j v are the urea flux and water flux respectively c f u is the urea concentration in the feed solution jin et al 2011b 2012 the water flux j v decreased notably during the fo process as presented in fig 2 although the urea concentration of the feed solution c f u kept rising fig 3a but not as significant as the water flux decline urea flux j u mainly depends on the urea concentration difference between the feed and draw solution which varied little with the concentration factor fig 3a hence the urea flux was relatively stable the combined influence of the above three parameters eventually led to the reduction in the urea rejection the result indicates that the urea rejection was relatively low especially at a high concentration factor nevertheless it must be noted that the dialysis concentrate needs to be diluted to about 35 times its original volume before it can be used for hemodialysis smith and reynolds 2015 since the concentration of the dialysis concentrate initially diluted by the osmotic dilution process is still too high to be directly used adding pure water for further dilution is needed to meet the dialysis requirement as a result the urea concentration in the dialysate will be further greatly reduced fabricating fo membranes with a higher urea rejection is still meaningful for further improving the quality of the recycled water 3 2 origin of flux decline during the osmotic dilution experiment two main factors led to the flux decline 1 reduced effective osmotic pressure gradient across the fo membrane 2 membrane fouling and the resulting additional hydraulic resistance of the membrane to evaluate the effect of the two factors fo baseline flux was determined using the ssd solution without the organics po4 3 and hco3 in fig 4 the experimental baseline fo flux was compared with the flux which was measured using ssd with all components we also calculated the theoretical baseline fo flux and found that the theoretical fluxes well matched the experimental values with the variation of less than 10 the baseline flux was calculated based on the model developed by tiraferri and co workers tiraferri et al 2013 yip et al 2011 7 j w a π d exp j w s d π f exp j w k 1 b j w exp j w k exp j w s d where a b and s are intrinsic properties of the membrane d is the bulk diffusivity of the draw salt k is the feed solute mass transfer coefficient π f is the osmotic pressure in bulk feed solution π d is the osmotic pressure in bulk draw solution in this work d was set to 1 5 10 9 m2 s k was determined by shd d h with d h being the hydraulic diameter of the crossflow cell sh being the sherwood number for the appropriate flow regime in the feed channel the value of k was calculated to be 2 2 10 5 m s the osmotic pressures of the feed and draw solutions were calculated with the aid of oli analyzer software interestingly the experimental fo flux was found to be only slightly lower than the baseline fo flux in the baseline experiment no fouling and scaling would occur due to the absence of organics po4 3 and hco3 in the feed solution thus the flux decline was merely caused by the reduced osmotic pressure gradient during the experiment with ssd the feed became turbid due to the precipitation of inorganic chemicals the scaling due to the precipitation of the particles onto the membrane surface may occur however the observation manifested that the effect of scaling on fo flux was minor in comparison with the reduced osmotic pressure gradient most probably the surface of the cta membrane is smooth and tends to aggregate few foulants thus the resistance of the foulant layer is small chen et al 2015 2016a in addition fo has inherently good flux stability against fouling owing to the internal concentration polarization icp self compensation effect any attempt to reduce membrane flux is compensated by a reduction in icp tang et al 2010 3 3 cleaning by osmotic backwash in order to investigate the membrane fouling in long term operation the osmotic dilution experiment was repeated for several times fig 5 shows the normalized flux in several fo cycles and the effect of osmotic backwash after the first fo cycle the initial fo flux in cycle 2 was lower than the initial baseline flux and the initial flux in cycle 1 the initial fo flux in cycle 3 showed about 80 of the initial baseline flux however following an osmotic backwash the initial fo flux was recovered to nearly 97 of the initial baseline flux and an fo flux pattern similar to that in cycle 1 was observed the fouled membrane was almost completely restored using osmotic backwash in this bench scale experiment no pretreatment was considered nevertheless in a real and large scale process proper pretreatment such as adding a filter upstream of the fo system is recommended for safety reasons 3 4 analysis of the fouling sem images of the virgin and fouled membranes confirmed the membrane fouling the sem image of the virgin membrane shows a smooth membrane surface fig 6 a after three cycles of osmotic dilution experiments a foulant cake layer covered the membrane surface fig 6c membrane fouling was also demonstrated by the afm images of the virgin fig s4a and fouled fig s4b membranes the fouling resulted in an obvious change of membrane surface morphology the root mean square rms roughness of the fouled membrane surface in an area of 2 μm 2 μm was 11 77 nm which was larger than the virgin membrane 1 64 nm in the eds spectra only c and o were detected on the virgin membrane surface fig 6b which was consistent with the xps analysis fig s3 for the fouled membrane c o p cl na k ca and mg elements were mainly observed fig 6d no nitrogen was detected on the fouled membrane surface though all the organics in the ssd i e urea creatinine uric acid and bsa contains nitrogen the ssd feed solution contains four scaling precursor ions ca2 mg2 hco3 and po4 3 which could be precipitated with different scalants such as calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate thus it is evident that the membrane fouling is mainly caused by the inorganic scaling the ftir spectra of the virgin and fouled membrane surfaces are shown in fig s5 the ftir spectrum of the virgin membrane surface was similar to the specific ftir spectrum for a cta membrane wang et al 2014 xie and gray 2016 xue et al 2016 the spectrum is composed by three strong peaks located at 1738 1219 and 1040 cm 1 assigned to co ester c o coch3 linked to the o originated from pyranose oh and asymmetric c o c pyranose groups streching vibrations das et al 2014 fan et al 2010 wang et al 2014 xie and gray 2016 the peaks identified at 1370 and 906 cm 1 were correlated to ch3 and c h in plane and out of plane bending vibrations respectively dasgupta et al 2014 fan et al 2010 wang et al 2014 after fouling by ssd the specific peaks of the cta membrane disappeared or greatly weakened suggesting that the membrane surface was covered with foulants two new peaks appeared at 1647 and 1024 cm 1 the peak at 1647 cm 1 may be associated with the bending vibration of water molecules in crystalline hydrates grodzicki and piszczek 1996 the peak at 1024 cm 1 may be attributed to phosphates elzinga and sparks 2007 steiner et al 2010 tejedortejedor and anderson 1990 after cleaning the sem image of the cleaned membrane showed a small amount of residual scalants on the membrane surface fig 6e similar results were observed by afm image fig s4c the rms roughness of the cleaned membrane surface in an area of 2 μm 2 μm was 4 57 nm which was larger than the virgin membrane 1 64 nm and smaller than the fouled membrane 11 77 nm c o and a small amount of ca were present on the cleaned membrane surface fig 6f suggesting that most of the scalants were removed by the osmotic backwash and the small amount of residual scalants may be caco3 the ftir spectrum of the cleaned membrane surface is very similar to that of the virgin membrane indicating that the membrane cleaning is effective and the polymeric active layer is robust and resilient to chemical change after exposure to ssd for three cycles of fo experiments the peak intensity of the cleaned membrane surface was slightly lower than the virgin membrane which was likely due to the residual scalants covered on the membrane surface 3 5 foulant of inorganic origin from a thermodynamic perspective precipitation can occur when the solubility limit of a mineral salt is exceeded the extent of supersaturation can be expressed as the saturation index si antony et al 2011 van de lisdonk et al 2001 the visual minteq software was used to analyze the possible mineral scales and to calculate their si values al mutairi et al 2009 chen et al 2013 2016b fig 7 shows the si values of the five possible mineral scales i e hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 oh

at ph 5 0 9 0 and their si values given the final concentration factor of 2 8 the ion concentrations used here were three times the initial ion concentrations in ssd for all the five compounds in fig 7 and most of the compounds in table s2 the si values increased with the increase of ph suggesting that the membrane scaling is more likely to occur under higher ph different forms of phosphate and carbonate may precipitate it is noteworthy that the si values of hydroxyapatite was the largest and increased dramatically with ph in the ph range of 7 0 8 5 the si values of hydroxyapatite were greater than 9 this result indicated that the ion activity product iap was much greater than the solubility product k sp and the ssd had a high tendency to form hydroxyapatite most calcium phosphate deposits in nature are amorphous chesters 2009 hydroxyapatite is one of the crystalline and most thermodynamically stable forms of calcium phosphate antony et al 2011 at ph 5 0 all compounds have negative si values implying that controlling the feed ph not higher than 5 0 can be an effective approach for scaling mitigation membrane scaling is the formation of mineral deposits on the membrane surface as feed solution becomes supersaturated by inorganic salts tran et al 2007 scaling occurs when the concentrations of the sparingly soluble salts in the feed solution reach supersaturation and the salts crystallise directly on the membrane surface surface crystallisation or crystallise in the bulk solution bulk crystallisation and deposit on the membrane surface antony et al 2011 mi and elimelech 2010 three possible reasons contribute to the membrane scaling in the reuse of ssd the first relates to the concentration increase of scaling precursor ions in the feed solution as water transports from the feed to the draw solution side the second reason would attribute to the increase of feed ph the third reverse diffusion of ca2 and mg2 across the membrane from the draw to feed solution may also contribute to membrane scaling however in the experimental duration the precipitates were able to be removed from the membrane surface by osmotic backwash this could be attributed to the smooth surface of cta fo membrane the other reason could be the chemistry of cta materials which does not preferably generate chemical bonding with the precipitates the time for the interaction between the precipitates and the membrane was probably too short to form chemical bonding this issue is worthwhile for further investigation nevertheless the current fo operation results demonstrated that the fo process was rather stable in concentrating the ssd to save the required pure water for hemodialysis as well as reduce the waste discharge 3 6 economic feasibility economic feasibility of the proposed fo process is another key and practical issue the data presented in table 2 show the assumptions and key cost parameters for pure water production using the present ro method and spent dialysate reuse with an fo system due to the lack of information about the cost of dialysis water in the literature we first estimated the dialysis water cost so as to compare it with the cost of spent dialysate reuse by fo a typical water treatment system for hemodialysis is shown in fig s6 water treatment system for hemodialysis primarily consists of a pretreatment unit which usually employs a combination of sediment filters carbon filters and water softeners and an ro unit other components such as deionizers ultrafilters anion exchange resins and a second ro system may also be needed based on the quality of the feed water damasiewicz et al 2012 a pretreatment system is essential owing to the presence of numerous contaminants in the tap water such as chlorine or chloramines fluoride nitrates aluminum copper and lead these contaminants are potentially hazardous to hemodialysis patients and some of them e g chloramines are difficult to be removed by ro damasiewicz et al 2012 ward 2004 herein only two core parts of the water treatment system i e the pretreatment system and the single stage ro unit are considered in the cost estimation and other parts are neglected the water recovery is assumed to be 30 the feed inlet flow rate is determined assuming that the dialysate flow rate of each dialysis machine is 500 ml min each dialysis machine works 15 h a day and the number of dialysis machines in the dialysis center is 50 the water permeability of the ro membrane is assumed to be 3 l m2 h bar based on bw30 400 ro element from dow and the operating pressure is assumed to be 15 bar detailed descriptions of the assumptions and estimated costs are listed in table s3 as shown in table 2 the total cost is 2 607 usd m3 of which the largest contribution is the cost of tap water accounting for 90 8 the economic feasibility of the fo process in spent dialysate reuse was analyzed for two different types of fo systems one is a small fo system which can only be used with one dialysis machine the other is a large fo system that can centrally process all spent dialysate generated by the dialysis center although the composition of the spent dialysate is much simpler than that of the tap water a pretreatment system is also recommended here to further improve the quality of the recycled water as well as extend the membrane lifetime the pretreatment unit for fo is assumed to have similar components to that for ro the water recovery from the spent dialysate is assumed to be 30 for both small and large fo systems based on the same assumptions as the present ro system in determining the feed inlet flow rate feed inlet flow rates for small and large fo systems are 0 45 and 22 5 m3 day the pump operating pressure and pump energy consumption are neglected because the low pressure pump only needs to overcome the fluid frictional resistance ali et al 2018 the average water flux is assumed to be 10 l m2 h detailed descriptions of the assumptions and estimated costs are given in table s3 table 2 shows that the total cost per m3 of product water using a small fo system is 4 753 usd m3 which is even higher than the cost of product water using the current method 2 607 usd m3 the cost of depreciation in system makes up most of the total cost accounting for 63 4 reducing fo system cost is the key to reducing the total cost nevertheless at present spent dialysate reuse with a small fo system does not appear to be an economically viable alternative compared with the existing method of pure water production however for the large fo system the total cost is considerably reduced to 0 253 usd m3 accounting for only 9 7 of the current pure water production cost this shows that if the centralized treatment and reuse of spent dialysate by fo can be realized it will be extremely economically competitive in this case the membrane replacement cost 0 111 usd m3 contributes the most to the total cost accounting for 43 9 the system depreciation cost and the maintenance cost account for 33 5 and 16 8 of the total cost respectively increasing membrane flux to reduce the required membrane area and reducing membrane cost will be conducive to the further reduction of the total cost the estimated number of hemodialysis patients is approximately 553 000 in china in 2015 wang et al 2019 a hemodialysis patient treated 3 times a week consumes around 24 m3 of pure water per year nystrand 2008 with the corresponding tap water consumption about 80 m3 agar 2010 i e recovery is 30 assuming that the water recovery of the proposed fo process is 30 as shown in table 2 3 981 600 m3 of pure water can be recovered per year in china assuming that the recovery of pure water produced by the existing method is also 30 it means that 13 272 000 m3 of tap water can be saved annually this is of great significance to china which is seriously short of water resources according to table 2 the cost savings per m3 of pure water recovered are 2 354 usd m3 it can be calculated that the annual cost savings in china are about 9 37 million usd 4 conclusions in this study we systematically investigated the recycling of water from synthetic spent dialysate by forward osmosis for the osmotic dilution of dialysis concentrate the flux decline was mainly caused by the decreased effective osmotic pressure gradient but not due to membrane scaling creatinine and uric acid could be almost completely rejected but urea rejection was relatively low obvious membrane scaling occurred after three fo cycles the scalants were primarily composed of phosphates and carbonates however osmotic backwash could restore the initial fo performance the less fouling scaling of the cta membrane in fo process was probably due to the smooth surface and the less chemical bonding between the membrane materials and the inorganic precipitates from the perspective of membrane fouling and scaling fo is a promising technology for the reuse of spent dialysate economic analysis shows that the cost of reusing spent dialysate with a small fo system matched with a single dialysis machine is higher than that of the existing method of producing dialysis water while centralized treatment of spent dialysate from a dialysis center with 50 dialysis machines using a large fo system can greatly save costs and water resources further improvement in the urea rejection of the fo membrane is meaningful to further improve the quality of the recycled water and promote the application of fo technology in hemodialysis declaration of competing interest the authors declare

18399,hemodialysis is one of the therapies for patients with kidney failure hemodialysis requires large amounts of pure water and is one of the most water hungry medical procedures and thus represents a clear opportunity where improvements should be made concerning the consumption and wastage of water in this paper we explored the potential of forward osmosis fo membrane for recycling the spent dialysate using the dialysis concentrate as the draw solution partially diluted dialysis concentrate could be further diluted with pure water to form dialysate for further dialysis process using commercial cellulose triacetate cta fo membranes the water recovery of approximately 64 was achieved and the final volume of the partially diluted dialysis concentrate was about four times the initial volume flux decline of the fo process was observed mainly due to concentration of synthetic spent dialysate and dilution of dialysis concentrate while membrane scaling had little impact on the flux decline the urea rejection was found to be relatively low owing to the small size and electroneutral nature of the urea molecule obvious membrane scaling was observed after three fo cycles the energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis of the scaling layer indicated that the scalants were phosphates and carbonates the scaling was removed via osmotic backwash and almost completely recovery of fo flux was obtained economic analysis showed that the centralized treatment of spent dialysate in a dialysis center using the proposed osmotic dilution process could greatly save water resources and cost improving the urea rejection of fo membrane was identified as an important research focus for future research on the potential application of fo technology for recycling the spent dialysate in

of fo in recovery of spent dialysate has not been reported yet in this paper we investigated the feasibility of fo in recycling the spent dialysate using the dialysis concentrate a highly saline liquid with extremely high osmotic pressure as the draw solution fig 1 schematically shows the water recovery from the spent dialysate by fo by spontaneously extracting water from the spent dialysate the dialysis concentrate is diluted and the spent dialysate is concentrated since part of the water in the spent dialysate is recovered pure water for diluting dialysis concentrate to suitable salinity is reduced and the discharge volume of the spent dialysate decreases if feasible this osmotic dilution process would suffice as an ideal application of the fo technology to explore the possibility of such a process the water flux and urea rejection of a commercial cellulose triacetate cta fo membrane were investigated the fouling scaling during concentration was analyzed and osmotic backwash was evaluated to recover the membrane performance finally the economic feasibility of the process was estimated this work opens a new potential application for fo 2 materials and methods 2 1

feed solution and dialysis concentrate was used as the draw solution the fo process here can also be specifically referred to as the osmotic dilution process because the diluted draw solution is directly utilized without regeneration the compositions of ssd and dialysis concentrate used in this study are listed in table 1 the ph of ssd was adjusted to 7 0 using hcl the same fo setup fig s1 was used in fo mode at 25 0 5 c the cross flow velocity for both feed and draw solutions was 25 cm s the feed solution was concentrated from 1400 ml to 500 ml and the draw solution was diluted from 300 ml to 1200 ml samples were taken from the feed and draw solutions for the measurement of creatinine uric acid and total nitrogen a baseline flux was determined by utilizing an ssd feed without organics po4 3 and hco3 as the basis for comparison if the membrane fouling occurred concentration factor was defined as the ratio of the initial feed volume v f0 to the feed volume at time t v ft

p v f 0 100 the urea nitrogen concentration was obtained by subtracting the nitrogen concentration of creatinine and uric acid from the total nitrogen then the urea concentration was acquired from the urea nitrogen concentration the average urea rejection r u was calculated according to the following method dou et al 2019 jin et al 2011a 3 r u 1 c u p c u f 100 where c u f is the urea concentration in the feed solution and can be calculated by the average of the urea concentration in the feed solution at the time of sampling c u f t and previous sampling c u f 0 c u f c u f 0 c u f t 2 c u p is the average urea concentration in the permeate and is calculated by 4 c u p m u p v p where m u p is the amount of urea diffusing from the feed into draw solution during the period between two adjacent samplings v p is the permeate volume between the two adjacent samplings 300 ml in this study m u p was calculated by 5 m u p c u d t v d t c u d 0 v d 0 where c u d t and v d t are the urea

in long term operation the osmotic dilution experiment was repeated for several cycles in each fo cycle 900 ml water was allowed to permeate across the fo membrane for 40 60 h after these cycles the membrane was cleaned using osmotic backwash the feed and draw solutions were replaced with 3 m nacl and di water respectively the cleaning process was with the same operational parameters as the fo operation for 30 min the baseline flux was then determined again to assess the fouling reversibility the ratio of the recovered flux after cleaning to initial was assessed as a flux recovery rate 2 4

results and discussion 3 1 fo performance in concentrating ssd the basic performances of the commercially available cta membrane are shown in table s1 the pure water permeability of the cta membrane is 0 38 l m2 h bar and the membrane has a nacl rejection of 97 4 fig s2 shows that the cta membrane has a smooth surface and is reinforced by an embedded polyester mesh fig 2 presents the fo flux and the water recovery from the spent dialysate following the concentration factor the fo flux declined from 18 6 to 4 4 l m2 h following the increase of the concentration factor a water recovery of 64 was obtained as the concentration factor reached 2 8 the decline in the fo flux could be attributed to the reduced effective osmotic pressure gradient across the membrane and the membrane fouling the initial feed solution of the spent dialysate was clean with a turbidity of near zero fig 2 as the osmotic dilution proceeded the feed transformed to a slightly turbid solution fig 2 photo in the middle at the end the feed appeared completely cloudy with a turbidity of 188 ntu fig 2 the last photo at the right bottom the increase in the feed turbidity was due to the dispersive particles in the solution particle analysis indicated that the particle size of ssd at the end was mainly in the range of 0 7 1 8 μm and the average particle size was 1 18 μm inset in fig 2 another interesting observation was that the ph of the feed solution increased from 7 0 to 8 5 although the draw solution was acidic ph 2 2 4 4 at the presence of acetic acid increase of the feed ph was initiated from the loss of co2 from the feed solution at ph 7 0 the feed solution contains co2 and hco3 harrison 2007 skoog et al 2013 during the experiment the dissolved co2 in the feed solution will escape into the air according to the equilibrium co2 aq co2 g which obeys henry s law harrison 2007 the co2 loss from the feed solution will promote the conversion of hco3 into co2 hco3 h3o co2 aq 2h2o harrison 2007 skoog et al 2013 the feed ph will then go up the ph increase of the feed solution was also observed by other researchers phuntsho et al 2014 zach maor et al 2008 we found the presence of hco3 in the feed solutions they used accordingly in many cases the relatively high concentration of hco3 will give rise to the ph increase of the feed solution increase of ph may favour the formation of inorganic scale we analyzed the removal of three major nitrogen containing metabolites i e urea creatinine and uric acid which are also hemodialysis markers by the fo membrane during the osmotic dilution process creatinine and uric acid were not detected in draw solution therefore creatinine and uric acid were rejected by the fo membrane the variation of the urea concentration in the feed and draw solution with concentration factor is given in fig 3 a as osmotic dilution proceeded the urea concentration in the feed and draw solution increased gradually and reached 49 39 and 17 46 mmol l respectively at the end of the experiment fig 3b shows the change of the average urea rejection as a function of the accumulated permeate volume the average urea rejection declined as more water permeated across the fo membrane the average urea rejection was 78 0 when the accumulated permeate volume was 0 300 ml concentration factor 1 0 1 3 the value declined from 78 0 to 36 4 when the accumulated permeate volume was 300 600 ml concentration factor 1 3 1 8 when the permeate volume was 600 900 ml concentration factor 1 8 2 8 the average urea rejection continued to decline slightly from 36 4 to 34 6 the decrease of urea rejection may be related to several factors the urea rejection r u in the fo process can be expressed by r u 1 j u j v c f u where j u and j v are the urea flux and water flux respectively c f u is the urea concentration in the feed solution jin et al 2011b 2012 the water flux j v decreased notably during the fo process as presented in fig 2 although the urea concentration of the feed solution c f u kept rising fig 3a but not as significant as the water flux decline urea flux j u mainly depends on the urea concentration difference between the feed and draw solution which varied little with the concentration factor fig 3a hence the urea flux was relatively stable the combined influence of the above three parameters eventually led to the reduction in the urea rejection the result indicates that the urea rejection was relatively low especially at a high concentration factor nevertheless it must be noted that the dialysis concentrate needs to be diluted to about 35 times its original volume before it can be used for hemodialysis smith and reynolds 2015 since the concentration of the dialysis concentrate initially diluted by the osmotic dilution process is still too high to be directly used adding pure water for further dilution is needed to meet the dialysis requirement as a result the urea concentration in the dialysate will be further greatly reduced fabricating fo membranes with a higher urea rejection is still meaningful for further improving the quality of the recycled water 3 2 origin of flux decline during the osmotic dilution experiment two main factors led to the flux decline 1 reduced effective osmotic pressure gradient across the fo membrane 2 membrane fouling and the resulting additional hydraulic resistance of the membrane to evaluate the effect of the two factors fo baseline flux was determined using the ssd solution without the organics po4 3 and hco3 in fig 4 the experimental baseline fo flux was compared with the flux which was measured using ssd with all components we also calculated the theoretical baseline fo flux and found that the theoretical fluxes well matched the experimental values with the variation of less than 10 the baseline flux was calculated based on the model developed by tiraferri and co workers tiraferri et al 2013 yip et al 2011 7 j w a π d exp j w s d π f exp j w k 1 b j w exp j w k exp j w s d where a b and s are intrinsic properties of the membrane d is the bulk diffusivity of the draw salt k is the feed solute mass transfer coefficient π f is the osmotic pressure in bulk feed solution π d is the osmotic pressure in bulk draw solution in this work d was set to 1 5 10 9 m2 s k was determined by shd d h with d h being the hydraulic diameter of the crossflow cell sh being the sherwood number for the appropriate flow regime in the feed channel the value of k was calculated to be 2 2 10 5 m s the osmotic pressures of the feed and draw solutions were calculated with the aid of oli analyzer software interestingly the experimental fo flux was found to be only slightly lower than the baseline fo flux in the baseline experiment no fouling and scaling would occur due to the absence of organics po4 3 and hco3 in the feed solution thus the flux decline was merely caused by the reduced osmotic pressure gradient during the experiment with ssd the feed became turbid due to the precipitation of inorganic chemicals the scaling due to the precipitation of the particles onto the membrane surface may occur however the observation manifested that the effect of scaling on fo flux was minor in comparison with the reduced osmotic pressure gradient most probably the surface of the cta membrane is smooth and tends to aggregate few foulants thus the resistance of the foulant layer is small chen et al 2015 2016a in addition fo has inherently good flux stability against fouling owing to the internal concentration polarization icp self compensation effect any attempt to reduce membrane flux is compensated by a reduction in icp tang et al 2010 3 3 cleaning by osmotic backwash in order to investigate the membrane fouling in long term operation the osmotic dilution experiment was repeated for several times fig 5 shows the normalized flux in several fo cycles and the effect of osmotic backwash after the first fo cycle the initial fo flux in cycle 2 was lower than the initial baseline flux and the initial flux in cycle 1 the initial fo flux in cycle 3 showed about 80 of the initial baseline flux however following an osmotic backwash the initial fo flux was recovered to nearly 97 of the initial baseline flux and an fo flux pattern similar to that in cycle 1 was observed the fouled membrane was almost completely restored using osmotic backwash in this bench scale experiment no pretreatment was considered nevertheless in a real and large scale process proper pretreatment such as adding a filter upstream of the fo system is recommended for safety reasons 3 4 analysis of the fouling sem images of the virgin and fouled membranes confirmed the membrane fouling the sem image of the virgin membrane shows a smooth membrane surface fig 6 a after three cycles of osmotic dilution experiments a foulant cake layer covered the membrane surface fig 6c membrane fouling was also demonstrated by the afm images of the virgin fig s4a and fouled fig s4b membranes the fouling resulted in an obvious change of membrane surface morphology the root mean square rms roughness of the fouled membrane surface in an area of 2 μm 2 μm was 11 77 nm which was larger than the virgin membrane 1 64 nm in the eds spectra only c and o were detected on the virgin membrane surface fig 6b which was consistent with the xps analysis fig s3 for the fouled membrane c o p cl na k ca and mg elements were mainly observed fig 6d no nitrogen was detected on the fouled membrane surface though all the organics in the ssd i e urea creatinine uric acid and bsa contains nitrogen the ssd feed solution contains four scaling precursor ions ca2 mg2 hco3 and po4 3 which could be precipitated with different scalants such as calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate thus it is evident that the membrane fouling is mainly caused by the inorganic scaling the ftir spectra of the virgin and fouled membrane surfaces are shown in fig s5 the ftir spectrum of the virgin membrane surface was similar to the specific ftir spectrum for a cta membrane wang et al 2014 xie and gray 2016 xue et al 2016 the spectrum is composed by three strong peaks located at 1738 1219 and 1040 cm 1 assigned to co ester c o coch3 linked to the o originated from pyranose oh and asymmetric c o c pyranose groups streching vibrations das et al 2014 fan et al 2010 wang et al 2014 xie and gray 2016 the peaks identified at 1370 and 906 cm 1 were correlated to ch3 and c h in plane and out of plane bending vibrations respectively dasgupta et al 2014 fan et al 2010 wang et al 2014 after fouling by ssd the specific peaks of the cta membrane disappeared or greatly weakened suggesting that the membrane surface was covered with foulants two new peaks appeared at 1647 and 1024 cm 1 the peak at 1647 cm 1 may be associated with the bending vibration of water molecules in crystalline hydrates grodzicki and piszczek 1996 the peak at 1024 cm 1 may be attributed to phosphates elzinga and sparks 2007 steiner et al 2010 tejedortejedor and anderson 1990 after cleaning the sem image of the cleaned membrane showed a small amount of residual scalants on the membrane surface fig 6e similar results were observed by afm image fig s4c the rms roughness of the cleaned membrane surface in an area of 2 μm 2 μm was 4 57 nm which was larger than the virgin membrane 1 64 nm and smaller than the fouled membrane 11 77 nm c o and a small amount of ca were present on the cleaned membrane surface fig 6f suggesting that most of the scalants were removed by the osmotic backwash and the small amount of residual scalants may be caco3 the ftir spectrum of the cleaned membrane surface is very similar to that of the virgin membrane indicating that the membrane cleaning is effective and the polymeric active layer is robust and resilient to chemical change after exposure to ssd for three cycles of fo experiments the peak intensity of the cleaned membrane surface was slightly lower than the virgin membrane which was likely due to the residual scalants covered on the membrane surface 3 5 foulant of inorganic origin from a thermodynamic perspective precipitation can occur when the solubility limit of a mineral salt is exceeded the extent of supersaturation can be expressed as the saturation index si antony et al 2011 van de lisdonk et al 2001 the visual minteq software was used to analyze the possible mineral scales and to calculate their si values al mutairi et al 2009 chen et al 2013 2016b fig 7 shows the si values of the five possible mineral scales i e hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 oh 2 ca3 po4 2 beta dolomite ordered camg co3 2 ca4h po4 3 3h2o and huntite mg3ca co3 4 which have the highest si values at ph 8 5 as a function of the feed ph table s2 lists all possible mineral scales at ph 5 0 9 0 and their si values given the final concentration factor of 2 8 the ion concentrations used here were three times the initial ion concentrations in ssd for all the five compounds in fig 7 and most of the compounds in table s2 the si values increased with the increase of ph suggesting that the membrane scaling is more likely to occur under higher ph different forms of phosphate and carbonate may precipitate it is noteworthy that the si values of hydroxyapatite was the largest and increased dramatically with ph in the ph range of 7 0 8 5 the si values of hydroxyapatite were greater than 9 this result indicated that the ion activity product iap was much greater than the solubility product k sp and the ssd had a high tendency to form hydroxyapatite most calcium phosphate deposits in nature are amorphous chesters 2009 hydroxyapatite is one of the crystalline and most thermodynamically stable forms of calcium phosphate antony et al 2011 at ph 5 0 all compounds have negative si values implying that controlling the feed ph not higher than 5 0 can be an effective approach for scaling mitigation membrane scaling is the formation of mineral deposits on the membrane surface as feed solution becomes supersaturated by inorganic salts tran et al 2007 scaling occurs when the concentrations of the sparingly soluble salts in the feed solution reach supersaturation and the salts crystallise directly on the membrane surface surface crystallisation or crystallise in the bulk solution bulk crystallisation and deposit on the membrane surface antony et al 2011 mi and elimelech 2010 three possible reasons contribute to the membrane scaling in the reuse of ssd the first relates to the concentration increase of scaling precursor ions in the feed solution as water transports from the feed to the draw solution side the second reason would attribute to the increase of feed ph the third reverse diffusion of ca2 and mg2 across the membrane from the draw to feed solution may also contribute to membrane scaling however in the experimental duration the precipitates were able to be removed from the membrane surface by osmotic backwash this could be attributed to the smooth surface of cta fo membrane the other reason could be the chemistry of cta materials which does not preferably generate chemical bonding with the precipitates the time for the interaction between the precipitates and the membrane was probably too short to form chemical bonding this issue is worthwhile for further investigation nevertheless the current fo operation results demonstrated that the fo process was rather stable in concentrating the ssd to save the required pure water for hemodialysis as well as reduce the waste discharge 3 6 economic feasibility economic feasibility of the proposed fo process is another key and practical issue the data presented in table 2 show the assumptions and key cost parameters for pure water production using the present ro method and spent dialysate reuse with an fo system due to the lack of information about the cost of dialysis water in the literature we first estimated the dialysis water cost so as to compare it with the cost of spent dialysate reuse by fo a typical water treatment system for hemodialysis is shown in fig s6 water treatment system for hemodialysis primarily consists of a pretreatment unit which usually employs a combination of sediment filters carbon filters and water softeners and an ro unit other components such as deionizers ultrafilters anion exchange resins and a second ro system may also be needed based on the quality of the feed water damasiewicz et al 2012 a pretreatment system is essential owing to the presence of numerous contaminants in the tap water such as chlorine or chloramines fluoride nitrates aluminum copper and lead these contaminants are potentially hazardous to hemodialysis patients and some of them e g chloramines are difficult to be removed by ro damasiewicz et al 2012 ward 2004 herein only two core parts of the water treatment system i e the pretreatment system and the single stage ro unit are considered in the cost estimation and other parts are neglected the water recovery is assumed to be 30 the feed inlet flow rate is determined assuming that the dialysate flow rate of each dialysis machine is 500 ml min each dialysis machine works 15 h a day and the number of dialysis machines in the dialysis center is 50 the water permeability of the ro membrane is assumed to be 3 l m2 h bar based on bw30 400 ro element from dow and the operating pressure is assumed to be 15 bar detailed descriptions of the assumptions and estimated costs are listed in table s3 as shown in table 2 the total cost is 2 607 usd m3 of which the largest contribution is the cost of tap water accounting for 90 8 the economic feasibility of the fo process in spent dialysate reuse was analyzed for two different types of fo systems one is a small fo system which can only be used with one dialysis machine the other is a large fo system that can centrally process all spent dialysate generated by the dialysis center although the composition of the spent dialysate is much simpler than that of the tap water a pretreatment system is also recommended here to further improve the quality of the recycled water as well as extend the membrane lifetime the pretreatment unit for fo is assumed to have similar components to that for ro the water recovery from the spent dialysate is assumed to be 30 for both small and large fo systems based on the same assumptions as the present ro system in determining the feed inlet flow rate feed inlet flow rates for small and large fo systems are 0 45 and 22 5 m3 day the pump operating pressure and pump energy consumption are neglected because the low pressure pump only needs to overcome the fluid frictional resistance ali et al 2018 the average water flux is assumed to be 10 l m2 h detailed descriptions of the assumptions and estimated costs are given in table s3 table 2 shows that the total cost per m3 of product water using a small fo system is 4 753 usd m3 which is even higher than the cost of product water using the current method 2 607 usd m3 the cost of depreciation in system makes up most of the total cost accounting for 63 4 reducing fo system cost is the key to reducing the total cost nevertheless at present spent dialysate reuse with a small fo system does not appear to be an economically viable alternative compared with the existing method of pure water production however for the large fo system the total cost is considerably reduced to 0 253 usd m3 accounting for only 9 7 of the current pure water production cost this shows that if the centralized treatment and reuse of spent dialysate by fo can be realized it will be extremely economically competitive in this case the membrane replacement cost 0 111 usd m3 contributes the most to the total cost accounting for 43 9 the system depreciation cost and the maintenance cost account for 33 5 and 16 8 of the total cost respectively increasing membrane flux to reduce the required membrane area and reducing membrane cost will be conducive to the further reduction of the total cost the estimated number of hemodialysis patients is approximately 553 000 in china in 2015 wang et al 2019 a hemodialysis patient treated 3 times a week consumes around 24 m3 of pure water per year nystrand 2008 with the corresponding tap water consumption about 80 m3 agar 2010 i e recovery is 30 assuming that the water recovery of the proposed fo process is 30 as shown in table 2 3 981 600 m3 of pure water can be recovered per year in china assuming that the recovery of pure water produced by the existing method is also 30 it means that 13 272 000 m3 of tap water can be saved annually this is of great significance to china which is seriously short of water resources according to table 2 the cost savings per m3 of pure water recovered are 2 354 usd m3 it can be calculated that the annual cost savings in china are about 9 37 million usd 4 conclusions in this study we systematically investigated the recycling of water from synthetic spent dialysate by forward osmosis for the osmotic dilution of dialysis concentrate the flux decline was mainly caused by the decreased effective osmotic pressure gradient but not due to membrane scaling creatinine and uric acid could be almost completely rejected but urea rejection was relatively low obvious membrane scaling occurred after three fo cycles the scalants were primarily composed of phosphates and carbonates however osmotic backwash could restore the initial fo performance the less fouling scaling of the cta membrane in fo process was probably due to the smooth surface and the less chemical bonding between the membrane materials and the inorganic precipitates from the perspective of membrane fouling and scaling fo is a promising technology for the reuse of spent dialysate economic analysis shows that the cost of reusing spent dialysate with a small fo system matched with a single dialysis machine is higher than that of the existing method of producing dialysis water while centralized treatment of spent dialysate from a dialysis center with 50 dialysis machines using a large fo system can greatly save costs and water resources further improvement in the urea rejection of the fo membrane is meaningful to further improve the quality of the recycled water and promote the application of fo technology in hemodialysis declaration of competing interest the authors declare
