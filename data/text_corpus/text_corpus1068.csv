5340,lattice boltzmann method lbm and pore network model pnm are two types of simulation methods for modelling the fluid flow in porous media at the pore scale lbm is accurate in representing the pore structures but is computationally expensive while pnm is very efficient but cannot capture the details of pore structures in this work we propose to couple these two methods to simulate two phase drainage flow in porous media to describe the throat geometry more accurately an improved pore network extraction method is proposed based on watershed method where throat bonds with real throat cross sections are extracted a multi relaxation time color gradient lattice boltzmann model is adopted to simulate the flow properties for each throat bond namely critical entry capillary pressure capillary pressure saturation relationship single phase conductance and relative conductance saturation relationship for both phases which are the input parameters for pnm simulations to further improve the computational efficiency five artificial neural network models are developed which relate the five flow properties to the actual shape of throat cross sections where the shape is characterized by 9 parameters the database consists of lbm simulations of the flow properties of 1421 throat cross sections extracted from 5 sandstone digital rocks the trained artificial neural network models show much better performance than the conventional pnm when predicting the flow properties for each throat bond finally the accuracy of the improved pnm coupled with lbm is validated by both the single phase flow and two phase drainage flow in a berea sandstone keywords two phase drainage flow porous media lattice boltzmann method pore network model artificial neural network 1 introduction multiphase flow in porous media is a common phenomenon in many areas such as enhanced oil recovery ground water flow co2 storage gas water transport in proton exchange membrane pem fuel cells building materials exposed to the environment the capillary pressure curve and relative permeability curve are two key input parameters for macroscale flow simulation in all these applications usually these curves are obtained through experimental measurements in recent years with the development of pore scale imaging techniques and computational capacity pore scale numerical simulations blunt et al 2013 have been more and more used towards predicting the fluid flow and transport properties of porous media in pore scale numerical simulations the first step is to characterize the porous media and their pore structure we retain x ray micro computer tomography as a main technique to acquire digital 3d datasets greyscale images of porous material samples with different resolutions and level of details dependent on modalities once acquired reconstructed and sometimes post processed the digital dataset is then segmented into a binary image consisting of pore voxels and solid voxels various segmentation techniques may be applied schlüter et al 2014 wildenschild and sheppard 2013 fluid flow directly based on realistic porous structures can be simulated by direct numerical methods dnm these methods include the traditional computational fluid dynamic cfd method based on navier stokes n s equations ferrari and lunati 2014 prodanović and bryant 2006 zhu et al 2020 the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method tartakovsky and meakin 2006 the dissipative particle dynamics dpd method groot and warren 1997 and the lattice boltzmann method lbm etc among these methods lbm is becoming most popular because of the following advantages a ease of programming b natural suitability for parallel computing c ease of dealing with complex solid boundaries etc in a pioneering work succi et al 1989 firstly adopted lbm to simulate single phase flow in three dimensional complex porous media as the simulation could recover darcy s law this work was groundbreaking towards using lbm in rock and other porous media physics since then lbm has been more widely adopted to simulate both single phase and multi phase flow in porous media for single phase flow permeability is the most important property lbm has been adopted to simulate single phase flow in different kinds of porous geometries nabovati et al 2009 okabe and blunt 2004 the relationship between permeability and pore structures was widely studied bosl et al 1998 kang et al 2014 nabovati et al 2009 pan et al 2006 zhao et al 2020 2018b 2016 which can be used for macroscale flow simulations or analysis of flow mechanisms for example sun et al 2017 proposed to analyze the gas transport patterns in shale rocks based on the lbm simulation results noteworthy is the paper of pan et al 2006 that reported that the permeability obtained by single relaxation time srt lbm is strongly dependent on fluid viscosity which was an unphysical result this defect can be significantly controlled by multi relaxation time mrt lbm therefore the mrt lbm is used in this work for multiphase flow simulation there are different kinds of lb models huang et al 2015 mainly including the color gradient model leclaire et al 2017 zhao et al 2018a pseudo potential model qin et al 2019 2018 shan and chen 1993 wei et al 2018 free energy model swift et al 1996 and mean field model he et al 1999 these models have been adopted to investigate different multiphase problems in porous media liu et al 2016 including relative permeability calculation jiang and tsuji 2017 landry et al 2014 zhao et al 2018a capillary pressure curve prediction porter et al 2009 displacement dynamics liu et al 2014 fluid trapping jiang and tsuji 2015 etc for all the direct numerical methods including lbm tremendous high resolution computational grids are needed to capture the detailed porous structures which leads to heavy computational costs therefore lbm is usually accelerated by cpu pan et al 2004 or gpu an et al 2017 parallelization despite these efforts simulation domains can still be too large especially for multiphase flow simulations pore network model pnm is another type of pore scale numerical method which is much more computational efficient than direct numerical methods aghaei and piri 2015 blunt et al 2013 instead of simulating fluid flow directly in realistic pore structures pnm simulates fluid flow in simplified pore networks which can be extracted from real often digitalized porous media gostick 2017 or built using known characteristics jivkov et al 2013 the complex pore structures are simplified into regular pore bodies connected by throat bonds in conventional pnm the cross sections of the pore bodies and throat bonds are selected to be circles squares triangles or other regular geometries the fluid flow properties in such simple pore bodies and throat bonds can be calculated by analytical or empirical expressions lal et al 2019 øren et al 1998 rajaram et al 1997 valvatne 2004 this significantly reduces the computational costs however in counterpart the oversimplified pore bodies and throat bonds are less accurate than a description based on the real pore structures and can lead to errors in the predicted flow properties the conventional pnm has two primary simplifications one is that the complex pore and throat cross sections are simplified into regular geometries the other is that the throat bond with uniform cross section is used to characterize the tortuous flowing paths with variating cross sections between two pore bodies some efforts have been devoted to improving the accuracy of pnm from these two aspects raeini et al 2018 2017 developed a generalized pore network model which uses several corners in both the pore bodies and throat bonds to more accurately describe the pore structures in addition the cross section variations between pore bodies and throat bonds were also considered the generalized pnm showed better simulation results than the conventional pnm but both the extraction and computation processes were much more complicated while some others mainly focused on improving the description of throat cross sections such as miao et al 2017 and rabbani and babaei 2019 we also devote to improving the accuracy of throat cross section in this work as described above dnms can accurately capture the details of pore structures however the high computational costs limit their applications for large digital porous media on the contrary pnm is very computational efficient but is inaccurate in describing the real pore structures in recent years different methods have been developed to combine the strengths of both dnm and pnm sholokhova et al 2009 and van marcke et al 2010 developed similar improved pnm for single phase flow simulation the pore throat pore elements are extracted from the digital porous media without geometry simplification when extracting the pore network then dnm is used to simulate single phase flow and calculate the conductance in each pore throat pore element the obtained conductance can be in turn introduced into pnm to calculate the permeability of the whole porous media as the flow resistance of single phase flow is mainly encountered in the throats because of their smaller cross section miao et al 2017 and rabbani and babaei 2019 proposed another pnm approach which only considers the real cross section of throat bonds in addition the artificial neural network ann model is adopted to relate the throat conductance with the shape of cross section parameters as input for two phase flow simulation recent developments aimed on incorporating the influence of viscous coupling at fluid fluid interfaces dnm simulation of two phase flow in different regular channels allow considering the influence of viscous coupling dehghanpour et al 2011 shams et al 2018 the obtained conductance of different phases can be used in pnm to calculate the relative permeability xie et al 2017 as the imbibition mechanisms are much more complicated than drainage process the dnm has also been used to investigate the pore filling mechanisms in regular pore bodies ferrari and lunati 2014 zacharoudiou et al 2017 to this day developments of pnm for two phase flow simulation are mainly based on conventional regular pore networks it remains a challenging issue of how to improve the pnm for two phase flow simulation while taking into account the real pore geometry this topic is addressed in this paper in this work we focus on capillary dominated two phase drainage flow in porous media during drainage the maximum capillary pressures are encountered in the throats because of their narrow cross sections this means that the two phase drainage flow is throat dominated highlighting the need to describe the throat structures accurately therefore we develop an improved pore network model considering real throat cross sections to simulate two phase drainage flow in porous media the two phase flow properties in these real throat bonds are calculated by lbm because lbm requires high computational resources the capacity of ann model to relate the flow properties to the shape of cross sections is investigated as a mean of reducing computational costs although similar coupling method has been reported for single phase flow in porous media miao et al 2017 rabbani and babaei 2019 the two phase flow problem is much more complicated and asks a more advanced treatment which we addressed in this work the paper is arranged as follows in section 2 we briefly introduce the pore network extraction method in section 3 the numerical methods are introduced including the color gradient lattice boltzmann model conventional pore network model cpnm and improved pore network model ipnm developed in this paper the coupling procedure between lbm and ipnm is described in detail in section 4 the accuracy of cpnm and ipnm in predicting two phase flow properties is analyzed in detail finally the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 pore network extraction method there are two types of pore networks artificial regular pore networks raoof and hassanizadeh 2010 and pore network extracted from digital porous media the latter one is more realistic as it keeps the topology of real pore structures there are different pore network extraction methods such as medial axis based method lindquist et al 1996 maximum ball based method dong and blunt 2009 watershed based method gostick 2017 rabbani et al 2014 etc compared with the first two types of pore network extraction methods the watershed based method is much easier to implement while the accuracy remains satisfactory gostick 2017 rabbani et al 2014 therefore in this work the watershed method is adopted to decompose the pore space and extract the pore network two different pore networks are extracted one with a conventional method with geometry simplification of pore bodies and throat bonds and one with an improved method with realistic throat geometry 2 1 porous media decomposition using watershed method the open source algorithm snow gostick 2017 is adopted to decompose the porous media into sub pore regions this algorithm includes four steps first step is to get the distance map and apply gaussian filter to remove some fake watershed ridge lines then a maximum filter is applied to eliminate peaks on saddles and plateaus next the peaks close to each other are merged into one peak finally the porous media are segmented into sub pore regions more details about this algorithm can be found in gostick 2017 using the watershed method the pore space is split into sub pore regions as illustrated in fig 1 b each sub pore region corresponds to a pore body within the pore network the sub pore regions are connected with narrow interfaces which correspond to throat bonds in the pore network 2 2 conventional pore network extraction in this work we assign all the pore volume to the pore bodies and no volume to the throat bonds in addition we assume that the pore bodies have no flow resistance and that all flow resistance is located at the throat bonds similar assumptions have been used before joekar niasar et al 2010 in terms of geometry all pore bodies are taken as cubes with a volume equal to the volume of the corresponding sub pore region for the throat bonds the inscribed radius rin and shape factor g are determined in order to simplify the real throat cross sections into regular geometries such as circle square and triangle valvatne 2004 the inscribed radius rin is defined as the radius of inscribed circle in the throat cross section the shape factor g is defined as a p 2 where a and p are the area and perimeter of the throat cross section respectively based on g the throat cross sections can be simplified into triangle g 3 36 square 3 36 g 1 16 and circle g 1 16 respectively after the geometry simplification the parameters a and p of the throat bonds are recalculated based on the simplified cross sections for other parameters such as the length of throat bonds and the coordinates of pore bodies we adopt the same method introduced in gostick 2017 it is possible that the inscribed radius of a throat bond may be slightly larger than those of the connected pore bodies as for throat bond the inscribed radius is obtained based on 2d cross section while for the pore body it is obtained based on 3d geometry but the number of these throat bonds is very small if a pore body has a smaller inscribed radius than the connected throat bond we change the inscribed radius of this pore body to that of the throat bond which means the total pore volume may be slightly changed but this volume change is negligible 2 3 improved pore network extraction with real throat cross section in the conventional pore network both the pore bodies and throat bonds are simplified into regular geometries since the throats determine the invasion patterns and the flow properties during two phase drainage flow a highly accurate description of the throat geometry should be sought for therefore we propose to use the throat bonds with real throat cross sections to replace the regular throat bonds of the conventional pore network as the pore bodies are only used to calculate the saturation of the whole pore network and they have no influence on the invasion process and flow properties we continue to consider them as cubes similar pore networks have been adopted to simulate single phase flow in porous media miao et al 2017 rabbani and babaei 2019 however the improved pore network adopted here to simulate two phase drainage flow asks a more advanced treatment as shown in fig 1 b using the watershed method the porous media can be decomposed into sub pore regions the centroids of different pore regions are determined as shown by the black dots in fig 1 b sub pore regions 2 and 3 are two connected regions to get the cross section of their throat we firstly connect the two centroids with a straight line shown in dashed blue line then a plane perpendicular to this line is inserted and moved from centroid 2 to 3 the varying cross sections along this line are obtained and the cross section with minimum inscribed radius is selected as the real throat cross section fig 2 shows one real throat cross section extracted from the fontainebleau sandstone shown in fig 11 e different parameters miao et al 2017 rabbani and babaei 2019 are adopted to characterize the cross section as shown in table 1 these parameters are used in the ann model to predict the flow properties of throat bonds 3 numerical methods 3 1 color gradient lattice boltzmann model in this work a three dimensional mrt color gradient lattice boltzmann model liu et al 2012 xu et al 2017 zhao et al 2018a is adopted to simulate the two phase flow properties in each throat bond in this model two density distribution functions marked as red and blue are used to represent the two fluids the two phase interaction is modeled by a perturbation operator and recoloring operator the perturbation operator is used to generate the interfacial tension and the recoloring operator is used to produce the phase segregation and maintain the phase interface the model is briefly described in appendix a in general the accuracy of lbm simulation results increases with grid resolution to get reliable flow properties in each throat bond the grid resolution should be high enough therefore two phase drainage simulations through a square throat bond with different grid numbers are conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the lb model and to analyze the influence of grid resolution on simulation results the square throat bond model of sizes h h l and l 2 5h is shown in fig 3 a and h ranges from 5 to 20 lattices to eliminate the influence of boundary condition two buffer zones of 10 lattices are added at the inlet and outlet at the inlet seen on the left in the figure a velocity boundary condition is adopted while a pressure boundary condition is adopted at the outlet in all the simulations the interfacial tension is 0 05 in lattice unit and the contact angle of the wetting phase is 0 used for all simulations afterwards as initial condition the throat is filled with the wetting phase then the non wetting phase is injected from the inlet with a low capillary number velocity when the non wetting phase breaks through into the throat as shown in fig 3 b the entry capillary pressure pc is obtained the simulation results are compared with theoretical solutions as shown in fig 4 where the analytical solution is equation in appendix b the accuracy of the lb model increases with grid number when the pore size becomes larger than 11 lattices the relative error between lbm simulation result and the theoretical solution is within 3 therefore to get accurate simulation results we set the minimum throat radius to be 6 lattices hence a pore size of 12 lattices in the following simulations in addition to the entry capillary pressure the accuracy of using this lb model to simulate two phase flow conductance is also verified for concurrent annular two phase flow in a cylindrical tube the wetting phase flows along the solid walls while the non wetting phase locates itself in the center the relative conductance of the two phases can be analytically calculated by the following equations ramstad et al 2010 1 g rw s w 2 g rn 2 s n m s n 2 1 2 m where m is the dynamic viscosity ratio between the non wetting phase and wetting phase the subscripts w and n represent wetting phase and non wetting phase respectively two cylindrical tubes with the diameters of 12 and 20 lattices are built and the lb model is used to simulate the annular two phase flow in both tubes with two different viscosity ratios m 1 0 and m 1 324 the detailed simulation plan is similar to that in section 3 3 4 fig 5 allows comparison between the lbm simulation results and the theoretical solution as can be seen with both grid resolutions the lbm simulation results match well with the theoretical solutions demonstrating the accuracy of using lbm to simulate the relative conductance 3 2 conventional pore network model for quasi static pore network model the invasion percolation theory is usually adopted to simulate the drainage process the general procedure for drainage simulation is as follows 1 the pore network is initialized by filling it with wetting phase for the inlet pore body set the entry capillary pressure as the minimum critical entry capillary pressure of the connecting throat bonds 2 set the wetting phase pressure at outlet as pw set the initial non wetting phase pressure as pn the inlet pore bodies are marked as invaded if pn pw is larger than their entry capillary pressures then iterations are performed as follows 3 search the minimum critical entry capillary pressure pc ent min for all throat bonds connecting to the invaded pore bodies 4 compare pn pw with pc ent min to determine whether invasion occurs if pn pw is larger than pc ent min go to step 5 otherwise go to step 8 5 invade the non wetting phase into this throat bond and the connecting pore body if it has not been invaded yet 6 detect trapping of pore bodies and throat bonds remove isolated non invaded pore bodies and throat bonds that cannot connect to the outlet through wetting phase 7 calculate fluid saturation and relative permeability 8 increase pn with a small pressure difference pn pn δp check the uninvaded inlet pore bodies and mark them as invaded if pn pw is larger than the corresponding entry capillary pressures steps 3 to 8 are repeated until a finish criterion is reached as shown in fig 6 the finish criterion can be a certain driven pressure difference or a certain wetting phase saturation this process is implemented with a fast algorithm masson and pride 2014 five flow properties are needed in this simulation including 1 critical entry capillary pressure pc ent 2 capillary pressure saturation relationship for each pore body and each throat bond 3 single phase conductance of each throat bond 4 relative conductance saturation relationship for wetting phase in each throat bond 5 relative conductance saturation relationship for non wetting phase in each throat bond in the cpnm these five properties are calculated by analytical or empirical expressions based on the simplified pore and throat geometry as shown in appendix b 3 3 improved pore network model with flow properties calculated by lattice boltzmann method as stated in section 2 3 the improved pore network relies on throat bonds with real throat cross sections there is no expression to predict the two phase flow properties through arbitrary throat bonds therefore lbm is used to calculate the five flow properties of the throat bonds described in previous section then these flow properties are incorporated into the quasi static pnm to simulate two phase flow in the whole porous medium in all simulations and analyses of section 3 3 we constantly use lattice units in terms of two phases a water oil system is used in this work as we do not consider the effect of gravity the densities of wetting phase and non wetting phase are set to be 1 0 and their viscosities 0 175 and 0 23167 respectively the contact angle of wetting phase is 0 and the interfacial tension between the two phases is 0 05 the lbm simulation results can be easily transferred into physical units given the time scale t 0 length scale l 0 and mass scale m 0 zhao et al 2018a for example if we set t 0 5 0 10 8s l 0 5 0 10 6m and m 0 1 5 10 15kg the viscosities of two fluids can be calculated by μ phy μ lbm m 0 l 0 t 0 which are 1 05 and 1 39 mpa s for water and oil respectively and the interfacial tension can be calculated by σ phy σ lbm m 0 t 0 2 which is 30 0 mn m next we will describe in detail how we calculate the five flow properties of the throat bonds 3 3 1 critical entry capillary pressure just before the non wetting phase breaks through the throat bond it is the shape of the front two phase meniscus also referred to as main meniscus that determines the capillary pressure therefore we need to model the dynamics of this main meniscus during the drainage process where the non wetting phase displaces the wetting phase through the throat bond in order to get the critical entry capillary pressure fig 7 a shows a real throat cross section extracted from a fontainebleau sandstone this throat cross section is extended in x direction with a distance of 5rin where rin is the inscribed radius then two buffer zones of 10 lattices are added at the inlet left and outlet right to represent the connecting two pore bodies and to eliminate the influence of boundary conditions the computational domain is shown in fig 7 b at initial condition the throat bond and right pore body are filled with the wetting phase while the left pore body is filled with the non wetting phase then the non wetting phase is injected into the throat bond with a small capillary number ca 5 0 10 4 from the inlet boundary while constant pressure boundary condition is adopted at the outlet boundary upon injection of the non wetting phase the pressure difference between the two phases increases when the pressure difference exceeds the entry capillary pressure the non wetting phase breaks through into the throat bond and the corresponding pressure difference is the critical entry capillary pressure it should be mentioned that the entry capillary pressure is dependent on ca during this drainage process we select ca 5 0 10 4 after a sensitivity analysis for ca between 0 00025 and 0 03 shows little sensitivity for ca smaller than 0 001 3 3 2 capillary pressure saturation relationship in a pore or throat hosting two fluids the curvature of the interface will determine the capillary pressure as a phase invades a pore or throat filled by another phase different saturation ratios of the pore or throat will yield different capillary pressures upon filling a throat bond the main meniscus seen in the previous section eventually disappears after the non wetting phase breaks through the throat bond which means the curvature of interface along the throat bond becomes infinite and arc menisci in the corners will determine the capillary pressure the model shown in fig 8 a is used to get such capillary pressure saturation relationship in the throat bond the same throat bond used in the previous section is now closed with solid walls a similar model approach has been adopted in other research suh et al 2017 to calculate the capillary pressure for arbitrary throat bonds at initial condition a certain amount of non wetting phase is set in the middle of the domain and the remaining volume is filled with wetting phase fig 8 a shows the two phase distribution at steady state capillary pressure is obtained directly from the simulation results among the different cross sections along the throat bond in x direction we use the middle cross section x nx 2 to calculate the saturation under this capillary pressure similar to suh et al 2017 as the curvature of interface along the throat bond here is almost infinite as shown in fig 8 c fig 8 d shows the capillary pressure saturation relationship of this throat bond where point e corresponds to the configuration seen in a c when the saturation is very low the non wetting phase appears as an isolated sphere in the center of the throat bond with increase of the non wetting phase saturation the radius of the non wetting phase sphere increases and the capillary pressure decreases this corresponds to the first stage of the capillary pressure saturation curve after a minimum pc which corresponds to the critical entry capillary pressure pc increases with increasing non wetting phase saturation in the quasi static pnm the non wetting phase can fill the throat bond only after the driven pressure difference exceeds the critical entry capillary pressure therefore only the right half of the capillary pressure saturation relationship shown in red in fig 8 d is needed in the simulations 3 3 3 conductance single phase flow simulation is performed to calculate the single phase or saturated conductance of the throat bond the computational model consists of a throat cross section as shown in fig 9 a given that periodic boundary conditions are used the depth of the model is small namely 3 lattices a sensitivity analysis with 6 and 10 lattices showed identical results the throat bond is fully filled with one fluid and a small external acceleration ax 1 0 10 4 is added in x direction to this fluid when the simulation reaches steady state the volume flux q across the throat bond is determined then the conductance of this throat is calculated by 2 g μ q ρ a x μ μ where ρ is the fluid density in lbm simulation μ is the dynamic viscosity of the lbm simulation μ is the dynamic viscosity of fluid to be used in the pore network simulation 3 3 4 relative conductance saturation relationship using the model for determining the single phase conductance the relative conductance of two phase flow at different saturations is calculated as initial conditions a certain amount of non wetting phase is initialized at the middle of the cross section according to the distance map shown in fig 9 b and the wetting phase is initialized near the solid surface then an acceleration ax 1 0 10 4 is added to both fluids when the simulation reaches the steady state both the phase distribution and velocity distribution can be obtained fig 9 c shows the phase distribution when the non wetting phase saturation is about 0 7 the blue color represents the non wetting phase and the red color represents the wetting phase fig 9 d shows the corresponding velocity distribution from this the volume fluxes of both non wetting and wetting phases q n and q w can be calculated the conductance of either fluids can be calculated by 3 g k q k ρ k a x where the subscript k n w denotes the non wetting phase and wetting phase respectively the relative conductance is 4 g r k g k g μ k where g μ k is the conductance of the single phase with the dynamic viscosity of μ k which is calculated based on eq 3 it should be noted that the viscous coupling between the two phases is directly considered in this simulation under different non wetting phase saturations the relative conductance can be calculated following the above procedure fig 9 e shows the relative conductance saturation relationship for the throat bond used as illustration as the influence of viscous coupling varies with viscosity ratio this work is valid for the viscous ratio between the two phases used i e 1 324 3 4 machine learning to relate flow properties with shape information although simulating the flow properties in one single throat bond is very efficient it is still time consuming and complicated to conduct simulations for all throat bonds of the extracted pore networks to get the corresponding flow properties for computational efficiency we use machine learning to relate flow properties to shapes of cross sections to do so a feed forward artificial neural network model is selected as it is able to approximate almost all kinds of functions regardless of their complexities valeh e sheyda et al 2010 in general an artificial neural network model includes three types of layers the input layer hidden layer s and output layer fig 10 shows the simplest ann model which has only one hidden layer for this ann model which consists of n m and 1 nodes in the input hidden and output layers respectively the final output can be calculated by 5 y g j 1 m w kj 2 f i i n w ji 1 x i b j 1 b k 2 where x is the input value and y is the final output value w is weight b is bias f and g are the transfer functions we set f as a hyperbolic tangent transfer function and g as a linear transfer function the performance of the ann model in the training process is evaluated by the mean square error mse which is defined as 6 mse i 1 n y i y i 2 n where n is the total number for evaluation y and y are the target and prediction values respectively the training process is implemented with the neural network toolbox in matlab the total database is randomly divided into three parts training set validation set and test set the training set is used to train the ann model by optimizing the weights and biases based on mse the validation set monitors the training process to avoid overfitting the test set is used to evaluate the generalization of the trained ann model in addition to mse the performance of the trained ann model is also evaluated by two other metrics i e the mean absolute relative error mare and the determination coefficient de the definitions are 7 mare 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 8 de 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y is the mean target value 4 results and analysis 4 1 rock samples and simulation plan in this work we focus on oil water two phase flow in sandstones using five different digital sandstones acquired through x ray ct from one bentheimer one berea and three fontainebleau and available from online resources shown in fig 11 a e the digital rocks are decomposed into sub pore regions using the watershed method and the throat cross sections are extracted as described in section 2 1 from each digital rock we randomly select 200 300 throat cross sections all selected throat cross sections have inscribed radii larger than 6 lattices a total of 1421 cross sections some shown in fig 11 f are selected we note that the flow properties of smaller throats are determined as described in section 4 4 below for this investigation we do not consider sub resolution porosity next different models are built based on the selected cross sections and lbm is used to calculate different flow properties as explained in section 3 3 for the critical entry capillary pressure and single phase conductance only one simulation is needed for each throat bond for the capillary pressure saturation relationship and relative conductance saturation relationship nine simulations are conducted for each throat bond therefore with 20 simulations per cross section this amounts to a total of 28 420 simulations in the following analysis the non dimensional lattice units are adopted unless otherwise specified the physical units can be easily obtained through unit transfer as stated in section 3 3 4 2 comparison of flow properties at the pore scale calculated by lbm and cpnm to evaluate the accuracy of cpnm we compare the five flow properties obtained by lbm simulations with those obtained by cpnm predictions for all the selected throat bonds in a series of graphs shown in fig 12 in all the graphs x represents the properties obtained by lbm simulations without geometry simplification and y represents the corresponding values predicted by cpnm with simplified throat bonds for cpnm the geometry simplification process is discussed in section 2 2 and the analytical or empirical expressions of the different flow properties are given in appendix b comparing the cpnm and lbm results we observe that overall the results show globally similar trends except for the relative conductance saturation results looking at the critical entry capillary pressure the cpnm prediction results agree well with the lbm simulation results this is because the critical entry capillary pressure mainly depends on the inscribed radius as shown in equation in appendix b2 as described in section 2 2 the radius of the simplified throat bond is the radius inscribed within the real throat cross section it is thus expected that these two methods have similar predictions on the other hand there are still some non negligible deviations between cpnm predictions and lbm simulation results these are induced by the differences in shape of the cross sections for the capillary pressure saturation relationship we plot the capillary pressure versus saturation results upon and after the non wetting phase breaks through the throat bond which corresponds to the red points shown in fig 8 d fig 12 b shows a large spread between cpnm predictions and lbm simulation results the capillary pressure saturation relationship mainly depends on the shape of arc menisci in the corners compared with the real throat cross sections as shown in fig 11 f the regular triangular or square cross sections are too simple to describe the arc meniscus dynamics therefore the cpnm predictions deviate significantly from lbm simulation results fig 12 c shows the log log plot of single phase conductance obtained by the two different methods according to equation in appendix b1 the conductance is mainly determined by the area of cross section as described in section 2 2 the inscribed radius and shape factor are adopted to simplify the real throat cross section into regular geometries which means the area of cross section may be changed during this simplification this is the main reason for these differences between the cpnm predictions and lbm simulation results fig 12 d compares relative conductance under different saturations calculated by cpnm and lbm methods as the expression for wetting phase conductance eq 26 only applies upon and after the non wetting phase breaks through the throat bond we only plot these points in this figure in contrast for the non wetting phase we plot all the points under different saturations as mentioned the relative conductance calculated by cpnm does not agree with lbm simulation results with cpnm underestimating the relative conductance but less so at low and high fluid saturations this is due to the fact that in cpnm when calculating the conductance of both phases the fluid fluid interfaces are treated as solid boundaries which means the viscous coupling between the two phase is neglected however fluids will have some non zero velocities at the fluid fluid interfaces as seen in our lbm simulations fig 9 d in addition as the viscosity of the non wetting phase is a little higher than that of the wetting phase the relative conductance of non wetting phase can be even higher than 1 0 due to the lubrication effect the problem of viscous coupling has also been identified by other researchers in regular throat geometries shams et al 2018 xie et al 2017 according to above analysis it can be concluded that for the single phase conductance and critical entry capillary pressure the prediction of cpnm is acceptable the main reason is that these two properties are only dependent on the shape of the throat cross section for a certain pair of fluids and the simplified cpnm can well describe the controlling parameters such as inscribed radius and shape factor for these two properties while for the capillary pressure saturation relationship and relative conductance saturation relationship in addition to the shape of cross section the phase distribution also has significant influence on these properties however the phase distribution can be very complicated in arbitrary throat bond depending on the shape of throat cross section both the simplification of the complex throat cross section and the resulting change of phase distribution make it more difficult to predict these two properties in addition the viscous coupling between the two phases is not considered in cpnm resulting in a worse prediction of the non wetting phase relative conductance 4 3 artificial neural network model to predict flow properties as described in sections 3 2 and 3 3 five flow properties are needed in the quasi static pnm for drainage simulation therefore five ann models are trained to predict the different flow properties the critical entry capillary pressure and single phase conductance are not related to fluid saturation the input parameters only include the nine shape parameters listed in table 1 for the two capillary pressure saturation and relative conductance saturation relationships in addition to the above nine parameters saturation is also one input parameter for each ann model we randomly select 70 of the database as training set 15 of the database as validation set and the left 15 as test set for the critical entry capillary pressure and single phase conductance there are 1421 sets of data for the capillary pressure saturation relationship only the data after the non wetting phase breaks through the throat bond are used shown as red points in fig 8 d for the relative conductance saturation relationship there are 12 789 sets of data for both wetting phase and non wetting phase only one hidden layer is applied in the ann model as this is sufficient to describe the relationships between inputs and outputs as the performance of ann model is related to the neuron number in the hidden layer n hidden and the initialization of weights and biases the trial and error method is adopted to optimize the architecture of the ann model for each flow property the architecture n hidden of the ann model is determined by increasing n hidden from 4 to 40 for each n hidden we run 30 times the training process and select the best one to reduce the influence of initialization of weights and biases the optimal architecture of hidden layer is chosen by comparing the performances of the ann models for different n hidden table 2 shows the optimal architecture and performance metrics of different ann models for comparison the corresponding performance metrics of cpnm are also listed when calculating the performance metrics of cpnm we just replace y i in equations with the value calculated based on cpnm fig 13 shows the comparison of different flow properties calculated by lbm shown on the x axes and those predicted by the trained ann models on the y axes according to the comparison results the ann models can predict the critical entry capillary pressure single phase conductance and relative conductance saturation relationship perfectly using the input parameters the corresponding determination coefficients are all larger than 0 99 for the capillary pressure saturation relationship the performance of ann model is a little worse but it is still much more accurate than cpnm as also reflected with performance metrics listed in table 2 according to the comparison results the ann model can significantly reduce mare and increase de of the prediction results which demonstrates that it is a very promising tool to predict the two phase flow properties through arbitrary throat bonds 4 4 validation of the improved pore network model to simulate fluid flow in porous media in this section the ipnm and cpnm are used to simulate both single phase flow and two phase flow in a berea sandstone to verify the accuracy of different models the digital rock of berea sandstone is shown in fig 14 a before the following processing and simulations this digital rock is upscaled from 1024 1024 1024 voxels to 512 512 512 voxels in order to reduce the computational cost which means eight neighboring voxels in the original dataset are merged into one voxel in the rescaled digital rock in the rescaling process the upscaled voxel is assigned as pore voxel if the fraction of pore voxels in original dataset is larger than 50 the extracted pore network based on the rescaled digital rock is shown in fig 14 b which consists of 8850 pore bodies and 19 884 throat bonds before the two phase flow simulation we firstly simulate single phase flow in this porous medium with lbm ipnm and cpnm respectively lbm simulation is implemented directly in the rescaled complete digital rock the left boundary is considered as inlet and right as outlet and pressure boundary conditions are imposed on both sides when the relative volume flux change in 100 consecutive iteration time steps is less than 10 5 the simulation is assumed to have reached the steady state then the volume flux across the digital rock is recorded and the permeability is calculated based on darcy equation which is k lbm 1 591 µm2 this is considered as the reference permeability of this digital rock the lbm simulation is executed on the piz daint from the swiss national supercomputing centre the computational time is transformed to equivalent one cpu time by multiplying the time for simulation with the number of cpus which is 23 594 h to simulate single phase flow or two phase flow with the ipnm the flow properties listed in section 3 3 of each throat bond should be calculated first as described in sections 3 1 and 4 1 to guarantee the accuracy of lbm simulation results the minimum inscribed radius of the throat cross section should be 6 lattices however for most of the cross sections extracted from this digital rock the inscribe radii are smaller than 6 lattices to apply the trained ann model to predict the flow properties the small cross sections are firstly amplified to larger images with the inscribed radii larger than 6 lattices then the nine parameters shown in table 1 characterizing the shapes of these amplified cross sections are calculated and adopted in the trained ann models to predict the flow properties finally the single phase conductance and capillary pressure are rescaled to the original cross sections according to their dimensions as follows 9 g g a l r 4 p c p c a l r where the superscript a means the amplified cross section l r r in a r in is the amplification coefficient the relative conductance is a dimensionless value and therefore we do not need to rescale it the above rescaling processes have been validated using lbm simulation results for the cpnm the similar rescaling processes are also conducted to calculate the corresponding flow properties then both cpnm and ipnm are used to simulate single phase flow in the extracted pore network using equations and listed in appendix b1 and the corresponding permeability are calculated which are k cpnm 1 863 µm2 and k ipnm 1 683 µm2 respectively the relative error re for cpnm and ipnm are 17 11 and 5 81 respectively which is defined as re k pnm k lbm k lbm 100 as can be seen both pore network models well predict the permeability of this digital rock and the ipnm improves the accuracy in calculating the permeability the computational time for pore network model is mainly spent on the image processing while solving the pressure distribution takes less than 0 1 s for cpnm and ipnm the computational times are 1 12 h and 1 84 h respectively which are negligible compared with the lbm computational time next the primary drainage process of oil displacing water in this porous medium is simulated by both the ipnm and cpnm and the simulation results are compared with experimental results which were widely used to validate pore network models dong and blunt 2009 valvatne 2004 the digital rock is water wet and the contact angle of water is 0 the viscosities of water and oil are 1 05 and 1 39 mpa s respectively and the surface tension is 30 0 mn m valvatne 2004 at initial condition the pore network is fully filled with water then the oil is injected from the inlet x 0 to drain water out of the pore network under a certain simulation step and driven pressure difference the invaded pore bodies and throat bonds are recorded based on the invasion percolation theory as introduced in section 3 2 the non wetting phase saturation in each invaded cubic pore body is calculated according to the corresponding capillary pressure saturation relationship joekar niasar et al 2010 then the total non wetting phase volume in the pore network can be obtained by summing up the non wetting phase volume in each invaded pore body for the relative permeability the sub networks of both wetting and non wetting phases are extracted according to the phase distribution based on the relative conductance saturation relationship in each throat bond the corresponding fluid conductance of each phase can be obtained then the permeability of each phase can be calculated similar to the single phase flow simulation fig 14 c shows the relative permeability curves during primary drainage process calculated by different pore network models and the comparison with experimental results the improved pore network model coupling lbm simulation results shows better prediction results than the conventional pore network model which demonstrates the better predictive capacity of the improved pore network model in addition we can see that the coupling process has a particularly significant effect on the non wetting phase oil relative permeability this is due to the fact that after the breaking through a throat bond by the non wetting phase the wetting phase exists only as wetting layers at the corners which means the wetting phase saturation and conductance is very small in the invaded throat bond therefore the wetting phase relative permeability is dominated by the uninvaded throat bonds and the coupling process has little effects on the wetting phase relative permeability however for the non wetting phase the invaded throat bonds are determining its relative permeability as stated in sections 3 3 4 and 4 2 the viscous coupling between two phases is considered in the improved pore network model which significantly improves the non wetting phase relative conductance for each throat bond accordingly the non wetting phase relative permeability increases significantly in ipnm compared with cpnm similar phenomenon has also been observed in other research xie et al 2017 but in this work an improved pore network is proposed which better describes the throat geometry 5 conclusions in this paper an improved pore network model is proposed to simulate two phase drainage flow in porous media to describe the throat structure more accurately the throat bonds with real cross sections are retained in the improved pore network model five flow properties are needed in the pore network simulation of two phase drainage flow including the critical entry capillary pressure capillary pressure saturation relationship single phase conductance and relative conductance saturation relationships for both phases for a certain pair of fluids such as oil and water as adopted in this paper these flow properties are dependent on the throat geometry however for the throat bonds with real cross sections there is no analytical or empirical expression to predict these flow properties therefore the lattice boltzmann method is applied to calculate the flow properties in these arbitrary throat bonds as there are usually tens of thousands of throat bonds in a typical pore network simulating the flow properties in each throat bond is still time consuming to further improve the computational efficiency five artificial neural network models are developed to relate the flow properties with the shape of the throat cross sections which decrease the simulation time from days to only seconds nine parameters are selected to characterize the shape of cross sections to build up the database 1421 throat cross sections are randomly selected from 5 sandstone digital rocks and lbm is adopted to simulate the flow properties in these throat cross sections five ann models are trained to predict the flow properties based on the lbm simulation results and the shape of the cross sections the prediction results of both conventional pore network model and the trained ann models are compared with the lbm simulation results the comparison results demonstrate that the ann models give much better prediction results than the conventional pore network model this conclusion is also validated by both single phase flow and two phase drainage flow simulations in a berea sandstone the main contribution of this work is that we provide a new way to couple lattice boltzmann method and pore network model to simulate two phase drainage flow in porous media more accurately and more efficiently in addition we demonstrate that the artificial neural network model is a very promising tool to predict the two phase flow properties through arbitrary throat geometry provided a sufficient rich database exists it should be mentioned that we focus only on water oil system in this work however the two phase flow properties are also dependent on other parameters such as fluid properties and wettability in future work we will further explore the influence of other parameters on two phase flow properties and develop a more general artificial neural network model to predict flow properties in addition a quasi static pore network model is adopted in this work we will also extend this coupling process to dynamic pore network model in future work credit authorship contribution statement jianlin zhao conceptualization methodology

5340,lattice boltzmann method lbm and pore network model pnm are two types of simulation methods for modelling the fluid flow in porous media at the pore scale lbm is accurate in representing the pore structures but is computationally expensive while pnm is very efficient but cannot capture the details of pore structures in this work we propose to couple these two methods to simulate two phase drainage flow in porous media to describe the throat geometry more accurately an improved pore network extraction method is proposed based on watershed method where throat bonds with real throat cross sections are extracted a multi relaxation time color gradient lattice boltzmann model is adopted to simulate the flow properties for each throat bond namely critical entry capillary pressure capillary pressure saturation relationship single phase conductance and relative conductance saturation relationship for both phases which are the input parameters for pnm simulations to further improve the computational efficiency five artificial neural network models are developed which relate the five flow properties to the actual shape of throat cross sections where the shape is characterized by 9 parameters the database consists of lbm simulations of the flow properties of 1421 throat cross sections extracted from 5 sandstone digital rocks the trained artificial neural network models show much better performance than the conventional pnm when predicting the flow properties for each throat bond finally the accuracy of the improved pnm coupled with lbm is validated by both the single phase flow and two phase drainage flow in a berea sandstone keywords two phase drainage flow porous media lattice boltzmann method pore network model artificial neural network 1 introduction multiphase flow in porous media is a common phenomenon in many areas such as enhanced oil recovery ground water flow co2 storage gas water transport in proton exchange membrane pem fuel cells building materials exposed to the environment the capillary pressure curve and relative permeability curve are two key input parameters for macroscale flow simulation in all these applications usually these curves are obtained through experimental measurements in recent years with the development of pore scale imaging techniques and computational capacity pore scale numerical simulations blunt et al 2013 have been more and more used towards predicting the fluid flow and transport properties of porous media in pore scale numerical simulations the first step is to characterize the porous media and their pore structure we retain x ray micro computer tomography as a main technique to acquire digital 3d datasets greyscale images of porous material samples with different resolutions and level of details dependent on modalities once acquired reconstructed and sometimes post processed the digital dataset is then segmented into a binary image consisting of pore voxels and solid voxels various segmentation techniques may be applied schlüter et al 2014 wildenschild and sheppard 2013 fluid flow directly based on realistic porous structures can be simulated by direct numerical methods dnm these methods include the traditional computational fluid dynamic cfd method based on navier stokes n s equations ferrari and lunati 2014 prodanović and bryant 2006 zhu et al 2020 the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method tartakovsky and meakin 2006 the dissipative particle dynamics dpd method groot and warren 1997 and the lattice boltzmann method lbm etc among these methods lbm is becoming most popular because of the following advantages a ease of programming b natural suitability for parallel computing c ease of dealing with complex solid boundaries etc in a pioneering work succi et al 1989 firstly adopted lbm to simulate single phase flow in three dimensional complex porous media as the simulation could recover darcy s law this work was groundbreaking towards using lbm in rock and other porous media physics since then lbm has been more widely adopted to simulate both single phase and multi phase flow in porous media for single phase flow permeability is the most important property lbm has been adopted to simulate single phase flow in different kinds of porous geometries nabovati et al 2009 okabe and blunt 2004 the relationship between permeability and pore structures was widely studied bosl et al 1998 kang et al 2014 nabovati et al 2009 pan et al 2006 zhao et al 2020 2018b 2016 which can be used for macroscale flow simulations or analysis of flow mechanisms for example sun et al 2017 proposed to analyze the gas transport patterns in shale rocks based on the lbm simulation results noteworthy is the paper of pan et al 2006 that reported that the permeability obtained by single relaxation time srt lbm is strongly dependent on fluid viscosity which was an unphysical result this defect can be significantly controlled by multi relaxation time mrt lbm therefore the mrt lbm is used in this work for multiphase flow simulation there are different kinds of lb models huang et al 2015 mainly including the color gradient model leclaire et al 2017 zhao et al 2018a pseudo potential model qin et al 2019 2018 shan and chen 1993 wei et al 2018 free energy model swift et al 1996 and mean field model he et al 1999 these models have been adopted to investigate different multiphase problems in porous media liu et al 2016 including relative permeability calculation jiang and tsuji 2017 landry et al 2014 zhao et al 2018a capillary pressure curve prediction porter et al 2009 displacement dynamics liu et al 2014 fluid trapping jiang and tsuji 2015 etc for all the direct numerical methods including lbm tremendous high resolution computational grids are needed to capture the detailed porous structures which leads to heavy computational costs therefore lbm is usually accelerated by cpu pan et al 2004 or gpu an et al 2017 parallelization despite these efforts simulation domains can still be too large especially for multiphase flow simulations pore network model pnm is another type of pore scale numerical method which is much more computational efficient than direct numerical methods aghaei and piri 2015 blunt et al 2013 instead of simulating fluid flow directly in realistic pore structures pnm simulates fluid flow in simplified pore networks which can be extracted from real often digitalized porous media gostick 2017 or built using known characteristics jivkov et al 2013 the complex pore structures are simplified into regular pore bodies connected by throat bonds in conventional pnm the cross sections of the pore bodies and throat bonds are selected to be circles squares triangles or other regular geometries the fluid flow properties in such simple pore bodies and throat bonds can be calculated by analytical or empirical expressions lal et al 2019 øren et al 1998 rajaram et al 1997 valvatne 2004 this significantly reduces the computational costs however in counterpart the oversimplified pore bodies and throat bonds are less accurate than a description based on the real pore structures and can lead to errors in the predicted flow properties the conventional pnm has two primary simplifications one is that the complex pore and throat cross sections are simplified into regular geometries the other is that the throat bond with uniform cross section is used to characterize the tortuous flowing paths with variating cross sections between two pore bodies some efforts have been devoted to improving the accuracy of pnm from these two aspects raeini et al 2018 2017 developed a generalized pore network model which uses several corners in both the pore bodies and throat bonds to more accurately describe the pore structures in addition the cross section variations between pore bodies and throat bonds were also considered the generalized pnm showed better simulation results than the conventional pnm but both the extraction and computation processes were much more complicated while some others mainly focused on improving the description of throat cross sections such as miao et al 2017 and rabbani and babaei 2019 we also devote to improving the accuracy of throat cross section in this work as described above dnms can accurately capture the details of pore structures however the high computational costs limit their applications for large digital porous media on the contrary pnm is very computational efficient but is inaccurate in describing the real pore structures in recent years different methods have been developed to combine the strengths of both dnm and pnm sholokhova et al 2009 and van marcke et al 2010 developed similar improved pnm for single phase flow simulation the pore throat pore elements are extracted from the digital porous media without geometry simplification when extracting the pore network then dnm is used to simulate single phase flow and calculate the conductance in each pore throat pore element the obtained conductance can be in turn introduced into pnm to calculate the permeability of the whole porous media as the flow resistance of single phase flow is mainly encountered in the throats because of their smaller cross section miao et al 2017 and rabbani and babaei 2019 proposed another pnm approach which only considers the real cross section of throat bonds in addition the artificial neural network ann model is adopted to relate the throat conductance with the shape of cross section parameters as input for two phase flow simulation recent developments aimed on incorporating the influence of viscous coupling at fluid fluid interfaces dnm simulation of two phase flow in different regular channels allow considering the influence of viscous coupling dehghanpour et al 2011 shams et al 2018 the obtained conductance of different phases can be used in pnm to calculate the relative permeability xie et al 2017 as the imbibition mechanisms are much more complicated than drainage process the dnm has also been used to investigate the pore filling mechanisms in regular pore bodies ferrari and lunati 2014 zacharoudiou et al 2017 to this day developments of pnm for two phase flow simulation are mainly based on conventional regular pore networks it remains a challenging issue of how to improve the pnm for two phase flow simulation while taking into account the real pore geometry this topic is addressed in this paper in this work we focus on capillary dominated two phase drainage flow in porous media during drainage the maximum capillary pressures are encountered in the throats because of their narrow cross sections this means that the two phase drainage flow is throat dominated highlighting the need to describe the throat structures accurately therefore we develop an improved pore network model considering real throat cross sections to simulate two phase drainage flow in porous media the two phase flow properties in these real throat bonds are calculated by lbm because lbm requires high computational resources the capacity of ann model to relate the flow properties to the shape of cross sections is investigated as a mean of reducing computational costs although similar coupling method has been reported for single phase flow in porous media miao et al 2017 rabbani and babaei 2019 the two phase flow problem is much more complicated and asks a more advanced treatment which we addressed in this work the paper is arranged as follows in section 2 we briefly introduce the pore network extraction method in section 3 the numerical methods are introduced including the color gradient lattice boltzmann model conventional pore network model cpnm and improved pore network model ipnm developed in this paper the coupling procedure between lbm and ipnm is described in detail in section 4 the accuracy of cpnm and ipnm in predicting two phase flow properties is analyzed in detail finally the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 pore network extraction method there are two types of pore networks artificial regular pore networks raoof and hassanizadeh 2010 and pore network extracted from digital porous media the latter one is more realistic as it keeps the topology of real pore structures there are different pore network extraction methods such as medial axis based method lindquist et al 1996 maximum ball based method dong and blunt 2009 watershed based method gostick 2017 rabbani et al 2014 etc compared with the first two types of pore network extraction methods the watershed based method is much easier to implement while the accuracy remains satisfactory gostick 2017 rabbani et al 2014 therefore in this work the watershed method is adopted to decompose the pore space and extract the pore network two different pore networks are extracted one with a conventional method with geometry simplification of pore bodies and throat bonds and one with an improved method with realistic throat geometry 2 1 porous media decomposition using watershed method the open source algorithm snow gostick 2017 is adopted to decompose the porous media into sub pore regions this algorithm includes four steps first step is to get the distance map and apply gaussian filter to remove some fake watershed ridge lines then a maximum filter is applied to eliminate peaks on saddles and plateaus next the peaks close to each other are merged into one peak finally the porous media are segmented into sub pore regions more details about this algorithm can be found in gostick 2017 using the watershed method the pore space is split into sub pore regions as illustrated in fig 1 b each sub pore region corresponds to a pore body within the pore network the sub pore regions are connected with narrow interfaces which correspond to throat bonds in the pore network 2 2 conventional pore network extraction in this work we assign all the pore volume to the pore bodies and no volume to the throat bonds in addition we assume that the pore bodies have no flow resistance and that all flow resistance is located at the throat bonds similar assumptions have been used before joekar niasar et al 2010 in terms of geometry all pore bodies are taken as cubes with a volume equal to the volume of the corresponding sub pore region for the throat bonds the inscribed radius rin and shape factor g are determined in order to simplify the real throat cross sections into regular geometries such as circle square and triangle valvatne 2004 the inscribed radius rin is defined as the radius of inscribed circle in the throat cross section the shape factor g is defined as a p 2 where a and p are the area and perimeter of the throat cross section respectively based on g the throat cross sections can be simplified into triangle g 3 36 square 3 36 g 1 16 and circle g 1 16 respectively after the geometry simplification the parameters a and p of the throat bonds are recalculated based on the simplified cross sections for other parameters such as the length of throat bonds and the coordinates of pore bodies we adopt the same method introduced in gostick 2017 it is possible that the inscribed radius of a throat bond may be slightly larger than those of the connected pore bodies as for throat bond the inscribed radius is obtained based on 2d cross section while for the pore body it is obtained based on 3d geometry but the number of these throat bonds is very small if a pore body has a smaller inscribed radius than the connected throat bond we change the inscribed radius of this pore body to that of the throat bond which means the total pore volume may be slightly changed but this volume change is negligible 2 3 improved pore network extraction with real throat cross section in the conventional pore network both the pore bodies and throat bonds are simplified into regular geometries since the throats determine the invasion patterns and the flow properties during two phase drainage flow a highly accurate description of the throat geometry should be sought for therefore we propose to use the throat bonds with real throat cross sections to replace the regular throat bonds of the conventional pore network as the pore bodies are only used to calculate the saturation of the whole pore network and they have no influence on the invasion process and flow properties we continue to consider them as cubes similar pore networks have been adopted to simulate single phase flow in porous media miao et al 2017 rabbani and babaei 2019 however the improved pore network adopted here to simulate two phase drainage flow asks a more advanced treatment as shown in fig 1 b using the watershed method the porous media can be decomposed into sub pore regions the centroids of different pore regions are determined as shown by the black dots in fig 1 b sub pore regions 2 and 3 are two connected regions to get the cross section of their throat we firstly connect the two centroids with a straight line shown in dashed blue line then a plane perpendicular to this line is inserted and moved from centroid 2 to 3 the varying cross sections along this line are obtained and the cross section with minimum inscribed radius is selected as the real throat cross section fig 2 shows one real throat cross section extracted from the fontainebleau sandstone shown in fig 11 e different parameters miao et al 2017 rabbani and babaei 2019 are adopted to characterize the cross section as shown in table 1 these parameters are used in the ann model to predict the flow properties of throat bonds 3 numerical methods 3 1 color gradient lattice boltzmann model in this work a three dimensional mrt color gradient lattice boltzmann model liu et al 2012 xu et al 2017 zhao et al 2018a is adopted to simulate the two phase flow properties in each throat bond in this model two density distribution functions marked as red and blue are used to represent the two fluids the two phase interaction is modeled by a perturbation operator and recoloring operator the perturbation operator is used to generate the interfacial tension and the recoloring operator is used to produce the phase segregation and maintain the phase interface the model is briefly described in appendix a in general the accuracy of lbm simulation results increases with grid resolution to get reliable flow properties in each throat bond the grid resolution should be high enough therefore two phase drainage simulations through a square throat bond with different grid numbers are conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the lb model and to analyze the influence of grid resolution on simulation results the square throat bond model of sizes h h l and l 2 5h is shown in fig 3 a and h ranges from 5 to 20 lattices to eliminate the influence of boundary condition two buffer zones of 10 lattices are added at the inlet and outlet at the inlet seen on the left in the figure a velocity boundary condition is adopted while a pressure boundary condition is adopted at the outlet in all the simulations the interfacial tension is 0 05 in lattice unit and the contact angle of the wetting phase is 0 used for all simulations afterwards as initial condition the throat is filled with the wetting phase then the non wetting phase is injected from the inlet with a low capillary number velocity when the non wetting phase breaks through into the throat as shown in fig 3 b the entry capillary pressure pc is obtained the simulation results are compared with theoretical solutions as shown in fig 4 where the analytical solution is equation in appendix b the accuracy of the lb model increases with grid number when the pore size becomes larger than 11 lattices the relative error between lbm simulation result and the theoretical solution is within 3 therefore to get accurate simulation results we set the minimum throat radius to be 6 lattices hence a pore size of 12 lattices in the following simulations in addition to the entry capillary pressure the accuracy of using this lb model to simulate two phase flow conductance is also verified for concurrent annular two phase flow in a cylindrical tube the wetting phase flows along the solid walls while the non wetting phase locates itself in the center the relative conductance of the two phases can be analytically calculated by the following equations ramstad et al 2010 1 g rw s w 2 g rn 2 s n m s n 2 1 2 m where m is the dynamic viscosity ratio between the non wetting phase and wetting phase the subscripts w and n represent wetting phase and non wetting phase respectively two cylindrical tubes with the diameters of 12 and 20 lattices are built and the lb model is used to simulate the annular two phase flow in both tubes with two different viscosity ratios m 1 0 and m 1 324 the detailed simulation plan is similar to that in section 3 3 4 fig 5 allows comparison between the lbm simulation results and the theoretical solution as can be seen with both grid resolutions the lbm simulation results match well with the theoretical solutions demonstrating the accuracy of using lbm to simulate the relative conductance 3 2 conventional pore network model for quasi static pore network model the invasion percolation theory is usually adopted to simulate the drainage process the general procedure for drainage simulation is as follows 1 the pore network is initialized by filling it with wetting phase for the inlet pore body set the entry capillary pressure as the minimum critical entry capillary pressure of the connecting throat bonds 2 set the wetting phase pressure at outlet as pw set the initial non wetting phase pressure as pn the inlet pore bodies are marked as invaded if pn pw is larger than their entry capillary pressures then iterations are performed as follows 3 search the minimum critical entry capillary pressure pc ent min for all throat bonds connecting to the invaded pore bodies 4 compare pn pw with pc ent min to determine whether invasion occurs if pn pw is larger than pc ent min go to step 5 otherwise go to step 8 5 invade the non wetting phase into this throat bond and the connecting pore body if it has not been invaded yet 6 detect trapping of pore bodies and throat bonds remove isolated non invaded pore bodies and throat bonds that cannot connect to the outlet through wetting phase 7 calculate fluid saturation and relative permeability 8 increase pn with a small pressure difference pn pn δp check the uninvaded inlet pore bodies and mark them as invaded if pn pw is larger than the corresponding entry capillary pressures steps 3 to 8 are repeated until a finish criterion is reached as shown in fig 6 the finish criterion can be a certain driven pressure difference or a certain wetting phase saturation this process is implemented with a fast algorithm masson and pride 2014 five flow properties are needed in this simulation including 1 critical entry capillary pressure pc ent 2 capillary pressure saturation relationship for each pore body and each throat bond 3 single phase conductance of each throat bond 4 relative conductance saturation relationship for wetting phase in each throat bond 5 relative conductance saturation relationship for non wetting phase in each throat bond in the cpnm these five properties are calculated by analytical or empirical expressions based on the simplified pore and throat geometry as shown in appendix b 3 3 improved pore network model with flow properties calculated by lattice boltzmann method as stated in section 2 3 the improved pore network relies on throat bonds with real throat cross sections there is no expression to predict the two phase flow properties through arbitrary throat bonds therefore lbm is used to calculate the five flow properties of the throat bonds described in previous section then these flow properties are incorporated into the quasi static pnm to simulate two phase flow in the whole porous medium in all simulations and analyses of section 3 3 we constantly use lattice units in terms of two phases a water oil system is used in this work as we do not consider the effect of gravity the densities of wetting phase and non wetting phase are set to be 1 0 and their viscosities 0 175 and 0 23167 respectively the contact angle of wetting phase is 0 and the interfacial tension between the two phases is 0 05 the lbm simulation results can be easily transferred into physical units given the time scale t 0 length scale l 0 and mass scale m 0 zhao et al 2018a for example if we set t 0 5 0 10 8s l 0 5 0 10 6m and m 0 1 5 10 15kg the viscosities of two fluids can be calculated by μ phy μ lbm m 0 l 0 t 0 which are 1 05 and 1 39 mpa s for water and oil respectively and the interfacial tension can be calculated by σ phy σ lbm m 0 t 0 2 which is 30 0 mn m next we will describe in detail how we calculate the five flow properties of the throat bonds 3 3 1 critical entry capillary pressure just before the non wetting phase breaks through the throat bond it is the shape of the front two phase meniscus also referred to as main meniscus that determines the capillary pressure therefore we need to model the dynamics of this main meniscus during the drainage process where the non wetting phase displaces the wetting phase through the throat bond in order to get the critical entry capillary pressure fig 7 a shows a real throat cross section extracted from a fontainebleau sandstone this throat cross section is extended in x direction with a distance of 5rin where rin is the inscribed radius then two buffer zones of 10 lattices are added at the inlet left and outlet right to represent the connecting two pore bodies and to eliminate the influence of boundary conditions the computational domain is shown in fig 7 b at initial condition the throat bond and right pore body are filled with the wetting phase while the left pore body is filled with the non wetting phase then the non wetting phase is injected into the throat bond with a small capillary number ca 5 0 10 4 from the inlet boundary while constant pressure boundary condition is adopted at the outlet boundary upon injection of the non wetting phase the pressure difference between the two phases increases when the pressure difference exceeds the entry capillary pressure the non wetting phase breaks through into the throat bond and the corresponding pressure difference is the critical entry capillary pressure it should be mentioned that the entry capillary pressure is dependent on ca during this drainage process we select ca 5 0 10 4 after a sensitivity analysis for ca between 0 00025 and 0 03 shows little sensitivity for ca smaller than 0 001 3 3 2 capillary pressure saturation relationship in a pore or throat hosting two fluids the curvature of the interface will determine the capillary pressure as a phase invades a pore or throat filled by another phase different saturation ratios of the pore or throat will yield different capillary pressures upon filling a throat bond the main meniscus seen in the previous section eventually disappears after the non wetting phase breaks through the throat bond which means the curvature of interface along the throat bond becomes infinite and arc menisci in the corners will determine the capillary pressure the model shown in fig 8 a is used to get such capillary pressure saturation relationship in the throat bond the same throat bond used in the previous section is now closed with solid walls a similar model approach has been adopted in other research suh et al 2017 to calculate the capillary pressure for arbitrary throat bonds at initial condition a certain amount of non wetting phase is set in the middle of the domain and the remaining volume is filled with wetting phase fig 8 a shows the two phase distribution at steady state capillary pressure is obtained directly from the simulation results among the different cross sections along the throat bond in x direction we use the middle cross section x nx 2 to calculate the saturation under this capillary pressure similar to suh et al 2017 as the curvature of interface along the throat bond here is almost infinite as shown in fig 8 c fig 8 d shows the capillary pressure saturation relationship of this throat bond where point e corresponds to the configuration seen in a c when the saturation is very low the non wetting phase appears as an isolated sphere in the center of the throat bond with increase of the non wetting phase saturation the radius of the non wetting phase sphere increases and the capillary pressure decreases this corresponds to the first stage of the capillary pressure saturation curve after a minimum pc which corresponds to the critical entry capillary pressure pc increases with increasing non wetting phase saturation in the quasi static pnm the non wetting phase can fill the throat bond only after the driven pressure difference exceeds the critical entry capillary pressure therefore only the right half of the capillary pressure saturation relationship shown in red in fig 8 d is needed in the simulations 3 3 3 conductance single phase flow simulation is performed to calculate the single phase or saturated conductance of the throat bond the computational model consists of a throat cross section as shown in fig 9 a given that periodic boundary conditions are used the depth of the model is small namely 3 lattices a sensitivity analysis with 6 and 10 lattices showed identical results the throat bond is fully filled with one fluid and a small external acceleration ax 1 0 10 4 is added in x direction to this fluid when the simulation reaches steady state the volume flux q across the throat bond is determined then the conductance of this throat is calculated by 2 g μ q ρ a x μ μ where ρ is the fluid density in lbm simulation μ is the dynamic viscosity of the lbm simulation μ is the dynamic viscosity of fluid to be used in the pore network simulation 3 3 4 relative conductance saturation relationship using the model for determining the single phase conductance the relative conductance of two phase flow at different saturations is calculated as initial conditions a certain amount of non wetting phase is initialized at the middle of the cross section according to the distance map shown in fig 9 b and the wetting phase is initialized near the solid surface then an acceleration ax 1 0 10 4 is added to both fluids when the simulation reaches the steady state both the phase distribution and velocity distribution can be obtained fig 9 c shows the phase distribution when the non wetting phase saturation is about 0 7 the blue color represents the non wetting phase and the red color represents the wetting phase fig 9 d shows the corresponding velocity distribution from this the volume fluxes of both non wetting and wetting phases q n and q w can be calculated the conductance of either fluids can be calculated by 3 g k q k ρ k a x where the subscript k n w denotes the non wetting phase and wetting phase respectively the relative conductance is 4 g r k g k g μ k where g μ k is the conductance of the single phase with the dynamic viscosity of μ k which is calculated based on eq 3 it should be noted that the viscous coupling between the two phases is directly considered in this simulation under different non wetting phase saturations the relative conductance can be calculated following the above procedure fig 9 e shows the relative conductance saturation relationship for the throat bond used as illustration as the influence of viscous coupling varies with viscosity ratio this work is valid for the viscous ratio between the two phases used i e 1 324 3 4 machine learning to relate flow properties with shape information although simulating the flow properties in one single throat bond is very efficient it is still time consuming and complicated to conduct simulations for all throat bonds of the extracted pore networks to get the corresponding flow properties for computational efficiency we use machine learning to relate flow properties to shapes of cross sections to do so a feed forward artificial neural network model is selected as it is able to approximate almost all kinds of functions regardless of their complexities valeh e sheyda et al 2010 in general an artificial neural network model includes three types of layers the input layer hidden layer s and output layer fig 10 shows the simplest ann model which has only one hidden layer for this ann model which consists of n m and 1 nodes in the input hidden and output layers respectively the final output can be calculated by 5 y g j 1 m w kj 2 f i i n w ji 1 x i b j 1 b k 2 where x is the input value and y is the final output value w is weight b is bias f and g are the transfer functions we set f as a hyperbolic tangent transfer function and g as a linear transfer function the performance of the ann model in the training process is evaluated by the mean square error mse which is defined as 6 mse i 1 n y i y i 2 n where n is the total number for evaluation y and y are the target and prediction values respectively the training process is implemented with the neural network toolbox in matlab the total database is randomly divided into three parts training set validation set and test set the training set is used to train the ann model by optimizing the weights and biases based on mse the validation set monitors the training process to avoid overfitting the test set is used to evaluate the generalization of the trained ann model in addition to mse the performance of the trained ann model is also evaluated by two other metrics i e the mean absolute relative error mare and the determination coefficient de the definitions are 7 mare 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 8 de 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y is the mean target value 4 results and analysis 4 1 rock samples and simulation plan in this work we focus on oil water two phase flow in sandstones using five different digital sandstones acquired through x ray ct from one bentheimer one berea and three fontainebleau and available from online resources shown in fig 11 a e the digital rocks are decomposed into sub pore regions using the watershed method and the throat cross sections are extracted as described in section 2 1 from each digital rock we randomly select 200 300 throat cross sections all selected throat cross sections have inscribed radii larger than 6 lattices a total of 1421 cross sections some shown in fig 11 f are selected we note that the flow properties of smaller throats are determined as described in section 4 4 below for this investigation we do not consider sub resolution porosity next different models are built based on the selected cross sections and lbm is used to calculate different flow properties as explained in section 3 3 for the critical entry capillary pressure and single phase conductance only one simulation is needed for each throat bond for the capillary pressure saturation relationship and relative conductance saturation relationship nine simulations are conducted for each throat bond therefore with 20 simulations per cross section this amounts to a total of 28 420 simulations in the following analysis the non dimensional lattice units are adopted unless otherwise specified the physical units can be easily obtained through unit transfer as stated in section 3 3 4 2 comparison of flow properties at the pore scale calculated by lbm and cpnm to evaluate the accuracy of cpnm we compare the five flow properties obtained by lbm simulations with those obtained by cpnm predictions for all the selected throat bonds in a series of graphs shown in fig 12 in all the graphs x represents the properties obtained by lbm simulations without geometry simplification and y represents the corresponding values predicted by cpnm with simplified throat bonds for cpnm the geometry simplification process is discussed in section 2 2 and the analytical or empirical expressions of the different flow properties are given in appendix b comparing the cpnm and lbm results we observe that overall the results show globally similar trends except for the relative conductance saturation results looking at the critical entry capillary pressure the cpnm prediction results agree well with the lbm simulation results this is because the critical entry capillary pressure mainly depends on the inscribed radius as shown in equation in appendix b2 as described in section 2 2 the radius of the simplified throat bond is the radius inscribed within the real throat cross section it is thus expected that these two methods have similar predictions on the other hand there are still some non negligible deviations between cpnm predictions and lbm simulation results these are induced by the differences in shape of the cross sections for the capillary pressure saturation relationship we plot the capillary pressure versus saturation results upon and after the non wetting phase breaks through the throat bond which corresponds to the red points shown in fig 8 d fig 12 b shows a large spread between cpnm predictions and lbm simulation results the capillary pressure saturation relationship mainly depends on the shape of arc menisci in the corners compared with the real throat cross sections as shown in fig 11 f the regular triangular or square cross sections are too simple to describe the arc meniscus dynamics therefore the cpnm predictions deviate significantly from lbm simulation results fig 12 c shows the log log plot of single phase conductance obtained by the two different methods according to equation in appendix b1 the conductance is mainly determined by the area of cross section as described in section 2 2 the inscribed radius and shape factor are adopted to simplify the real throat cross section into regular geometries which means the area of cross section may be changed during this simplification this is the main reason for these differences between the cpnm predictions and lbm simulation results fig 12 d compares relative conductance under different saturations calculated by cpnm and lbm methods as the expression for wetting phase conductance eq 26 only applies upon and after the non wetting phase breaks through the throat bond we only plot these points in this figure in contrast for the non wetting phase we plot all the points under different saturations as mentioned the relative conductance calculated by cpnm does not agree with lbm simulation results with cpnm underestimating the relative conductance but less so at low and high fluid saturations this is due to the fact that in cpnm when calculating the conductance of both phases the fluid fluid interfaces are treated as solid boundaries which means the viscous coupling between the two phase is neglected however fluids will have some non zero velocities at the fluid fluid interfaces as seen in our lbm simulations fig 9 d in addition as the viscosity of the non wetting phase is a little higher than that of the wetting phase the relative conductance of non wetting phase can be even higher than 1 0 due to the lubrication effect the problem of viscous coupling has also been identified by other researchers in regular throat geometries shams et al 2018 xie et al 2017 according to above analysis it can be concluded that for the single phase conductance and critical entry capillary pressure the prediction of cpnm is acceptable the main reason is that these two properties are only dependent on the shape of the throat cross section for a certain pair of fluids and the simplified cpnm can well describe the controlling parameters such as inscribed radius and shape factor for these two properties while for the capillary pressure saturation relationship and relative conductance saturation relationship in addition to the shape of cross section the phase distribution also has significant influence on these properties however the phase distribution can be very complicated in arbitrary throat bond depending on the shape of throat cross section both the simplification of the complex throat cross section and the resulting change of phase distribution make it more difficult to predict these two properties in addition the viscous coupling between the two phases is not considered in cpnm resulting in a worse prediction of the non wetting phase relative conductance 4 3 artificial neural network model to predict flow properties as described in sections 3 2 and 3 3 five flow properties are needed in the quasi static pnm for drainage simulation therefore five ann models are trained to predict the different flow properties the critical entry capillary pressure and single phase conductance are not related to fluid saturation the input parameters only include the nine shape parameters listed in table 1 for the two capillary pressure saturation and relative conductance saturation relationships in addition to the above nine parameters saturation is also one input parameter for each ann model we randomly select 70 of the database as training set 15 of the database as validation set and the left 15 as test set for the critical entry capillary pressure and single phase conductance there are 1421 sets of data for the capillary pressure saturation relationship only the data after the non wetting phase breaks through the throat bond are used shown as red points in fig 8 d for the relative conductance saturation relationship there are 12 789 sets of data for both wetting phase and non wetting phase only one hidden layer is applied in the ann model as this is sufficient to describe the relationships between inputs and outputs as the performance of ann model is related to the neuron number in the hidden layer n hidden and the initialization of weights and biases the trial and error method is adopted to optimize the architecture of the ann model for each flow property the architecture n hidden of the ann model is determined by increasing n hidden from 4 to 40 for each n hidden we run 30 times the training process and select the best one to reduce the influence of initialization of weights and biases the optimal architecture of hidden layer is chosen by comparing the performances of the ann models for different n hidden table 2 shows the optimal architecture and performance metrics of different ann models for comparison the corresponding performance metrics of cpnm are also listed when calculating the performance metrics of cpnm we just replace y i in equations with the value calculated based on cpnm fig 13 shows the comparison of different flow properties calculated by lbm shown on the x axes and those predicted by the trained ann models on the y axes according to the comparison results the ann models can predict the critical entry capillary pressure single phase conductance and relative conductance saturation relationship perfectly using the input parameters the corresponding determination coefficients are all larger than 0 99 for the capillary pressure saturation relationship the performance of ann model is a little worse but it is still much more accurate than cpnm as also reflected with performance metrics listed in table 2 according to the comparison results the ann model can significantly reduce mare and increase de of the prediction results which demonstrates that it is a very promising tool to predict the two phase flow properties through arbitrary throat bonds 4 4 validation of the improved pore network model to simulate fluid flow in porous media in this section the ipnm and cpnm are used to simulate both single phase flow and two phase flow in a berea sandstone to verify the accuracy of different models the digital rock of berea sandstone is shown in fig 14 a before the following processing and simulations this digital rock is upscaled from 1024 1024 1024 voxels to 512 512 512 voxels in order to reduce the computational cost which means eight neighboring voxels in the original dataset are merged into one voxel in the rescaled digital rock in the rescaling process the upscaled voxel is assigned as pore voxel if the fraction of pore voxels in original dataset is larger than 50 the extracted pore network based on the rescaled digital rock is shown in fig 14 b which consists of 8850 pore bodies and 19 884 throat bonds before the two phase flow simulation we firstly simulate single phase flow in this porous medium with lbm ipnm and cpnm respectively lbm simulation is implemented directly in the rescaled complete digital rock the left boundary is considered as inlet and right as outlet and pressure boundary conditions are imposed on both sides when the relative volume flux change in 100 consecutive iteration time steps is less than 10 5 the simulation is assumed to have reached the steady state then the volume flux across the digital rock is recorded and the permeability is calculated based on darcy equation which is k lbm 1 591 µm2 this is considered as the reference permeability of this digital rock the lbm simulation is executed on the piz daint from the swiss national supercomputing centre the computational time is transformed to equivalent one cpu time by multiplying the time for simulation with the number of cpus which is 23 594 h to simulate single phase flow or two phase flow with the ipnm the flow properties listed in section 3 3 of each throat bond should be calculated first as described in sections 3 1 and 4 1 to guarantee the accuracy of lbm simulation results the minimum inscribed radius of the throat cross section should be 6 lattices however for most of the cross sections extracted from this digital rock the inscribe radii are smaller than 6 lattices to apply the trained ann model to predict the flow properties the small cross sections are firstly amplified to larger images with the inscribed radii larger than 6 lattices then the nine parameters shown in table 1 characterizing the shapes of these amplified cross sections are calculated and adopted in the trained ann models to predict the flow properties finally the single phase conductance and capillary pressure are rescaled to the original cross sections according to their dimensions as follows 9 g g a l r 4 p c p c a l r where the superscript a means the amplified cross section l r r in a r in is the amplification coefficient the relative conductance is a dimensionless value and therefore we do not need to rescale it the above rescaling processes have been validated using lbm simulation results for the cpnm the similar rescaling processes are also conducted to calculate the corresponding flow properties then both cpnm and ipnm are used to simulate single phase flow in the extracted pore network using equations and listed in appendix b1 and the corresponding permeability are calculated which are k cpnm 1 863 µm2 and k ipnm 1 683 µm2 respectively the relative error re for cpnm and ipnm are 17 11 and 5 81 respectively which is defined as re k pnm k lbm k lbm 100 as can be seen both pore network models well predict the permeability of this digital rock and the ipnm improves the accuracy in calculating the permeability the computational time for pore network model is mainly spent on the image processing while solving the pressure distribution takes less than 0 1 s for cpnm and ipnm the computational times are 1 12 h and 1 84 h respectively which are negligible compared with the lbm computational time next the primary drainage process of oil displacing water in this porous medium is simulated by both the ipnm and cpnm and the simulation results are compared with experimental results which were widely used to validate pore network models dong and blunt 2009 valvatne 2004 the digital rock is water wet and the contact angle of water is 0 the viscosities of water and oil are 1 05 and 1 39 mpa s respectively and the surface tension is 30 0 mn m valvatne 2004 at initial condition the pore network is fully filled with water then the oil is injected from the inlet x 0 to drain water out of the pore network under a certain simulation step and driven pressure difference the invaded pore bodies and throat bonds are recorded based on the invasion percolation theory as introduced in section 3 2 the non wetting phase saturation in each invaded cubic pore body is calculated according to the corresponding capillary pressure saturation relationship joekar niasar et al 2010 then the total non wetting phase volume in the pore network can be obtained by summing up the non wetting phase volume in each invaded pore body for the relative permeability the sub networks of both wetting and non wetting phases are extracted according to the phase distribution based on the relative conductance saturation relationship in each throat bond the corresponding fluid conductance of each phase can be obtained then the permeability of each phase can be calculated similar to the single phase flow simulation fig 14 c shows the relative permeability curves during primary drainage process calculated by different pore network models and the comparison with experimental results the improved pore network model coupling lbm simulation results shows better prediction results than the conventional pore network model which demonstrates the better predictive capacity of the improved pore network model in addition we can see that the coupling process has a particularly significant effect on the non wetting phase oil relative permeability this is due to the fact that after the breaking through a throat bond by the non wetting phase the wetting phase exists only as wetting layers at the corners which means the wetting phase saturation and conductance is very small in the invaded throat bond therefore the wetting phase relative permeability is dominated by the uninvaded throat bonds and the coupling process has little effects on the wetting phase relative permeability however for the non wetting phase the invaded throat bonds are determining its relative permeability as stated in sections 3 3 4 and 4 2 the viscous coupling between two phases is considered in the improved pore network model which significantly improves the non wetting phase relative conductance for each throat bond accordingly the non wetting phase relative permeability increases significantly in ipnm compared with cpnm similar phenomenon has also been observed in other research xie et al 2017 but in this work an improved pore network is proposed which better describes the throat geometry 5 conclusions in this paper an improved pore network model is proposed to simulate two phase drainage flow in porous media to describe the throat structure more accurately the throat bonds with real cross sections are retained in the improved pore network model five flow properties are needed in the pore network simulation of two phase drainage flow including the critical entry capillary pressure capillary pressure saturation relationship single phase conductance and relative conductance saturation relationships for both phases for a certain pair of fluids such as oil and water as adopted in this paper these flow properties are dependent on the throat geometry however for the throat bonds with real cross sections there is no analytical or empirical expression to predict these flow properties therefore the lattice boltzmann method is applied to calculate the flow properties in these arbitrary throat bonds as there are usually tens of thousands of throat bonds in a typical pore network simulating the flow properties in each throat bond is still time consuming to further improve the computational efficiency five artificial neural network models are developed to relate the flow properties with the shape of the throat cross sections which decrease the simulation time from days to only seconds nine parameters are selected to characterize the shape of cross sections to build up the database 1421 throat cross sections are randomly selected from 5 sandstone digital rocks and lbm is adopted to simulate the flow properties in these throat cross sections five ann models are trained to predict the flow properties based on the lbm simulation results and the shape of the cross sections the prediction results of both conventional pore network model and the trained ann models are compared with the lbm simulation results the comparison results demonstrate that the ann models give much better prediction results than the conventional pore network model this conclusion is also validated by both single phase flow and two phase drainage flow simulations in a berea sandstone the main contribution of this work is that we provide a new way to couple lattice boltzmann method and pore network model to simulate two phase drainage flow in porous media more accurately and more efficiently in addition we demonstrate that the artificial neural network model is a very promising tool to predict the two phase flow properties through arbitrary throat geometry provided a sufficient rich database exists it should be mentioned that we focus only on water oil system in this work however the two phase flow properties are also dependent on other parameters such as fluid properties and wettability in future work we will further explore the influence of other parameters on two phase flow properties and develop a more general artificial neural network model to predict flow properties in addition a quasi static pore network model is adopted in this work we will also extend this coupling process to dynamic pore network model in future work credit authorship contribution statement jianlin zhao conceptualization methodology

5341,one of the main environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing hf is the upward migration of the hf fluids from a shale reservoir to reach the shallow drinking water aquifers through preferential flow paths such as fractures or faults oversimplified model structures or arbitrary boundary conditions were used in the previous studies resulting in inaccurate results to better describe the flow and transport in fractures faults and matrix pores a dual medium model including fracture fault and matrix was established in this study to understand the evolution that occurs in reservoir pressure during hf and the long term migration of hf fluids in deep geological formations considering sichuan basin china as a case study both hf fractures and pre existing natural faults were characterized as highly permeable preferential flow channels simulation results show that the spatial distribution of pressure in shallow aquifers is mainly controlled by the topography while it is controlled by overpressure in the deep strata hf fluids were not found to contaminate the shallow groundwater throughout the simulation period even in the worst scenario a sensitivity analysis is carried out to quantify and understand the influence of a broad range of possibilities of parameters such as hf fracture reservoir properties and hf operation the results suggest that the reservoir properties and the duration over which the injection of hf fluid take place are the most important factors influencing the spatiotemporal distribution of hf moreover hf fluids are removed from the formation by the production of gas meaning that these fluids are unlikely to contaminate the shallow aquifers of the sichuan basin keywords shallow groundwater hydraulic fracturing dual medium model numerical simulation shale gas sichuan basin 1 introduction the success of extracting unconventional gas such as shale gas from shale formations over the last decade has changed the energy landscape especially in the united states shale gas rose from 2 of u s gas production in 2000 to 35 in 2012 sieminski 2015 abundant supplies of natural gas have been discovered in the u s which greatly increases u s the energy independence of the country kerr 2010 vidic et al 2013 on a global scale very large reserves of shale gas have been discovered in some other countries including canada china germany and the united kingdom for example the abundant shale gas resources in china cover a geological reserve volume of 134 4 1012 m3 with a technologically recoverable reserve volume of 25 08 1012 m3 according to the estimates made by the ministry of land and resources in 2012 zhao and yang 2015 indicating wide ranging development prospects for the extraction of shale gas in china industrial development for shale gas production has begun in the sichuan basin which is considered to have the greatest recoverable reserves of natural gas in china hydraulic fracturing hf is generally used to produce economically viable quantities of natural gas from unconventional reservoirs such as shale despite the large resource potential and economic benefits the environmental risks caused by hf in shale gas development have triggered an intense public debate especially regarding the possibility of the fluids used in fracturing reaching the water resources during the hf process a volume of 9000 29 000 m3 of hf fluid is injected into the deep reservoirs at pressures greater than that produced by the lithosphere causing the formation to fracture and thereby increasing its local permeability mcbroom 2013 cai and ofterdinger 2014 vengosh et al 2014 however only 5 50 is estimated to return to the surface as flowback and the rest of hf fluid may be permanently trapped in the shale matrix birdsell et al 2015 so it becomes a potential threat to the environment the migration of hf fluid in deep shale gas reservoirs is a complicated multi scale multi phase and multi physics process that involves thermal hydrodynamic mechanical and chemical processes stephansson et al 2004 xue et al 2019 moreover the coexistence of different media with significantly different permeabilities such as the highly permeable fracture zone and the less permeable tight matrix is an obstacle to address these issues meaning that many of the mechanisms by which hf fluid migrates remain unclear however both natural gas and hf fluids have been found in water wells and shallow aquifers near the areas developed for shale gas digiulio et al 2011 osborn et al 2011 although the exact source and pathways have not been determined with the increasing development of shale gas and the demand for environmental protection researchers are required to simplify studies related to shale gas production myers 2012 wilson et al 2017 taherdangkoo et al 2019 such as merely focusing on the single phase transport of contaminants ignoring the thermal effect or ignoring the stress effect however the results of these studies have appeared contradictory so far myers 2012 saiers and barth 2012 wilson et al 2017 ladevèze et al 2019 taherdangkoo et al 2019 the controversial issue is whether or not hf fluids that are injected into the subsurface at depths of several kilometers can migrate upwards through natural geological pathways to reach the shallow aquifers that are present at depths of tens to hundreds of meters two conditions that must be met for the upward migration of hf fluid to occur fig 1 the presence of long term upward head gradient and a permeable pathway through which fluids can be transported the upward head gradient from deep shale reservoirs to shallow aquifers is mainly through the topographically driven flow that occurs in regional groundwater discharge zones tóth 2009 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2017b zhang et al 2018 the overpressure in shale gas reservoirs osborne and swarbrick 1997 and the overpressure produced by the injection of hf fluid topographic gradients create long flow paths that penetrate to significant depths and traverse entire basins consequently brine a common deep formation fluid can be transported over long distances and may eventually be able to migrate upwards to mix with shallow fresh water in discharge areas e g near a river valley or coast jiang et al 2014 wang et al 2017a the overpressure in shale gas reservoirs resulting from disequilibrium compaction and the cracking of oil to natural gas is common in oil and gas basins around the world these two upward driving forces are both persistent and pre existing however the overpressure produced due to hf fluid injection is ephemeral and may be active in conjunction with hf the geological formations that lie between shale gas reservoirs and the overlying groundwater aquifers are often of low permeability and considerable thicknesses approximately 1500 m previous studies have shown that significant upward transport of injected fluids is unlikely unless there are permeable pathways present such as fractures and faults myers 2012 gassiat et al 2013 kissinger et al 2013 based on systematic analysis flewelling and sharma 2014 suggested that overpressure is always present with in shale units the extent of which depends on the permeability of the overburden rocks the significant thickness and low permeable lithology between the shale unit and shallow aquifers means that the rapid upward migration of hf fluids myers 2012 rozell and reaven 2012 warner et al 2012 is not physically plausible the potential contamination of shallow aquifers from the upward migration of hf fluids through preferential pathways such as fractures or faults is often considered negligible because the growth extent of these fractures is too small to directly connect the shale unit with shallow aquifers zoback et al 2010 and fault reactivation due to hf would likely occur over small distances of only a few meters mcbroom 2013 moreover the downward and horizontal flow of fluids from the horizontal shale gas well may be promoted during gas production thus decreasing the risk of upward migration howarth et al 2011 however the risks still exist if hf induces communication with other conductive paths such as natural faults or abandoned wells fig 1 in this case the long distances and low permeability of the lithology may not act as sufficient barriers against the flow of hf fluid into shallow aquifers in addition it is difficult to determine whether the hf of shale formations affects the quality of groundwater because baseline conditions decades of monitoring and detailed information concerning the drilling and casing of well is required to generate an accurate conclusion most importantly the complex flow and transport of solutes through induced and natural fractures which are generally over 1000 m below the overlying aquifers requires a long term and extensive monitoring program that is often unavailable in summary it is difficult to preclude future groundwater contamination solely based on theoretical analysis therefore numerical modeling analyses of the flow and transport that occurs in fractured rock systems may be conducted for the purpose of risk assessment many studies have built numerical models to assess the possibility of the upward migration of hf fluid to contaminate shallow groundwater using data from shale gas fields around the world in countries such as in north america myers 2012 reagan et al 2015 edwards et al 2017 germany kissinger et al 2013 pfunt et al 2016 taherdangkoo et al 2019 and england cai and ofterdinger 2014 wilson et al 2017 in these studies the equivalent porous media epm approach was used due to its advantages in dealing with regional scale models both the fractures caused by hf and the pre existing faults are preferential flow paths for the upward migration of hf fluids in the formation however epm is difficult to characterize such heterogeneous characteristics which might lead to inaccuracy and uncertainty the discrete fracture network dfn approach is able to describe the heterogeneity of a fractured rock by explicitly depicting the geometry of fracture and fault dong et al 2019 but it is impossible to accurately describe all fractures from the deep shale reservoir to shallow aquifer due to the scarcity of fracture information such as the location orientation shape size and transmissivity of each fracture besides a regional scale dfn model with large number of fractures will require a huge amount of calculation therefore a dual medium model combining the advantages of both the equivalent continuum and discrete fracture network approaches xue et al 2019 has the ability to better predict the migration of hf fluid in fractured shale formations as well as in shallow aquifers in order to avoid oversimplified model structures and artificially unrealistic boundary conditions in previous studies a dual medium model including both fracture fault and matrix is built to assess the potential risk for the upward migration of hf fluids in the sichuan basin which has not yet been addressed it can describe the effect of fracture or fault on the preferential flow and a more natural boundaries are used such as those used in the model based on the groundwater flow system theory proposed by tóth 2009 using the geological setting of sichuan basin the first shale gas field in china as a case study a typical two dimensional profile crossing over the shale gas well was selected for the risk assessment of hf upward migration in the subsurface the key parameters related to the migration were also analyzed to quantify and understand the influence of a broad spectrum of field possibilities 2 materials and methods 2 1 geological and hydrogeological setting the sichuan basin located tectonically west of the yangtze metaplatform is a large and tectonically stable old oil gas bearing superimposed basin that encompasses approximately 180 103 km2 in southwest china fig 2 the strata in sichuan basin includes a complete regional sedimentary record with exposures from the presinian to the quaternary system the strata is approximately 6000 12 000 m in thickness and spans from the paleozoic to the cenozoic six different source rocks are present within the formation ranging from the cambrian and silurian through the permian to the triassic which are the dominant source rocks in the basin fig 2 huang et al 1997 zhu et al 2007 and includes strata from the lower cambrian lower silurian lower permian upper permian lower jurassic and the upper triassic the lower silurian longmaxi formation is more widespread than the formations with the total residual thickness of the silurian strata reaching approximately 1200 m in the southern sichuan basin the sedimentary rocks in the southern sichuan basin are lower silurian in age including the longmaxi shiniulan hanjiadian and xiushan formations with an average thickness of 800 1000 m chen et al 2014 the longmaxi formation consists of black graptolitic shale in the lower section and nodular limestone in the upper section the shiniulan formation consists of gray and dark gray limestone nodular limestone nodular muddy limestone and bioclastic calcarenite and calcirudite with the inclusion of some interbedded shales the hanjiadian formation is composed of mudstone with intercalated calcirudite beds and small patch reefs the xiushan formation is composed of grayish yellow and grayish green shale and silty shale interbedded with siltstones fig 2 the shales in the upper ordovician wufeng formation lower silurian longmaxi formation in the sichuan basin and the surrounding areas are the key strata currently under exploration for the production and construction of shale wells the jiaoshiba zone shows excellent exploration potentials one of the national areas used for the demonstration of shale gas production the well jiaoye 1 jy1 in the longmaxi formation was tested for high yield industrial gas flow after hf in november of 2012 as this is the first shale gas well in china a two dimensional cross section running through jy1 was selected for numerical simulation to assess the environmental risk to an adjacent shallow aquifer due to hf structurally the jiaoshiba shale field is located in a transitional area of the basin which runs in a northeast direction transitioning to a near north south direction fig 2 according to the observable lithological differences the strata in the jiaoshiba area can be roughly divided into five layers 1 the upper permian lower triassic limestone 2 lower permian mudstone and interbedded limestone 3 middle and lower silurian mudstone 4 upper ordovician and lower silurian shale and mudstone and 5 cambrian ordovician limestone that reaches from the surface to the base of the basin the upper ordovician wufeng formation and lower silurian longmaxi formation are both shale gas reservoirs the closest fault to the jy1 well site is the daershan fault fig 3 f4 that cuts across the strata from the cambrian to the triassic and runs in a north south direction as an east dipping fault with an inclination of approximately 40 dong et al 2015 the formation pressure coefficient which gradually increases from top to bottom ranges from 1 1 to 1 6 and it is approximately 1 55 in the shale gas reservoirs guo and zhang 2014 as mentioned above the sichuan basin is surrounded by mountains with a central region that consists mainly of hills and mountains of low elevation fractures in the bedrocks such as sandstone and limestone are the main reservoirs for groundwater a small amount of shallow groundwater is also found in the pores of the quaternary loose rocks in some of the lower valleys precipitation is an important recharge sources for shallow groundwater and the shallow groundwater flow system pattern is controlled by topography while the deep groundwater flow is controlled by the tectonic conditions of the sedimentary basin because of the abundant precipitation and large number of rivers in the study area groundwater is rarely exploited as drinking water by the residents in this region however there exists a close relationship between groundwater and surface water surface water such as the yangtse river will be in an extremely dangerous situation if groundwater is polluted by the hf migration groundwater is sometimes used as an alternative source for drinking water as a result ensuring that shallow groundwater is not polluted is crucial to the safety of the surface water and consequently the drinking water 2 2 mathematical model the migration of hf in the subsurface at depths of several kilometers is a typical multi scale multi phase and multi physics issue gas hf fluid brine and solid proppants migrate from micro nano scale pores in the shale to centimeter meter scale horizontal wells under control of multi physical control including thermal hydrodynamic mechanical and chemical processes however the focus of this study is the migration of a water based fluid as all the critical additives used in hf are primarily water soluble flow and transport through gas migration is considered unlikely to occur because the gas and liquid phase are separate and continue individually beyond a certain transport distance schwartz 2015 in addition no significant gas phase is present in many hf applications such as shale oil or deep geothermal systems due to the overpressure in the reservoir therefore single phase flow was applied in the model the absolute permeability of a single phase in porous media is always greater than that of multiphase van genuchten 1980 flewelling and sharma 2014 enhancing the ability of hf to flow through and potentially out of the shale reservoir meanwhile the temperature may rise significantly in the subsurface at depths of several kilometers due to the geothermal gradient changing the viscosity of the fluid this may therefore be one of the forces driving the movement of the fluid in addition the significant amount of stress present within deep formations causes the fractures to close greatly reducing the permeability of the medium although hf operation can lead to an instantaneous increase in the local permeability the possibility of hydraulically induced fractures at great depths thousands of meters leading to the activation of faults and creating new flow paths that can reach shallow groundwater resources or even the surface is remote rutqvist et al 2013 therefore this is a worst case situation used to assess the potential of risk to the shallow aquifers when the thermal and mechanical processes are neglected in addition hf fluid is assumed to be a conservative tracer when dissolved in the water phase of our model because it is a water based chemical mixture that is composed of a base fluid with the addition of friction reducers scale inhibitors corrosion inhibitors surfactants and other additives kekacs et al 2015 this means that the model does not account for sorption and biological chemical degradation processes we acknowledge that modeling hf fluid as an inert tracer represents a conservative less favorable scenario and leads to an overestimation of the contamination distribution in the aquifer kissinger et al 2013 thus the following set of general equations is used to describe the flow and transport in a porous media system u k μ p ρ g d t ρ ε ρ u q m c i t d c i u c i r i where u is the darcy velocity si unit m s k is the permeability of the porous medium si unit m2 μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid si unit pa s p is the fluid s pressure si unit pa ρ is its density si unit kg m3 g is the magnitude of gravitational acceleration si unit m s2 d is a unit vector in the direction affected by gravity acts ε is the porosity dimensionless qm is a the mass source term si unit kg m3 s ci is the concentration of the species si unit mol m3 d is the diffusion coefficient si unit m2 s and ri is the reaction rate expression for the species si unit mol m3 s fluids flowing through the natural fractures artificial hf fractures and faults are conceptualized by assuming laminar flow between parallel plates with no additional surface friction which is described by the cubic law snow 1969 fractures are treated as interior boundaries in the model and the fracture flow node adds fracture flow to the boundaries using tangential derivatives to define the flow along the interior boundaries that represent fractures within a porous medium the fracture permeability and flux can be given by k f d f 2 12 q f k f μ d f t p ρ g t d where d f is the thickness of the fracture si unit m k f is the fracture permeability si unit m2 q f is the volume flow rate per unit length in the fracture si unit m2 s t denotes the gradient operator that is restricted to the tangential plane of the fracture and d represents the vertical coordinate the mathematical model was implemented using the comsol 5 2 a multiphysics simulator the pre existing subsurface flow module was utilized by combining the darcy s law interface with the transport of diluted species in the porous media interface comsol multiphysics is a finite element analysis software package that is used in various physics and engineering applications in which the mathematical model is discretized using the finite element method 2 3 numerical model the model domain consisted of a vertical cross section of an 8 km long and 3 5 km deep portion of a sedimentary basin including the five strata mentioned in section 2 1 fig 3 the numerical model was divided into six layers including an artificially set shallow aquifer with a thickness of 100 m at the top fig 4 a high recharge rate combined with a low hydraulic conductivity of aquifer leads to the groundwater table being controlled by topography haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 relatively large amounts of precipitation occur in the study area and the shallow groundwater is mainly distributed among bedrock fractures with low permeabilityl thus any undulation in groundwater table can be considered consistent with the topography as a result the upper boundary was set simply as a constant head that is on the same level as the terrain the bottom and lateral boundaries are no flow boundaries the initial condition in a particular layer was set to hydrostatic pressure if the formation pressure coefficient was normal otherwise it was set to the hydrostatic pressure multiplied by the formation pressure coefficient the main parameters for each layer in the model are listed in table 1 the permeability effective porosity and formation pressure coefficient in each of the lithostratigraphic units were found in previously published literature concerned with the sichuan basin owing to the wide range of data sources the parameters that are most likely to cause hf migration are used in the base case model to avoid conservative results for example if different permeabilities for the same formation are reported in different studies the largest is selected the results for predicting the migration of hf fluid to an aquifer is therefore considered the worst scenario in the base case model the ratio of horizontal permeability kh to vertical permeability kv was set to 10 in all layers because the permeability in sedimentary basins is inherently anisotropic across a range of spatial scales and kh is often an order of magnitude or greater than kv desbarats 1987 after the hydraulic fracturing of the shale reservoir a multi scale network of fractures will form along both sides of the horizontal well and the maximum range that the artificial hydraulic fracturing reaches is called the hydraulic fracturing zone barati and liang 2014 the drilling data from jy1 shows that the thickness of the part of the shale reservoir with a high gas content is 89 m guo and zhang 2014 and the micro seismic monitoring data shows that the maximum height of the fracture growth is less than 80 m liu et al 2017 the hydraulic fracturing zone was set to 80 m it was assumed that the multi scale fracture network consists of both primary and secondary fractures the fracture that is directly connected to the horizontal well was considered the primary fracture the secondary fracture is connected to the primary fracture and the others fractures are considered natural fig 4 based on the engineering parameters of jy1 the basic parameters of the horizontal well and hf fractures are given in table 2 and the parameter values selected for flow and transport in the model are listed in table 3 2 4 simulation period and stages our model included four separate stages the injection of fracturing fluids a shut in period production and the continued migration of fracturing fluids after the well has been plugged and abandoned because the migration of hf fluid in the groundwater of the subsurface is a long term process the four stages were modeled as a continuous process over 1000 years stage 1 injection was set to 1 day and involved the injection of approximately 11 106 kg of fracturing fluid with a specified pressure boundary condition of 50 mpa 85 of the lithostatic pressure assuming an overburden density of 2500 kg m3 the depth of the horizontal well is approximately 2500 m in the horizontal well the concentration of hf fluid was set at 100 mol m3 stage 2 was a shut in period lasting 20 days during which no fluid was allowed to leave or enter the domain via the horizontal wellbore and the well pressure was maintained at 50 mpa stage 3 represents a 20 year period of production with a specified pressure boundary conditions in the horizontal wellbore nodes the specified pressure was set at approximately 20 mpa which is also called the bottom hole pressure large amounts of hf fluid should be removed during this stage stage 4 lasts from the end of the production to 1000 years the well was decommissioned and no fluid was allowed to leave or enter the domain through the well nodes and the fracturing fluid plume was allowed to migrate 3 results 3 1 distribution and evolution of pressure fractures whether natural or artificial are predominant channels through which flow and mass transfer occurs in rocks but the traditional equivalent porous medium model cannot describe these characteristics in our study a dual medium model was used to characterize the fracture and rock matrix in a hydraulic fracturing shale reservoir the spatial distribution of pressure in the profile at the end of the shut in periods which is mainly controlled by the topography and overpressure is shown in fig 5 the results show that groundwater flow patterns in the shallow aquifer are consistent with the theoretical results by tóth 2009 the tracking trajectories of water particles originating at the surface are represented by the white lines in fig 5 the local and intermediate flow systems are shown and the groundwater flows from the high to the low terrain in the shallow aquifer shallow groundwater cannot penetrate the deep formations because of the low permeability and overpressure so the movement of deep pore water is mainly controlled by overpressure the overpressure occurs in the lower and middle silurian mudstone 4th layer in table 1 the upper ordovician and lower silurian shale and mudstone 5th layer in table 1 and the cambrian ordovician limestone 6th layer in table 1 which is consistent with the current field observations much of the data obtained from oil and gas fields have shown that oil and gas reservoirs in sedimentary basins such as the sichuan basin tarim basin etc osborne and swarbrick 1997 karlsen and skeie 2006 liu et al 2016 are in states of overpressure the overpressure in the shale reservoir is approximately 40 mpa and may have been preserved for millions of years since the formation of the respective basins in order to understand the relationship between permeability and overpressure and to determine how pressure changes with location two observation points are set in the model where no hf operation is taking place no 95 is located in the discharge zone and no 499 the recharge zone with the specific locations in fig 4 the change in pressure over time is shown in fig 6 the hydrostatic pressure is plotted as dashed line in fig 6 for comparison the time required for overpressure dissipation was estimated under the following conditions 1 no faulting and 2 with permeable faults fig 6 according to the model results the overpressure in the shale reservoir can be maintained for 1 ma without faulting after which the pressure will increase gradually if it is the discharge zones and decreases if it is in recharge zones due to the influence of the regional groundwater flow that is driven by the topography from 1 ma to 100 ma fig 6a after 100 ma the pressure in both the discharge zones and recharge zones declined because of pressure dissipation even if the pressure has stabilized after 10 000 ma in the discharge zones no 95 it was still greater than the hydrostatic pressure fig 6a in contrast the normal pressure is less than the hydrostatic pressure in the recharge zone no 499 assuming that the shale gas reservoir was connected to the ground surface using the daershan fault as a permeable pathway the pressure in the shale gas reservoir would drop rapidly after 0 2 ma fig 6b overall the time required for the pressure to dissipate is approximately 0 1 ma if there is a permeable fault such as the daershan fault 1 10 8 m2 that connects the overpressure formations with the ground surfaces and the timescale will be hundreds to thousands of ma without faulting after the hf operation begins the pressure in the horizontal well increases dramatically to 50 mpa and the high pressure transfer to the secondary fracture occurs at the end of the shut in period 21 days because the duration of the hf operation is very short and the permeability of the shale reservoir is very low the high pressure of the hf could not be transferred to outside the fracturing zone and could not change the regional pore water flow field during the gas production stage the pressure in the horizontal well plunges to 20 mpa and the pressure in the fracturing zone also falls to 20 mpa in a short time it is clear that fractures represent a preferential flow channel due to high permeability and therefore represent the main factor controlling the pressure distribution 3 2 spatiotemporal distribution of hf fluid a large amount of hf fluid was injected into the horizontal well in one day after which the well was closed during the shut in period hf fluid flows into the secondary fracture or shale matrix and its concentration decreases rapidly the spatiotemporal distribution of the hf fluid during the injection and shut in periods is shown in fig 7 at the beginning of hf the hf fluids diffuse along the primary fracture on both sides at the end of hf fluid injection the hf fluids almost fill the entire hf area and the maximum concentration is equal to the injection concentration during the shut in period the pollutes within the hf fluids limited to 0 01 mol m3 moves gradually upwards to pass the shale formation on the 22nd day because there is no continuous source for recharge the concentration of the hf fluids decreases gradually while the polluted area is expanding after entering the gas production stage the pressure in the horizontal well is less than the shale formation pressure so most of the hf fluid is sucked into the horizontal well and removed from the system modeling results indicate that hf fluids therefore do not contaminate the shallow groundwater throughout the simulation period even in the worst scenario 3 3 parametric study a sensitivity analysis is designed to examine the uncertainties of the geological field and hf operation and draw a meaningful conclusion for the specific setting of the model a total of 49 simulations aimed at assessing different field scenarios and shale gas exploration conditions were run while altering parameters such as the aperture of the primary fracture the aperture of the secondary fracture the permeability of the shale matrix the porosity of the shale matrix the injection time the shut in time the shut in pressure the production pressure and with or without faults in fig 8 location no 431 in fig 4 was selected as a representative to show the change in the concentration of hf fluid because it is located in the hf zone and its concentration can represent the hf migration toward overburden or fault these figures only show the changes in concentration over 1000 days after which the concentration drops to zero fig 8a and b show that the present hf concentration peak at the observation point increases with an increase in the aperture of the primary and secondary fractures a larger aperture makes it easier for the movement of hf fluid whether the fracture is primary or secondary when the primary fracture aperture increases to 0 01 m the concentration peak is 6 times higher than that the scenario in which the aperture is only 0 001 m however the peak concentration of hf fluid only changed from 1 to 1 3 mol m3 when the secondary fracture aperture is increased from 0 0001 m to 0 001 m a longer tail of the hf fluid concentration curve occurs when the secondary fracture aperture is larger the modeling results indicate that the effect of the primary fracture aperture on concentration is greater than that of the secondary fracture the effect of shale properties on hf fluid concentration is shown in fig 8c 8d the ascent of hf fluid concentration increased significantly with an increase in the shale permeability the concentration peak reached 10 mol m3 when the permeability was set to 1e 18 m2 while it was only 0 075 mol m3 when the permeability was set to 1e 20 m2 the peak concentration appeared on the 2nd day but it took 8 days for the peak to be reached in the base case therefore a higher permeability of the shale reservoir will significantly speed up the spread of hf fluid the change in shale permeability has a significant influence on the peak hf fluid concentration it is worth noting that there is an inverse relationship between shale porosity and the concentration peak a reduction in the shale porosity will increase the concentration peak for example the concentration was larger than 2 5 mol m3 when the shale porosity was less than 0 01 however a larger shale porosity will significantly extend the tail of the concentration curve but the hf fluid concentration still fell to zero within 1000 days fig 8d during the short lived injection and shut in periods the duration of the hf fluid injection and shut in pressure are the dominant forces for hf fluid migration from the hf zone to the overburden and fault although in any defined scenario the hf fluid fails to migrate to the shallow aquifer a long injection time and a larger shut in pressure will cause the hf fluid to stay in the shale reservoir and maintain a higher concentration of two to five times the base case scenario fig 8e and 8 g in particular the peak concentration may reach 5 mol m3 and the hf fluid remain in the shale reservoir for at least 300 days when the short lived injection time lasts 3 days while the peak concentration is only 0 6 mol m3 and it stays in the reservoir for less than 80 days fig 8e on the contrary different shut in periods and different gas production pressures have little effect on the hf fluid migration fig 8f and 8 h there is only a slight difference in the hf concentration curve tail when changing the shut in period and gas production pressure the effects of these parameters on the retention and migration of the fracturing fluid is not obvious 4 discussion hf fluid migration is likely to occur under certain conditions via natural preferential pathways that transfer contaminants from deep shale reservoirs to shallow aquifers myers 2012 gassiat et al 2013 wilson et al 2017 but the simulation results presented in this paper show that the migration of hf fluid does not contaminate the shallow groundwater throughout the simulation period even in the worst scenario according to the characteristics of the fluid flow pattern in sedimentary basins found in previous studies topographic gradients can transfer fluid from the high terrain on the surface to the deep formations and then force the deep fluid to migrate upwards in the discharge zone however such a cycle only occurs in the 1st layer upper permian lower triassic limestone fig 5 and does not involve the deep cycle in the shale reservoir because of the very low permeability and overpressure in the deep formation in addition based on the current knowledge of basin hydrology jorgensen 1997 and senger et al 1987 showed that estimates for upward flux that are lower than natural meteoric recharge or possibly zero are considered realistic even if the upward migration of deep fluid occurs the travel time from the shale reservoir to the shallow aquifer may be millions of years or longer adams et al 2004 thornton and wilson 2007 flewelling and sharma 2014 because of the inherent association with low permeability rocks in oil and gas basins hf fluids must pass through the overburden or through preferential channels such as faults or fractures if they are to contaminate shallow aquifers however overpressure is usually found in oil and gas basins relying heavily on the low permeability overburden strata dissipation in the overpressure will occur at 0 01 ma and decrease to hydrostatic pressure at 1 ma if there is a permeable fault running through the shale reservoir fig 6b flewelling and sharma 2014 also suggested that permeability should be between 10 23 m2 and 10 20 m2 if the overpressure of a shale reservoir with a depth of 1000 to 5000 m is to be preserved for 10 100 ma it is remotely possible that fault activation caused by hf operation may directly connect shale reservoirs with shallow aquifers flewelling et al 2013 rutqvist et al 2013 the upward fluxes of hf fluid must therefore be extremely small according to these analyses and calculations a numerical model of the jy 1 well which is the first shale gas production well in china was established and the sensitivity of parameters such as shale reservoir properties and hf operation was analyzed numerical simulation showed that the hf concentration was significantly enhanced when the permeability of the shale reservoir increased while a larger porosity of the shale reservoir caused the hf fluid to remain longer within the reservoir it is therefore apparent that the permeability and porosity of the shale matrix significantly affect the hf concentration in the shale reservoir fig 8c and d hf operation such as the duration over which the hf fluid is injected and the shut in pressure is also critical for hf concentration in summary to minimize the impact of hf fluids on the environment the injection time of hf fluid should be shortened and the shut in pressure should be kept relatively low however for many reasons there are still limitations in assessing the potential risks of shallow aquifers using this model first the migration of hf fluid in the subsurface involves multi scale multi phase and multi physical process meaning that it is a complex issue because we focus on the migration of hf fluid from deep to shallow aquifers hf fluids are regarded as conservative tracers for migration in large scale single phase formations this will exaggerate the potential risks when the stress effect capillary forces geochemical reaction and geothermal effects are ignored second the 2d cross sectional model implies that the conditions of an infinitely extended fault and hf zone in the third dimension should be improved to 3d to facilitate the understanding of a more realistic spatial distribution of hf fluid in a shale reservoir however deeper data such as the location of the fault and the hf zone is required to produce such a model third shale gas exploration by hf is a transient and dynamic process changes in parameters such as pressure flow rate and concentration are easy to describe in the model but changes in the properties of hf fractures and shale reservoirs are difficult to accurately characterize in every calculation step in the numerical model for example the aperture of hf fracture increases in the hf fluid injection stage and decreases in the gas production stage but it was set as a constant in our model only when more field data is monitored and a more advanced multi process coupling model is developed can we accurately predict the potential risks of shallow groundwater due to hf fluid migration 5 conclusion a dual medium numerical model based on the first hf shale gas field in china which is located in sichuan basin was developed to assess potential risks of shallow groundwater this model combining the advantages of both the equivalent continuum and discrete fracture network approaches is able to deal with the hf migration on a regional scale and consider the role of preferential flow paths such as fractures or faults after getting the pressure evolution of shale reservoir and the spatiotemporal distributions of the hf fluid a parametric study was conducted to examine the influence of key factors such as the permeability and porosity of the shale reservoir and the hf operation the numerical modeling results revealed the following the spatial distribution of pressure is controlled by the topographic gradient in shallow areas whereas deep overpressure is the driving force for hf fluid migration from deep shale reservoirs to shallow aquifers connoting that the effect of overpressure should be the focus for study moreover overlying low permeable strata is the reason that overpressure preserved for more than a few million years moreover the overpressure will decrease to hydrostatic pressure within 0 2 ma if there is a permeable fault cut shale reservoir it is very unlikely that there is a natural pre existing conductive path such as a highly permeable fault or strata between the shale reservoir and the shallow aquifers after the shut in period the hf pressure is removed and large scale depressurization occurred over time due to the production from the horizontal well a large amount of hf fluid is removed from the shale reservoir through suction into the well in the production stage 1000 days the influence of the physical properties of the reservoir and hf injection time are significant for hf concentration in the reservoir while shut in time and production pressure are inconsequential for hf concentration notably increasing the shale matrix permeability significantly increased the peak concentration of hf fluid and accelerated the spread of hf fluid when the shale matrix permeability was set at 1e 18 m2 the hf fluid concentration at the reservoir was ten times higher than the base case and the peak concentration arrived at the 2nd day rather than the 8th day in the base case therefore accurately and completely determining the permeability of the shale matrix and shortening of hf injection time are considered as the most important factors determining the spatiotemporal distribution of hf fluid in the shale reservoir credit authorship contribution statement liheng wang conceptualization methodology software writing original draft software yanhui dong

5341,one of the main environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing hf is the upward migration of the hf fluids from a shale reservoir to reach the shallow drinking water aquifers through preferential flow paths such as fractures or faults oversimplified model structures or arbitrary boundary conditions were used in the previous studies resulting in inaccurate results to better describe the flow and transport in fractures faults and matrix pores a dual medium model including fracture fault and matrix was established in this study to understand the evolution that occurs in reservoir pressure during hf and the long term migration of hf fluids in deep geological formations considering sichuan basin china as a case study both hf fractures and pre existing natural faults were characterized as highly permeable preferential flow channels simulation results show that the spatial distribution of pressure in shallow aquifers is mainly controlled by the topography while it is controlled by overpressure in the deep strata hf fluids were not found to contaminate the shallow groundwater throughout the simulation period even in the worst scenario a sensitivity analysis is carried out to quantify and understand the influence of a broad range of possibilities of parameters such as hf fracture reservoir properties and hf operation the results suggest that the reservoir properties and the duration over which the injection of hf fluid take place are the most important factors influencing the spatiotemporal distribution of hf moreover hf fluids are removed from the formation by the production of gas meaning that these fluids are unlikely to contaminate the shallow aquifers of the sichuan basin keywords shallow groundwater hydraulic fracturing dual medium model numerical simulation shale gas sichuan basin 1 introduction the success of extracting unconventional gas such as shale gas from shale formations over the last decade has changed the energy landscape especially in the united states shale gas rose from 2 of u s gas production in 2000 to 35 in 2012 sieminski 2015 abundant supplies of natural gas have been discovered in the u s which greatly increases u s the energy independence of the country kerr 2010 vidic et al 2013 on a global scale very large reserves of shale gas have been discovered in some other countries including canada china germany and the united kingdom for example the abundant shale gas resources in china cover a geological reserve volume of 134 4 1012 m3 with a technologically recoverable reserve volume of 25 08 1012 m3 according to the estimates made by the ministry of land and resources in 2012 zhao and yang 2015 indicating wide ranging development prospects for the extraction of shale gas in china industrial development for shale gas production has begun in the sichuan basin which is considered to have the greatest recoverable reserves of natural gas in china hydraulic fracturing hf is generally used to produce economically viable quantities of natural gas from unconventional reservoirs such as shale despite the large resource potential and economic benefits the environmental risks caused by hf in shale gas development have triggered an intense public debate especially regarding the possibility of the fluids used in fracturing reaching the water resources during the hf process a volume of 9000 29 000 m3 of hf fluid is injected into the deep reservoirs at pressures greater than that produced by the lithosphere causing the formation to fracture and thereby increasing its local permeability mcbroom 2013 cai and ofterdinger 2014 vengosh et al 2014 however only 5 50 is estimated to return to the surface as flowback and the rest of hf fluid may be permanently trapped in the shale matrix birdsell et al 2015 so it becomes a potential threat to the environment the migration of hf fluid in deep shale gas reservoirs is a complicated multi scale multi phase and multi physics process that involves thermal hydrodynamic mechanical and chemical processes stephansson et al 2004 xue et al 2019 moreover the coexistence of different media with significantly different permeabilities such as the highly permeable fracture zone and the less permeable tight matrix is an obstacle to address these issues meaning that many of the mechanisms by which hf fluid migrates remain unclear however both natural gas and hf fluids have been found in water wells and shallow aquifers near the areas developed for shale gas digiulio et al 2011 osborn et al 2011 although the exact source and pathways have not been determined with the increasing development of shale gas and the demand for environmental protection researchers are required to simplify studies related to shale gas production myers 2012 wilson et al 2017 taherdangkoo et al 2019 such as merely focusing on the single phase transport of contaminants ignoring the thermal effect or ignoring the stress effect however the results of these studies have appeared contradictory so far myers 2012 saiers and barth 2012 wilson et al 2017 ladevèze et al 2019 taherdangkoo et al 2019 the controversial issue is whether or not hf fluids that are injected into the subsurface at depths of several kilometers can migrate upwards through natural geological pathways to reach the shallow aquifers that are present at depths of tens to hundreds of meters two conditions that must be met for the upward migration of hf fluid to occur fig 1 the presence of long term upward head gradient and a permeable pathway through which fluids can be transported the upward head gradient from deep shale reservoirs to shallow aquifers is mainly through the topographically driven flow that occurs in regional groundwater discharge zones tóth 2009 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2017b zhang et al 2018 the overpressure in shale gas reservoirs osborne and swarbrick 1997 and the overpressure produced by the injection of hf fluid topographic gradients create long flow paths that penetrate to significant depths and traverse entire basins consequently brine a common deep formation fluid can be transported over long distances and may eventually be able to migrate upwards to mix with shallow fresh water in discharge areas e g near a river valley or coast jiang et al 2014 wang et al 2017a the overpressure in shale gas reservoirs resulting from disequilibrium compaction and the cracking of oil to natural gas is common in oil and gas basins around the world these two upward driving forces are both persistent and pre existing however the overpressure produced due to hf fluid injection is ephemeral and may be active in conjunction with hf the geological formations that lie between shale gas reservoirs and the overlying groundwater aquifers are often of low permeability and considerable thicknesses approximately 1500 m previous studies have shown that significant upward transport of injected fluids is unlikely unless there are permeable pathways present such as fractures and faults myers 2012 gassiat et al 2013 kissinger et al 2013 based on systematic analysis flewelling and sharma 2014 suggested that overpressure is always present with in shale units the extent of which depends on the permeability of the overburden rocks the significant thickness and low permeable lithology between the shale unit and shallow aquifers means that the rapid upward migration of hf fluids myers 2012 rozell and reaven 2012 warner et al 2012 is not physically plausible the potential contamination of shallow aquifers from the upward migration of hf fluids through preferential pathways such as fractures or faults is often considered negligible because the growth extent of these fractures is too small to directly connect the shale unit with shallow aquifers zoback et al 2010 and fault reactivation due to hf would likely occur over small distances of only a few meters mcbroom 2013 moreover the downward and horizontal flow of fluids from the horizontal shale gas well may be promoted during gas production thus decreasing the risk of upward migration howarth et al 2011 however the risks still exist if hf induces communication with other conductive paths such as natural faults or abandoned wells fig 1 in this case the long distances and low permeability of the lithology may not act as sufficient barriers against the flow of hf fluid into shallow aquifers in addition it is difficult to determine whether the hf of shale formations affects the quality of groundwater because baseline conditions decades of monitoring and detailed information concerning the drilling and casing of well is required to generate an accurate conclusion most importantly the complex flow and transport of solutes through induced and natural fractures which are generally over 1000 m below the overlying aquifers requires a long term and extensive monitoring program that is often unavailable in summary it is difficult to preclude future groundwater contamination solely based on theoretical analysis therefore numerical modeling analyses of the flow and transport that occurs in fractured rock systems may be conducted for the purpose of risk assessment many studies have built numerical models to assess the possibility of the upward migration of hf fluid to contaminate shallow groundwater using data from shale gas fields around the world in countries such as in north america myers 2012 reagan et al 2015 edwards et al 2017 germany kissinger et al 2013 pfunt et al 2016 taherdangkoo et al 2019 and england cai and ofterdinger 2014 wilson et al 2017 in these studies the equivalent porous media epm approach was used due to its advantages in dealing with regional scale models both the fractures caused by hf and the pre existing faults are preferential flow paths for the upward migration of hf fluids in the formation however epm is difficult to characterize such heterogeneous characteristics which might lead to inaccuracy and uncertainty the discrete fracture network dfn approach is able to describe the heterogeneity of a fractured rock by explicitly depicting the geometry of fracture and fault dong et al 2019 but it is impossible to accurately describe all fractures from the deep shale reservoir to shallow aquifer due to the scarcity of fracture information such as the location orientation shape size and transmissivity of each fracture besides a regional scale dfn model with large number of fractures will require a huge amount of calculation therefore a dual medium model combining the advantages of both the equivalent continuum and discrete fracture network approaches xue et al 2019 has the ability to better predict the migration of hf fluid in fractured shale formations as well as in shallow aquifers in order to avoid oversimplified model structures and artificially unrealistic boundary conditions in previous studies a dual medium model including both fracture fault and matrix is built to assess the potential risk for the upward migration of hf fluids in the sichuan basin which has not yet been addressed it can describe the effect of fracture or fault on the preferential flow and a more natural boundaries are used such as those used in the model based on the groundwater flow system theory proposed by tóth 2009 using the geological setting of sichuan basin the first shale gas field in china as a case study a typical two dimensional profile crossing over the shale gas well was selected for the risk assessment of hf upward migration in the subsurface the key parameters related to the migration were also analyzed to quantify and understand the influence of a broad spectrum of field possibilities 2 materials and methods 2 1 geological and hydrogeological setting the sichuan basin located tectonically west of the yangtze metaplatform is a large and tectonically stable old oil gas bearing superimposed basin that encompasses approximately 180 103 km2 in southwest china fig 2 the strata in sichuan basin includes a complete regional sedimentary record with exposures from the presinian to the quaternary system the strata is approximately 6000 12 000 m in thickness and spans from the paleozoic to the cenozoic six different source rocks are present within the formation ranging from the cambrian and silurian through the permian to the triassic which are the dominant source rocks in the basin fig 2 huang et al 1997 zhu et al 2007 and includes strata from the lower cambrian lower silurian lower permian upper permian lower jurassic and the upper triassic the lower silurian longmaxi formation is more widespread than the formations with the total residual thickness of the silurian strata reaching approximately 1200 m in the southern sichuan basin the sedimentary rocks in the southern sichuan basin are lower silurian in age including the longmaxi shiniulan hanjiadian and xiushan formations with an average thickness of 800 1000 m chen et al 2014 the longmaxi formation consists of black graptolitic shale in the lower section and nodular limestone in the upper section the shiniulan formation consists of gray and dark gray limestone nodular limestone nodular muddy limestone and bioclastic calcarenite and calcirudite with the inclusion of some interbedded shales the hanjiadian formation is composed of mudstone with intercalated calcirudite beds and small patch reefs the xiushan formation is composed of grayish yellow and grayish green shale and silty shale interbedded with siltstones fig 2 the shales in the upper ordovician wufeng formation lower silurian longmaxi formation in the sichuan basin and the surrounding areas are the key strata currently under exploration for the production and construction of shale wells the jiaoshiba zone shows excellent exploration potentials one of the national areas used for the demonstration of shale gas production the well jiaoye 1 jy1 in the longmaxi formation was tested for high yield industrial gas flow after hf in november of 2012 as this is the first shale gas well in china a two dimensional cross section running through jy1 was selected for numerical simulation to assess the environmental risk to an adjacent shallow aquifer due to hf structurally the jiaoshiba shale field is located in a transitional area of the basin which runs in a northeast direction transitioning to a near north south direction fig 2 according to the observable lithological differences the strata in the jiaoshiba area can be roughly divided into five layers 1 the upper permian lower triassic limestone 2 lower permian mudstone and interbedded limestone 3 middle and lower silurian mudstone 4 upper ordovician and lower silurian shale and mudstone and 5 cambrian ordovician limestone that reaches from the surface to the base of the basin the upper ordovician wufeng formation and lower silurian longmaxi formation are both shale gas reservoirs the closest fault to the jy1 well site is the daershan fault fig 3 f4 that cuts across the strata from the cambrian to the triassic and runs in a north south direction as an east dipping fault with an inclination of approximately 40 dong et al 2015 the formation pressure coefficient which gradually increases from top to bottom ranges from 1 1 to 1 6 and it is approximately 1 55 in the shale gas reservoirs guo and zhang 2014 as mentioned above the sichuan basin is surrounded by mountains with a central region that consists mainly of hills and mountains of low elevation fractures in the bedrocks such as sandstone and limestone are the main reservoirs for groundwater a small amount of shallow groundwater is also found in the pores of the quaternary loose rocks in some of the lower valleys precipitation is an important recharge sources for shallow groundwater and the shallow groundwater flow system pattern is controlled by topography while the deep groundwater flow is controlled by the tectonic conditions of the sedimentary basin because of the abundant precipitation and large number of rivers in the study area groundwater is rarely exploited as drinking water by the residents in this region however there exists a close relationship between groundwater and surface water surface water such as the yangtse river will be in an extremely dangerous situation if groundwater is polluted by the hf migration groundwater is sometimes used as an alternative source for drinking water as a result ensuring that shallow groundwater is not polluted is crucial to the safety of the surface water and consequently the drinking water 2 2 mathematical model the migration of hf in the subsurface at depths of several kilometers is a typical multi scale multi phase and multi physics issue gas hf fluid brine and solid proppants migrate from micro nano scale pores in the shale to centimeter meter scale horizontal wells under control of multi physical control including thermal hydrodynamic mechanical and chemical processes however the focus of this study is the migration of a water based fluid as all the critical additives used in hf are primarily water soluble flow and transport through gas migration is considered unlikely to occur because the gas and liquid phase are separate and continue individually beyond a certain transport distance schwartz 2015 in addition no significant gas phase is present in many hf applications such as shale oil or deep geothermal systems due to the overpressure in the reservoir therefore single phase flow was applied in the model the absolute permeability of a single phase in porous media is always greater than that of multiphase van genuchten 1980 flewelling and sharma 2014 enhancing the ability of hf to flow through and potentially out of the shale reservoir meanwhile the temperature may rise significantly in the subsurface at depths of several kilometers due to the geothermal gradient changing the viscosity of the fluid this may therefore be one of the forces driving the movement of the fluid in addition the significant amount of stress present within deep formations causes the fractures to close greatly reducing the permeability of the medium although hf operation can lead to an instantaneous increase in the local permeability the possibility of hydraulically induced fractures at great depths thousands of meters leading to the activation of faults and creating new flow paths that can reach shallow groundwater resources or even the surface is remote rutqvist et al 2013 therefore this is a worst case situation used to assess the potential of risk to the shallow aquifers when the thermal and mechanical processes are neglected in addition hf fluid is assumed to be a conservative tracer when dissolved in the water phase of our model because it is a water based chemical mixture that is composed of a base fluid with the addition of friction reducers scale inhibitors corrosion inhibitors surfactants and other additives kekacs et al 2015 this means that the model does not account for sorption and biological chemical degradation processes we acknowledge that modeling hf fluid as an inert tracer represents a conservative less favorable scenario and leads to an overestimation of the contamination distribution in the aquifer kissinger et al 2013 thus the following set of general equations is used to describe the flow and transport in a porous media system u k μ p ρ g d t ρ ε ρ u q m c i t d c i u c i r i where u is the darcy velocity si unit m s k is the permeability of the porous medium si unit m2 μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid si unit pa s p is the fluid s pressure si unit pa ρ is its density si unit kg m3 g is the magnitude of gravitational acceleration si unit m s2 d is a unit vector in the direction affected by gravity acts ε is the porosity dimensionless qm is a the mass source term si unit kg m3 s ci is the concentration of the species si unit mol m3 d is the diffusion coefficient si unit m2 s and ri is the reaction rate expression for the species si unit mol m3 s fluids flowing through the natural fractures artificial hf fractures and faults are conceptualized by assuming laminar flow between parallel plates with no additional surface friction which is described by the cubic law snow 1969 fractures are treated as interior boundaries in the model and the fracture flow node adds fracture flow to the boundaries using tangential derivatives to define the flow along the interior boundaries that represent fractures within a porous medium the fracture permeability and flux can be given by k f d f 2 12 q f k f μ d f t p ρ g t d where d f is the thickness of the fracture si unit m k f is the fracture permeability si unit m2 q f is the volume flow rate per unit length in the fracture si unit m2 s t denotes the gradient operator that is restricted to the tangential plane of the fracture and d represents the vertical coordinate the mathematical model was implemented using the comsol 5 2 a multiphysics simulator the pre existing subsurface flow module was utilized by combining the darcy s law interface with the transport of diluted species in the porous media interface comsol multiphysics is a finite element analysis software package that is used in various physics and engineering applications in which the mathematical model is discretized using the finite element method 2 3 numerical model the model domain consisted of a vertical cross section of an 8 km long and 3 5 km deep portion of a sedimentary basin including the five strata mentioned in section 2 1 fig 3 the numerical model was divided into six layers including an artificially set shallow aquifer with a thickness of 100 m at the top fig 4 a high recharge rate combined with a low hydraulic conductivity of aquifer leads to the groundwater table being controlled by topography haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 relatively large amounts of precipitation occur in the study area and the shallow groundwater is mainly distributed among bedrock fractures with low permeabilityl thus any undulation in groundwater table can be considered consistent with the topography as a result the upper boundary was set simply as a constant head that is on the same level as the terrain the bottom and lateral boundaries are no flow boundaries the initial condition in a particular layer was set to hydrostatic pressure if the formation pressure coefficient was normal otherwise it was set to the hydrostatic pressure multiplied by the formation pressure coefficient the main parameters for each layer in the model are listed in table 1 the permeability effective porosity and formation pressure coefficient in each of the lithostratigraphic units were found in previously published literature concerned with the sichuan basin owing to the wide range of data sources the parameters that are most likely to cause hf migration are used in the base case model to avoid conservative results for example if different permeabilities for the same formation are reported in different studies the largest is selected the results for predicting the migration of hf fluid to an aquifer is therefore considered the worst scenario in the base case model the ratio of horizontal permeability kh to vertical permeability kv was set to 10 in all layers because the permeability in sedimentary basins is inherently anisotropic across a range of spatial scales and kh is often an order of magnitude or greater than kv desbarats 1987 after the hydraulic fracturing of the shale reservoir a multi scale network of fractures will form along both sides of the horizontal well and the maximum range that the artificial hydraulic fracturing reaches is called the hydraulic fracturing zone barati and liang 2014 the drilling data from jy1 shows that the thickness of the part of the shale reservoir with a high gas content is 89 m guo and zhang 2014 and the micro seismic monitoring data shows that the maximum height of the fracture growth is less than 80 m liu et al 2017 the hydraulic fracturing zone was set to 80 m it was assumed that the multi scale fracture network consists of both primary and secondary fractures the fracture that is directly connected to the horizontal well was considered the primary fracture the secondary fracture is connected to the primary fracture and the others fractures are considered natural fig 4 based on the engineering parameters of jy1 the basic parameters of the horizontal well and hf fractures are given in table 2 and the parameter values selected for flow and transport in the model are listed in table 3 2 4 simulation period and stages our model included four separate stages the injection of fracturing fluids a shut in period production and the continued migration of fracturing fluids after the well has been plugged and abandoned because the migration of hf fluid in the groundwater of the subsurface is a long term process the four stages were modeled as a continuous process over 1000 years stage 1 injection was set to 1 day and involved the injection of approximately 11 106 kg of fracturing fluid with a specified pressure boundary condition of 50 mpa 85 of the lithostatic pressure assuming an overburden density of 2500 kg m3 the depth of the horizontal well is approximately 2500 m in the horizontal well the concentration of hf fluid was set at 100 mol m3 stage 2 was a shut in period lasting 20 days during which no fluid was allowed to leave or enter the domain via the horizontal wellbore and the well pressure was maintained at 50 mpa stage 3 represents a 20 year period of production with a specified pressure boundary conditions in the horizontal wellbore nodes the specified pressure was set at approximately 20 mpa which is also called the bottom hole pressure large amounts of hf fluid should be removed during this stage stage 4 lasts from the end of the production to 1000 years the well was decommissioned and no fluid was allowed to leave or enter the domain through the well nodes and the fracturing fluid plume was allowed to migrate 3 results 3 1 distribution and evolution of pressure fractures whether natural or artificial are predominant channels through which flow and mass transfer occurs in rocks but the traditional equivalent porous medium model cannot describe these characteristics in our study a dual medium model was used to characterize the fracture and rock matrix in a hydraulic fracturing shale reservoir the spatial distribution of pressure in the profile at the end of the shut in periods which is mainly controlled by the topography and overpressure is shown in fig 5 the results show that groundwater flow patterns in the shallow aquifer are consistent with the theoretical results by tóth 2009 the tracking trajectories of water particles originating at the surface are represented by the white lines in fig 5 the local and intermediate flow systems are shown and the groundwater flows from the high to the low terrain in the shallow aquifer shallow groundwater cannot penetrate the deep formations because of the low permeability and overpressure so the movement of deep pore water is mainly controlled by overpressure the overpressure occurs in the lower and middle silurian mudstone 4th layer in table 1 the upper ordovician and lower silurian shale and mudstone 5th layer in table 1 and the cambrian ordovician limestone 6th layer in table 1 which is consistent with the current field observations much of the data obtained from oil and gas fields have shown that oil and gas reservoirs in sedimentary basins such as the sichuan basin tarim basin etc osborne and swarbrick 1997 karlsen and skeie 2006 liu et al 2016 are in states of overpressure the overpressure in the shale reservoir is approximately 40 mpa and may have been preserved for millions of years since the formation of the respective basins in order to understand the relationship between permeability and overpressure and to determine how pressure changes with location two observation points are set in the model where no hf operation is taking place no 95 is located in the discharge zone and no 499 the recharge zone with the specific locations in fig 4 the change in pressure over time is shown in fig 6 the hydrostatic pressure is plotted as dashed line in fig 6 for comparison the time required for overpressure dissipation was estimated under the following conditions 1 no faulting and 2 with permeable faults fig 6 according to the model results the overpressure in the shale reservoir can be maintained for 1 ma without faulting after which the pressure will increase gradually if it is the discharge zones and decreases if it is in recharge zones due to the influence of the regional groundwater flow that is driven by the topography from 1 ma to 100 ma fig 6a after 100 ma the pressure in both the discharge zones and recharge zones declined because of pressure dissipation even if the pressure has stabilized after 10 000 ma in the discharge zones no 95 it was still greater than the hydrostatic pressure fig 6a in contrast the normal pressure is less than the hydrostatic pressure in the recharge zone no 499 assuming that the shale gas reservoir was connected to the ground surface using the daershan fault as a permeable pathway the pressure in the shale gas reservoir would drop rapidly after 0 2 ma fig 6b overall the time required for the pressure to dissipate is approximately 0 1 ma if there is a permeable fault such as the daershan fault 1 10 8 m2 that connects the overpressure formations with the ground surfaces and the timescale will be hundreds to thousands of ma without faulting after the hf operation begins the pressure in the horizontal well increases dramatically to 50 mpa and the high pressure transfer to the secondary fracture occurs at the end of the shut in period 21 days because the duration of the hf operation is very short and the permeability of the shale reservoir is very low the high pressure of the hf could not be transferred to outside the fracturing zone and could not change the regional pore water flow field during the gas production stage the pressure in the horizontal well plunges to 20 mpa and the pressure in the fracturing zone also falls to 20 mpa in a short time it is clear that fractures represent a preferential flow channel due to high permeability and therefore represent the main factor controlling the pressure distribution 3 2 spatiotemporal distribution of hf fluid a large amount of hf fluid was injected into the horizontal well in one day after which the well was closed during the shut in period hf fluid flows into the secondary fracture or shale matrix and its concentration decreases rapidly the spatiotemporal distribution of the hf fluid during the injection and shut in periods is shown in fig 7 at the beginning of hf the hf fluids diffuse along the primary fracture on both sides at the end of hf fluid injection the hf fluids almost fill the entire hf area and the maximum concentration is equal to the injection concentration during the shut in period the pollutes within the hf fluids limited to 0 01 mol m3 moves gradually upwards to pass the shale formation on the 22nd day because there is no continuous source for recharge the concentration of the hf fluids decreases gradually while the polluted area is expanding after entering the gas production stage the pressure in the horizontal well is less than the shale formation pressure so most of the hf fluid is sucked into the horizontal well and removed from the system modeling results indicate that hf fluids therefore do not contaminate the shallow groundwater throughout the simulation period even in the worst scenario 3 3 parametric study a sensitivity analysis is designed to examine the uncertainties of the geological field and hf operation and draw a meaningful conclusion for the specific setting of the model a total of 49 simulations aimed at assessing different field scenarios and shale gas exploration conditions were run while altering parameters such as the aperture of the primary fracture the aperture of the secondary fracture the permeability of the shale matrix the porosity of the shale matrix the injection time the shut in time the shut in pressure the production pressure and with or without faults in fig 8 location no 431 in fig 4 was selected as a representative to show the change in the concentration of hf fluid because it is located in the hf zone and its concentration can represent the hf migration toward overburden or fault these figures only show the changes in concentration over 1000 days after which the concentration drops to zero fig 8a and b show that the present hf concentration peak at the observation point increases with an increase in the aperture of the primary and secondary fractures a larger aperture makes it easier for the movement of hf fluid whether the fracture is primary or secondary when the primary fracture aperture increases to 0 01 m the concentration peak is 6 times higher than that the scenario in which the aperture is only 0 001 m however the peak concentration of hf fluid only changed from 1 to 1 3 mol m3 when the secondary fracture aperture is increased from 0 0001 m to 0 001 m a longer tail of the hf fluid concentration curve occurs when the secondary fracture aperture is larger the modeling results indicate that the effect of the primary fracture aperture on concentration is greater than that of the secondary fracture the effect of shale properties on hf fluid concentration is shown in fig 8c 8d the ascent of hf fluid concentration increased significantly with an increase in the shale permeability the concentration peak reached 10 mol m3 when the permeability was set to 1e 18 m2 while it was only 0 075 mol m3 when the permeability was set to 1e 20 m2 the peak concentration appeared on the 2nd day but it took 8 days for the peak to be reached in the base case therefore a higher permeability of the shale reservoir will significantly speed up the spread of hf fluid the change in shale permeability has a significant influence on the peak hf fluid concentration it is worth noting that there is an inverse relationship between shale porosity and the concentration peak a reduction in the shale porosity will increase the concentration peak for example the concentration was larger than 2 5 mol m3 when the shale porosity was less than 0 01 however a larger shale porosity will significantly extend the tail of the concentration curve but the hf fluid concentration still fell to zero within 1000 days fig 8d during the short lived injection and shut in periods the duration of the hf fluid injection and shut in pressure are the dominant forces for hf fluid migration from the hf zone to the overburden and fault although in any defined scenario the hf fluid fails to migrate to the shallow aquifer a long injection time and a larger shut in pressure will cause the hf fluid to stay in the shale reservoir and maintain a higher concentration of two to five times the base case scenario fig 8e and 8 g in particular the peak concentration may reach 5 mol m3 and the hf fluid remain in the shale reservoir for at least 300 days when the short lived injection time lasts 3 days while the peak concentration is only 0 6 mol m3 and it stays in the reservoir for less than 80 days fig 8e on the contrary different shut in periods and different gas production pressures have little effect on the hf fluid migration fig 8f and 8 h there is only a slight difference in the hf concentration curve tail when changing the shut in period and gas production pressure the effects of these parameters on the retention and migration of the fracturing fluid is not obvious 4 discussion hf fluid migration is likely to occur under certain conditions via natural preferential pathways that transfer contaminants from deep shale reservoirs to shallow aquifers myers 2012 gassiat et al 2013 wilson et al 2017 but the simulation results presented in this paper show that the migration of hf fluid does not contaminate the shallow groundwater throughout the simulation period even in the worst scenario according to the characteristics of the fluid flow pattern in sedimentary basins found in previous studies topographic gradients can transfer fluid from the high terrain on the surface to the deep formations and then force the deep fluid to migrate upwards in the discharge zone however such a cycle only occurs in the 1st layer upper permian lower triassic limestone fig 5 and does not involve the deep cycle in the shale reservoir because of the very low permeability and overpressure in the deep formation in addition based on the current knowledge of basin hydrology jorgensen 1997 and senger et al 1987 showed that estimates for upward flux that are lower than natural meteoric recharge or possibly zero are considered realistic even if the upward migration of deep fluid occurs the travel time from the shale reservoir to the shallow aquifer may be millions of years or longer adams et al 2004 thornton and wilson 2007 flewelling and sharma 2014 because of the inherent association with low permeability rocks in oil and gas basins hf fluids must pass through the overburden or through preferential channels such as faults or fractures if they are to contaminate shallow aquifers however overpressure is usually found in oil and gas basins relying heavily on the low permeability overburden strata dissipation in the overpressure will occur at 0 01 ma and decrease to hydrostatic pressure at 1 ma if there is a permeable fault running through the shale reservoir fig 6b flewelling and sharma 2014 also suggested that permeability should be between 10 23 m2 and 10 20 m2 if the overpressure of a shale reservoir with a depth of 1000 to 5000 m is to be preserved for 10 100 ma it is remotely possible that fault activation caused by hf operation may directly connect shale reservoirs with shallow aquifers flewelling et al 2013 rutqvist et al 2013 the upward fluxes of hf fluid must therefore be extremely small according to these analyses and calculations a numerical model of the jy 1 well which is the first shale gas production well in china was established and the sensitivity of parameters such as shale reservoir properties and hf operation was analyzed numerical simulation showed that the hf concentration was significantly enhanced when the permeability of the shale reservoir increased while a larger porosity of the shale reservoir caused the hf fluid to remain longer within the reservoir it is therefore apparent that the permeability and porosity of the shale matrix significantly affect the hf concentration in the shale reservoir fig 8c and d hf operation such as the duration over which the hf fluid is injected and the shut in pressure is also critical for hf concentration in summary to minimize the impact of hf fluids on the environment the injection time of hf fluid should be shortened and the shut in pressure should be kept relatively low however for many reasons there are still limitations in assessing the potential risks of shallow aquifers using this model first the migration of hf fluid in the subsurface involves multi scale multi phase and multi physical process meaning that it is a complex issue because we focus on the migration of hf fluid from deep to shallow aquifers hf fluids are regarded as conservative tracers for migration in large scale single phase formations this will exaggerate the potential risks when the stress effect capillary forces geochemical reaction and geothermal effects are ignored second the 2d cross sectional model implies that the conditions of an infinitely extended fault and hf zone in the third dimension should be improved to 3d to facilitate the understanding of a more realistic spatial distribution of hf fluid in a shale reservoir however deeper data such as the location of the fault and the hf zone is required to produce such a model third shale gas exploration by hf is a transient and dynamic process changes in parameters such as pressure flow rate and concentration are easy to describe in the model but changes in the properties of hf fractures and shale reservoirs are difficult to accurately characterize in every calculation step in the numerical model for example the aperture of hf fracture increases in the hf fluid injection stage and decreases in the gas production stage but it was set as a constant in our model only when more field data is monitored and a more advanced multi process coupling model is developed can we accurately predict the potential risks of shallow groundwater due to hf fluid migration 5 conclusion a dual medium numerical model based on the first hf shale gas field in china which is located in sichuan basin was developed to assess potential risks of shallow groundwater this model combining the advantages of both the equivalent continuum and discrete fracture network approaches is able to deal with the hf migration on a regional scale and consider the role of preferential flow paths such as fractures or faults after getting the pressure evolution of shale reservoir and the spatiotemporal distributions of the hf fluid a parametric study was conducted to examine the influence of key factors such as the permeability and porosity of the shale reservoir and the hf operation the numerical modeling results revealed the following the spatial distribution of pressure is controlled by the topographic gradient in shallow areas whereas deep overpressure is the driving force for hf fluid migration from deep shale reservoirs to shallow aquifers connoting that the effect of overpressure should be the focus for study moreover overlying low permeable strata is the reason that overpressure preserved for more than a few million years moreover the overpressure will decrease to hydrostatic pressure within 0 2 ma if there is a permeable fault cut shale reservoir it is very unlikely that there is a natural pre existing conductive path such as a highly permeable fault or strata between the shale reservoir and the shallow aquifers after the shut in period the hf pressure is removed and large scale depressurization occurred over time due to the production from the horizontal well a large amount of hf fluid is removed from the shale reservoir through suction into the well in the production stage 1000 days the influence of the physical properties of the reservoir and hf injection time are significant for hf concentration in the reservoir while shut in time and production pressure are inconsequential for hf concentration notably increasing the shale matrix permeability significantly increased the peak concentration of hf fluid and accelerated the spread of hf fluid when the shale matrix permeability was set at 1e 18 m2 the hf fluid concentration at the reservoir was ten times higher than the base case and the peak concentration arrived at the 2nd day rather than the 8th day in the base case therefore accurately and completely determining the permeability of the shale matrix and shortening of hf injection time are considered as the most important factors determining the spatiotemporal distribution of hf fluid in the shale reservoir credit authorship contribution statement liheng wang conceptualization methodology software writing original draft software yanhui dong

5342,although spatial heterogeneity of soil properties topography and climate is commonly incorporated into ecohydrological models the spatial and temporal variability in plant functional traits is typically overlooked the objective of our study is to evaluate the impact of trait parameter variability on modeled ecohydrological processes we implemented a model data fusion approach to constrain spatiotemporally dynamic parameters in plant functional traits at two desert shrubland sites located along a topographic and climate gradient in the mojave desert our results showed that the estimates for specific leaf area and rooting depth for the broadleaf evergreen shrub plant functional type showed spatial variability with lower specific leaf area and deeper rooting depth found at the low elevation site we also found that the specific leaf area estimates changed over time at both sites in response to water stress but with different sensitivities possibly depending on species and or climate the spatial variability in trait parameter estimates was greater than temporal variability and played a more important role in accurately simulating ecohydrological processes but including the temporal variability in specific leaf area further improved seasonal predictions in simulations forced by future climate projections under the representative concentration pathway 4 5 rcp 4 5 and 8 5 rcp 8 5 greenhouse gas emissions scenarios spatial variability in trait parameters impacted predictions of both carbon and water fluxes while temporal variability in trait parameters resulted in predictions of higher ecological function and water use efficiency the higher water use efficiency led to improved ecohydrological function in simulations under rcp 4 5 but it showed little capacity for buffering intensive water stresses under the more pessimistic rcp 8 5 scenario indicating that with spatiotemporally variable trait parameters the impact on predicted ecohydrological processes depends on the climate projections overall our modeling results prompt further field based examination of temporal and belowground trait variability in desert shrublands and they raise the question of how combined spatiotemporal variabilities of multiple traits may support ecohydrological function under water stress keywords ecohydrological model plant functional trait model data fusion 1

and vegetation properties e g band et al 1993 wigmosta et al 1994 oleson et al 2010 for representing vegetation properties a major complication is the daunting number of vegetation species globally alton 2011 to help make the problem more tractable the concept of plant functional types pfts was developed to represent main ecosystems e g oleson and bonan 2000 bonan et al 2002 different model grid cells can be assigned different pfts and in more process based models the different grid cells can have different simulated carbon fluxes and states e g vegetation carbon stock that change over time the major simplification is that all species assigned to a particular pft are assumed to share the same static set of plant parameters over time to represent plant functional traits which are key

limitation reich et al 2014 despite the growing recognition of plant trait variability it is still unclear to what degree current constant parameter pft based models are biased in their simulations of ecohydrological processes nor how these biases may affect our ability to predict future changes in coupled carbon and water cycles some recent studies explicitly incorporated spatial trait variability into ecohydrological models using statistical methods verheijen et al 2013 ali et al 2015 butler et al 2017 and they demonstrated that model simulations were sensitive to trait variability however much remains unknown about the drivers of trait variability correlations between trait variability and climatic variables are relatively weak wright et al 2005 moles et al 2014 šímová et al 2018 focusing on under characterized temporal trait variability previous work by liu and ng 2019 presented a new framework for constraining temporally dynamic trait parameters in an implementation of a mojave desert shrubland site they found estimates of the leaf trait parameter specific leaf area sla to be temporally dynamic in response to water availability allowing greater simulated water use efficiency than with a temporally constant parameter prompted by this finding that temporal trait parameter variability could impact simulations of coupled plant water conditions as represented by water use efficiency the current study builds upon that work with the goal of evaluating how different characteristics of trait variability spatial versus temporal may affect ecohydrological process simulations and whether these variabilities could have implications for predicting ecohydrological vulnerability or resilience of desert shrublands with models focusing on two study sites spanning a climate and terrain gradient in a mojave desert watershed we applied a model data fusion approach raupach et al 2005 liu and gupta 2007 to address the following questions 1 how do the spatial and temporal variability in estimated trait parameters compare in this watershed 2 which type of trait variability spatial versus temporal plays a more important role in accurately simulating ecohydrological processes 3 how does the spatiotemporal variability in trait parameters affect our predictions of ecosystem response to future climatic change 2 method 2 1 overview to investigate how spatial and temporal variability in plant trait parameters affects simulated ecohydrological fluxes and states we conducted three model data fusion experiments that statistically use observations to estimate model parameters and their uncertainties for two sites along a topographic and climate gradient in the mojave desert the first experiment e1 followed the standard constant parameterization approach in which all functional traits shared identical plant parameter values within one pft correspondingly a model data fusion approach was applied where observations from the two sites were used to estimate a single set of plant trait parameters that applied identically to both locations in contrast the second experiment e2 acknowledged that there could be spatial differences in plant trait parameters between the two sites in this experiment the model data fusion framework was implemented separately at each of two different study sites to generate different plant estimates at each location the third experiment e3 further allowed trait parameters to have temporal variability it used the previously developed stochastic model data fusion approach from liu and ng 2019 to constrain potential temporal patterns in plant trait parameters at each of the two study sites a schematic flow chart depicting the three parameterization experiments is shown in fig 1 we then simulated the ecohydrological fluxes and states for the two sites under future climate projections from the representative concentration pathway 4 5 rcp 4 5 and 8 5 rcp 8 5 greenhouse gas ghg emissions scenarios van vuuren et al 2011 using the parameter estimates derived from the three experiments 2 2 study sites with the strong link between plant function and water availability and less complexity in vegetation composition desert shrublands are relatively ideal for investigating spatiotemporal variability in trait parameters and their response to environmental stressors we selected two desert shrubland sites kelmet 860 m a s l and globe 1250 m a s l located at a distance of 13 km from each other in kelso valley in the mojave national preserve southeastern california usa fig 2 a as the two sites have different climatic and geological conditions as well as similar vegetation types but distinct species composition they enable us to test our hypothesis that in response to environmental changes plant functional traits within a pft may exhibit spatiotemporal variability and that these should be represented in ecohydrological models detailed information about the kelmet site as well as a description of previous work in kelso valley can be found in liu and ng 2019 the globe site was instrumented with a hobo weather station onset computer corporation bourne ma that provided hourly precipitation air temperature and relative humidity measurements from 2005 through 2010 the model also requires solar radiation wind speed and air pressure data these were taken from kelmet the closest fully instrumented location with solar radiation values decreased by 50 w m2 when precipitation occurred at globe but not kelmet to generate a longer meteorological time series that is representative of globe we extended the record back to 1 january 1961 using regional data see section s1 in supplementary information for details similar to the reconstruction approach for kelmet liu and ng 2019 in kelso valley prominent rainfall occurs in the winter season with occasional convective storms in the summer reconstructed meteorological forcing time series from 1961 to 2010 indicate that the higher elevation globe site is cooler and wetter annual average temperature 18 4 c and precipitation 291 mm year than the lower elevation kelmet site annual average temperature 20 1 c and precipitation 103 mm year fig 2b also younger coarser and more homogeneous soils are present at the lower elevation kelmet site compared to the globe site miller et al 2009 at the kelmet site 15 of the ground is covered by the broadleaf evergreen shrub larrea tridentata with the co dominant drought deciduous shrub ambrosia dumosa covering about 5 vegetation at the globe site is more diverse with prunus fasciculata and ambrosia eriocentra as the major shrubs present see section s2 in supplementary information for more details overall the broadleaf evergreen shrub and broadleaf deciduous shrub pfts cover about 8 and 12 of the ground at globe respectively although the plant species are different between the sites most are categorized as broadleaf evergreen shrub or broadleaf deciduous shrub pfts this means that under the current pft based model paradigm identical broadleaf evergreen shrub and broadleaf deciduous shrub parameters would be used for the two sites in this study we examine whether plant trait parameter estimates exhibit spatiotemporal variability at the two sites that affect ecohydrological process predictions to use as model constraints on plant trait and soil hydraulic parameter estimates soil moisture at 15 and 35 cm soil depths were measured at both sites from 2 july 2007 to 31 december 2010 using hobo soil moisture probes onset computer corporation bourne ma kelmet observations were described in ng et al 2015 and 1 km 8 day resolution leaf area index lai ratio of the total surface area of all leaves to the ground area below retrieval from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis myneni et al 2002 were compiled over that period at both sites 2 3 ecoyhdrological model we used the community land model version 4 5 clm4 5 oleson et al 2010 to simulate coupled soil moisture and leaf area index lai ratio of the total surface area of all leaves to the ground area below clm4 5 consists of multiple land surface processes including surface radiation transfer energy water balance soil and snow hydrology and plant physiology as well as carbon nitrogen cycling mostly using process based methods specifically the hydrological processes represented in the model include interception canopy through fall infiltration evaporation transpiration surface runoff subsurface drainage vertical soil moisture flux through vadose zone soil and groundwater discharge and recharge the model also determines changes in vegetation states carbon and nitrogen pools in various plant compartments based on simulated ecosystem processes such as photosynthesis and respiration clm 4 5 requires hourly meteorological forcing data air temperature humidity rainfall and radiation soil texture for its 10 computational layers down to a 3 8 m depth and percent cover for the model s pre set pfts the broadleaf evergreen shrub and broadleaf deciduous shrub pft parameterizations in clm were developed to represent shrubs in arid and semiarid regions in the world including deserts in southwestern u s zeng et al 2008 clm4 5 requires inputs for meteorological values including air temperature precipitation radiation air pressure and humidity which we provided at an hourly frequency an interpolation module within clm 4 5 further downscaled the meteorological data for the model s half hourly computational time stepping oleson et al 2010 it should be noted that recently some ecohydrological models have further incorporated plant hydraulics water transport within the plant e g clm5 lawrence et al 2018 and or plant demography evolution of plant age distribution see review by fisher et al 2018 which are likely capable of providing a more accurate representation of the ecohydrological response to climate variability however such model approaches require many parameters that are highly uncertain currently posing obstacles to their widespread use in this study prompted by the growing observations of leaf trait variability kattge et al 2011 we chose to focus on leaf traits as well as other traits already included in common ecohydrological models without introducing plant hydraulics or demographic modules our approach can be extended in the future to further consider parameters for models that include such modules 2 4 model data fusion approach for parameter estimation we use the ensemble kalman filter enkf method evensen 1994 to estimate plant trait parameters in the clm4 5 model based on observations although the method was originally developed for estimating model states i e variables simulated by the model we use the augmented state extension with which model parameters can also be estimated evensen 2009 enkf has been commonly used in hydrological applications reichle et al 2002 moradkhani et al 2005 liu and gupta 2007 reichle et al 2008 and more recently also in ecological studies raupach et al 2005 williams et al 2005 wang et al 2009 luo et al 2011 the basic idea of enkf is that observations are used to constrain the model over a sequence of assimilation cycles that cover observational times one assimilation cycle comprises two steps a model forecast step in which an ensemble of model runs are carried out to represent initial model information and its uncertainty and a model analysis step which uses the following equation to constrain or condition the model using an observation at time t yt x t a x t f k y t h x t f where k p t f h t h p t f h t r 1 is known as the kalman gain x t f and x t a are vectors of model state variables at time t that includes states and parameters with the f superscript indicating the forecast state before the observation constraint and the a superscript indicating the analysis state after the observation constraint h is the function that determines the relationship between model states and observation data to represent uncertainties p t f is the forecast error covariance matrix and is determined from the ensemble of model runs and r is the observation error covariance matrix the forecast step in the assimilation cycle at time t 1 step uses the analysis vector x t a at previous time step time t as the initial state the assimilation cycle evolves until the final time step of available observational data we used two different implementations of enkf that were previously presented in liu and ng 2019 both implementations included two computational passes of the enkf for the whole observational period from t 0 to t to help resolve inconsistencies that can arise between state and parameters estimates when using kalman filter type methods with strongly nonlinear models experiments e1 and e2 utilized the static implementation of the two pass enkf from liu and ng 2019 which treats parameters as constant in time and consists of a relatively straightforward extension of the standard enkf over two passes to constrain uncertainties experiment e3 used the stochastic implementation of the two pass enkf which was developed by liu and ng 2019 to constrain temporally dynamic parameterizations of plant functional traits and to identify potential trait variability the main way that the stochastic implementation of the enkf differs from the standard static implementation is that instead of using only the final parameter estimate at the last time step of the calibration period we focus on the time varying parameter estimates over the entire time period and this enables us to identify how trait parameters co vary with environmental conditions more implementation details can be found in liu and ng 2019 liu and ng 2019 showed that the new stochastic implementation can uncover temporal trait variability and its implementation at the kelmet site yielded parameter time series estimates that were correlated with soil water stress a regression based parameterization based on this correlation allowed probabilistic predictions of trait variability and therefore the impacts on ecohydrological processes at kelmet similar to liu and ng 2019 we assumed in this study that model uncertainty arises due to uncertainties in eight plant parameters table s1 here we further considered uncertainties in the following soil hydraulic properties to account for the effect of different soil conditions between the two study sites the moisture retention curve exponent b saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat saturated matric potential ψ sat and saturated volumetric soil moisture content θ sat in clm4 5 these parameters are used for calculating the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and moisture retention curve in all experiments including e3 soil hydraulic parameters were treated as static in time the initial distribution of plant trait parameters prior to any constraint on observations was adopted from liu and ng 2019 where three of the plant trait parameters were derived from the global plant trait database try kattge et al 2011 with lognormal distributions and the other five plant parameters which are generally not found in try were assumed to follow the uniform distributions obtained from white et al 2000 table s1 it should be noted that lai is a prognostic state variable in clm 4 5 instead of an input parameter states in many other land surface models the initial distributions of soil hydraulic parameters prior to any constraint on observations were assigned based on the method from ng et al 2014 the modis lai and soil moisture measurement at 15 cm and 35 cm depths were used for the observational constraints in the enkf implementation 2 5 downscaled future climate data under the rcp scenarios we obtained the new statistically downscaled climate model dataset multivariate adaptive constructed analogs version 2 meteorological data macav2 metdata for our future model predictions this data product contains daily downscaled meteorological variables for the conterminous u s at 4 km resolution under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios ghg emissions peak around the year 2040 and then stabilize in rcp 4 5 while ghg emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century in rcp 8 5 the meteorological variables in macav2 metdata were statistically downscaled from global climate model gcm data from the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 here we used macav2 metdata derived from the geophysical fluid dynamic laboratory gfdl esm2m output delworth et al 2006 including 2 m air temperature precipitation shortwave radiation and vapor pressure deficit we then disaggregated the daily meteorological forcing data from macav2 metdata into 1 hourly time steps using the open source toolbox meteorological observation time series disaggregation tool melodist förster et al 2016 we tested the disaggregation algorithms using observed meteorological time series from 1961 to 2009 for the kelmet and globe sites and found that they produced a reasonable reconstruction of diurnal features at those sites fig s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal and spatial variability in trait estimates in all experiments soil hydraulic parameters were assumed to be spatially variable at the two sites to account for the observed difference in soil properties with elevation bedford et al 2009 within a site the soil parameter estimates using the two pass enkf were similar across all three experiments which is unsurprising because the experiments differed only in their treatment of plant parameters results for e1 in fig 3 show that the higher elevation globe site has greater values of b ψ sat and θ sat but lower k sat compared to the lower elevation kelmet site these soil parameter estimates are consistent with having younger and coarser soils deposited at lower elevations in the mojave desert rundel and gibson 2005 bedford et al 2009 miller et al 2009 fig 4 shows the plant trait estimates from the second last enkf pass for the broadleaf evergreen shrub pft in each of the three experiments at the two sites note that although only the final time parameter estimate is used as the result in the static enkf implementations in e1 and e2 we show the entire observational period in order to facilitate comparisons with the e3 result which uses the full time series of the temporally varying parameter estimate as the result although all trait parameters for the broadleaf evergreen shrub pft were relatively well constrained in the first pass of enkf the ranges of parameter estimates were all reduced compared with their prior distributions see fig s2 sla and rootb representing rooting depth parameters for the broadleaf evergreen shrub pft had the greatest uncertainty reduction in all experiments when spatial variability was allowed in traits in e2 and e3 we found a higher sla and lower rootb estimate at the globe site compared to at the kelmet site in addition in e3 estimated sla for the broadleaf evergreen shrub pft at both sites showed clear temporal dynamics using the stochastic implementation coefficient of variation of 0 25 and 0 19 for kelmet and globe site respectively providing model evidence for sla variability over time in the broadleaf evergreen shrub pft none of the other plant parameters showed appreciable temporal variability coefficient of variation 0 1 including sla for the broadleaf deciduous shrub pft although direct trait observations were not available at our study sites to validate the results of our model data fusion approach our variable sla and root depth estimates are consistent with data from other studies spatial variations in plant functional traits have been widely observed across global biomes and plant functional type and climate gradient are identified as the main drivers for the trait divergence wright et al 2005 kattge et al 2011 osnas et al 2018 in particular sla variability has been found to be an indicator of plant adaptation to climate variability and the plant with high plasticity in sla tend to have high resource use efficiency under varying environment conditions niinemets 2001 poorter et al 2009 consistent with our estimate of smaller sla at the hotter and drier kelmet site decreases in sla with lower water availability have been observed across space in evergreen species wright et al 2001 schulze et al 2006 gouveia and freitas 2009 grasses oyarzabal et al 2008 meng et al 2015 and crops pandey et al 1984 craufurd et al 1999 dry climate favors small thick and dense leaves low sla and this adaptation allows plant to increase water use efficiency niinemets 1999 as for rooting depth regional climate topography and local soil properties can be potential drivers for its variations stone and kalisz 1991 fan et al 2017 again consistent with our estimate of greater rooting depth larger rootb at the kelmet site deeper roots are generally found in coarser and younger soils which are characterized by vertically homogeneous soil texture and low field capacity sperry and hacke 2002 schenk and jackson 2005 hamerlynck et al 2002 found that larrea tridentata the main vegetation species at the kelmet site can utilize both deep and shallow roots to maintain continuous photosynthetic activity presumably by extracting shallow water during wet seasons and deeper water stores during droughts less is known about temporal trait variability compared to spatial variability likely because of challenges in repeat measurements this gap prompted previous work by liu and ng 2019 which found sla parameter estimates for the broadleaf evergreen shrub pft exhibited temporal pattern and the variation was significantly correlated with available soil water at the kelmet site here our results show that the temporal variation of sla estimates associated with water availability in terms of soil wetness factor β also occurs at the high elevation globe site fig 5 indicating that the potential for water stress driven sla spatiotemporal variability in the broadleaf evergreen shrub pft could be widespread across the watershed though less studied than spatial variability both biotic e g leaf aging reich et al 1991 laclau et al 2009 and abiotic factors e g radiation serbin et al 2014 have been found to be correlated with temporal sla variability across a range of biomes dawson and bliss 1993 abrams 1994 reich et al 1997 damesin et al 1998 wilson et al 2000 damesin and lelarge 2003 xu and baldocchi 2003 liu and stützel 2004 grassi et al 2005 misson et al 2006 ma et al 2011 nouvellon et al 2010 dwyer et al 2014 during drought seasons plants commonly decrease sla by modifying their anatomical tissues for less water requirement poorter et al 2009 in addition to changes in leaf scale sla water availability may also alter the plot meters and ecosystem 10 s of meters scale sla in water limited environments drought events can trigger the selective fall of older high sla leaves or the dormancy of high sla species resulting in lower average sla values for evergreen species that experience seasonal drought previous studies misson 2006 gratani and varone 2006 nouvellon et al 2010 found that sla can be about 20 28 lower during drought periods which is consistent with our finding that soil water availability can be the driver for sla temporal variation at the water limited study sites in addition to changes within individual plants these seasonal shifts in sla may also reflect changes in community level distributions as different species have been noted to exhibit unique relationships between sla and water use strategy castro díez et al 2000 hassiotou et al 2010 ma et al 2011 de la riva et al 2016 peguero pina et al 2017 3 2 comparison of variability in estimated sla between sites 3 2 1 temporal variability in estimated sla to examine how the temporal variability in estimated sla compares across sites we followed the approach of liu and ng 2019 and built linear regression relationships for each of the two sites based on the estimated parameters from e3 with two explanatory variables sla t 30 sla at the previous 30 day time step and β the soil wetness factor averaged over the preceding 30 days fig s3 shows that both regression models can well match the sla estimation for the kelmet and globe sites respectively note that the regression coefficients of the two equations are different see the caption of fig s3 for the statistical significance in their differences with higher sensitivity of sla to soil water availability and a lower auto correlation coefficient value at the kelmet site assuming that this difference in the estimated sla sensitivity between sites captures actual conditions it may reflect the different species compositions at the two sites varying sensitivity of sla in response to water stress within one pft has been reported in previous experimental studies anyia and herzog 2004 ramírez et al 2012 yin et al 2004 nielsen et al 2019 for example liu and stützel 2004 found that water stress decreased the sla in four varieties of vegetable amaranth but with different sensitivity in a semi arid mediterranean ecosystem ramírez et al 2012 conducted a manipulative drought field experiment with broadleaf evergreen shrubs and reported greater sla response to water availability in species with higher sla in contrast to ramírez et al 2012 however we found higher sla sensitivity in kelso valley to occur at the site with lower estimated sla for the broadleaf evergreen shrub pft kelmet rather than higher sla globe it is possible that only two years of indirect coarse resolution lai and spatially sparse soil moisture data in our study may be inadequate for fully constraining the actual sla sensitivity to soil water availability another possibility that has not been previously explored is that climatic differences between sites may trigger varying levels of trait sensitivity to environmental stressors in addition to species type further research into trait variability across species and climates is needed overall our results suggest that moisture driven temporal trait variability may occur widely across desert shrublands but that their implementation in models could remain a challenge due to unique location and or species specific relationships 3 2 2 spatial versus temporal variability in estimated sla the little attention paid to temporal trait variability relative to spatial prompted us to next evaluate how the two types of variability compare in our results for the e3 experiment we found that the spatial differences in estimated sla across the two sites were greater than the temporal range from 1961 to 2010 at both sites table 1 the positive relationship between temporally variable sla estimates and simulated soil wetness found above fig 5 suggests that wetter and cooler conditions at globe compared to kelmet could be driving the similarly positive spatial gradient in estimated sla variability based on water availability at the two sites the apparent sla sensitivity to water availability calculated by the change in sla per change in soil wetness factor in the model is in fact much greater over space than over time at each site the spatial difference in soil wetness is even smaller than the temporal difference even though the spatial difference in sla is greater than the temporal difference this indicates that estimated sla changes more in between the study sites than would be expected due to the water stress driven temporal variability inferred at each site over the 40 year modeling period the greater spatial compared to temporal gradients found in our sla estimates suggests that actual spatial trait variability may be more prominent than temporal and this may be attributed to a couple of reasons first as suggested for the difference in temporal sla characteristics at the two sites distinct species compositions between the sites could exhibit divergent sla characteristics niinemets 2001 poorter et al 2009 second it is possible that persistent differences in climate and soil wetness conditions between the two sites have led to a greater change in sla over space than is physiologically possible over the shorter seasonal times scales of climatic changes within a site an implication of our findings is that although traits can vary both spatially and temporally easier to measure spatial variability characteristics should not be directly substituted into models to represent temporal variability verheijen et al 2015 recently developed regression models to build statistical relationships between plant trait parameters and climatic conditions using a global trait database and then used these to predict the anually dynamic trait parameters 3 3 ecohydrological role of spatial and temporal trait parameter variability comparing simulation results using parameter estimates from e1 e2 and e3 provides insights into the relative importance of spatial versus temporal variability in parameters for simulating ecohydrological states the parameter estimates from the e1 experiment performed worse than those from e2 and e3 in reproducing the observed lai and soil moisture at both the globe and kelmet sites figs 6 and 7 respectively when allowing for spatial variability of trait parameters in the e2 parameterization simulated soil moisture improved at both sites and simulated lai matched the time averaged lai observations however the simulated lai using trait parameter estimates from e2 failed to capture the seasonal lai variations at both sites when the temporally dynamic sla estimates from e3 were incorporated in the model simulations tracked lai observation dynamics much more closely than the simulation that only accounted for spatial variations in parameters e2 fig 6 simulations could be expected to show a more substantial change with the addition of spatially variable sla compared to temporally variable sla given the greater spatial difference in estimated sla than temporal table 1 indeed table 2 quantitatively shows that the greatest improvement increase in the coefficient of correlation r2 and decrease in root mean square error rmse in lai and soil moisture simulations occurred when spatial variability of trait parameters was allowed in clm 4 5 e1 to e2 note that e1 already took into account differences in soil and climate conditions between the sites and so e2 results point to the need for including spatial variability in plant trait parameters to capture both ecological and hydrological states further incorporation of temporally variable trait parameters in e3 led to a subtler improvement in model performance table 2 suggesting that ecohydrological process simulations were more sensitive to the spatial variability of trait parameters however compared to the results in e3 most of the lai ensemble uncertainties with temporally constant traits in e1 and e2 failed to include the lai observations during the observation period at both sites fig 6 this corroborates findings at the lower elevation kelmet site by liu and ng 2019 and demonstrates the benefit of using temporally variable sla for robustly capturing lai seasonal variation across a soil and climate gradient such that model ensemble predictions encompass actual conditions overall the simulations using the three sets of parameter estimates demonstrate that both spatial and temporal variability in the sla and rooting depth parameters impact lai and soil moisture simulations over the observation period this is consistent with the ecological functions of the traits represented by these parameters sla is a key ecophysiological trait affecting photosynthetic capacity and plant biomass reich et al 1997 niinemets 1999 antúnez et al 2001 wright et al 2004 quero et al 2006 and rooting depth is a trait that is central to determining ecosystem resilience to water stress and long term coupling between carbon and water cycles nepstad et al 1994 oliveira et al 2005 maeght et al 2013 3 4 future scenario simulations with trait parameter variability using a 40 year historical period at the kelmet site liu and ng 2019 showed that simulations with temporally variable sla in the broadleaf evergreen shrub pft had greater simulated water use efficiency compared to the case of time static sla here we further evaluated how the combination of spatial and temporal trait parameter variability impacts simulated ecohydrological fluxes and we further assessed how that variability might affect predictions of coupled carbon and water fluxes under future climate change to do this we extended experiments e1 e2 and e3 by implementing their respective parameter estimates in simulations forced with rcp climate scenarios from 2011 to 2100 for the two sites we first focused on the most pessimistic climate scenario rcp 8 5 in order to bracket our predictions of ecohydrological changes with the various trait parameter inputs for e1 and e2 the estimated parameters at the final time step were used to run clm 4 5 for e3 the regression equations for time varying sla for the two sites fig s3 were incorporated into clm 4 5 fig 8 a 8b 9a and 9b show the projections of climate forcing under the rcp 8 5 scenario at kelmet and globe at both sites temperature was predicted to rise and precipitation to decrease from 2011 to the end of 21st century with rcp 8 5 as a result lai was predicted to decrease at both sites for all experiments fig 10 and table s2 specifically across all experiments lai was estimated to decrease about 50 at kelmet and 30 at globe with the more dramatic drop at kelmet resulting from the more severe warmer and drier climatic conditions projected at that low elevation site it should be noted that the lai predictions in 2011 are higher than in the calibrated simulation period from 2007 to 2010 at both sites due to biases in the disaggregation scheme and possibly also in the climate model in particular fig s1 shows an over representation of small rain events by the disaggregation scheme further over simulation of drizzle is a well recognized problem in numerical weather prediction and climate models wood 2005 sun et al 2006 wyant et al 2007 hannay et al 2009 stephens et al 2010 while this raises uncertainties in the absolute raw clm outputs generated with climate model forcings the simulations are nonetheless useful for examining relative trends over the century and relative differences among the three different experiments demonstrating the sensitivity of future predicted ecohydrological fluxes to trait parameter variability at kelmet and globe figs 8 and 9 respectively compare the simulated annual lai transpiration gross primary productivity gpp and water use efficiency wue defined as gpp divided by transpiration under the rcp 8 5 scenario for the three experiments although the rcp 8 5 ensemble time series for the three experiments show overlaps accounting for spatial differences in the broadleaf evergreen shrub trait parameters e2 and e3 compared to e1 resulted in consistently lower estimated mean sla at kelmet fig 4 and correspondingly lower simulated lai transpiration and gpp fig 8 and table s3 while it led to the opposite effect at the globe site generally higher sla lai transpiration and gpp predictions figs 4 and 9 and table s3 unsurprisingly including spatially variable trait parameters led to greater predicted differences in ecohydrological variables between the two sites compared to the default parameterization e1 table s3 figs 8 and 9 further demonstrate that the ensemble simulations using the temporally variable sla estimates e3 experiment not only generated higher lai seasonal variability due to time varying sla especially at kelmet fig s4 but interestingly they also show slightly higher long term average lai results than the simulations with only spatially variable sla estimates e2 4 to 7 higher the slightly higher lai prediction with temporally dynamic sla in e3 compared to e2 corresponds to greater long term average predicted gpp and wue at both sites insets in figs 8 and 9 and table s3 overall our model results suggest that spatial variability in plant trait parameters can affect predictions of ecological and hydrological function appreciable changes in gpp and transpiration while temporal variability impacts may be more limited to the prediction of ecological responses appreciable changes in gpp but not in transpiration see insets in figs 8 and 9 and table s3 our model based evidence for trait variations affecting predicted ecohydrological processes across kelso valley is consistent with observations from other studies gouveia and freitas 2009 assessed intra specific variation in a range of leaf attributes and leaf carbon isotope concentration in an evergreen tree quercuset suber along a rainfall gradient and demonstrated that the changes in leaf thickness associated with water availability strongly affected the water use efficiency maxwell et al 2018 measured the intrinsic water use efficiency iwue defined as the ratio of net carbon assimilation to stomatal conductance along a 1500 m elevation gradient with a wide climatic range in a montane forest system and found that iwue highly depends on the dominant evergreen forest species leaf trait characteristics and stage of soil development although these observational studies reported only spatial gradients in leaf traits iwue may also reflect temporal changes because iwue is derived from leaf carbon isotope values which record accumulated plant conditions over time wieser et al 2018 it should be noted that different species may have distinct strategies in response to environmental stressors resulting in varying effects on ecohydrological processes for example some species with lower sla have thicker leaves that support greater photosynthesis per area de la riva et al 2016 peguero pina et al 2017 while other species with lower sla have increased leaf density and reduced mesophyll conductance and photosynthesis castro díez et al 2000 hassiotou et al 2010 de la riva et al 2016 therefore although evergreen species tend to show higher wue with lower sla this relationship may not extend across different ecosystems in terms of nutrients trait variations have been shown to influence nitrogen cycling at the watershed scale due to differences within one pft in litter quality e g the ratio of carbon to nitrogen and nitrogen uptake rates williard et al 2005 dawson et al 2005 these previous studies suggest that simulated ecohydrological responses to trait parameter changes in our model may reflect actual sensitivities further research is needed to corroborate findings with field data and to evaluate the generality of the spatiotemporal trends found for kelso valley 3 5 sensitivity to future climate scenario to assess the impact of trait parameter variability on model predictions under a range of climate scenarios we conducted additional simulations using the rcp 4 5 climate projections and compared results against those using the rcp 8 5 climate inputs in rcp 4 5 temperature peaked around 2040 and then stabilized following ghg emissions figs s5a and s6a although both rcp scenarios showed that precipitation decreases at the end of 21st century the decrease in rcp 4 5 was generally less severe figs s5b and s6b qualitatively compared to the case with only spatial trait variability including spatiotemporal sla variability had similar effects on the predicted ecohydrological variables as in the rcp 8 5 results higher predicted time averaged lai gpp and wue but approximately the same transpiration figs s5 and s6 and table s4 importantly although both climate scenarios show that predicted wue improves with temporally variable trait parameters compared to the case with only spatial variability tables s3 and s4 under the rcp 8 5 climate change projection this has a far less effect on predicted lai decline over 90 years see similar percent change in lai for all rcp 8 5 experiments in fig 10 and table s2 the reason is that under rcp 8 5 the higher wue simulations with temporally variable sla in e3 compared to e2 corresponded to only a small boost to the change in gpp over the 90 year period boost of 0 2 gc month at kelmet and globe respectively table s2 compared to the initial gpp values about 5 1 and 7 5 gc month at kelmet and globe respectively table s2 due to continuously warming and drying conditions in fact the 90 year relative declines in average lai gpp and transpiration predictions under rcp 8 5 are very similar across all three experiments fig 10 and table s2 indicating that the magnitude of ecohydrological change simulated over the century with the most pessimistic climate scenario will overwhelm any potential benefits higher wue that may be afforded by spatiotemporally variable trait parameters in contrast with the milder rcp 4 5 climate change projections the improved wue predictions with temporally variable sla e3 compared to only spatially variable traits in e2 correspond to a larger effect on predictions of relative lai and gpp change over 90 years fig 10 for example at the kelmet site in the rcp 4 5 scenario the higher wue predictions with temporally variable sla can appreciably buffer the simulated gpp and lai decline from a 9 8 and 14 7 decline with only spatially variable sla to a 5 6 and 8 6 decline with spatiotemporally variable sla table s5 and fig 10 the simulation comparison between the two scenarios indicates that when considering spatiotemporally variable trait parameters the benefits for ecohydrological processes depend on the long term climate projections under the more pessimistic rcp 8 5 climate projections our simulations suggest that the trait variability represented by our trait parameter estimates may not be able to keep pace with the rates of warming and drying in our desert shrubland sites it should be noted however that over smaller climatic variabilities such as those that occur on the time scale of seasons up to a few years improved wue with spatiotemporal trait parameters can result in notably higher gpp even under rcp 8 5 for example from the year 2073 to 2075 in the rcp 8 5 scenario gpp at globe jumps up from 1 5 to 6 0 gc mon factor of 4 with spatiotemporally variable trait parameters compared to only from 1 5 to 4 7 gc mon factor of about 3 with constant traits 4 summary and conclusion by using remotely sensed lai and in situ soil moisture measurements we implemented a model data fusion approach that constrained spatiotemporally variable parameters representing plant functional traits of shrubs in a mojave desert watershed we found that the broadleaf evergreen shrub pft at a lower elevation study site had lower sla 26 and deeper rooting depth 17 estimates than at a higher elevation study site in addition we demonstrated that the sla estimates co varied over time with soil water availability at both sites but with different levels of sensitivity to water stress spatial variability in the estimated sla parameter was found to be 26 greater than the temporal variability in the watershed incorporating the spatially variable trait parameters into the clm 4 5 ecohydrological model was more important than representing temporally variable parameters for correctly capturing time averaged lai and soil moisture observations and simulating ecohydrological fluxes states however temporally variable sla parameters were needed to simulate the observed seasonality in lai our model based findings in a desert shrubland suggest that the global bias of spatial plant trait observations compared to temporal observations may be somewhat justified if spatial trait variability generally exceeds temporal as found in our estimates however results at our two study sites suggest that temporally variable trait parameters could be widespread and incorporating them into models may be needed for capturing seasonal responses to environmental stressors that could improve predicted ecohydrological efficiency as represented by wue unfortunately our parameterization results showed that spatial and temporal trait variability exhibit distinct characteristics and consequently more commonly observed spatial trait variability should not be directly adopted to also represent under observed temporal variability in traits our estimates of variable sla and root depth are generally consistent with field based studies of trait variability in other settings including previous findings that spatial and or temporal trait variability may represent adaptations that benefit ecological function this indicates that our model based results may provide insights into actual ecohydrological conditions in desert shrublands our modeling work prompts additional measurements of plant traits such as sla and root depth over both time and space across different shrub types such field data can be used to test hypotheses raised by our model results such as whether differences in climate terrain and species in desert shrublands could be driving spatial trait variability and whether sla may exhibit sensitivities to water availability that are greater over space than time possibly due to inter species or climatic differences or to time lags in adaptations rcp future climate scenario tests showed that spatially variable trait parameters impacted predictions of both carbon and water fluxes while additional temporal variability in sla generated higher predictions in lai gpp and wue increased wue predictions with added temporal trait variability resulted in discernible ecohydrological benefits under the milder climate scenario rcp 4 5 but simulations under the most pessimistic greenhouse gas emissions scenario rcp 8 5 showed that this increase in wue predictions was insufficient for appreciably buffering against more extreme stresses in particular 90 year ecohydrological projections in the study watershed under rcp 8 5 showed 30 50 declines in lai regardless of trait parameter variability our plot scale model findings about variable plant traits prompt further extensions of our method to regional and global simulations of coupled carbon and water dynamics our method can be implemented to constrain incomplete trait distributions from general plant databases such as try using global remote sensing data e g lai from modis as in the current study and possibly soil moisture from smap entekhabi et al 2010 in future work along with any other available observations at different spatiotemporal resolutions this

5342,although spatial heterogeneity of soil properties topography and climate is commonly incorporated into ecohydrological models the spatial and temporal variability in plant functional traits is typically overlooked the objective of our study is to evaluate the impact of trait parameter variability on modeled ecohydrological processes we implemented a model data fusion approach to constrain spatiotemporally dynamic parameters in plant functional traits at two desert shrubland sites located along a topographic and climate gradient in the mojave desert our results showed that the estimates for specific leaf area and rooting depth for the broadleaf evergreen shrub plant functional type showed spatial variability with lower specific leaf area and deeper rooting depth found at the low elevation site we also found that the specific leaf area estimates changed over time at both sites in response to water stress but with different sensitivities possibly depending on species and or climate the spatial variability in trait parameter estimates was greater than temporal variability and played a more important role in accurately simulating ecohydrological processes but including the temporal variability in specific leaf area further improved seasonal predictions in simulations forced by future climate projections under the representative concentration pathway 4 5 rcp 4 5 and 8 5 rcp 8 5 greenhouse gas emissions scenarios spatial variability in trait parameters impacted predictions of both carbon and water fluxes while temporal variability in trait parameters resulted in predictions of higher ecological function and water use efficiency the higher water use efficiency led to improved ecohydrological function in simulations under rcp 4 5 but it showed little capacity for buffering intensive water stresses under the more pessimistic rcp 8 5 scenario indicating that with spatiotemporally variable trait parameters the impact on predicted ecohydrological processes depends on the climate projections overall our modeling results prompt further field based examination of temporal and belowground trait variability in desert shrublands and they raise the question of how combined spatiotemporal variabilities of multiple traits may support ecohydrological function under water stress keywords ecohydrological model plant functional trait model data fusion 1

the major simplification is that all species assigned to a particular pft are assumed to share the same static set of plant parameters over time to represent plant functional traits which are key characteristics controlling plant growth reproduction and survival under different environmental conditions van kleunen and fischer 2007 while convenient this pft based modeling approach ignores observations that environmental variations may cause trait variations within one pft that can be even larger than average trait differences between pfts kattge et al 2011 aboveground functional traits

limitation reich et al 2014 despite the growing recognition of plant trait variability it is still unclear to what degree current constant parameter pft based models are biased in their simulations of ecohydrological processes nor how these biases may affect our ability to predict future changes in coupled carbon and water cycles some recent studies explicitly incorporated spatial trait variability into ecohydrological models using statistical methods verheijen et al 2013 ali et al 2015 butler et al 2017 and they demonstrated that model simulations were sensitive to trait variability however much remains unknown about the drivers of trait variability correlations between trait variability and climatic variables are relatively weak wright et al 2005 moles et al 2014 šímová et al 2018 focusing on under characterized temporal trait variability previous work by liu and ng 2019 presented a new framework for constraining temporally dynamic trait parameters in an implementation of a mojave desert shrubland site they found estimates of the leaf trait parameter specific leaf area sla to be temporally dynamic in response to water availability allowing greater simulated water use efficiency than with a temporally constant parameter prompted by this finding that temporal trait parameter variability could impact simulations of coupled plant water conditions as represented by water use efficiency the current study builds upon that work with the goal of evaluating how different characteristics of trait variability spatial versus temporal may affect ecohydrological process simulations and whether these variabilities could have implications for predicting ecohydrological vulnerability or resilience of desert shrublands with models focusing on two study sites spanning a climate and terrain gradient in a mojave desert watershed we applied a model data fusion approach raupach et al 2005 liu and gupta 2007 to address the following questions 1 how do the spatial and temporal variability in estimated trait parameters compare in this watershed 2 which type of trait variability spatial versus temporal plays a more important role in accurately simulating ecohydrological processes 3 how does the spatiotemporal variability in trait parameters affect our predictions of ecosystem response to future climatic change 2 method 2 1 overview to investigate how spatial and temporal variability in plant trait parameters affects simulated ecohydrological fluxes and states we conducted three model data fusion experiments that statistically use observations to estimate model parameters and their uncertainties for two sites along a topographic and climate gradient in the mojave desert the first experiment e1 followed the standard constant parameterization approach in which all functional traits shared identical plant parameter values within one pft correspondingly a model data fusion approach was applied where observations from the two sites were used to estimate a single set of plant trait parameters that applied identically to both locations in contrast the second experiment e2 acknowledged that there could be spatial differences in plant trait parameters between the two sites in this experiment the model data fusion framework was implemented separately at each of two different study sites to generate different plant estimates at each location the third experiment e3 further allowed trait parameters to have temporal variability it used the previously developed stochastic model data fusion approach from liu and ng 2019 to constrain potential temporal patterns in plant trait parameters at each of the two study sites a schematic flow chart depicting the three parameterization experiments is shown in fig 1 we then simulated the ecohydrological fluxes and states for the two sites under future climate projections from the representative concentration pathway 4 5 rcp 4 5 and 8 5 rcp 8 5 greenhouse gas ghg emissions scenarios van vuuren et al 2011 using the parameter estimates derived from the three experiments 2 2 study sites with the strong link between plant function and water availability and less complexity in vegetation composition desert shrublands are relatively ideal for investigating spatiotemporal variability in trait parameters and their response to environmental stressors we selected two desert shrubland sites kelmet 860 m a s l and globe 1250 m a s l located at a distance of 13 km from each other in kelso valley in the mojave national preserve southeastern california usa fig 2 a as the two sites have different climatic and geological conditions as well as similar vegetation types but distinct species composition they enable us to test our hypothesis that in response to environmental changes plant functional traits within a pft may exhibit spatiotemporal variability and that these should be represented in ecohydrological models detailed information about the kelmet site as well as a description of previous work in kelso valley can be found in liu and ng 2019 the globe site was instrumented with a hobo weather station onset computer corporation bourne ma that provided hourly precipitation air temperature and relative humidity measurements from 2005 through 2010 the model also requires solar radiation wind speed and air pressure data these were taken from kelmet the closest fully instrumented location with solar radiation values decreased by 50 w m2 when precipitation occurred at globe but not kelmet to generate a longer meteorological time series that is representative of globe we extended the record back to 1 january 1961 using regional data see section s1 in supplementary information for details similar to the reconstruction approach for kelmet liu and ng 2019 in kelso valley prominent rainfall occurs in the winter season with occasional convective storms in the summer reconstructed meteorological forcing time series from 1961 to 2010 indicate that the higher elevation globe site is cooler and wetter annual average temperature 18 4 c and precipitation 291 mm year than the lower elevation kelmet site annual average temperature 20 1 c and precipitation 103 mm year fig 2b also younger coarser and more homogeneous soils are present at the lower elevation kelmet site compared to the globe site miller et al 2009 at the kelmet site 15 of the ground is covered by the broadleaf evergreen shrub larrea tridentata with the co dominant drought deciduous shrub ambrosia dumosa covering about 5 vegetation at the globe site is more diverse with prunus fasciculata and ambrosia eriocentra as the major shrubs present see section s2 in supplementary information for more details overall the broadleaf evergreen shrub and broadleaf deciduous shrub pfts cover about 8 and 12 of the ground at globe respectively although the plant species are different between the sites most are categorized as broadleaf evergreen shrub or broadleaf deciduous shrub pfts this means that under the current pft based model paradigm identical broadleaf evergreen shrub and broadleaf deciduous shrub parameters would be used for the two sites in this study we examine whether plant trait parameter estimates exhibit spatiotemporal variability at the two sites that affect ecohydrological process predictions to use as model constraints on plant trait and soil hydraulic parameter estimates soil moisture at 15 and 35 cm soil depths were measured at both sites from 2 july 2007 to 31 december 2010 using hobo soil moisture probes onset computer corporation bourne ma kelmet observations were described in ng et al 2015 and 1 km 8 day resolution leaf area index lai ratio of the total surface area of all leaves to the ground area below retrieval from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis myneni et al 2002 were compiled over that period at both sites 2 3 ecoyhdrological model we used the community land model version 4 5 clm4 5 oleson et al 2010 to simulate coupled soil moisture and leaf area index lai ratio of the total surface area of all leaves to the ground area below clm4 5 consists of multiple land surface processes including surface radiation transfer energy water balance soil and snow hydrology and plant physiology as well as carbon nitrogen cycling mostly using process based methods specifically the hydrological processes represented in the model include interception canopy through fall infiltration evaporation transpiration surface runoff subsurface drainage vertical soil moisture flux through vadose zone soil and groundwater discharge and recharge the model also determines changes in vegetation states carbon and nitrogen pools in various plant compartments based on simulated ecosystem processes such as photosynthesis and respiration clm 4 5 requires hourly meteorological forcing data air temperature humidity rainfall and radiation soil texture for its 10 computational layers down to a 3 8 m depth and percent cover for the model s pre set pfts the broadleaf evergreen shrub and broadleaf deciduous shrub pft parameterizations in clm were developed to represent shrubs in arid and semiarid regions in the world including deserts in southwestern u s zeng et al 2008 clm4 5 requires inputs for meteorological values including air temperature precipitation radiation air pressure and humidity which we provided at an hourly frequency an interpolation module within clm 4 5 further downscaled the meteorological data for the model s half hourly computational time stepping oleson et al 2010 it should be noted that recently some ecohydrological models have further incorporated plant hydraulics water transport within the plant e g clm5 lawrence et al 2018 and or plant demography evolution of plant age distribution see review by fisher et al 2018 which are likely capable of providing a more accurate representation of the ecohydrological response to climate variability however such model approaches require many parameters that are highly uncertain currently posing obstacles to their widespread use in this study prompted by the growing observations of leaf trait variability kattge et al 2011 we chose to focus on leaf traits as well as other traits already included in common ecohydrological models without introducing plant hydraulics or demographic modules our approach can be extended in the future to further consider parameters for models that include such modules 2 4 model data fusion approach for parameter estimation we use the ensemble kalman filter enkf method evensen 1994 to estimate plant trait parameters in the clm4 5 model based on observations although the method was originally developed for estimating model states i e variables simulated by the model we use the augmented state extension with which model parameters can also be estimated evensen 2009 enkf has been commonly used in hydrological applications reichle et al 2002 moradkhani et al 2005 liu and gupta 2007 reichle et al 2008 and more recently also in ecological studies raupach et al 2005 williams et al 2005 wang et al 2009 luo et al 2011 the basic idea of enkf is that observations are used to constrain the model over a sequence of assimilation cycles that cover observational times one assimilation cycle comprises two steps a model forecast step in which an ensemble of model runs are carried out to represent initial model information and its uncertainty and a model analysis step which uses the following equation to constrain or condition the model using an observation at time t yt x t a x t f k y t h x t f where k p t f h t h p t f h t r 1 is known as the kalman gain x t f and x t a are vectors of model state variables at time t that includes states and parameters with the f superscript indicating the forecast state before the observation constraint and the a superscript indicating the analysis state after the observation constraint h is the function that determines the relationship between model states and observation data to represent uncertainties p t f is the forecast error covariance matrix and is determined from the ensemble of model runs and r is the observation error covariance matrix the forecast step in the assimilation cycle at time t 1 step uses the analysis vector x t a at previous time step time t as the initial state the assimilation cycle evolves until the final time step of available observational data we used two different implementations of enkf that were previously presented in liu and ng 2019 both implementations included two computational passes of the enkf for the whole observational period from t 0 to t to help resolve inconsistencies that can arise between state and parameters estimates when using kalman filter type methods with strongly nonlinear models experiments e1 and e2 utilized the static implementation of the two pass enkf from liu and ng 2019 which treats parameters as constant in time and consists of a relatively straightforward extension of the standard enkf over two passes to constrain uncertainties experiment e3 used the stochastic implementation of the two pass enkf which was developed by liu and ng 2019 to constrain temporally dynamic parameterizations of plant functional traits and to identify potential trait variability the main way that the stochastic implementation of the enkf differs from the standard static implementation is that instead of using only the final parameter estimate at the last time step of the calibration period we focus on the time varying parameter estimates over the entire time period and this enables us to identify how trait parameters co vary with environmental conditions more implementation details can be found in liu and ng 2019 liu and ng 2019 showed that the new stochastic implementation can uncover temporal trait variability and its implementation at the kelmet site yielded parameter time series estimates that were correlated with soil water stress a regression based parameterization based on this correlation allowed probabilistic predictions of trait variability and therefore the impacts on ecohydrological processes at kelmet similar to liu and ng 2019 we assumed in this study that model uncertainty arises due to uncertainties in eight plant parameters table s1 here we further considered uncertainties in the following soil hydraulic properties to account for the effect of different soil conditions between the two study sites the moisture retention curve exponent b saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat saturated matric potential ψ sat and saturated volumetric soil moisture content θ sat in clm4 5 these parameters are used for calculating the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and moisture retention curve in all experiments including e3 soil hydraulic parameters were treated as static in time the initial distribution of plant trait parameters prior to any constraint on observations was adopted from liu and ng 2019 where three of the plant trait parameters were derived from the global plant trait database try kattge et al 2011 with lognormal distributions and the other five plant parameters which are generally not found in try were assumed to follow the uniform distributions obtained from white et al 2000 table s1 it should be noted that lai is a prognostic state variable in clm 4 5 instead of an input parameter states in many other land surface models the initial distributions of soil hydraulic parameters prior to any constraint on observations were assigned based on the method from ng et al 2014 the modis lai and soil moisture measurement at 15 cm and 35 cm depths were used for the observational constraints in the enkf implementation 2 5 downscaled future climate data under the rcp scenarios we obtained the new statistically downscaled climate model dataset multivariate adaptive constructed analogs version 2 meteorological data macav2 metdata for our future model predictions this data product contains daily downscaled meteorological variables for the conterminous u s at 4 km resolution under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios ghg emissions peak around the year 2040 and then stabilize in rcp 4 5 while ghg emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century in rcp 8 5 the meteorological variables in macav2 metdata were statistically downscaled from global climate model gcm data from the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 here we used macav2 metdata derived from the geophysical fluid dynamic laboratory gfdl esm2m output delworth et al 2006 including 2 m air temperature precipitation shortwave radiation and vapor pressure deficit we then disaggregated the daily meteorological forcing data from macav2 metdata into 1 hourly time steps using the open source toolbox meteorological observation time series disaggregation tool melodist förster et al 2016 we tested the disaggregation algorithms using observed meteorological time series from 1961 to 2009 for the kelmet and globe sites and found that they produced a reasonable reconstruction of diurnal features at those sites fig s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal and spatial variability in trait estimates in all experiments soil hydraulic parameters were assumed to be spatially variable at the two sites to account for the observed difference in soil properties with elevation bedford et al 2009 within a site the soil parameter estimates using the two pass enkf were similar across all three experiments which is unsurprising because the experiments differed only in their treatment of plant parameters results for e1 in fig 3 show that the higher elevation globe site has greater values of b ψ sat and θ sat but lower k sat compared to the lower elevation kelmet site these soil parameter estimates are consistent with having younger and coarser soils deposited at lower elevations in the mojave desert rundel and gibson 2005 bedford et al 2009 miller et al 2009 fig 4 shows the plant trait estimates from the second last enkf pass for the broadleaf evergreen shrub pft in each of the three experiments at the two sites note that although only the final time parameter estimate is used as the result in the static enkf implementations in e1 and e2 we show the entire observational period in order to facilitate comparisons with the e3 result which uses the full time series of the temporally varying parameter estimate as the result although all trait parameters for the broadleaf evergreen shrub pft were relatively well constrained in the first pass of enkf the ranges of parameter estimates were all reduced compared with their prior distributions see fig s2 sla and rootb representing rooting depth parameters for the broadleaf evergreen shrub pft had the greatest uncertainty reduction in all experiments when spatial variability was allowed in traits in e2 and e3 we found a higher sla and lower rootb estimate at the globe site compared to at the kelmet site in addition in e3 estimated sla for the broadleaf evergreen shrub pft at both sites showed clear temporal dynamics using the stochastic implementation coefficient of variation of 0 25 and 0 19 for kelmet and globe site respectively providing model evidence for sla variability over time in the broadleaf evergreen shrub pft none of the other plant parameters showed appreciable temporal variability coefficient of variation 0 1 including sla for the broadleaf deciduous shrub pft although direct trait observations were not available at our study sites to validate the results of our model data fusion approach our variable sla and root depth estimates are consistent with data from other studies spatial variations in plant functional traits have been widely observed across global biomes and plant functional type and climate gradient are identified as the main drivers for the trait divergence wright et al 2005 kattge et al 2011 osnas et al 2018 in particular sla variability has been found to be an indicator of plant adaptation to climate variability and the plant with high plasticity in sla tend to have high resource use efficiency under varying environment conditions niinemets 2001 poorter et al 2009 consistent with our estimate of smaller sla at the hotter and drier kelmet site decreases in sla with lower water availability have been observed across space in evergreen species wright et al 2001 schulze et al 2006 gouveia and freitas 2009 grasses oyarzabal et al 2008 meng et al 2015 and crops pandey et al 1984 craufurd et al 1999 dry climate favors small thick and dense leaves low sla and this adaptation allows plant to increase water use efficiency niinemets 1999 as for rooting depth regional climate topography and local soil properties can be potential drivers for its variations stone and kalisz 1991 fan et al 2017 again consistent with our estimate of greater rooting depth larger rootb at the kelmet site deeper roots are generally found in coarser and younger soils which are characterized by vertically homogeneous soil texture and low field capacity sperry and hacke 2002 schenk and jackson 2005 hamerlynck et al 2002 found that larrea tridentata the main vegetation species at the kelmet site can utilize both deep and shallow roots to maintain continuous photosynthetic activity presumably by extracting shallow water during wet seasons and deeper water stores during droughts less is known about temporal trait variability compared to spatial variability likely because of challenges in repeat measurements this gap prompted previous work by liu and ng 2019 which found sla parameter estimates for the broadleaf evergreen shrub pft exhibited temporal pattern and the variation was significantly correlated with available soil water at the kelmet site here our results show that the temporal variation of sla estimates associated with water availability in terms of soil wetness factor β also occurs at the high elevation globe site fig 5 indicating that the potential for water stress driven sla spatiotemporal variability in the broadleaf evergreen shrub pft could be widespread across the watershed though less studied than spatial variability both biotic e g leaf aging reich et al 1991 laclau et al 2009 and abiotic factors e g radiation serbin et al 2014 have been found to be correlated with temporal sla variability across a range of biomes dawson and bliss 1993 abrams 1994 reich et al 1997 damesin et al 1998 wilson et al 2000 damesin and lelarge 2003 xu and baldocchi 2003 liu and stützel 2004 grassi et al 2005 misson et al 2006 ma et al 2011 nouvellon et al 2010 dwyer et al 2014 during drought seasons plants commonly decrease sla by modifying their anatomical tissues for less water requirement poorter et al 2009 in addition to changes in leaf scale sla water availability may also alter the plot meters and ecosystem 10 s of meters scale sla in water limited environments drought events can trigger the selective fall of older high sla leaves or the dormancy of high sla species resulting in lower average sla values for evergreen species that experience seasonal drought previous studies misson 2006 gratani and varone 2006 nouvellon et al 2010 found that sla can be about 20 28 lower during drought periods which is consistent with our finding that soil water availability can be the driver for sla temporal variation at the water limited study sites in addition to changes within individual plants these seasonal shifts in sla may also reflect changes in community level distributions as different species have been noted to exhibit unique relationships between sla and water use strategy castro díez et al 2000 hassiotou et al 2010 ma et al 2011 de la riva et al 2016 peguero pina et al 2017 3 2 comparison of variability in estimated sla between sites 3 2 1 temporal variability in estimated sla to examine how the temporal variability in estimated sla compares across sites we followed the approach of liu and ng 2019 and built linear regression relationships for each of the two sites based on the estimated parameters from e3 with two explanatory variables sla t 30 sla at the previous 30 day time step and β the soil wetness factor averaged over the preceding 30 days fig s3 shows that both regression models can well match the sla estimation for the kelmet and globe sites respectively note that the regression coefficients of the two equations are different see the caption of fig s3 for the statistical significance in their differences with higher sensitivity of sla to soil water availability and a lower auto correlation coefficient value at the kelmet site assuming that this difference in the estimated sla sensitivity between sites captures actual conditions it may reflect the different species compositions at the two sites varying sensitivity of sla in response to water stress within one pft has been reported in previous experimental studies anyia and herzog 2004 ramírez et al 2012 yin et al 2004 nielsen et al 2019 for example liu and stützel 2004 found that water stress decreased the sla in four varieties of vegetable amaranth but with different sensitivity in a semi arid mediterranean ecosystem ramírez et al 2012 conducted a manipulative drought field experiment with broadleaf evergreen shrubs and reported greater sla response to water availability in species with higher sla in contrast to ramírez et al 2012 however we found higher sla sensitivity in kelso valley to occur at the site with lower estimated sla for the broadleaf evergreen shrub pft kelmet rather than higher sla globe it is possible that only two years of indirect coarse resolution lai and spatially sparse soil moisture data in our study may be inadequate for fully constraining the actual sla sensitivity to soil water availability another possibility that has not been previously explored is that climatic differences between sites may trigger varying levels of trait sensitivity to environmental stressors in addition to species type further research into trait variability across species and climates is needed overall our results suggest that moisture driven temporal trait variability may occur widely across desert shrublands but that their implementation in models could remain a challenge due to unique location and or species specific relationships 3 2 2 spatial versus temporal variability in estimated sla the little attention paid to temporal trait variability relative to spatial prompted us to next evaluate how the two types of variability compare in our results for the e3 experiment we found that the spatial differences in estimated sla across the two sites were greater than the temporal range from 1961 to 2010 at both sites table 1 the positive relationship between temporally variable sla estimates and simulated soil wetness found above fig 5 suggests that wetter and cooler conditions at globe compared to kelmet could be driving the similarly positive spatial gradient in estimated sla variability based on water availability at the two sites the apparent sla sensitivity to water availability calculated by the change in sla per change in soil wetness factor in the model is in fact much greater over space than over time at each site the spatial difference in soil wetness is even smaller than the temporal difference even though the spatial difference in sla is greater than the temporal difference this indicates that estimated sla changes more in between the study sites than would be expected due to the water stress driven temporal variability inferred at each site over the 40 year modeling period the greater spatial compared to temporal gradients found in our sla estimates suggests that actual spatial trait variability may be more prominent than temporal and this may be attributed to a couple of reasons first as suggested for the difference in temporal sla characteristics at the two sites distinct species compositions between the sites could exhibit divergent sla characteristics niinemets 2001 poorter et al 2009 second it is possible that persistent differences in climate and soil wetness conditions between the two sites have led to a greater change in sla over space than is physiologically possible over the shorter seasonal times scales of climatic changes within a site an implication of our findings is that although traits can vary both spatially and temporally easier to measure spatial variability characteristics should not be directly substituted into models to represent temporal variability verheijen et al 2015 recently developed regression models to build statistical relationships between plant trait parameters and climatic conditions using a global trait database and then used these to predict the anually dynamic trait parameters 3 3 ecohydrological role of spatial and temporal trait parameter variability comparing simulation results using parameter estimates from e1 e2 and e3 provides insights into the relative importance of spatial versus temporal variability in parameters for simulating ecohydrological states the parameter estimates from the e1 experiment performed worse than those from e2 and e3 in reproducing the observed lai and soil moisture at both the globe and kelmet sites figs 6 and 7 respectively when allowing for spatial variability of trait parameters in the e2 parameterization simulated soil moisture improved at both sites and simulated lai matched the time averaged lai observations however the simulated lai using trait parameter estimates from e2 failed to capture the seasonal lai variations at both sites when the temporally dynamic sla estimates from e3 were incorporated in the model simulations tracked lai observation dynamics much more closely than the simulation that only accounted for spatial variations in parameters e2 fig 6 simulations could be expected to show a more substantial change with the addition of spatially variable sla compared to temporally variable sla given the greater spatial difference in estimated sla than temporal table 1 indeed table 2 quantitatively shows that the greatest improvement increase in the coefficient of correlation r2 and decrease in root mean square error rmse in lai and soil moisture simulations occurred when spatial variability of trait parameters was allowed in clm 4 5 e1 to e2 note that e1 already took into account differences in soil and climate conditions between the sites and so e2 results point to the need for including spatial variability in plant trait parameters to capture both ecological and hydrological states further incorporation of temporally variable trait parameters in e3 led to a subtler improvement in model performance table 2 suggesting that ecohydrological process simulations were more sensitive to the spatial variability of trait parameters however compared to the results in e3 most of the lai ensemble uncertainties with temporally constant traits in e1 and e2 failed to include the lai observations during the observation period at both sites fig 6 this corroborates findings at the lower elevation kelmet site by liu and ng 2019 and demonstrates the benefit of using temporally variable sla for robustly capturing lai seasonal variation across a soil and climate gradient such that model ensemble predictions encompass actual conditions overall the simulations using the three sets of parameter estimates demonstrate that both spatial and temporal variability in the sla and rooting depth parameters impact lai and soil moisture simulations over the observation period this is consistent with the ecological functions of the traits represented by these parameters sla is a key ecophysiological trait affecting photosynthetic capacity and plant biomass reich et al 1997 niinemets 1999 antúnez et al 2001 wright et al 2004 quero et al 2006 and rooting depth is a trait that is central to determining ecosystem resilience to water stress and long term coupling between carbon and water cycles nepstad et al 1994 oliveira et al 2005 maeght et al 2013 3 4 future scenario simulations with trait parameter variability using a 40 year historical period at the kelmet site liu and ng 2019 showed that simulations with temporally variable sla in the broadleaf evergreen shrub pft had greater simulated water use efficiency compared to the case of time static sla here we further evaluated how the combination of spatial and temporal trait parameter variability impacts simulated ecohydrological fluxes and we further assessed how that variability might affect predictions of coupled carbon and water fluxes under future climate change to do this we extended experiments e1 e2 and e3 by implementing their respective parameter estimates in simulations forced with rcp climate scenarios from 2011 to 2100 for the two sites we first focused on the most pessimistic climate scenario rcp 8 5 in order to bracket our predictions of ecohydrological changes with the various trait parameter inputs for e1 and e2 the estimated parameters at the final time step were used to run clm 4 5 for e3 the regression equations for time varying sla for the two sites fig s3 were incorporated into clm 4 5 fig 8 a 8b 9a and 9b show the projections of climate forcing under the rcp 8 5 scenario at kelmet and globe at both sites temperature was predicted to rise and precipitation to decrease from 2011 to the end of 21st century with rcp 8 5 as a result lai was predicted to decrease at both sites for all experiments fig 10 and table s2 specifically across all experiments lai was estimated to decrease about 50 at kelmet and 30 at globe with the more dramatic drop at kelmet resulting from the more severe warmer and drier climatic conditions projected at that low elevation site it should be noted that the lai predictions in 2011 are higher than in the calibrated simulation period from 2007 to 2010 at both sites due to biases in the disaggregation scheme and possibly also in the climate model in particular fig s1 shows an over representation of small rain events by the disaggregation scheme further over simulation of drizzle is a well recognized problem in numerical weather prediction and climate models wood 2005 sun et al 2006 wyant et al 2007 hannay et al 2009 stephens et al 2010 while this raises uncertainties in the absolute raw clm outputs generated with climate model forcings the simulations are nonetheless useful for examining relative trends over the century and relative differences among the three different experiments demonstrating the sensitivity of future predicted ecohydrological fluxes to trait parameter variability at kelmet and globe figs 8 and 9 respectively compare the simulated annual lai transpiration gross primary productivity gpp and water use efficiency wue defined as gpp divided by transpiration under the rcp 8 5 scenario for the three experiments although the rcp 8 5 ensemble time series for the three experiments show overlaps accounting for spatial differences in the broadleaf evergreen shrub trait parameters e2 and e3 compared to e1 resulted in consistently lower estimated mean sla at kelmet fig 4 and correspondingly lower simulated lai transpiration and gpp fig 8 and table s3 while it led to the opposite effect at the globe site generally higher sla lai transpiration and gpp predictions figs 4 and 9 and table s3 unsurprisingly including spatially variable trait parameters led to greater predicted differences in ecohydrological variables between the two sites compared to the default parameterization e1 table s3 figs 8 and 9 further demonstrate that the ensemble simulations using the temporally variable sla estimates e3 experiment not only generated higher lai seasonal variability due to time varying sla especially at kelmet fig s4 but interestingly they also show slightly higher long term average lai results than the simulations with only spatially variable sla estimates e2 4 to 7 higher the slightly higher lai prediction with temporally dynamic sla in e3 compared to e2 corresponds to greater long term average predicted gpp and wue at both sites insets in figs 8 and 9 and table s3 overall our model results suggest that spatial variability in plant trait parameters can affect predictions of ecological and hydrological function appreciable changes in gpp and transpiration while temporal variability impacts may be more limited to the prediction of ecological responses appreciable changes in gpp but not in transpiration see insets in figs 8 and 9 and table s3 our model based evidence for trait variations affecting predicted ecohydrological processes across kelso valley is consistent with observations from other studies gouveia and freitas 2009 assessed intra specific variation in a range of leaf attributes and leaf carbon isotope concentration in an evergreen tree quercuset suber along a rainfall gradient and demonstrated that the changes in leaf thickness associated with water availability strongly affected the water use efficiency maxwell et al 2018 measured the intrinsic water use efficiency iwue defined as the ratio of net carbon assimilation to stomatal conductance along a 1500 m elevation gradient with a wide climatic range in a montane forest system and found that iwue highly depends on the dominant evergreen forest species leaf trait characteristics and stage of soil development although these observational studies reported only spatial gradients in leaf traits iwue may also reflect temporal changes because iwue is derived from leaf carbon isotope values which record accumulated plant conditions over time wieser et al 2018 it should be noted that different species may have distinct strategies in response to environmental stressors resulting in varying effects on ecohydrological processes for example some species with lower sla have thicker leaves that support greater photosynthesis per area de la riva et al 2016 peguero pina et al 2017 while other species with lower sla have increased leaf density and reduced mesophyll conductance and photosynthesis castro díez et al 2000 hassiotou et al 2010 de la riva et al 2016 therefore although evergreen species tend to show higher wue with lower sla this relationship may not extend across different ecosystems in terms of nutrients trait variations have been shown to influence nitrogen cycling at the watershed scale due to differences within one pft in litter quality e g the ratio of carbon to nitrogen and nitrogen uptake rates williard et al 2005 dawson et al 2005 these previous studies suggest that simulated ecohydrological responses to trait parameter changes in our model may reflect actual sensitivities further research is needed to corroborate findings with field data and to evaluate the generality of the spatiotemporal trends found for kelso valley 3 5 sensitivity to future climate scenario to assess the impact of trait parameter variability on model predictions under a range of climate scenarios we conducted additional simulations using the rcp 4 5 climate projections and compared results against those using the rcp 8 5 climate inputs in rcp 4 5 temperature peaked around 2040 and then stabilized following ghg emissions figs s5a and s6a although both rcp scenarios showed that precipitation decreases at the end of 21st century the decrease in rcp 4 5 was generally less severe figs s5b and s6b qualitatively compared to the case with only spatial trait variability including spatiotemporal sla variability had similar effects on the predicted ecohydrological variables as in the rcp 8 5 results higher predicted time averaged lai gpp and wue but approximately the same transpiration figs s5 and s6 and table s4 importantly although both climate scenarios show that predicted wue improves with temporally variable trait parameters compared to the case with only spatial variability tables s3 and s4 under the rcp 8 5 climate change projection this has a far less effect on predicted lai decline over 90 years see similar percent change in lai for all rcp 8 5 experiments in fig 10 and table s2 the reason is that under rcp 8 5 the higher wue simulations with temporally variable sla in e3 compared to e2 corresponded to only a small boost to the change in gpp over the 90 year period boost of 0 2 gc month at kelmet and globe respectively table s2 compared to the initial gpp values about 5 1 and 7 5 gc month at kelmet and globe respectively table s2 due to continuously warming and drying conditions in fact the 90 year relative declines in average lai gpp and transpiration predictions under rcp 8 5 are very similar across all three experiments fig 10 and table s2 indicating that the magnitude of ecohydrological change simulated over the century with the most pessimistic climate scenario will overwhelm any potential benefits higher wue that may be afforded by spatiotemporally variable trait parameters in contrast with the milder rcp 4 5 climate change projections the improved wue predictions with temporally variable sla e3 compared to only spatially variable traits in e2 correspond to a larger effect on predictions of relative lai and gpp change over 90 years fig 10 for example at the kelmet site in the rcp 4 5 scenario the higher wue predictions with temporally variable sla can appreciably buffer the simulated gpp and lai decline from a 9 8 and 14 7 decline with only spatially variable sla to a 5 6 and 8 6 decline with spatiotemporally variable sla table s5 and fig 10 the simulation comparison between the two scenarios indicates that when considering spatiotemporally variable trait parameters the benefits for ecohydrological processes depend on the long term climate projections under the more pessimistic rcp 8 5 climate projections our simulations suggest that the trait variability represented by our trait parameter estimates may not be able to keep pace with the rates of warming and drying in our desert shrubland sites it should be noted however that over smaller climatic variabilities such as those that occur on the time scale of seasons up to a few years improved wue with spatiotemporal trait parameters can result in notably higher gpp even under rcp 8 5 for example from the year 2073 to 2075 in the rcp 8 5 scenario gpp at globe jumps up from 1 5 to 6 0 gc mon factor of 4 with spatiotemporally variable trait parameters compared to only from 1 5 to 4 7 gc mon factor of about 3 with constant traits 4 summary and conclusion by using remotely sensed lai and in situ soil moisture measurements we implemented a model data fusion approach that constrained spatiotemporally variable parameters representing plant functional traits of shrubs in a mojave desert watershed we found that the broadleaf evergreen shrub pft at a lower elevation study site had lower sla 26 and deeper rooting depth 17 estimates than at a higher elevation study site in addition we demonstrated that the sla estimates co varied over time with soil water availability at both sites but with different levels of sensitivity to water stress spatial variability in the estimated sla parameter was found to be 26 greater than the temporal variability in the watershed incorporating the spatially variable trait parameters into the clm 4 5 ecohydrological model was more important than representing temporally variable parameters for correctly capturing time averaged lai and soil moisture observations and simulating ecohydrological fluxes states however temporally variable sla parameters were needed to simulate the observed seasonality in lai our model based findings in a desert shrubland suggest that the global bias of spatial plant trait observations compared to temporal observations may be somewhat justified if spatial trait variability generally exceeds temporal as found in our estimates however results at our two study sites suggest that temporally variable trait parameters could be widespread and incorporating them into models may be needed for capturing seasonal responses to environmental stressors that could improve predicted ecohydrological efficiency as represented by wue unfortunately our parameterization results showed that spatial and temporal trait variability exhibit distinct characteristics and consequently more commonly observed spatial trait variability should not be directly adopted to also represent under observed temporal variability in traits our estimates of variable sla and root depth are generally consistent with field based studies of trait variability in other settings including previous findings that spatial and or temporal trait variability may represent adaptations that benefit ecological function this indicates that our model based results may provide insights into actual ecohydrological conditions in desert shrublands our modeling work prompts additional measurements of plant traits such as sla and root depth over both time and space across different shrub types such field data can be used to test hypotheses raised by our model results such as whether differences in climate terrain and species in desert shrublands could be driving spatial trait variability and whether sla may exhibit sensitivities to water availability that are greater over space than time possibly due to inter species or climatic differences or to time lags in adaptations rcp future climate scenario tests showed that spatially variable trait parameters impacted predictions of both carbon and water fluxes while additional temporal variability in sla generated higher predictions in lai gpp and wue increased wue predictions with added temporal trait variability resulted in discernible ecohydrological benefits under the milder climate scenario rcp 4 5 but simulations under the most pessimistic greenhouse gas emissions scenario rcp 8 5 showed that this increase in wue predictions was insufficient for appreciably buffering against more extreme stresses in particular 90 year ecohydrological projections in the study watershed under rcp 8 5 showed 30 50 declines in lai regardless of trait parameter variability our plot scale model findings about variable plant traits prompt further extensions of our method to regional and global simulations of coupled carbon and water dynamics our method can be implemented to constrain incomplete trait distributions from general plant databases such as try using global remote sensing data e g lai from modis as in the current study and possibly soil moisture from smap entekhabi et al 2010 in future work along with any other available observations at different spatiotemporal resolutions this approach has the potential to effectively and efficiently build statistical relationships between the data constrained traits and biotic and abiotic factors in a targeted region or even at the global

5343,in recent years uncertainties in climate change have made the allocation of waste load a severe challenge this research develops a new model framework integrating a soil and water assessment tool swat for hydrological simulation of the river basin borg many objective evolutionary algorithm borg moea for optimization and a software for many objective robust decision making openmordm to minimize these uncertainties and identifying the most robust waste load allocation plans resisting the impact of system uncertainties this framework has been applied to the golgol river basin iran which is the main source of the ilam dam water supply in this study first temperature and precipitation were predicted in 2080 2099 then the swat model was used to simulate runoff and biochemical oxygen demand bod afterward by specifying the objective functions the borg moea produced the most optimal waste load allocation scenarios in the driest month of the future august so that the amount of bod in the dam reservoir remains less than 5 mg l in the next step the robustness of the solutions analyzed using openmordm then the results were analyzed using the patient rule induction method prim and classification and regression tree cart methods to identify the system vulnerability domains and minimizing false positives through the analysis four climate scenarios have been used to explain how the methodological selection of them affects the resulting candidate planning solutions the results indicated that individual design selections from the water managers or researchers could influence the efficacy of the model framework which in turn results in failure of the most robust waste load allocation strategies under future climate change keywords climate change robust decision making borg many objective evolutionary algorithm deep uncertainty scenario discovery golgol river basin 1 introduction lately various approaches have been developed to address the uncertainties associated with water resources management looking for the most robust design alternatives that minimize deviation from future plans is one of the most critical elements in water resources management this challenge is exacerbated by deep uncertainties so that the set of all possible future events as well as their associated probability distributions themselves contain uncertainties though many robustness frameworks have expanded lately include information gap decision theory ben haim 2004 decision scaling brown et al 2012 brown 2010 many objective robust decision making lempert 2002 kasprzyk et al 2013 lempert et al 2013 2006 lempert and collins 2007 groves and lempert 2007 weaver et al 2013 however various researches have studied and organized ordinary methodological elections in robustness focused decision support frameworks dittrich et al 2016 herman et al 2015 kwakkel and haasnoot 2019 maier et al 2016 among all these approaches mordm is vastly superior in implementing interactive visual analytics to distinguish proper answers trade offs recognition among various plans and evaluate their operation under the influence of deep uncertainties this method has so far been used to solve several water management issues singh et al 2015 problem formulation is the first stage in mordm in which the operation goals the specific uncertainties and the computational model are received from the beneficiaries furthermore critical constraints or other assumptions of the operation of the system are expressed in the next step the previous stage becomes a multi objective search to create design alternatives for the problem for determining the robust performance rules of a water supply system kang ren et al 2019 utilized the mordm framework the uncertainty analysis and multi objective optimization tools were employed first to show the trade offs between the conflicting objectives and second reveal the sensitive factors for the possible states of the system results determined that the robust operating rules offer significant insights into the hurdles posed by deep uncertainties and provide a management template for decision making on climate change and complicated human activities moallemi et al 2019 examined two frameworks epoch era analysis and robust decision making they deduced that the supremacy of each framework is not inevitable and depends on the circumstances and the problem while robust decision making is a more impressing framework under contested and obscure information about the future epoch era analysis can operate better when stakeholder knowledge about the future provides a deliberative specification of future scenarios trindade et al 2017 developed a multi stakeholder mordm framework to better account for deeply uncertain factors when recognizing collaborative drought management strategies their results revealed that appropriately designing adaptive risk of failure action triggers needed stressing them with a broad sample of deeply uncertain factors in the computational search condition of mordm the results from their research had a general benefit for areas where neighboring municipalities can profit from joint regional water portfolio planning newly multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas reed et al 2013 have been considered in water resources management these algorithms have been advanced to obtain the most suitable trade off answers instead of gaining a solution that can optimize all objectives concurrently coello coello et al 2007 moeas can explore multiple pareto optimal results in a profoundly complicated search space because of their capability to employ the identities of recombinant answers zitzler and thiele 1999 for a complex allocation system moeas provide the optimization output as an approximate set of pareto answers instead of a single best solution as managers portfolio preferences diverged as trade off information increased smith et al 2019 choosing the most robust solutions among these alternatives creates new challenges for policymakers previous studies have employed a variety of methods to select the robust alternatives in water resources management among them are geometric angle based pruning algorithm sudeng and wattanapongsakorn 2014 visually interactive decision making and design using evolutionary multi objective optimization video kollat and reed 2007 and mordm kasprzyk et al 2013 yan et al 2017 advanced a model framework combining mordm and biophysical modeling their case study was the pearl river basin prb china where to reduce saltwater intrusion in the dry season adequate flow to the delta was needed before recognizing and evaluating robust water allocation plans for the future the performance of ten ultra modern moeas was assessed for allocating water in the prb the borg moea which is a self adaptive optimization algorithm had superior achievement through the historical periods therefore it was elected to create new water allocation plans for the future 2079 2099 the study noted that the framework could work inadequately because of unpredictable climate change influences on water resources the purpose of this paper is to advance a model framework that combines many objective robust decision making with hydrological modeling to identify robust waste load allocation plans under climate change through these analyses four climate scenarios have been adopted to demonstrate how the methodological choice of them changes the resulting candidate planning solutions in this study the openmordm is utilized which is an open source application of mordm in the r programming language openmordm provides a platform for constructive decision support enabling analysts to interactively identify promising options and possible vulnerabilities while balancing contrasting objectives hadka et al 2015 r language was chosen because of its widespread use in environmental modeling and access to pre built analytical and statistical packages selected in addition to the preceding forecasting future climate change is also subject to uncertainty dessai and hulme 2007 one of the effects of climate change is on hydrological cycles which result in changing flow and discharge of rivers these factors cause changes in the transmission and distribution of pollutants in the environment and generally affect the quantity and quality of water all of these changes will introduce uncertainties that will pose significant challenges for water resource policymakers and managers for example when 20 general circulation models gcms were employed to create 39 runs of the 21st century for the murray darling basin in lim and roderick 2009 study the results indicated that 22 runs showed growth in yearly mean precipitation by the end of the 21st century while 17 runs were showing this decline robust optimization was practiced by mortazavi naeini et al 2015 to protect bulk water supply quality in an urban area against drought and climate change uncertainties and measured the amount of potential evapotranspiration pet and future rainfall for the 23 gcms obtained from a previous study csiro bom 2007 the multi site stochastic model was used to generate 10 000 50 year replicates of daily precipitation and pet based on these values it should be noted that just one emission scenario a1f1 was involved in their study culley et al 2016 expanded a bottom up framework to determine the maximum operational acceptance capacity of water resource systems regarding the space of future climate exposure which was based on seven gcms and six regional climate models under three representative concentration pathways rcps there is no agreement on what will occur in the future climate change and this will cause problems with making decisions for managing water resources efficiently uncertainty about future weather forecasts is unlikely to diminish significantly in the near future for managing water resources under uncertainty in climate change it is essential to implement forecasting for a variety of emission scenarios resulting from multiple gcms pierce et al 2009 teutschbein et al 2015 the remainder of the paper is structured as follows in section 2 the model framework has been defined including models and datasets utilized in this paper the golgol river basin iran has been presented in section 3 as a case study conclusion in section 4 contains lessons learned from this study and proposals for the future 2 methodology 2 1 model framework fig 1 depicted the model framework combining various modeling tools and data employed in this research this complex framework has a significant role as a tool to facilitate robust waste load allocation in the golgol river basin which includes a model for generating random climate data lars wg a hydrological model swat a state of the art optimization algorithm borg moea and an open source software openmordm to study the effects of climate change on various systems in future periods the value of climate variables should be first simulated in the future using tools known as climate models models of the various components of the climate system may be coupled to produce increasingly complex models coupled atmosphere ocean models including such parameterized physical processes are called atmosphere ocean general circulation models aogcms currently the most reliable tools for simulating the climate variables and producing the climate scenarios are aogcms which are based on the physical laws describing the dynamics of atmosphere and ocean expressed by mathematical equations mitchell 2003 wilby and harris 2006 ipcc 2013 however these models have the output of climate parameters on a vast spatial and temporal scale therefore it is necessary to produce and utilize downscaled models to use large scale climate models in this study in order to predict temperature and precipitation under climate change aogcm outputs were used and downscaled by lars wg two aogcm were selected after weighting to 10 of them hadley centre coupled model version 3 hadcm3 and european centre hamburg model version 5 echam5 om were selected with the highest weight gain two different greenhouse gas emission scenarios published by intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc were applied a2 a very heterogeneous world with continuously increasing global population and regionally oriented economic growth that is more fragmented and slower than in other scenarios and b1 a convergent world with the same global population as in the a1 storyline but with rapid changes in economic structures toward a service and information economy with reductions in material intensity and the introduction of clean and resource efficient technologies in order to ensure the capability of the model to forecast long term variables and the accuracy of the model results the observed data were entered into the software and the model reproduced the data in the baseline period to ensure the homogeneity of the data used the run test was utilized and the results were in the range of 95 confidence interval a baseline scenario for the statistical period of 1986 2010 was run and time series related to minimum temperature maximum temperature and precipitation for ilam station were produced daily then by using the correlation coefficient r2 mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse equations the observed data were compared with the data generated by the model concordance of statistical specifications between observational data and reproduced data designated that the model will be able to generate temperature and precipitation data for future periods with low uncertainty however it should be noted that this framework can be set for any other future period then these forecasted outputs were utilized to run a hydrological model chain 1 next the swat model used to simulate daily bod and daily runoff of the river and the outputs calibrated by swat cup software calibration and uncertainty analysis in this study was performed using the sequential uncertainty fitting 2 sufi 2 algorithm in swat cup software in this method the measurement of uncertainty in modeling includes uncertainties in driving variables the concept of model parameters and measured data for this purpose the two factors are the index of the evaluation of the results p factor which is the percentage of measured data bracketed by the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu and r factor which is the average thickness of the 95ppu band divided by the standard deviation of the measured data sufi 2 tries to bracket most of the measured data with the smallest possible uncertainty band also two coefficients nash sutcliffe ns and correlation r2 were implemented to evaluate swat model calibration which their results indicated that the model was sufficient to simulate the parameters abbaspour et al 2007 the change factor method has also been used to observe the effect of climate change on the basin chain 2 after obtaining bod concentration values in the future 2080 2099 to predict the pollutant transport process the concentration was simulated from upstream to downstream using the streeter phelps relationship then by setting up objective functions the optimization algorithm borg moea produced the best waste allocation scenarios under well characterized uncertainty while still had been satisfying the objective function chain 3 afterward by implementing openmordm developed by hadka et al 2015 and changing the well characterized uncertainty into the deep uncertainty the robustness of each allocation plan measured chain 4 prim and cart were used to identify the values of the input parameters that made the system vulnerable chain 5 and finally the best waste load allocation scenarios were chosen chain 6 various robustness assessing methods are required due to their tendency towards ignoring outliers hadka et al 2015 a correct determination of thresholds for quantifying robustness is an important level in mordm and the continuation of the analysis depends on it proper thresholds may vary between stakeholders and attitudes based on constraints of the system or the operation level required herman et al 2015 developed two main categories of robustness measurement methods after lempert and collins 2007 regret and satisficing in general regret based robustness measures the deviation in system performance in profoundly uncertain scenarios in other words regret based robustness concentrates on the impact of choosing the wrong plans for future scenarios savage 1951 while satisficing based robustness determines the feasibility of the design according to the execution criteria set by the beneficiary the criteria are coded with a satisficing counter function which is set to 1 when all the conditions are satisfied and otherwise is 0 for satisficing based robustness feasibility is measured by a fraction of the scenarios that meet the criteria the functions are given as eqs 1 and 2 it should be noted that eq 1 assumes the maximization of all objective functions however if the minimizing of the objective function is considered then eq 1 should calculate the minimum objective value 1 r regret max i quantile s s f i x s sup y p f i y s f i x s 0 9 where quantile s s calculates the 90th percentile value within all scenarios p is the set of answers created by borg moea and sup y p identifies the best answer in p among scenarios the best answer here is calculated as the ideal point the ideal point in multi objective space gets the best result in each objective it should be noted that this point may not suit a realistic design rather it will be used as a higher limit on the best achievable output in each objective hadka et al 2015 2 r satisficing 1 s s s i s f x s 2 2 multi objective evolutionary algorithms selection evolutionary algorithms eas are a class of search and optimization algorithms developed based on natural evolution processes holland 1975 their capability to support a wide range of different answers has made ea a default option to solve multi objective problems in general the moea can be defined as follows 3 p t 1 s s v s v p t p t where p t denotes candidate answers at the tth iteration p t 1 is the new answer ss v and sv are the environment selection the genetic variation and variation selection operators respectively purshouse and fleming 2007 moeas are positively efficient in obtaining trade off answers for multi objective problems with opposing objectives coello coello et al 2007 over the past ten years however more than 20 moeas have been offered throughout a literature review on present ultra modern moeas that are highly efficient the borg moea which has been reported as an advanced and top performing algorithm has been selected the borg moea explicitly designed to deal with multi objective multimodal problems where our main concentration in the future will be on developing seriously challenging applications in the real world it combines є dominance a measure of convergence speed named є progress randomized restarts and auto adaptive multi operator recombination into a unified optimization framework kollat and reed 2006 hadka and reed 2012 hadka and reed 2013 reed et al 2013 hadka et al 2012 3 case study the study area in this research is golgol watershed with an area of 279 53 km2 in the ilam province iran it is one of the subbasins of the ilam dam and it is located between 46 16 36 and 46 38 32 eastern longitudes and between 33 23 46 and 33 38 12 northern latitudes fig 2 the maximum height of the basin is 2065 m its minimum height is 1052 m and the average height is 1578 m above sea level the average slope of the basin is 39 5 and the average precipitation of the basin is 416 mm 1994 2015 the golgol river is one of the most important rivers supplying the ilam dam it flows from east to west and enters the dam reservoir after passing through about 13 villages the golgol chaviz and emma rivers feed the ilam dam and the golgol river basin was only included in this research to consider the effect of the waste load of two other basins on the bod of the reservoir the problem formulation keeps the bod below 5 mg l saberi and niksokhan 2017 at the junction of these three rivers with the dam reservoir the golgol river alone provides 70 of this inflow to the dam therefore the water quality of the dam is under the vital influence due to changing in water quality and quantity of this river and as the ilam dam is the main water supplier of the ilam city the water quality of the river has a significant impact on the lives of the people of this province therefore it is necessary first to predict the changes in golgol river water quality and then to adopt a strategy for the proper allocation of pollutant emissions from pollutant sources to ensure the water quality of the dam reservoir in this research the amount of runoff and bod of the river is predicted under climate change since uncertainty has always been one of the challenges facing water resources engineering it has been tried to minimize the effects of this uncertainty by developing a framework and by identifying the scenarios that lead to failure ultimately the best scenario of waste load allocation is selected 4 formulation and results 4 1 formulating the optimization problem from lars wg and swat outputs it has been observed that because of climate change river flow fig 3 and rainfall fig 4 of the dry season are likely to decrease in the future within all climate scenarios this may result in decreasing the water quality of the dam reservoir by the increase in the concentration of bod discharge from upstream stakeholders table 1 so seeking an appropriate pollution strategy for bod discharge to prevent further contamination of the dam reservoir has led to four objectives formulation it should be pointed out that the river system has only been included in this research and the reservoir operating rules have not been considered these four objectives are minimizing bod concentration in the dam reservoir maximizing inertia maximizing reliability and minimizing cost these objective functions are as follows minimizing bod in the dam reservoir the first objective function measures the mean bod concentration during each time step and scenario 4 f bod 1 s s s max x t s where s and t are the collections of all sampled scenarios and time steps daily here respectively and xt s is the amount of contamination in the reservoir at time t in scenario s inertia the second objective function computes the portion of time periods where the day to day variation in permissible contamination at at 1 stays under a specified threshold τ 5 f inertia 1 t 1 n r 1 n 1 n r 1 t 1 t i a t a t 1 τ where nr is the number of reaches of the river i is an indicator function having the value 1 if the requirements are satisfied and 0 otherwise at is the concentration of bod emitted by the stakeholders in day t at 1 is the concentration of bod emitted by the stakeholders in day t 1 and τ is the permissible change threshold which set to 20 in this research since a pollution control strategy has been developing in this study to impose restrictions on anthropogenic pollution emitted by the stakeholders ideally changes in permissible pollution are below the specified limit however drastic changes are burdening policymakers to revise existing policies and infrastructure so that these programs may change before the passing of their projected lifetime inertia value of 1 is ideal designating that there is no need for significant modifications in environmental planning policies reliability the third objective calculates the portion of days in which the amount of contamination in the dam reservoir remains under the critical bod threshold 5 mg l of the reservoir xcrit 6 f reliability 1 s t s s t t i x t s x crit where xcrit is the critical bod threshold for the dam reservoir if the pollutant exceeds the critical level bacterial growth and oxygen consumption will accelerate and oxygen levels may decrease to a level that can be fatal to the fish and other aquatic organisms accordingly a value of the reliability function near 1 0 is favored showing that the dam reservoir provides oxygen to fish and aquatic organisms throughout all times and within all scenarios the equation additionally introduces a severe constraint of f reliability 0 85 in the problem code the fourth objective is the economic function 7 f economic i 1 n c i t i where ti is the discharge purification percentage of the ith stakeholder n is the number of stakeholders throughout the study area and ci is the sum of the cost of penalties and treatment the cost function of treatment for discharges of industrial and municipal wastewater is obtained according to the relations 8 and 9 respectively in these relationships the t parameter is the percentage of organic matter removed the penalty function of violation of the standard is also calculated according to the relation 10 8 c o s t m 3 y e a r 0 5 t 3 0 73 t 2 0 09 t 0 02 9 c o s t m 3 y e a r 0 434 t 2 0 228 t 0 029 10 c o s t year 983 27 b o d bod std 2 37313 b o d bod std 4 2 producing water allocation plans in this step the output parameters of the swat and lars software have been used as the baseline parameters these basic default parameters represent predictable future scenarios under well characterized uncertainty creating a baseline result is a more careful examination of effects of the deep uncertainty and robustness then by the use of borg moea design alternatives have been generated for the allocation problem based on the objective functions a three dimensional scatter plot is applied to show the approximate pareto answers generated by borg moea base on baseline parameters furthermore a parallel coordinates plot also depicts the trade offs between performance objectives each line depicts an alternative design for controlling pollution the place where the line crosses each vertical axis represents the relevant objective value since the problem code determines the constraint f reliability 0 85 there are no answers with weaker reliability on the plot for the graphical representation of reliability a color palette is also determined which facilitates understanding of the relationships between objective functions all of those as mentioned earlier has been implemented for two aogcms hadcm3 and echam5 om under two emission scenarios a2 and b1 and the results for these scenarios are shown in figs 5 8 the three main axes include the average bod value in the dam reservoir the total cost of treatment and penalty and the inertia and the color of the glyphs spherical markers shown in the scatter plot represent reliability each glyph represents a 10 day pollution control strategy for five stakeholders a set of 50 decision variables that are approximately pareto optimal and as the range of reliability green glyphs represent 100 reliability and red glyphs 86 reliability it should be noted that the ideal point is determined by a star in the scatter plot in all figures after all the above steps the next step is to measure the robustness of each of these points however since the objective functions conflict with each other the ideal point may not be achievable from above scatter and a parallel coordinate plots it can be concluded that first the inertia does not affect the bod variables cost and reliability as the figures show that the inertia plate at each intersection level intersects the graph the result being similar to the other intersections which indicates the dependency of this objective function to cost and bod functions also since the color of the glyphs does not change in depth this parameter does not affect reliability as well second for the lower bod values the cost function increases indicating a higher wastewater treatment to meet the problem constraint and therefore a higher treatment cost it is also expected that in the high amounts for bod there will still be an increase in the cost due to penalty while as the bod increases as shown the answers are in the lower cost range due to the lower purification cost but no penalties yet however upon entry into the penalty area the reliability level drops significantly as the stakeholder is evacuating too much contamination also reliability loss does not satisfy the problem s constraint so there is no glyph to this on the 3d plots third according to the outputs of the lars wg and swat models in the hadcm3 b1 echam5 om b1 echam5 om a2 and hadcm3 a2 climate scenarios respectively the river flow decreases and the initial bod concentration and temperature increases which the decrease in the number of highly reliable solutions in fig 5 a to 5 d also confirms the increase in bod in the river due to climate change also results in more waste load treatment by stakeholders to meet the problem constraint which increases the cost of treatment this increase in cost is well evident in the output of scattering schemes after all the above steps the next step is to measure the robustness of each of these points 4 3 robustness assessment of water allocation plans until this part of the study swat output data were used as baseline parameters under well characterized uncertainties in the future however the uncertainties surrounding environmental systems in the real world are often insufficiently described the probability distribution that indicates the uncertainty of the critical parameters maybe profoundly uncertain or the model inputs data may be concealed or just recognized to lie within a range of values then uncertain parameters such as river flow river s velocity and bod decay rate kr were modeled under deep uncertainty since the values of these parameters are profoundly uncertain a range of plausible values for any uncertainties that are also meaningful was defined and 1000 latin hypercube samples lhs were created randomly this random lhs output is a 1000 3 matrix next a new problem was defined by using each row of the generated matrix representing three values for the uncertainty variables the problem that was previously solved under well characterized initial values was examined with deeply uncertain parameters however as it has been explained before because of the uncertainties surrounding environmental systems in the real world the hydrological and geological pattern does not remain constant regret and satisficing methods pursue different goals to show uncertainty and the calculation of uncertainty will vary depending on which one of these methods is used herman et al 2015 the three dimensional scattering scheme was then plotted for the robustness of each of the glyphs under all four climate scenarios and fig 6 was plotted the glyph coloring in each method is related to the robustness measure used green glyphs are relatively robust whereas red glyphs show poor robustness these figures have key arguments that will be discussed below fig 6 a to 6 c show relatively similar regions in the two robustness measurement methods the left most regions are highly robust areas with stricter plans for controlling pollution the outcome is impressive because regret based robustness and satisficing based robustness have fundamentally different criteria for measurement the observations of sameness in these two robustness assessment approaches confirm that stricter plans are more robust to deep uncertainties in fig 6 d the satisficing based robustness result displays all glyphs present weak robustness and it means adjacent to near the assumed future situation there is at least a single uncertainty parameter that leads all plans to fail in this case more results investigation revealed the existence of a single parameter leading all plans to fail with flow 0 2700 m 3 s velocity 20500 6 m day and bod decay rate 0 79 day 1 this scenario creates a severe vulnerability that results in all solutions failing to meet the reliability constraints in the dam reservoir the regret based robustness method studied in this research did not discover this critical vulnerability and this indicates that various robustness methods must be regarded in each research so if well characterized uncertainties had been considered a risky pollution control policy could be applied by the system that is more likely to pollute the reservoir it is possible to offer plans that are flexible to profoundly uncertain futures by carrying out comprehensive research and discovering profoundly uncertain situations hence the selection of robustness measurement methods can influence the process of decision making 4 4 vulnerability analysis the poor robustness indicated by satisficing based robustness under the hadcm3 a2 climate scenario show user defined criteria are not met in all scenarios in the future but a comprehensive study utilizing mordm can unveil the underlying causes of the vulnerabilities prim and cart are two methods to explore these vulnerabilities for recognizing various states of deeply uncertain factors that make the system vulnerable both prim and cart implement a scenario discovery lempert et al 2008 these two methods have been used to identify key vulnerabilities leading to failures in all four climate scenarios the prim aims to identify areas of uncertainty with an above average portion of uncertainty parameterizations leading to vulnerabilities friedman and fisher 1999 and represents it as a hyperbox the red boxes indicate the range of uncertainty parameters leading to the polluted lake on the other hand the cart method subdivides the space of uncertainty recursively into partitions representing less and more frequent vulnerabilities breiman et al 1984 fig 7 a to 7 d show the results of the scenario discovery using the prim method under all four climate scenarios similarly fig 8 a to 8 d illustrate vulnerabilities ranges identified by the cart method the following cart diagrams are produced under each of the four climate scenarios in the tree diagram when x y is positive follow the left branch and otherwise follow the right branch the two numbers shown in each partition represent the number of polluted scenarios the left number and unpolluted scenarios the right number it should be noted that the single parameterization leading all plans to fail with flow 0 2700 m 3 s velocity 20500 6 m day and bod decay rate 0 79 day 1 is accurately assorted as polluted by cart as depicted in fig 8 d however prim was unable to represent the value of kr in its uncertainty range so it is offered using these two methods together if the more detailed analysis is required 5 conclusion the model framework presented in this study combines mordm with hydrological modeling to recognize robust waste load allocation strategies under four climate scenarios in the future and it contains several parts first the selected aogcm data were down scaled by the lars wg statistical model in order to predict temperature and precipitation based on climate change s effects the utilized models in this study are hadcm3 and echam5 om which are applied under two scenarios a2 and b1 and in one period 2080 2099 the results showed an increase in temperature in all scenarios and a decrease in precipitation in some scenarios or an increase in the other ones also the capability of the model to simulate was approved in the next step by entering these climate data and digital elevation maps soil type and slope classification into the swat model the runoff and bod values were simulated and validated in 2080 2099 the results indicated an increase in bod and a decrease in the runoff in all scenarios then the simulated data were introduced as well characterized input parameters to openmordm software and the objective functions were configured using borg moea the best waste load allocation scenarios for each source of contaminants near the river were generated so that the level of bod at the junction of three rivers with the dam reservoir dam entrance remains less than the standard value of 5 mg l further investigation of generated design alternatives in the hadcm3 b1 echam5 om b1 echam5 om a2 and hadcm3 a2 climate scenarios respectively showed more critical conditions reduction in glyphs and reliability which were conforming the swat and lars wg outputs because they revealed flow was decreasing and temperature and pollutant concentration was increasing in the next step all of these glyphs robustness waste load allocation plan was evaluated and during the previous climate scenario ordering there was a decrease in the robustness of the answers finally both prim and cart methods were used to identify key vulnerabilities and it was found that in order to avoid vulnerable situations high values of water velocity and low values of the bod decay rate and flow should not be taken into account since these are relatively uncontrollable features of the system in the formulation of the problem our findings propose ex post evaluation guidance in this study for most states the optimal pollution control plans are satisfying except for when flow and bod decay rate are low and the water velocity is high one of the advantages of the cart method is generating a decision tree allowing researchers managers to detect partitions representing a desired misclassification ratio and deduce particular ex post evaluations guidance for example as shown in fig 8 b if the system is monitored to ensure that kr is greater than 0 8 then only 11 of the remaining plans would be exposed to failure if the system characteristics break these evaluations guidance then additional mordm analysis and problem formulations are required to achieve satisfactory designs in addition distinguishing key factors of vulnerability tells researchers managers where more examination could be advantageous finally all high robustness glyphs that were outside the range of vulnerability were selected as the most robust allocation scenarios in the future in other words the best measurements that must be implemented by stakeholders to avoid the pollution are the solutions that first satisfy the functions and constraints of the problem green glyphs in fig 5 and secondly have the robustness of about one under both regret and satisficing approaches green glyphs in fig 6 also parameters that have uncertainty should not be in the red range in prim boxes fig 7 and in the cart diagrams should be considered as unpolluted scenarios fig 8 one of the other findings also designates that the effectiveness of the model framework can be affected by stakeholders with arbitrary design decisions and result in the failure of even the most robust water allocation strategies under future climate change advancing a robust water allocation scenario in a river basin that suffers from water contamination needs water resource managers and climate change researchers to clearly define the vulnerabilities of their methods and climate change of their case study in the future declaration of competing interest the authors

5343,in recent years uncertainties in climate change have made the allocation of waste load a severe challenge this research develops a new model framework integrating a soil and water assessment tool swat for hydrological simulation of the river basin borg many objective evolutionary algorithm borg moea for optimization and a software for many objective robust decision making openmordm to minimize these uncertainties and identifying the most robust waste load allocation plans resisting the impact of system uncertainties this framework has been applied to the golgol river basin iran which is the main source of the ilam dam water supply in this study first temperature and precipitation were predicted in 2080 2099 then the swat model was used to simulate runoff and biochemical oxygen demand bod afterward by specifying the objective functions the borg moea produced the most optimal waste load allocation scenarios in the driest month of the future august so that the amount of bod in the dam reservoir remains less than 5 mg l in the next step the robustness of the solutions analyzed using openmordm then the results were analyzed using the patient rule induction method prim and classification and regression tree cart methods to identify the system vulnerability domains and minimizing false positives through the analysis four climate scenarios have been used to explain how the methodological selection of them affects the resulting candidate planning solutions the results indicated that individual design selections from the water managers or researchers could influence the efficacy of the model framework which in turn results in failure of the most robust waste load allocation strategies under future climate change keywords climate change robust decision making borg many objective evolutionary algorithm deep uncertainty scenario discovery golgol river basin 1 introduction lately various approaches have been developed to address the uncertainties associated with water resources management looking for the most robust design alternatives that minimize deviation from future plans is one of the most critical elements in water resources management this challenge is exacerbated by deep uncertainties so that the set of all possible future events as well as their associated probability distributions themselves contain uncertainties though many robustness frameworks have expanded lately include information gap decision theory ben haim 2004 decision scaling brown et al 2012 brown 2010 many objective robust decision making lempert 2002 kasprzyk et al 2013 lempert et al 2013 2006 lempert and collins 2007 groves and lempert 2007 weaver et al 2013 however various researches have studied and organized ordinary methodological elections in robustness focused decision support frameworks dittrich et al 2016 herman et al 2015 kwakkel and haasnoot 2019 maier et al 2016 among all these approaches mordm is vastly superior in implementing interactive visual analytics to distinguish proper answers trade offs recognition among various plans and evaluate their operation under the influence of deep uncertainties this method has so far been used to solve several water management issues singh et al 2015 problem formulation is the first stage in mordm in which the operation goals the specific uncertainties and the computational model are received from the beneficiaries furthermore critical constraints or other assumptions of the operation of the system are expressed in the next step the previous stage becomes a multi objective search to create design alternatives for the problem for determining the robust performance rules of a water supply system kang ren et al 2019 utilized the mordm framework the uncertainty analysis and multi objective optimization tools were employed first to show the trade offs between the conflicting objectives and second reveal the sensitive factors for the possible states of the system results determined that the robust operating rules offer significant insights into the hurdles posed by deep uncertainties and provide a management template for decision making on climate change and complicated human activities moallemi et al 2019 examined two frameworks epoch era analysis and robust decision making they deduced that the supremacy of each framework is not inevitable and depends on the circumstances and the problem while robust decision making is a more impressing framework under contested and obscure information about the future epoch era analysis can operate better when stakeholder knowledge about the future provides a deliberative specification of future scenarios trindade et al 2017 developed a multi stakeholder mordm framework to better account for deeply uncertain factors when recognizing collaborative drought management strategies their results revealed that appropriately designing adaptive risk of failure action triggers needed stressing them with a broad sample of deeply uncertain factors in the computational search condition of mordm the results from their research had a general benefit for areas where neighboring municipalities can profit from joint regional water portfolio planning newly multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas reed et al 2013 have been considered in water resources management these algorithms have been advanced to obtain the most suitable trade off answers instead of gaining a solution that can optimize all objectives concurrently coello coello et al 2007 moeas can explore multiple pareto optimal results in a profoundly complicated search space because of their capability to employ the identities of recombinant answers zitzler and thiele 1999 for a complex allocation system moeas provide the optimization output as an approximate set of pareto answers instead of a single best solution as managers portfolio preferences diverged as trade off information increased smith et al 2019 choosing the most robust solutions among these alternatives creates new challenges for policymakers previous studies have employed a variety of methods to select the robust alternatives in water resources management among them are geometric angle based pruning algorithm sudeng and wattanapongsakorn 2014 visually interactive decision making and design using evolutionary multi objective optimization video kollat and reed 2007 and mordm kasprzyk et al 2013 yan et al 2017 advanced a model framework combining mordm and biophysical modeling their case study was the pearl river basin prb china where to reduce saltwater intrusion in the dry season adequate flow to the delta was needed before recognizing and evaluating robust water allocation plans for the future the performance of ten ultra modern moeas was assessed for allocating water in the prb the borg moea which is a self adaptive optimization algorithm had superior achievement through the historical periods therefore it was elected to create new water allocation plans for the future 2079 2099 the study noted that the framework could work inadequately because of unpredictable climate change influences on water resources the purpose of this paper is to advance a model framework that combines many objective robust decision making with hydrological modeling to identify robust waste load allocation plans under climate change through these analyses four climate scenarios have been adopted to demonstrate how the methodological choice of them changes the resulting candidate planning solutions in this study the openmordm is utilized which is an open source application of mordm in the r programming language openmordm provides a platform for constructive decision support enabling analysts to interactively identify promising options and possible vulnerabilities while balancing contrasting objectives hadka et al 2015 r language was chosen because of its widespread use in environmental modeling and access to pre built analytical and statistical packages selected in addition to the preceding forecasting future climate change is also subject to uncertainty dessai and hulme 2007 one of the effects of climate change is on hydrological cycles which result in changing flow and discharge of rivers these factors cause changes in the transmission and distribution of pollutants in the environment and generally affect the quantity and quality of water all of these changes will introduce uncertainties that will pose significant challenges for water resource policymakers and managers for example when 20 general circulation models gcms were employed to create 39 runs of the 21st century for the murray darling basin in lim and roderick 2009 study the results indicated that 22 runs showed growth in yearly mean precipitation by the end of the 21st century while 17 runs were showing this decline robust optimization was practiced by mortazavi naeini et al 2015 to protect bulk water supply quality in an urban area against drought and climate change uncertainties and measured the amount of potential evapotranspiration pet and future rainfall for the 23 gcms obtained from a previous study csiro bom 2007 the multi site stochastic model was used to generate 10 000 50 year replicates of daily precipitation and pet based on these values it should be noted that just one emission scenario a1f1 was involved in their study culley et al 2016 expanded a bottom up framework to determine the maximum operational acceptance capacity of water resource systems regarding the space of future climate exposure which was based on seven gcms and six regional climate models under three representative concentration pathways rcps there is no agreement on what will occur in the future climate change and this will cause problems with making decisions for managing water resources efficiently uncertainty about future weather forecasts is unlikely to diminish significantly in the near future for managing water resources under uncertainty in climate change it is essential to implement forecasting for a variety of emission scenarios resulting from multiple gcms pierce et al 2009 teutschbein et al 2015 the remainder of the paper is structured as follows in section 2 the model framework has been defined including models and datasets utilized in this paper the golgol river basin iran has been presented in section 3 as a case study conclusion in section 4 contains lessons learned from this study and proposals for the future 2 methodology 2 1 model framework fig 1 depicted the model framework combining various modeling tools and data employed in this research this complex framework has a significant role as a tool to facilitate robust waste load allocation in the golgol river basin which includes a model for generating random climate data lars wg a hydrological model swat a state of the art optimization algorithm borg moea and an open source software openmordm to study the effects of climate change on various systems in future periods the value of climate variables should be first simulated in the future using tools known as climate models models of the various components of the climate system may be coupled to produce increasingly complex models coupled atmosphere ocean models including such parameterized physical processes are called atmosphere ocean general circulation models aogcms currently the most reliable tools for simulating the climate variables and producing the climate scenarios are aogcms which are based on the physical laws describing the dynamics of atmosphere and ocean expressed by mathematical equations mitchell 2003 wilby and harris 2006 ipcc 2013 however these models have the output of climate parameters on a vast spatial and temporal scale therefore it is necessary to produce and utilize downscaled models to use large scale climate models in this study in order to predict temperature and precipitation under climate change aogcm outputs were used and downscaled by lars wg two aogcm were selected after weighting to 10 of them hadley centre coupled model version 3 hadcm3 and european centre hamburg model version 5 echam5 om were selected with the highest weight gain two different greenhouse gas emission scenarios published by intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc were applied a2 a very heterogeneous world with continuously increasing global population and regionally oriented economic growth that is more fragmented and slower than in other scenarios and b1 a convergent world with the same global population as in the a1 storyline but with rapid changes in economic structures toward a service and information economy with reductions in material intensity and the introduction of clean and resource efficient technologies in order to ensure the capability of the model to forecast long term variables and the accuracy of the model results the observed data were entered into the software and the model reproduced the data in the baseline period to ensure the homogeneity of the data used the run test was utilized and the results were in the range of 95 confidence interval a baseline scenario for the statistical period of 1986 2010 was run and time series related to minimum temperature maximum temperature and precipitation for ilam station were produced daily then by using the correlation coefficient r2 mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse equations the observed data were compared with the data generated by the model concordance of statistical specifications between observational data and reproduced data designated that the model will be able to generate temperature and precipitation data for future periods with low uncertainty however it should be noted that this framework can be set for any other future period then these forecasted outputs were utilized to run a hydrological model chain 1 next the swat model used to simulate daily bod and daily runoff of the river and the outputs calibrated by swat cup software calibration and uncertainty analysis in this study was performed using the sequential uncertainty fitting 2 sufi 2 algorithm in swat cup software in this method the measurement of uncertainty in modeling includes uncertainties in driving variables the concept of model parameters and measured data for this purpose the two factors are the index of the evaluation of the results p factor which is the percentage of measured data bracketed by the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu and r factor which is the average thickness of the 95ppu band divided by the standard deviation of the measured data sufi 2 tries to bracket most of the measured data with the smallest possible uncertainty band also two coefficients nash sutcliffe ns and correlation r2 were implemented to evaluate swat model calibration which their results indicated that the model was sufficient to simulate the parameters abbaspour et al 2007 the change factor method has also been used to observe the effect of climate change on the basin chain 2 after obtaining bod concentration values in the future 2080 2099 to predict the pollutant transport process the concentration was simulated from upstream to downstream using the streeter phelps relationship then by setting up objective functions the optimization algorithm borg moea produced the best waste allocation scenarios under well characterized uncertainty while still had been satisfying the objective function chain 3 afterward by implementing openmordm developed by hadka et al 2015 and changing the well characterized uncertainty into the deep uncertainty the robustness of each allocation plan measured chain 4 prim and cart were used to identify the values of the input parameters that made the system vulnerable chain 5 and finally the best waste load allocation scenarios were chosen chain 6 various robustness assessing methods are required due to their tendency towards ignoring outliers hadka et al 2015 a correct determination of thresholds for quantifying robustness is an important level in mordm and the continuation of the analysis depends on it proper thresholds may vary between stakeholders and attitudes based on constraints of the system or the operation level required herman et al 2015 developed two main categories of robustness measurement methods after lempert and collins 2007 regret and satisficing in general regret based robustness measures the deviation in system performance in profoundly uncertain scenarios in other words regret based robustness concentrates on the impact of choosing the wrong plans for future scenarios savage 1951 while satisficing based robustness determines the feasibility of the design according to the execution criteria set by the beneficiary the criteria are coded with a satisficing counter function which is set to 1 when all the conditions are satisfied and otherwise is 0 for satisficing based robustness feasibility is measured by a fraction of the scenarios that meet the criteria the functions are given as eqs 1 and 2 it should be noted that eq 1 assumes the maximization of all objective functions however if the minimizing of the objective function is considered then eq 1 should calculate the minimum objective value 1 r regret max i quantile s s f i x s sup y p f i y s f i x s 0 9 where quantile s s calculates the 90th percentile value within all scenarios p is the set of answers created by borg moea and sup y p identifies the best answer in p among scenarios the best answer here is calculated as the ideal point the ideal point in multi objective space gets the best result in each objective it should be noted that this point may not suit a realistic design rather it will be used as a higher limit on the best achievable output in each objective hadka et al 2015 2 r satisficing 1 s s s i s f x s 2 2 multi objective evolutionary algorithms selection evolutionary algorithms eas are a class of search and optimization algorithms developed based on natural evolution processes holland 1975 their capability to support a wide range of different answers has made ea a default option to solve multi objective problems in general the moea can be defined as follows 3 p t 1 s s v s v p t p t where p t denotes candidate answers at the tth iteration p t 1 is the new answer ss v and sv are the environment selection the genetic variation and variation selection operators respectively purshouse and fleming 2007 moeas are positively efficient in obtaining trade off answers for multi objective problems with opposing objectives coello coello et al 2007 over the past ten years however more than 20 moeas have been offered throughout a literature review on present ultra modern moeas that are highly efficient the borg moea which has been reported as an advanced and top performing algorithm has been selected the borg moea explicitly designed to deal with multi objective multimodal problems where our main concentration in the future will be on developing seriously challenging applications in the real world it combines є dominance a measure of convergence speed named є progress randomized restarts and auto adaptive multi operator recombination into a unified optimization framework kollat and reed 2006 hadka and reed 2012 hadka and reed 2013 reed et al 2013 hadka et al 2012 3 case study the study area in this research is golgol watershed with an area of 279 53 km2 in the ilam province iran it is one of the subbasins of the ilam dam and it is located between 46 16 36 and 46 38 32 eastern longitudes and between 33 23 46 and 33 38 12 northern latitudes fig 2 the maximum height of the basin is 2065 m its minimum height is 1052 m and the average height is 1578 m above sea level the average slope of the basin is 39 5 and the average precipitation of the basin is 416 mm 1994 2015 the golgol river is one of the most important rivers supplying the ilam dam it flows from east to west and enters the dam reservoir after passing through about 13 villages the golgol chaviz and emma rivers feed the ilam dam and the golgol river basin was only included in this research to consider the effect of the waste load of two other basins on the bod of the reservoir the problem formulation keeps the bod below 5 mg l saberi and niksokhan 2017 at the junction of these three rivers with the dam reservoir the golgol river alone provides 70 of this inflow to the dam therefore the water quality of the dam is under the vital influence due to changing in water quality and quantity of this river and as the ilam dam is the main water supplier of the ilam city the water quality of the river has a significant impact on the lives of the people of this province therefore it is necessary first to predict the changes in golgol river water quality and then to adopt a strategy for the proper allocation of pollutant emissions from pollutant sources to ensure the water quality of the dam reservoir in this research the amount of runoff and bod of the river is predicted under climate change since uncertainty has always been one of the challenges facing water resources engineering it has been tried to minimize the effects of this uncertainty by developing a framework and by identifying the scenarios that lead to failure ultimately the best scenario of waste load allocation is selected 4 formulation and results 4 1 formulating the optimization problem from lars wg and swat outputs it has been observed that because of climate change river flow fig 3 and rainfall fig 4 of the dry season are likely to decrease in the future within all climate scenarios this may result in decreasing the water quality of the dam reservoir by the increase in the concentration of bod discharge from upstream stakeholders table 1 so seeking an appropriate pollution strategy for bod discharge to prevent further contamination of the dam reservoir has led to four objectives formulation it should be pointed out that the river system has only been included in this research and the reservoir operating rules have not been considered these four objectives are minimizing bod concentration in the dam reservoir maximizing inertia maximizing reliability and minimizing cost these objective functions are as follows minimizing bod in the dam reservoir the first objective function measures the mean bod concentration during each time step and scenario 4 f bod 1 s s s max x t s where s and t are the collections of all sampled scenarios and time steps daily here respectively and xt s is the amount of contamination in the reservoir at time t in scenario s inertia the second objective function computes the portion of time periods where the day to day variation in permissible contamination at at 1 stays under a specified threshold τ 5 f inertia 1 t 1 n r 1 n 1 n r 1 t 1 t i a t a t 1 τ where nr is the number of reaches of the river i is an indicator function having the value 1 if the requirements are satisfied and 0 otherwise at is the concentration of bod emitted by the stakeholders in day t at 1 is the concentration of bod emitted by the stakeholders in day t 1 and τ is the permissible change threshold which set to 20 in this research since a pollution control strategy has been developing in this study to impose restrictions on anthropogenic pollution emitted by the stakeholders ideally changes in permissible pollution are below the specified limit however drastic changes are burdening policymakers to revise existing policies and infrastructure so that these programs may change before the passing of their projected lifetime inertia value of 1 is ideal designating that there is no need for significant modifications in environmental planning policies reliability the third objective calculates the portion of days in which the amount of contamination in the dam reservoir remains under the critical bod threshold 5 mg l of the reservoir xcrit 6 f reliability 1 s t s s t t i x t s x crit where xcrit is the critical bod threshold for the dam reservoir if the pollutant exceeds the critical level bacterial growth and oxygen consumption will accelerate and oxygen levels may decrease to a level that can be fatal to the fish and other aquatic organisms accordingly a value of the reliability function near 1 0 is favored showing that the dam reservoir provides oxygen to fish and aquatic organisms throughout all times and within all scenarios the equation additionally introduces a severe constraint of f reliability 0 85 in the problem code the fourth objective is the economic function 7 f economic i 1 n c i t i where ti is the discharge purification percentage of the ith stakeholder n is the number of stakeholders throughout the study area and ci is the sum of the cost of penalties and treatment the cost function of treatment for discharges of industrial and municipal wastewater is obtained according to the relations 8 and 9 respectively in these relationships the t parameter is the percentage of organic matter removed the penalty function of violation of the standard is also calculated according to the relation 10 8 c o s t m 3 y e a r 0 5 t 3 0 73 t 2 0 09 t 0 02 9 c o s t m 3 y e a r 0 434 t 2 0 228 t 0 029 10 c o s t year 983 27 b o d bod std 2 37313 b o d bod std 4 2 producing water allocation plans in this step the output parameters of the swat and lars software have been used as the baseline parameters these basic default parameters represent predictable future scenarios under well characterized uncertainty creating a baseline result is a more careful examination of effects of the deep uncertainty and robustness then by the use of borg moea design alternatives have been generated for the allocation problem based on the objective functions a three dimensional scatter plot is applied to show the approximate pareto answers generated by borg moea base on baseline parameters furthermore a parallel coordinates plot also depicts the trade offs between performance objectives each line depicts an alternative design for controlling pollution the place where the line crosses each vertical axis represents the relevant objective value since the problem code determines the constraint f reliability 0 85 there are no answers with weaker reliability on the plot for the graphical representation of reliability a color palette is also determined which facilitates understanding of the relationships between objective functions all of those as mentioned earlier has been implemented for two aogcms hadcm3 and echam5 om under two emission scenarios a2 and b1 and the results for these scenarios are shown in figs 5 8 the three main axes include the average bod value in the dam reservoir the total cost of treatment and penalty and the inertia and the color of the glyphs spherical markers shown in the scatter plot represent reliability each glyph represents a 10 day pollution control strategy for five stakeholders a set of 50 decision variables that are approximately pareto optimal and as the range of reliability green glyphs represent 100 reliability and red glyphs 86 reliability it should be noted that the ideal point is determined by a star in the scatter plot in all figures after all the above steps the next step is to measure the robustness of each of these points however since the objective functions conflict with each other the ideal point may not be achievable from above scatter and a parallel coordinate plots it can be concluded that first the inertia does not affect the bod variables cost and reliability as the figures show that the inertia plate at each intersection level intersects the graph the result being similar to the other intersections which indicates the dependency of this objective function to cost and bod functions also since the color of the glyphs does not change in depth this parameter does not affect reliability as well second for the lower bod values the cost function increases indicating a higher wastewater treatment to meet the problem constraint and therefore a higher treatment cost it is also expected that in the high amounts for bod there will still be an increase in the cost due to penalty while as the bod increases as shown the answers are in the lower cost range due to the lower purification cost but no penalties yet however upon entry into the penalty area the reliability level drops significantly as the stakeholder is evacuating too much contamination also reliability loss does not satisfy the problem s constraint so there is no glyph to this on the 3d plots third according to the outputs of the lars wg and swat models in the hadcm3 b1 echam5 om b1 echam5 om a2 and hadcm3 a2 climate scenarios respectively the river flow decreases and the initial bod concentration and temperature increases which the decrease in the number of highly reliable solutions in fig 5 a to 5 d also confirms the increase in bod in the river due to climate change also results in more waste load treatment by stakeholders to meet the problem constraint which increases the cost of treatment this increase in cost is well evident in the output of scattering schemes after all the above steps the next step is to measure the robustness of each of these points 4 3 robustness assessment of water allocation plans until this part of the study swat output data were used as baseline parameters under well characterized uncertainties in the future however the uncertainties surrounding environmental systems in the real world are often insufficiently described the probability distribution that indicates the uncertainty of the critical parameters maybe profoundly uncertain or the model inputs data may be concealed or just recognized to lie within a range of values then uncertain parameters such as river flow river s velocity and bod decay rate kr were modeled under deep uncertainty since the values of these parameters are profoundly uncertain a range of plausible values for any uncertainties that are also meaningful was defined and 1000 latin hypercube samples lhs were created randomly this random lhs output is a 1000 3 matrix next a new problem was defined by using each row of the generated matrix representing three values for the uncertainty variables the problem that was previously solved under well characterized initial values was examined with deeply uncertain parameters however as it has been explained before because of the uncertainties surrounding environmental systems in the real world the hydrological and geological pattern does not remain constant regret and satisficing methods pursue different goals to show uncertainty and the calculation of uncertainty will vary depending on which one of these methods is used herman et al 2015 the three dimensional scattering scheme was then plotted for the robustness of each of the glyphs under all four climate scenarios and fig 6 was plotted the glyph coloring in each method is related to the robustness measure used green glyphs are relatively robust whereas red glyphs show poor robustness these figures have key arguments that will be discussed below fig 6 a to 6 c show relatively similar regions in the two robustness measurement methods the left most regions are highly robust areas with stricter plans for controlling pollution the outcome is impressive because regret based robustness and satisficing based robustness have fundamentally different criteria for measurement the observations of sameness in these two robustness assessment approaches confirm that stricter plans are more robust to deep uncertainties in fig 6 d the satisficing based robustness result displays all glyphs present weak robustness and it means adjacent to near the assumed future situation there is at least a single uncertainty parameter that leads all plans to fail in this case more results investigation revealed the existence of a single parameter leading all plans to fail with flow 0 2700 m 3 s velocity 20500 6 m day and bod decay rate 0 79 day 1 this scenario creates a severe vulnerability that results in all solutions failing to meet the reliability constraints in the dam reservoir the regret based robustness method studied in this research did not discover this critical vulnerability and this indicates that various robustness methods must be regarded in each research so if well characterized uncertainties had been considered a risky pollution control policy could be applied by the system that is more likely to pollute the reservoir it is possible to offer plans that are flexible to profoundly uncertain futures by carrying out comprehensive research and discovering profoundly uncertain situations hence the selection of robustness measurement methods can influence the process of decision making 4 4 vulnerability analysis the poor robustness indicated by satisficing based robustness under the hadcm3 a2 climate scenario show user defined criteria are not met in all scenarios in the future but a comprehensive study utilizing mordm can unveil the underlying causes of the vulnerabilities prim and cart are two methods to explore these vulnerabilities for recognizing various states of deeply uncertain factors that make the system vulnerable both prim and cart implement a scenario discovery lempert et al 2008 these two methods have been used to identify key vulnerabilities leading to failures in all four climate scenarios the prim aims to identify areas of uncertainty with an above average portion of uncertainty parameterizations leading to vulnerabilities friedman and fisher 1999 and represents it as a hyperbox the red boxes indicate the range of uncertainty parameters leading to the polluted lake on the other hand the cart method subdivides the space of uncertainty recursively into partitions representing less and more frequent vulnerabilities breiman et al 1984 fig 7 a to 7 d show the results of the scenario discovery using the prim method under all four climate scenarios similarly fig 8 a to 8 d illustrate vulnerabilities ranges identified by the cart method the following cart diagrams are produced under each of the four climate scenarios in the tree diagram when x y is positive follow the left branch and otherwise follow the right branch the two numbers shown in each partition represent the number of polluted scenarios the left number and unpolluted scenarios the right number it should be noted that the single parameterization leading all plans to fail with flow 0 2700 m 3 s velocity 20500 6 m day and bod decay rate 0 79 day 1 is accurately assorted as polluted by cart as depicted in fig 8 d however prim was unable to represent the value of kr in its uncertainty range so it is offered using these two methods together if the more detailed analysis is required 5 conclusion the model framework presented in this study combines mordm with hydrological modeling to recognize robust waste load allocation strategies under four climate scenarios in the future and it contains several parts first the selected aogcm data were down scaled by the lars wg statistical model in order to predict temperature and precipitation based on climate change s effects the utilized models in this study are hadcm3 and echam5 om which are applied under two scenarios a2 and b1 and in one period 2080 2099 the results showed an increase in temperature in all scenarios and a decrease in precipitation in some scenarios or an increase in the other ones also the capability of the model to simulate was approved in the next step by entering these climate data and digital elevation maps soil type and slope classification into the swat model the runoff and bod values were simulated and validated in 2080 2099 the results indicated an increase in bod and a decrease in the runoff in all scenarios then the simulated data were introduced as well characterized input parameters to openmordm software and the objective functions were configured using borg moea the best waste load allocation scenarios for each source of contaminants near the river were generated so that the level of bod at the junction of three rivers with the dam reservoir dam entrance remains less than the standard value of 5 mg l further investigation of generated design alternatives in the hadcm3 b1 echam5 om b1 echam5 om a2 and hadcm3 a2 climate scenarios respectively showed more critical conditions reduction in glyphs and reliability which were conforming the swat and lars wg outputs because they revealed flow was decreasing and temperature and pollutant concentration was increasing in the next step all of these glyphs robustness waste load allocation plan was evaluated and during the previous climate scenario ordering there was a decrease in the robustness of the answers finally both prim and cart methods were used to identify key vulnerabilities and it was found that in order to avoid vulnerable situations high values of water velocity and low values of the bod decay rate and flow should not be taken into account since these are relatively uncontrollable features of the system in the formulation of the problem our findings propose ex post evaluation guidance in this study for most states the optimal pollution control plans are satisfying except for when flow and bod decay rate are low and the water velocity is high one of the advantages of the cart method is generating a decision tree allowing researchers managers to detect partitions representing a desired misclassification ratio and deduce particular ex post evaluations guidance for example as shown in fig 8 b if the system is monitored to ensure that kr is greater than 0 8 then only 11 of the remaining plans would be exposed to failure if the system characteristics break these evaluations guidance then additional mordm analysis and problem formulations are required to achieve satisfactory designs in addition distinguishing key factors of vulnerability tells researchers managers where more examination could be advantageous finally all high robustness glyphs that were outside the range of vulnerability were selected as the most robust allocation scenarios in the future in other words the best measurements that must be implemented by stakeholders to avoid the pollution are the solutions that first satisfy the functions and constraints of the problem green glyphs in fig 5 and secondly have the robustness of about one under both regret and satisficing approaches green glyphs in fig 6 also parameters that have uncertainty should not be in the red range in prim boxes fig 7 and in the cart diagrams should be considered as unpolluted scenarios fig 8 one of the other findings also designates that the effectiveness of the model framework can be affected by stakeholders with arbitrary design decisions and result in the failure of even the most robust water allocation strategies under future climate change advancing a robust water allocation scenario in a river basin that suffers from water contamination needs water resource managers and climate change researchers to clearly define the vulnerabilities of their methods and climate change of their case study in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
5344,it is important to investigate the potential impacts of global climate change on crop yield especially there have been limited relevant studies conducted in the cold regions such as northeast china this study investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of droughts on different growth stages of maize over northeast china during 1960 2016 and the effects of droughts on the climate induced yield of maize separated by the logistic regression model using standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei trend analysis methods rotated empirical orthogonal function wavelet method and hurst exponent the results indicated that 1 the spatiotemporal patterns of drought were identified at different growth stages and the changes in dryness wetness condition presented significant periodic oscillation on different time scales 2 the patterns of dryness wetness conditions and the changing characteristics of each sub region at the early growth eg and middle growth mg stages were similar 3 the future drought trends in most stations would be consistent with the past trends in addition to the wetting trend in the eastern and southern parts at the eg stage the whole study area would show a drying trend in future at other growth stages 4 the cross wavelet transform xwt was used to develop the changing relationships between climate induced yield of maize and the dryness wetness condition at different growth stages with obvious inter annual periodicities 5 for northeast china climatic factors that can affect the climate induced yield of maize are firstly temperature next precipitation and thirdly dryness wetness conditions keywords drought characteristics climate induced yield of maize wavelet method northeast china 1 introduction in the past few decades global warming has led to high temperature heat waves and extreme hydrological events such as floods and droughts e g spinoni et al 2015 tong et al 2019 umair et al 2019 which may significantly affect human life ecological environment agricultural production and economic development e g gan et al 2016 shi et al 2018 as is known drought is caused by the regional precipitation that is lower than normal value for a long term period and the occurrence of drought has seriously affected agricultural production kontgis et al 2019 economic development yu et al 2019 and regional water security nkomozepi and chung 2014 zhang et al 2019a as reported by food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations climate change will have great impacts on global crop yields and food security kontgis et al 2019 at present rain fed agriculture is still the dominant part of agriculture in china although the agricultural mechanization is keeping improving all the time dryness wetness conditions are the main factors affecting crops in rain fed areas in areas with long term unfavorable dryness wetness conditions the grain yield will inevitably be affected which can then threaten national food security therefore the topic of regional dryness wetness conditions has attracted the attention of a large number of scholars e g guo et al 2018 deng et al 2018 normally drought can be classified into four categories including meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought american meteorological society 2013 numerous drought indices have been developed based on different parameters for drought analysis including palmer drought severity index pdsi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei standardized precipitation index spi socioeconomic drought index sedi and so on e g shi et al 2018 mahmoudi et al 2019 shiru et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b for the application of these drought indices pdsi which is based on soil water balance has relatively high data requirements and it lacks the flexibility to adapt to the inherent multi scale nature of drought spei and spi both have multi scale characteristics and can be used to identify meteorological drought characteristics however spi identifies drought only by precipitation but spei is an improvement of the spi that includes potential evaporation in the process of water deficit calculation yao et al 2018 since this study mainly focuses on meteorological drought during the whole crop growth period spei is selected to characterize the drought events in the study area in order to analyze the impacts of climate change on crop yield both statistical and numerical models can be used numerical models were widely used in simulating the main process of crop growth and development e g world food studies wofost model lecerf et al 2019 decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat boonwichai et al 2019 and agricultural production systems simulator apsim bahri et al 2019 these process based models were typically developed and tested using experimental trials and thus could offer the distinct advantage of leveraging decades of research on crop physiology and reproduction agronomy and soil science among other disciplines lobell and burke 2010 however these models required a large amount of input data on cultivars management and soil conditions which unfortunately are not available in some regions of the world even if such data are available to calibrate these models can be very difficult because there are a lot of uncertain parameters iizumi et al 2009 in contrast statistical models are more commonly used because they are less data demanding are based on historical production and some basic climate data such as temperature and precipitation during the growing season which are readily available the main advantages of statistical models are their limited reliance on field calibration data and their transparent assessment of model uncertainties zhao et al 2015 in addition the input data requirement of statistical models is modest but if well developed they can still provide useful results in recent years wavelet analysis has been widely used to analyze the characteristics of geophysical time series such as climatic and hydrological data tan et al 2017 tong et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 wavelet methods can capture the temporal changes of a time series and the intermittent characteristics of the coherence between two time series okonkwo and demoz 2014 applied wavelet methods to teleconnect large scale climate patterns such as enso el niño southern oscillation to crop yield tian et al 2015 was the first to apply wavelet methods to assess the impacts of climatic factors on crop production which has enhanced our understanding on crop yield and its potential predictability however there are still only limited studies that apply wavelet methods to analyze the relationship between crop yield and droughts to our knowledge this study is likely the first to introduce wavelet methods to assess the impact of droughts on climate induced yield heilongjiang province is one of the most important agricultural provinces in china it is also one of the three major black lands in the world in addition heilongjiang province is located in the highest latitude and coldest region of china the increase of temperature in northeast china is much larger than the mainland china zhou et al 2020 the main crops in heilongjiang province are maize rice soybean etc among which the sowing area of maize accounts for 1 3 of the whole province s grain sowing area moreover it is worth noting that the province s maize yield accounts for 1 10 of china s maize yields consequently the food security of heilongjiang province is crucial to the stability and development of china s national food security the objectives of this study are 1 to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of dryness wetness conditions and the relevant periodic features in a specific period 2 to explore the long term drought trend in the future 3 to firstly introduce cross wavelet transform xwt to analyze the relationships between drought and climate induced yield of maize in northeast china and 4 to provide scientific basis for better understanding of china s grain production in response to climate change especially in the cold regions 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area heilongjiang province is located in the cold region of northeast china 121 11 e 135 05 e 43 26 n 53 33 n see fig 1 it is the highest latitude province in china it borders russia in the east and north inner mongolia in the west and jilin province in the south the area accounts for 4 9 of the total land area in china from east to west it can be divided into humid area semi humid area and semi arid area it has a temperate continental monsoon climate with distinct seasons i e hot and rainy summer but cold and dry winter fu et al 2018 due to the topographic reasons shu et al 2007 and the role of the atmospheric circulation wang et al 2018 climate differences in various regions of heilongjiang province are obvious 2 2 research data the meteorological data on daily time scale in the study area can be downloaded for free from the chinese meteorological data network http data cma cn the chinese meteorological data network strictly controls the data quality before the data are released to the public this includes checking for incorrect codes and records as well as homogenizing the data in this study the following variables i e precipitation temperature maximum average and minimum temperatures wind speed relative humidity average air pressure and sunshine duration are selected as most of these stations were built in the late 1950 s and the data are relatively complete after 1960 therefore only the data from 1960 are selected in this study to ensure that the lengths of the datasets from different stations are consistent the missing data are interpolated by the data of the adjacent stations in the same year however stations with serious lack of data i e more than twenty years are excluded directly after this elimination there are 26 meteorological stations left with complete daily observations from 1960 to 2016 the monthly values can be derived from the daily values monthly precipitation is the sum of the daily precipitation in a month while monthly average temperature is the mean of the daily temperature in a month the data of the per unit area yield of maize from 1986 to 2016 can be obtained from heilongjiang statistical yearbook issued by heilongjiang statistical bureau http www hlj gov cn zwfb zfcbw hljtjnj among the 13 prefecture level cities in heilongjiang province the agricultural production levels of daxinganling hegang shuangyashan and qitaihe are relatively backward leading to the relatively low maize yield for example in 2016 the maize yield of heilongjiang province was about 45 08 million tons while the total maize yield of these four areas was about 3 1 million tons only about 7 of the total therefore other nine prefecture level cities i e harbin qiqihar jiamusi jixi daqing mudanjiang yichun suihua and heihe were selected to analyze the impacts of drought on maize yield in subsection 3 4 in addition the land use data was obtained from the national remote sensing monitoring database of resources and environment data cloud platform of chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn in order to facilitate the study the whole growth period of maize was divided into three stages according to the planting rules of maize in northeast china therefore according to the method for dividing the growth period of maize in this region which was proposed by yang et al 2015 the early growth eg stage of maize is from march to may that including land consolidation and sowing maize usually silks in the middle of july so the seedling silking period corresponds to the middle growth mg stage of maize from may to july the later growth lg stage is used to represent the silking maturity period from july to september 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei in this study the drought index spei proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 is used to characterize the regional changes in dryness wetness conditions of northeast china the index uses the water deficit d computed from precipitation p and potential evaporation pet to track the water loss and gain which can judge the dryness and wetness water deficit d i is equal to p i pet i where i represent i th month then d i is normalized with a log logistic probability distribution to obtain spei the probability distribution function of d i series is as follows vicente serrano et al 2010 chen et al 2019 1 f x 1 α x γ β 1 where α β γ are scale shape and location parameters respectively then with f x spei can be easily obtained as the standardized value of f x 2 spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 3 w 2 l n p f o r p 0 5 where p is the probability of exceeding a determined d value p 1 f x for p greater than 0 5 p is replaced by 1 p w 2 l n 1 p and the sign of spei is reversed the constants are fixed i e c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 d 3 0 001308 the method follows the study of vicente serrano et al 2010 and the calculation process of the grades of meteorological drought in china s national climate center gb t 20481 2017 2 3 2 rotated empirical orthogonal function reof lorenz 1956 was likely the first to use the empirical orthogonal function eof to analyse key features of complex spatiotemporal meteorological variables the eigenvectors obtained after the decomposition are orthogonal to each other and the associated spatial modes can effectively reflect different spatial characteristics of climate elements it is widely used in the analysis of meteorological variables e g lena et al 2014 zhang et al 2015a in reof the original eof matrix is rotated on the basis of the maximum variance criterion to make the high load vector field in the same spatial mode more evenly distributed the variance of the load is maximized after the rotation which makes the high load area more prominent as a result the dominant space pattern represented by each principal component can be clearly distinguished guo et al 2018 after the rotation the spatial distribution of the high load vector field is clearer and the variation in time is more stable huang et al 2015 therefore reof is applied to the spei time series and the reof analysis includes spatial patterns reofs time series rotated principal components rpcs and eigenvalues 2 3 3 trend analysis methods in this study the mann kendall mk rank correlation test recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo is used to analyze the trend and abrupt change of the spei time series the mk trend analysis method is a nonparametric statistical test method widely used in the fields of meteorology hydrology and sedimentology e g zhang et al 2015b shi et al 2017 in this study the mk trend analysis method following the method in the study of shi and wang 2015 is used the normal statistic z is used to indicate the strength of the trend z greater than 0 represents an upward trend z less than 0 a decreasing trend and z 0 no obvious trend detected a critical value at the 95 significance level is selected for the abrupt change test the mk trend analysis is designed to detect the presence of statistically significant trends but not the slope of the trend which can be estimated using the sen s slope method sen 1968 shi and chen 2018 both the mk trend analysis and sen s slope method are used to analyze the trend of the spei time series 2 3 4 yields separation method crop yield y can be expressed as the sum of management climate contribution and random error among them crop yield caused by crop management mainly depends on productivity and the development level of science and technology climatic induced yield yc is also known as fluctuation yield which mainly reflects the yield fluctuation caused by climate change the specific calculation is as follows 4 y y t y c y r where y t is crop management induced yields y c is climatic induced yields y r is random error zhao et al 2015 found that the logistic regression model can optimally separate the spring maize yield in northeast china to crop management induced yields and climate induced yield in northeast china therefore in this study the logistic regression model is adopted to separate the per unit area yield of maize to climate induced yield when simulating the yield change y t tends to a limited amount y 0 which is a local maximum possible yield logistic equation is calculated as follows 5 y t y 0 1 e x p c d t where t is the elapsed time c and d are parameters taking logarithm on both sides of the equation 6 ln y 0 y t 1 c d t by replacing yt with the observed y the parameters c and d can be estimated using the least square method then the climate induced yield yc is estimated as 7 y c y y t 2 3 5 wavelet method common wavelet transform includes continuous wavelet transform cwt and discrete wavelet transform dwt cwt is mainly used in time frequency analysis and filtering of time localized frequency components while dwt is mainly used in signal denoising compared with cwt there are three main limitations of dwt shift sensitivity poor directionality and lack of phase information altunkaynak and ozger 2016 in addition cwt is more suitable for signal feature extraction and is widely used in geophysical research as a tool of time series intermittent wave feature extraction grinsted et al 2004 therefore in order to obtain the amplitude and phase information of time series cwt is selected in this study cwt decomposes time series from time domain to time frequency domain for a time series xn n 1 2 n cwt is defined as 8 w n s n 0 n 1 x n φ n n δ t s where n is the localized time index n is the time conversion index s is the scale δ t is the sampling period n is the number of points in the time series φ t represents a mother wavelet function and indicates the complex conjugate the wavelet power spectrum is defined as wn s 2 the wavelet power spectrum reflects the fluctuation of various scales contained in the time series and the characteristics of strength changing with scales the scale at the corresponding peak is the main time scale of the time series which is used to reflect the main period of the change in the time series however the main period needs to be tested for significance as geophysical time series usually have the characteristics of red noise red noise is often used as background spectrum to test the wavelet spectrum torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 tian et al 2015 when wavelet transform is applied to a time series the choice of mother wavelet function is particularly important an orthogonal wavelet function is generally used in dwt while a non orthogonal wavelet function can be used either in dwt or cwt hsu and li 2010 schaller et al 2017 in order to obtain smooth and continuous wavelet amplitude non orthogonal wavelet function is suitable in addition to obtain the amplitude and phase information of time series complex wavelet should be selected because complex wavelet has virtual part which can express the phase change well commonly used mother wavelet function includes harr mexican hat morlet etc morlet wavelet which is non orthogonal is a complex wavelet adjusted by gaussian function therefore this study selects morlet wavelet as mother wavelet the function of which can be written as 9 φ 0 η π 1 4 e j ω 0 η e η 2 2 where η is the nondimensional time factor ω 0 is the nondimensional frequency in addition in this study cross wavelet transform xwt based on morlet wavelet is applied to investigate the co relationship between two time series the cross wavelet spectrum generated by the complex conjugate of two time series represents the covariance correlation between two time series for two time series xn and y n their xwt can be defined as wxy wxwy their cross wavelet power is defined as wxy the complex argument arg wxy can be regarded as the local relative phase of these two time series in the time frequency field the theoretical distribution of the cross wavelet power of x n and y n with their background power spectra p k x and p k y torrence and compo 1998 is expressed as follows 11 d w n x w n y s δ x δ y p z v p v p k x p k y where z v p is the confidence level associated with the probability p for a probability distribution function defined by the square root of the two χ2 distributions for a more detailed description of cwt and xwt refer to the studies of torrence and compo 1998 and grinsted et al 2004 2 3 6 hurst exponent the hurst h exponent was proposed by a british hydrologist called hurst to analyze the long term temporal dependency of a time series hurst 1951 and is widely used in the field of hydrometeorology e g zhang et al 2012 tatli 2015 long term persistence ltp also referred to as the hurst phenomenon has been detected in many hydrologic time series particularly in river flows e g szolgayova et al 2014 tan and gan 2017 the h value lower than 0 5 indicates a lack of ltp while the h value larger than 0 5 indicates the presence of ltp when 0 h less than 0 5 it describes an anti persistent process which indicated anti trend of the time series in the future the smaller the h value the stronger the anti persistent when 0 5 h less than 1 it describes a dynamically persistent or trend reinforcing series may partly represent the presence of long term memories and non stationary characteristics in a process the larger the h value the stronger the long term persistency tong et al 2018 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal characteristics of drought reof was used to analyze the spei time series of maize at different growth stages the satisfactory cumulative variance percentage should be above 60 zhang et al 2015a fu et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 the cumulative variances were 77 35 65 76 and 69 42 respectively which indicated that it was reasonable to choose 4 rpcs at different growth stages the distribution of all reofs patterns is shown in fig 3 the rotational load represents the correlation between the spei sequence and its corresponding rpcs during the study period when dividing the sub region experiencing similar dryness wetness changes the threshold of the rotational load above 0 6 was considered to be reasonable li and wang 2016 the areas with high load mean that they experienced similar drought variability in the study period at the eg stage the high load of reof1 and reof2 patterns see fig 3 a and b were mainly distributed in the west and southeast of heilongjiang province in reof3 pattern fig 3 c the areas with high load value were mainly distributed in the central part of heilongjiang province while the areas with low load value are mainly distributed in the northwest and southeast in reof4 pattern fig 3 d the high load area is mainly distributed in the northern part of heilongjiang province while the low load area is mainly distributed in the southern part at the mg stage the dryness wetness conditions in the study area were different in spatial distribution in the reof1 4 patterns fig 3 e h the high load areas were in the western part the central part the southeast part and the northern part of heilongjiang province respectively at the lg stage the dryness wetness conditions in the study area were different in spatial distribution in the reof1 4 patterns fig 3 i l the areas with high load values were in the western part the southeast part the northern part and the southwest part of heilongjiang province respectively in summary reof could divide the dryness wetness conditions in the study area at different growth stages into four different sub regions with different dry and wet changing patterns to investigate the temporal characteristics of drought the trend analysis methods were used and the statistical results of corresponding rotated principal components at different growth stages are shown in fig 4 at the eg stage uf value was below 0 before 1972 but above 0 during 1972 1975 moreover uf value has been below 0 since the abrupt change in 1975 and the trend of decrease between 1998 and 2007 was significant indicating the continuous drought in western heilongjiang province from 1975 to 2007 yu et al 2019 however there was an increasing trend after 2007 fig 4 a as shown in fig 4 b there was an increasing trend from 1960 to 1975 from 1975 to 2000 uf was always below 0 but there was a non significant decreasing trend after 2000 uf showed an increasing trend indicating that the southeastern part of heilongjiang province showed a wetting trend and a slight easing of the drying trend the change of uf in the rpc3 is similar to that of the first two patterns however the time series decreased significantly between 1964 and 1968 after 1993 it began to show an increasing trend especially a significant increasing trend after 2012 fig 4 c it indicated that the central part of heilongjiang province presented a trend of wetting between 1960 and 1975 the uf values were always below 0 and the uf values fluctuated around 0 from 1975 to 1995 indicating that the northern part of heilongjiang province was in an unstable state of alternating dryness and wetness after 1996 there was a decreasing trend fig 4 d at the mg stage uf value turned negative around 1964 an abrupt change occurred around 2008 but the increasing trend was not significant fig 4 e the prc2 showed a decrease trend from 1960 to 1986 in 1966 1982 the uf value was less than 1 96 which indicated a significant decreasing trend from 1986 to 1998 there was an increasing trend and an abrupt change occurred around 1989 but the increasing trend was not significant there was a non significant decreasing after 1998 fig 4 f the prc3 showed a decreasing trend from 1960 to 1980 from 1980 to 1997 there was a non significant increasing trend and an abrupt change occurred around 1984 there was a non significant decreasing trend after 1997 and the abrupt change occurred around 1998 fig 4 g between 1960 and 1975 the uf values were always below 0 in addition the uf values always fluctuated around the 0 line between 1975 and 1995 indicating that the northern part of heilongjiang province was in an unstable state of alternating dryness and wetness fig 4 h at the lg stage the changes of rpc1 and rpc2 were similar there was a decreasing trend between 1963 and 1985 with a significant decreasing trend between 1975 and 1985 i e uf value was less than 1 96 by contrast an increasing trend was found during 1986 1994 rpc1 and rpc2 occurred an abrupt change around 2012 and 1992 respectively fig 4 i j and rpc3 had a non significant increasing trend between 1960 and 1995 the abrupt change occurred around 1995 and 2007 there was a decreasing trend during 1995 2007 however after 2007 there was an increasing trend fig 4 k from 1960 to 1980 rpc4 showed a decreasing trend among which the dryness and wetness alternations from 1967 to 1978 were unstable abrupt change occurred around 2005 i e a non significant increasing trend during 1981 2004 but a non significant decreasing trend during 2005 2015 fig 4 l 3 2 periodic features of drought morlet wavelet analysis was used to analyze rpcs at different growth stages the continuous wavelet power spectrum of each rpc is shown in fig 5 at the eg stage rpc1 had significant periodicities of 4 7a and 2 4a during 1979 1990 and 2001 2010 respectively fig 5 a rpc2 had the same significant periodicity around 3a during 2004 2010 fig 5 b while rpc3 had significant periodicities of 2 4a and 3a during 1971 1980 and 2003 2010 respectively fig 5 c for rpc4 significant periodicities of 2 4a was found during 1991 1996 and 1999 2008 fig 5 d at the mg stage rpc1 had significant periodicities of 12 14a 2 4a and 24 28a during 1964 1972 2002 2010 and 1977 2006 respectively fig 5 e during 1982 1985 2005 2011 and 1969 2011 rpc2 had periodicities of 2a 3 4a and 24 32a respectively fig 5 f rpc3 had significant periodicities of 2 4a 8 12a and 18 32a during 1978 1984 1972 1987 and 1974 2011 fig 5 g in addition rpc4 had significant periodicities of 3a and 6 8a during 1979 1983 and 1981 1990 respectively fig 5 h at the lg stage rpc1 had significant periodicity of 2 4a 2 4a and 8a during 1986 1995 2000 2008 and 2005 2013 fig 5 i rpc2 had the same significant periodicity of 3 4a during 1966 1969 1979 1986 and 2008 2012 moreover there also had significant periodicity of 22 32a during 1960 2008 from 2002 to 2006 rpc3 had a significant periodicity of 2 4a while from 2002 to 2015 rpc3 had a significant periodicity of 4 6a fig 5 k moreover fig 5 l shows that rpc4 had the same significant periodicity of about 3a during 1965 1972 and 1992 1998 moreover there also had significant periodicity of 28 32a during 1976 1994 3 3 future trend of drought sen s slope method was adopted to analyze the variation trend of spei time series at each station and hurst exponent was used to predict the persistence of dryness wetness conditions in the region fig 6 shows the spatial distributions of sen s slope and hurst exponent and the classification of hurst exponent wu et al 2017 is shown in table s1 the results showed that at the eg stage 50 of the stations in this region had a sen s slope of less than 0 fig 6 a table 1 among the stations with increasing trends only suifenhe station showed the significant trend meanwhile most stations i e 24 26 had a hurst exponent of larger than 0 5 in this region fig 6 d among them 8 stations were in grade ii with weak persistence and 12 stations were in grade iii with strong persistence thailai and yilan stations had the lowest h values i e 0 47 and 0 41 respectively while mingshui and fuyu stations had the highest h values i e 0 75 and 0 74 respectively the persistence of hurst exponent change indicated that the future trend of most stations would be consistent with the current situation that is the east and south of this region will present a trend of wetting while the west and north will present a trend of drying at the mg stage 65 4 of the stations in this region had a sen s slope of less than 0 fig 6 b table 1 suifenhe station showed a significant growth trend and shangzhi station showed a significant downward trend meanwhile most stations i e 25 26 in this region had a hurst exponent of larger than 0 5 fig 6 e among which 13 stations were in grade ii and 6 stations were in grade iii keshan and beilin stations had the lowest h values i e 0 44 and 0 47 respectively while mudanjiang and tonghe stations had the highest h values i e 0 75 and 0 74 respectively the persistence of hurst exponent change indicated that the future trend of most stations would be consistent with the current situation that is nearly 2 3 of this region will present a trend of drying in the future at the lg stage 92 3 of the stations in this region had a sen s slope of less than 0 fig 6 c table 1 and all stations i e 26 26 in this region had a hurst exponent of larger than 0 5 fig 6 f among them 12 stations were in grade ii with weak persistence 10 stations were in grade iii with strong persistence and 4 stations were in grade iv with stronger persistence the persistence of hurst exponent change indicated that the future trend of most stations would be consistent with the current situation that is most parts of this region will present a trend of drying in the future 3 4 relationship between maize yield and drought given the significant spatial variability of dryness wetness conditions its effects on crop yield are also expected to have spatial variation the spatial distribution of crop yield should be helpful for policy makers to plan out the future planting strategy in a specific region the correlations of climate induced yields of maize in the selected nine areas with the corresponding dryness wetness conditions at different growth stages are shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the correlation coefficients between maize yields and dryness wetness conditions varied among areas and growth stages for example at the eg stage the climate induced yields of maize in harbin qiqihar and jixi areas were negatively correlated with dryness wetness conditions while that in mudanjiang jixi and yichun areas were negatively correlated with dryness wetness conditions at both mg and lg stages particularly that of the jixi area at the mg stage in contrast other areas showed positive correlations of which the climate induced yield in daqing area was significantly affected by dryness wetness conditions at both mg and lg stages on a whole the climate induced yields in western heilongjiang province were basically positively correlated with dryness wetness conditions but the correlation was predominantly negative in the eastern part precipitation and temperature are both necessary climatic factors affecting spei guo et al 2019 in heilongjiang province the yields of spring maize are primarily dependent on both temperature and precipitation zhao et al 2015 to develop the qualitative relationships between drought and climate induced yield a multivariate regression method was selected to estimate the individual effects of different climate variables using climate variables as the independent variables and climate induced yield as the dependent variable the multivariate regression method based on historical data has been widely used and it can capture the net climate effects of combined climate variables e g bhatt et al 2014 chen et al 2015 prabnakorn et al 2018 li et al 2020 the results are shown in table 2 the effect of climatic factors on the maize yield varies among places as explained below there are about four types as shown in table 2 mainly depending on 1 temperature 2 temperature and precipitation 3 temperature and dryness wetness conditions and 4 temperature precipitation and dryness wetness conditions in qiqihar jiamusi mudanjiang and suihua the climate induced of maize mainly depends on temperature in jixi yichun heihe and daxinganling the climate induced of maize mainly depends on temperature and precipitation in harbin and daqing the climate induced of maize mainly depend on type 3 and 4 respectively apparently the climate induced yields of maize in the above nine areas were all affected by temperature in contrast precipitation only affected the climate induced yields of maize in four areas and dryness wetness conditions in two areas conversely it seems that temperature is the most important climatic factor in affecting the climate induced yields of maize in northeast china while precipitation and dryness wetness conditions are the second and third most important factors respectively drought is a complex phenomenon attributed to a combination of climatic factors represented by precipitation temperature and dryness wetness conditions even the change in dryness wetness conditions obtained from the multivariate regression model was not the most important factor affecting the yield of maize in northeast china it is expected to play a significant role in affecting the yield of maize in future because moisture availability is key to the growth of many crops including maize e g labudová et al 2016 liu et al 2018a 3 5 xwt of maize climate induced yield and drought as a correlation analysis cannot derive the interdecadal relationship between climate induced yield of maize and dryness wetness conditions this study applied the xwt to investigate such relationships between them for the first time fig 8 shows the cross wavelet power spectra of climate induced yield of maize and dryness wetness conditions in the selected nine areas at the eg stage at the eg stage a statistically significant positive correlation at the 95 confidence level was detected between the climate induced yield and dryness wetness conditions in heilongjiang province in harbin it shows a 3a inter annual signal from 2006 to 2009 fig 8 a in qiqihar it had a 2 4a signal from 2000 to 2009 fig 8 b in mudanjiang it shows a 2 3a signal over 2009 2012 fig 8 c in jiamusi jixi and daqing 2 4a signal were found during 2001 2012 2000 2010 and 2000 2009 respectively fig 8 d f in yichun it had 3 4a and 3a signals during 1990 1995 and 2007 2011 respectively fig 8 g in suihua it had a 2 3a signal from 2006 to 2010 fig 8 h in heihe it had 2 4a and 8a signals during 2000 2012 and 2002 2010 respectively fig 8 i similar results can be obtained through analyzing the cross wavelet power spectra of the climate induced yields of maize and dryness wetness conditions at the mg and lg stages fig s1 and s2 however there was no statistically significant correlation detected in harbin and suihua area on the scale of less than 8 signals compared with each area at the eg stage except yichun and jiamusi area at the mg stage and heihe and jixi area at the lg stage most areas show similar relationships between the climate induced yield and dryness wetness conditions at multiple inter annual scales from 1986 to 2016 in addition it is found that there were significant periodicities on a relatively large scale at the mg stage the cross wavelet power spectra show that the relationship between the climate induced yield of maize and dryness wetness conditions at different growth stages had obvious inter annual variability this study provides necessary qualitative information for studying the impact of climate change on crop production since the obvious decadal variability in drought and climate induced yield the decadal variability should be separated from the climate change signals when studying the impact of climate change on agriculture especially in the production prediction tian et al 2015 4 discussion 4 1 trends and periodicities of droughts periodicity and trend are two important characteristics of drought time series in this study it is found that most parts of this region showed decreasing trends and will present the trends of drying in future however the detected trends in different sub regions are not the same the patterns of dryness wetness conditions and the changing characteristics of each sub region are similar at the eg and mg stages the patterns of dryness wetness conditions may be related to the complex topography and large scale climate patterns as is known heilongjiang province has a wide range of southeast southwest or southerly winds throughout the whole year the barrier effects of greater khingan mountains lesser khingan mountains and changbai mountains on these prevailing winds form rich precipitation in the mountain areas while relatively less in the plain areas shu et al 2007 therefore these sub regions should be separately considered for regional water resources planning and management in addition climate change may be an important factor affecting the dryness wetness conditions in northeast china li et al 2017 found that precipitation in heilongjiang province showed a decreasing trend sun et al 2006 showed that the increase of temperature in northeast china is much larger than that in the whole mainland china the increase of temperature will cause a series of meteorological disasters e g drought and flood yu et al 2016 found that the annual mean temperature in heilongjiang province were 2 57 with an increasing trend of 0 35 decade over 1961 2013 in addition human activities also affect the dryness wetness conditions in northeast china marvel et al 2019 liu et al 2018b found that carbon dioxide emissions in northeast china showed an increasing trend and urbanization had a positive impact on carbon dioxide emissions during 1995 2014 the change of carbon dioxide emissions may lead to regional climate change because it is an indisputable fact of the climate warming due to the increase of carbon dioxide dong et al 2014 showed that the evapotranspiration increased in summer after farmland expansion in northeast china besides drought trends this study also examined the periodicity of dryness wetness conditions at different growth stages of maize by cwt showing that changes in dryness wetness conditions exhibited significant periodicities at multiple inter annual scales in addition it is found that there are some large scale periodicities at the mg and lg stages jiang et al 2008 found that there were multiple time scale characteristics of 2 3a 8 12a and 20 25a in the temperature of northeast china in recent 100 years fu et al 2018 evaluated the meteorological drought in heilongjiang province using the precipitation data of meteorological stations and found that the meteorological drought in each season had the periodic characteristics of 2 5a specifically the periodic characteristics of 22a and 32a on a relatively large scale were found in summer and autumn zhou et al 2020 analyzed the relationship between the temperature and large scale pattern in heilongjiang province using cross wavelet the results showed that arctic oscillation ao had significant influence on average temperature with the periodicity of 3a while pacific decadal oscillation pdo had a significant influence on average temperature with the periodicity of 3 4a therefore due to the periodicities of precipitation and temperature dryness wetness conditions described in this study also exhibited significant periodicities at multiple inter annual time scales previous studies e g liu et al 2018c fang et al 2019 himayoun and roshni 2019 also detected the periodic oscillatory behaviour in dryness wetness conditions at inter annual time scale due to changes in large scale climate patterns however to better understand this oscillatory behaviour of dryness wetness conditions in northeast china further studies are still needed 4 2 effects of drought on maize yield in general the effects of drought on maize yield are not the same at different growth stages in this study it is found that the climate yield of maize is more closely related to the dryness wetness conditions at the mg and lg stages but less related to that at the eg stage ji et al 2012 simulated the natural drought environment and carried out drought stress in the key growth period of spring maize in northeast china the results showed that the seedling stage of maize is not the critical stage of water demand and the maize after seedling stage is more affected by drought stress yang et al 2015 found that maize yield in sanjiang plain of heilongjiang province is most closely related to the dryness wetness conditions in july included at the mg stage in this study while that in songnen plain is more closely related to the dryness wetness conditions in august included at the lg stage in this study guo et al 2017 found that drought would only bring a slight impact on the yield loss in northeast china at the early stage of maize growth therefore it is particularly important to manage the drought effects on maize yield at the mg and lg stages the obtained results also show that the climate induced yield of maize has a positive correlation with dryness wetness conditions in the western part but a negative correlation in the eastern part of heilongjiang province generally maize is a drought resistant crop and can grow well even in some semi arid regions e g lian et al 2016 wu et al 2016 since the western part of heilongjiang province has a semi arid climate while the eastern part has a humid climate the different climatic regimes of the western and eastern parts of the province could be the main reason why opposite correlations are found between the climate induced yield of maize and dryness wetness conditions in both sides of the province in order to analyze the difference of spatial correlation between the climate induced yield and dryness wetness conditions in the east and west this study analyzed the reasons from the perspective of land use and urbanization taking daqing harbin jixi and mudanjiang as examples i e two in the east and two in the west the land use data of the study area in four phases i e 1980 1995 2005 2015 land use changes in a daqing b jixi c harbin and d mudanjiang during 1980 2015 are shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 a the arable land area increased the forest land area slightly increased and the grassland area decreased in daqing moreover the area of urban construction and rural housing increased zhang et al 2017 showed that the change of forest to grassland and arable land could lead to the decrease in temperature in heilongjiang province and the change of grassland to arable land could lead to the increase in temperature in heilongjiang province in addition liu et al 2018b found that carbon dioxide emissions in northeast china showed an increasing trend during 1995 2014 and urbanization had a positive impact on carbon dioxide emissions therefore the land use change and urbanization may cause the temperature increase in daqing and make the climate induced yield positively related to the dryness wetness conditions in different periods it can be seen from fig 9 b that the arable land area increased the forest land area slightly reduced the grassland area reduced and the area of urban construction and rural housing slightly increased in jixi therefore the temperature of jixi may increase however it can be seen from table 2 that precipitation is also the main factor affecting the climate induced yield in jixi due to the large amount of precipitation in the eastern part of heilongjiang province it may cause a negative correlation between the climate induced yield and dryness wetness conditions known from fig 9 c the arable land area and grassland area in harbin increased while the forest land area decreased thus land use change may slow down the temperature growth in harbin in recent years due to the large growth of urban construction and rural housing area and the level of urbanization has developed rapidly it may cause the different correlations between the climate induced yield and dryness wetness conditions in different periods in mudanjiang the arable land area and grassland area slightly increased while the forest land area slightly decreased fig 9 d moreover the urban construction and rural housing area basically remained unchanged therefore the land use change and urbanization may cause the temperature decrease in mudanjiang and make the climate induced yield negative related to the dryness wetness conditions in different periods the results in subsection 3 5 show that dryness wetness conditions at different growth stages have resulted in obvious inter annual changes in the climate induced yield of maize it is also found that compared with those at the eg and lg stages there were relatively large scale significant periodicities at the mg stage figs 8 s1 and s2 this may be caused by the same reason for the periodicities of dryness wetness conditions mentioned in subsection 4 1 moreover most area showed significant 3 4a correlations during 2000 2010 sun et al 2018 showed that the ao increased from 1990 to 2000 but showed decreasing trend after 2000 zhang et al 2017 showed that the cold flow over asia was stronger and the heat exchange between the north and the south was enhanced when the ao decreased leading to the temperature change in northeast china wang et al 2016 showed that pdo changed from warm phase to cold phase around 2000 and the phase change caused the decrease in temperature growth in northeast china zhou et al 2020 showed that ao had significant influences on average temperature with the periodicity of 3a and pdo had significant influences on average temperature with the periodicity of 3 4a therefore large scale climate patterns may be the main reason for the significant periodicity of 3 4a in heilongjiang province during 2000 2010 however the relevant effects on the climate induced yield of maize in northeast china should be further examined in future 4 3 litations and implications this study has investigated how regional climatic conditions and changes affected the maize yield in heilongjiang province besides precipitation temperature and dry wet conditions the maize yield is also dependent on other factors such as nitrogen fertilizers rezaei and lashkari 2019 solar radiation yang et al 2019 and agriculture management system casali et al 2018 nie et al 2018 found that both the effective precipitation and the water demand of maize during the growth period were generally decreasing in heilongjiang province it seems that more irrigation should be carried out during the maize growth period to maintain the maize yield of this province there should be further studies on the effects of supplementary irrigation on the maize yield in heilongjiang province the results of this study are based on 31 years of maize yield per unit land area from 1986 to 2016 it will be desirable if a longer dataset of maize yield is available although the hurst exponent is useful to predict the general trend of future droughts it cannot predict the severity or duration of future droughts therefore to ensure a stable maize yield in future it is advisable to consider implementing adequate crop management measures such as more effectively mitigate the impact of flooding and waterlogging to crop yield and cultivating excellent maize varieties that are more resistant to droughts it would be beneficial to develop a multi dimensional model to evaluate both climatic variables and other physical variables that will affect the maize yield moreover different regression models have been established for the nine selected areas in northeast china however these models may be region dependent the study area is located in the cold region and the models are applicable for other regions with different climatic characteristics beyond heilongjiang province relationship between drought and climate induced yield should be re established and the models may need more validations nevertheless the proposed regression models may have interpreted the individual effects of different climate variables on the yield of maize from the perspective of climatology 5 conclusions this study analyzes the spatiotemporal characteristics of dryness wetness condition in a specific period and firstly introduces cross wavelet analysis to explore the relationships between drought and climate induced yield of maize in northeast china the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 reof divides the dryness wetness conditions of maize into four sub regions at different growth stages at the eg stage there was a persistent drought in the western and southeastern parts but the drought trend eased slightly the central part presented the wetting trend while the northern part was in an unstable state with the alternation of wetness and dryness at the mg stage there was a wetting trend in the western part a drying trend in the central and southeastern parts and an unstable state in the northern part at the lg stage the western and eastern parts presented a trend of wetting while the southwestern and northern parts presented a trend of drying 2 the results of cwt showed that the variation of dryness wetness conditions included significant periodicities with multiple time scales 3 the persistence of hurst exponent change indicated that the future trend of most stations would be consistent with the current situation at the eg stage the east and south of this region would show a trend of wetting while the west and north would show a trend of drying at the mg stage most of this region would present the trend of drying at the lg stage most parts of this region would present the trends of drying 4 based on the results of cross wavelet analysis the climate induced yield of maize and dryness wetness conditions at different growth stages had obvious statistically significant interannual relationships climatic factors that affect the climate induced yield of maize in northeast china are first temperature second precipitation and third dryness wetness conditions this knowledge of the interannual variability can be useful for the future crop management of northeast china credit

5344,it is important to investigate the potential impacts of global climate change on crop yield especially there have been limited relevant studies conducted in the cold regions such as northeast china this study investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of droughts on different growth stages of maize over northeast china during 1960 2016 and the effects of droughts on the climate induced yield of maize separated by the logistic regression model using standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei trend analysis methods rotated empirical orthogonal function wavelet method and hurst exponent the results indicated that 1 the spatiotemporal patterns of drought were identified at different growth stages and the changes in dryness wetness condition presented significant periodic oscillation on different time scales 2 the patterns of dryness wetness conditions and the changing characteristics of each sub region at the early growth eg and middle growth mg stages were similar 3 the future drought trends in most stations would be consistent with the past trends in addition to the wetting trend in the eastern and southern parts at the eg stage the whole study area would show a drying trend in future at other growth stages 4 the cross wavelet transform xwt was used to develop the changing relationships between climate induced yield of maize and the dryness wetness condition at different growth stages with obvious inter annual periodicities 5 for northeast china climatic factors that can affect the climate induced yield of maize are firstly temperature next precipitation and thirdly dryness wetness conditions keywords drought characteristics climate induced yield of maize wavelet method northeast china 1 introduction in the past few decades global warming has led to high temperature heat waves and extreme hydrological events such as floods and droughts e g spinoni et al 2015 tong et al 2019 umair et al 2019 which may significantly affect human life ecological environment agricultural production and economic development e g gan et al 2016 shi et al 2018 as is known drought is caused by the regional precipitation that is lower than normal value for a long term period and the occurrence of drought has seriously affected agricultural production kontgis et al 2019 economic development yu et al 2019 and regional water security nkomozepi and chung 2014 zhang et al 2019a as reported by food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations climate change will have great impacts on global crop yields and food security kontgis et al 2019 at present rain fed agriculture is still the dominant part of agriculture in china although the agricultural mechanization is keeping improving all the time dryness wetness conditions are the main factors affecting crops in rain fed areas in areas with long term unfavorable dryness wetness conditions the grain yield will inevitably be affected which can then threaten national food security therefore the topic of regional dryness wetness conditions has attracted the attention of a large number of scholars e g guo et al 2018 deng et al 2018 normally drought can be classified into four categories including meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought american meteorological society 2013 numerous drought indices have been developed based on different parameters for drought analysis including palmer drought severity index pdsi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei standardized precipitation index spi socioeconomic drought index sedi and so on e g shi et al 2018 mahmoudi et al 2019 shiru et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b for the application of these drought indices pdsi which is based on soil water balance has relatively high data requirements and it lacks the flexibility to adapt to the inherent multi scale nature of drought spei and spi both have multi scale characteristics and can be used to identify meteorological drought characteristics however spi identifies drought only by precipitation but spei is an improvement of the spi that includes potential evaporation in the process of water deficit calculation yao et al 2018 since this study mainly focuses on meteorological drought during the whole crop growth period spei is selected to characterize the drought events in the study area in order to analyze the impacts of climate change on crop yield both statistical and numerical models can be used numerical models were widely used in simulating the main process of crop growth and development e g world food studies wofost model lecerf et al 2019 decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat boonwichai et al 2019 and agricultural production systems simulator apsim bahri et al 2019 these process based models were typically developed and tested using experimental trials and thus could offer the distinct advantage of leveraging decades of research on crop physiology and reproduction agronomy and soil science among other disciplines lobell and burke 2010 however these models required a large amount of input data on cultivars management and soil conditions which unfortunately are not available in some regions of the world even if such data are available to calibrate these models can be very difficult because there are a lot of uncertain parameters iizumi et al 2009 in contrast statistical models are more commonly used because they are less data demanding are based on historical production and some basic climate data such as temperature and precipitation during the growing season which are readily available the main advantages of statistical models are their limited reliance on field calibration data and their transparent assessment of model uncertainties zhao et al 2015 in addition the input data requirement of statistical models is modest but if well developed they can still provide useful results in recent years wavelet analysis has been widely used to analyze the characteristics of geophysical time series such as climatic and hydrological data tan et al 2017 tong et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 wavelet methods can capture the temporal changes of a time series and the intermittent characteristics of the coherence between two time series okonkwo and demoz 2014 applied wavelet methods to teleconnect large scale climate patterns such as enso el niño southern oscillation to crop yield tian et al 2015 was the first to apply wavelet methods to assess the impacts of climatic factors on crop production which has enhanced our understanding on crop yield and its potential predictability however there are still only limited studies that apply wavelet methods to analyze the relationship between crop yield and droughts to our knowledge this study is likely the first to introduce wavelet methods to assess the impact of droughts on climate induced yield heilongjiang province is one of the most important agricultural provinces in china it is also one of the three major black lands in the world in addition heilongjiang province is located in the highest latitude and coldest region of china the increase of temperature in northeast china is much larger than the mainland china zhou et al 2020 the main crops in heilongjiang province are maize rice soybean etc among which the sowing area of maize accounts for 1 3 of the whole province s grain sowing area moreover it is worth noting that the province s maize yield accounts for 1 10 of china s maize yields consequently the food security of heilongjiang province is crucial to the stability and development of china s national food security the objectives of this study are 1 to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of dryness wetness conditions and the relevant periodic features in a specific period 2 to explore the long term drought trend in the future 3 to firstly introduce cross wavelet transform xwt to analyze the relationships between drought and climate induced yield of maize in northeast china and 4 to provide scientific basis for better understanding of china s grain production in response to climate change especially in the cold regions 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area heilongjiang province is located in the cold region of northeast china 121 11 e 135 05 e 43 26 n 53 33 n see fig 1 it is the highest latitude province in china it borders russia in the east and north inner mongolia in the west and jilin province in the south the area accounts for 4 9 of the total land area in china from east to west it can be divided into humid area semi humid area and semi arid area it has a temperate continental monsoon climate with distinct seasons i e hot and rainy summer but cold and dry winter fu et al 2018 due to the topographic reasons shu et al 2007 and the role of the atmospheric circulation wang et al 2018 climate differences in various regions of heilongjiang province are obvious 2 2 research data the meteorological data on daily time scale in the study area can be downloaded for free from the chinese meteorological data network http data cma cn the chinese meteorological data network strictly controls the data quality before the data are released to the public this includes checking for incorrect codes and records as well as homogenizing the data in this study the following variables i e precipitation temperature maximum average and minimum temperatures wind speed relative humidity average air pressure and sunshine duration are selected as most of these stations were built in the late 1950 s and the data are relatively complete after 1960 therefore only the data from 1960 are selected in this study to ensure that the lengths of the datasets from different stations are consistent the missing data are interpolated by the data of the adjacent stations in the same year however stations with serious lack of data i e more than twenty years are excluded directly after this elimination there are 26 meteorological stations left with complete daily observations from 1960 to 2016 the monthly values can be derived from the daily values monthly precipitation is the sum of the daily precipitation in a month while monthly average temperature is the mean of the daily temperature in a month the data of the per unit area yield of maize from 1986 to 2016 can be obtained from heilongjiang statistical yearbook issued by heilongjiang statistical bureau http www hlj gov cn zwfb zfcbw hljtjnj among the 13 prefecture level cities in heilongjiang province the agricultural production levels of daxinganling hegang shuangyashan and qitaihe are relatively backward leading to the relatively low maize yield for example in 2016 the maize yield of heilongjiang province was about 45 08 million tons while the total maize yield of these four areas was about 3 1 million tons only about 7 of the total therefore other nine prefecture level cities i e harbin qiqihar jiamusi jixi daqing mudanjiang yichun suihua and heihe were selected to analyze the impacts of drought on maize yield in subsection 3 4 in addition the land use data was obtained from the national remote sensing monitoring database of resources and environment data cloud platform of chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn in order to facilitate the study the whole growth period of maize was divided into three stages according to the planting rules of maize in northeast china therefore according to the method for dividing the growth period of maize in this region which was proposed by yang et al 2015 the early growth eg stage of maize is from march to may that including land consolidation and sowing maize usually silks in the middle of july so the seedling silking period corresponds to the middle growth mg stage of maize from may to july the later growth lg stage is used to represent the silking maturity period from july to september 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei in this study the drought index spei proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 is used to characterize the regional changes in dryness wetness conditions of northeast china the index uses the water deficit d computed from precipitation p and potential evaporation pet to track the water loss and gain which can judge the dryness and wetness water deficit d i is equal to p i pet i where i represent i th month then d i is normalized with a log logistic probability distribution to obtain spei the probability distribution function of d i series is as follows vicente serrano et al 2010 chen et al 2019 1 f x 1 α x γ β 1 where α β γ are scale shape and location parameters respectively then with f x spei can be easily obtained as the standardized value of f x 2 spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 3 w 2 l n p f o r p 0 5 where p is the probability of exceeding a determined d value p 1 f x for p greater than 0 5 p is replaced by 1 p w 2 l n 1 p and the sign of spei is reversed the constants are fixed i e c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 d 3 0 001308 the method follows the study of vicente serrano et al 2010 and the calculation process of the grades of meteorological drought in china s national climate center gb t 20481 2017 2 3 2 rotated empirical orthogonal function reof lorenz 1956 was likely the first to use the empirical orthogonal function eof to analyse key features of complex spatiotemporal meteorological variables the eigenvectors obtained after the decomposition are orthogonal to each other and the associated spatial modes can effectively reflect different spatial characteristics of climate elements it is widely used in the analysis of meteorological variables e g lena et al 2014 zhang et al 2015a in reof the original eof matrix is rotated on the basis of the maximum variance criterion to make the high load vector field in the same spatial mode more evenly distributed the variance of the load is maximized after the rotation which makes the high load area more prominent as a result the dominant space pattern represented by each principal component can be clearly distinguished guo et al 2018 after the rotation the spatial distribution of the high load vector field is clearer and the variation in time is more stable huang et al 2015 therefore reof is applied to the spei time series and the reof analysis includes spatial patterns reofs time series rotated principal components rpcs and eigenvalues 2 3 3 trend analysis methods in this study the mann kendall mk rank correlation test recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo is used to analyze the trend and abrupt change of the spei time series the mk trend analysis method is a nonparametric statistical test method widely used in the fields of meteorology hydrology and sedimentology e g zhang et al 2015b shi et al 2017 in this study the mk trend analysis method following the method in the study of shi and wang 2015 is used the normal statistic z is used to indicate the strength of the trend z greater than 0 represents an upward trend z less than 0 a decreasing trend and z 0 no obvious trend detected a critical value at the 95 significance level is selected for the abrupt change test the mk trend analysis is designed to detect the presence of statistically significant trends but not the slope of the trend which can be estimated using the sen s slope method sen 1968 shi and chen 2018 both the mk trend analysis and sen s slope method are used to analyze the trend of the spei time series 2 3 4 yields separation method crop yield y can be expressed as the sum of management climate contribution and random error among them crop yield caused by crop management mainly depends on productivity and the development level of science and technology climatic induced yield yc is also known as fluctuation yield which mainly reflects the yield fluctuation caused by climate change the specific calculation is as follows 4 y y t y c y r where y t is crop management induced yields y c is climatic induced yields y r is random error zhao et al 2015 found that the logistic regression model can optimally separate the spring maize yield in northeast china to crop management induced yields and climate induced yield in northeast china therefore in this study the logistic regression model is adopted to separate the per unit area yield of maize to climate induced yield when simulating the yield change y t tends to a limited amount y 0 which is a local maximum possible yield logistic equation is calculated as follows 5 y t y 0 1 e x p c d t where t is the elapsed time c and d are parameters taking logarithm on both sides of the equation 6 ln y 0 y t 1 c d t by replacing yt with the observed y the parameters c and d can be estimated using the least square method then the climate induced yield yc is estimated as 7 y c y y t 2 3 5 wavelet method common wavelet transform includes continuous wavelet transform cwt and discrete wavelet transform dwt cwt is mainly used in time frequency analysis and filtering of time localized frequency components while dwt is mainly used in signal denoising compared with cwt there are three main limitations of dwt shift sensitivity poor directionality and lack of phase information altunkaynak and ozger 2016 in addition cwt is more suitable for signal feature extraction and is widely used in geophysical research as a tool of time series intermittent wave feature extraction grinsted et al 2004 therefore in order to obtain the amplitude and phase information of time series cwt is selected in this study cwt decomposes time series from time domain to time frequency domain for a time series xn n 1 2 n cwt is defined as 8 w n s n 0 n 1 x n φ n n δ t s where n is the localized time index n is the time conversion index s is the scale δ t is the sampling period n is the number of points in the time series φ t represents a mother wavelet function and indicates the complex conjugate the wavelet power spectrum is defined as wn s 2 the wavelet power spectrum reflects the fluctuation of various scales contained in the time series and the characteristics of strength changing with scales the scale at the corresponding peak is the main time scale of the time series which is used to reflect the main period of the change in the time series however the main period needs to be tested for significance as geophysical time series usually have the characteristics of red noise red noise is often used as background spectrum to test the wavelet spectrum torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 tian et al 2015 when wavelet transform is applied to a time series the choice of mother wavelet function is particularly important an orthogonal wavelet function is generally used in dwt while a non orthogonal wavelet function can be used either in dwt or cwt hsu and li 2010 schaller et al 2017 in order to obtain smooth and continuous wavelet amplitude non orthogonal wavelet function is suitable in addition to obtain the amplitude and phase information of time series complex wavelet should be selected because complex wavelet has virtual part which can express the phase change well commonly used mother wavelet function includes harr mexican hat morlet etc morlet wavelet which is non orthogonal is a complex wavelet adjusted by gaussian function therefore this study selects morlet wavelet as mother wavelet the function of which can be written as 9 φ 0 η π 1 4 e j ω 0 η e η 2 2 where η is the nondimensional time factor ω 0 is the nondimensional frequency in addition in this study cross wavelet transform xwt based on morlet wavelet is applied to investigate the co relationship between two time series the cross wavelet spectrum generated by the complex conjugate of two time series represents the covariance correlation between two time series for two time series xn and y n their xwt can be defined as wxy wxwy their cross wavelet power is defined as wxy the complex argument arg wxy can be regarded as the local relative phase of these two time series in the time frequency field the theoretical distribution of the cross wavelet power of x n and y n with their background power spectra p k x and p k y torrence and compo 1998 is expressed as follows 11 d

distributions for a more detailed description of cwt and xwt refer to the studies of torrence and compo 1998 and grinsted et al 2004 2 3 6 hurst exponent the hurst h exponent was proposed by a british hydrologist called hurst to analyze the long term temporal dependency of a time series hurst 1951 and is widely used in the field of hydrometeorology e g zhang et al 2012 tatli 2015 long term persistence ltp also referred to as the hurst phenomenon has been detected in many hydrologic time series particularly in river flows e g szolgayova et al 2014 tan and gan 2017 the h value lower than 0 5 indicates a lack of ltp while the h value larger than 0 5 indicates the presence of ltp when 0 h less than 0 5 it describes an anti persistent process which indicated anti trend of the time series in the future the smaller the h value the stronger the anti persistent when 0 5 h less than 1 it describes a dynamically persistent or trend reinforcing series may partly represent the presence of long term memories and non stationary characteristics in a process the larger the h value the stronger the long term persistency tong et al 2018 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal characteristics of drought reof was used to analyze the spei time series of maize at different growth stages the satisfactory cumulative variance percentage should be above 60 zhang et al 2015a fu et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 the cumulative variances were 77 35 65 76 and 69 42 respectively which indicated that it was reasonable to choose 4 rpcs at different growth stages the distribution of all reofs patterns is shown in fig 3 the rotational load represents the correlation between the spei sequence and its corresponding rpcs during the study period when dividing the sub region experiencing similar dryness wetness changes the threshold of the rotational load above 0 6 was considered to be reasonable li and wang 2016 the areas with high load mean that they experienced similar drought variability in the study period at the eg stage the high load of reof1 and reof2 patterns see fig 3 a and b were mainly distributed in the west and southeast of heilongjiang province in reof3 pattern fig 3 c the areas with high load value were mainly distributed in the central part of heilongjiang province while the areas with low load value are mainly distributed in the northwest and southeast in reof4 pattern fig 3 d the high load area is mainly distributed in the northern part of heilongjiang province while the low load area is mainly distributed in the southern part at the mg stage the dryness wetness conditions in the study area were different in spatial distribution in the reof1 4 patterns fig 3 e h the high load areas were in the western part the central part the southeast part and the northern part of heilongjiang province respectively at the lg stage the dryness wetness conditions in the study area were different in spatial distribution in the reof1 4 patterns fig 3 i l the areas with high load values were in the western part the southeast part the northern part and the southwest part of heilongjiang province respectively in summary reof could divide the dryness wetness conditions in the study area at different growth stages into four different sub regions with different dry and wet changing patterns to investigate the temporal characteristics of drought the trend analysis methods were used and the statistical results of corresponding rotated principal components at different growth stages are shown in fig 4 at the eg stage uf value was below 0 before 1972 but above 0 during 1972 1975 moreover uf value has been below 0 since the abrupt change in 1975 and the trend of decrease between 1998 and 2007 was significant indicating the continuous drought in western heilongjiang province from 1975 to 2007 yu et al 2019 however there was an increasing trend after 2007 fig 4 a as shown in fig 4 b there was an increasing trend from 1960 to 1975 from 1975 to 2000 uf was always below 0 but there was a non significant decreasing trend after 2000 uf showed an increasing trend indicating that the southeastern part of heilongjiang province showed a wetting trend and a slight easing of the drying trend the change of uf in the rpc3 is similar to that of the first two patterns however the time series decreased significantly between 1964 and 1968 after 1993 it began to show an increasing trend especially a significant increasing trend after 2012 fig 4 c it indicated that the central part of heilongjiang province presented a trend of wetting between 1960 and 1975 the uf values were always below 0 and the uf values fluctuated around 0 from 1975 to 1995 indicating that the northern part of heilongjiang province was in an unstable state of alternating dryness and wetness after 1996 there was a decreasing trend fig 4 d at the mg stage uf value turned negative around 1964 an abrupt change occurred around 2008 but the increasing trend was not significant fig 4 e the prc2 showed a decrease trend from 1960 to 1986 in 1966 1982 the uf value was less than 1 96 which indicated a significant decreasing trend from 1986 to 1998 there was an increasing trend and an abrupt change occurred around 1989 but the increasing trend was not significant there was a non significant decreasing after 1998 fig 4 f the prc3 showed a decreasing trend from 1960 to 1980 from 1980 to 1997 there was a non significant increasing trend and an abrupt change occurred around 1984 there was a non significant decreasing trend after 1997 and the abrupt change occurred around 1998 fig 4 g between 1960 and 1975 the uf values were always below 0 in addition the uf values always fluctuated around the 0 line between 1975 and 1995 indicating that the northern part of heilongjiang province was in an unstable state of alternating dryness and wetness fig 4 h at the lg stage the changes of rpc1 and rpc2 were similar there was a decreasing trend between 1963 and 1985 with a significant decreasing trend between 1975 and 1985 i e uf value was less than 1 96 by contrast an increasing trend was found during 1986 1994 rpc1 and rpc2 occurred an abrupt change around 2012 and 1992 respectively fig 4 i j and rpc3 had a non significant increasing trend between 1960 and 1995 the abrupt change occurred around 1995 and 2007 there was a decreasing trend during 1995 2007 however after 2007 there was an increasing trend fig 4 k from 1960 to 1980 rpc4 showed a decreasing trend among which the dryness and wetness alternations from 1967 to 1978 were unstable abrupt change occurred around 2005 i e a non significant increasing trend during 1981 2004 but a non significant decreasing trend during 2005 2015 fig 4 l 3 2 periodic features of drought morlet wavelet analysis was used to analyze rpcs at different growth stages the continuous wavelet power spectrum of each rpc is shown in fig 5 at the eg stage rpc1 had significant periodicities of 4 7a and 2 4a during 1979 1990 and 2001 2010 respectively fig 5 a rpc2 had the same significant periodicity around 3a during 2004 2010 fig 5 b while rpc3 had significant periodicities of 2 4a and 3a during 1971 1980 and 2003 2010 respectively fig 5 c for rpc4 significant periodicities of 2 4a was found during 1991 1996 and 1999 2008 fig 5 d at the mg stage rpc1 had significant periodicities of 12 14a 2 4a and 24 28a during 1964 1972 2002 2010 and 1977 2006 respectively fig 5 e during 1982 1985 2005 2011 and 1969 2011 rpc2 had periodicities of 2a 3 4a and 24 32a respectively fig 5 f rpc3 had significant periodicities of 2 4a 8 12a and 18 32a during 1978 1984 1972 1987 and 1974 2011 fig 5 g in addition rpc4 had significant periodicities of 3a and 6 8a during 1979 1983 and 1981 1990 respectively fig 5 h at the lg stage rpc1 had significant periodicity of 2 4a 2 4a and 8a during 1986 1995 2000 2008 and 2005 2013 fig 5 i rpc2 had the same significant periodicity of 3 4a during 1966 1969 1979 1986 and 2008 2012 moreover there also had significant periodicity of 22 32a during 1960 2008 from 2002 to 2006 rpc3 had a significant periodicity of 2 4a while from 2002 to 2015 rpc3 had a significant periodicity of 4 6a fig 5 k moreover fig 5 l shows that rpc4 had the same significant periodicity of about 3a during 1965 1972 and 1992 1998 moreover there also had significant periodicity of 28 32a during 1976 1994 3 3 future trend of drought sen s slope method was adopted to analyze the variation trend of spei time series at each station and hurst exponent was used to predict the persistence of dryness wetness conditions in the region fig 6 shows the spatial distributions of sen s slope and hurst exponent and the classification of hurst exponent wu et al 2017 is shown in table s1 the results showed that at the eg stage 50 of the stations in this region had a sen s slope of less than 0 fig 6 a table 1 among the stations with increasing trends only suifenhe station showed the significant trend meanwhile most stations i e 24 26 had a hurst exponent of larger than 0 5 in this region fig 6 d among them 8 stations were in grade ii with weak persistence and 12 stations were in grade iii with strong persistence thailai and yilan stations had the lowest h values i e 0 47 and 0 41 respectively while mingshui and fuyu stations had the highest h values i e 0 75 and 0 74 respectively the persistence of hurst exponent change indicated that the future trend of most stations would be consistent with the current situation that is the east and south of this region will present a trend of wetting while the west and north will present a trend of drying at the mg stage 65 4 of the stations in this region had a sen s slope of less than 0 fig 6 b table 1 suifenhe station showed a significant growth trend and shangzhi station showed a significant downward trend meanwhile most stations i e 25 26 in this region had a hurst exponent of larger than 0 5 fig 6 e among which 13 stations were in grade ii and 6 stations were in grade iii keshan and beilin stations had the lowest h values i e 0 44 and 0 47 respectively while mudanjiang and tonghe stations had the highest h values i e 0 75 and 0 74 respectively the persistence of hurst exponent change indicated that the future trend of most stations would be consistent with the current situation that is nearly 2 3 of this region will present a trend of drying in the future at the lg stage 92 3 of the stations in this region had a sen s slope of less than 0 fig 6 c table 1 and all stations i e 26 26 in this region had a hurst exponent of larger than 0 5 fig 6 f among them 12 stations were in grade ii with weak persistence 10 stations were in grade iii with strong persistence and 4 stations were in grade iv with stronger persistence the persistence of hurst exponent change indicated that the future trend of most stations would be consistent with the current situation that is most parts of this region will present a trend of drying in the future 3 4 relationship between maize yield and drought given the significant spatial variability of dryness wetness conditions its effects on crop yield are also expected to have spatial variation the spatial distribution of crop yield should be helpful for policy makers to plan out the future planting strategy in a specific region the correlations of climate induced yields of maize in the selected nine areas with the corresponding dryness wetness conditions at different growth stages are shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the correlation coefficients between maize yields and dryness wetness conditions varied among areas and growth stages for example at the eg stage the climate induced yields of maize in harbin qiqihar and jixi areas were negatively correlated with dryness wetness conditions while that in mudanjiang jixi and yichun areas were negatively correlated with dryness wetness conditions at both mg and lg stages particularly that of the jixi area at the mg stage in contrast other areas showed positive correlations of which the climate induced yield in daqing area was significantly affected by dryness wetness conditions at both mg and lg stages on a whole the climate induced yields in western heilongjiang province were basically positively correlated with dryness wetness conditions but the correlation was predominantly negative in the eastern part precipitation and temperature are both necessary climatic factors affecting spei guo et al 2019 in heilongjiang province the yields of spring maize are primarily dependent on both temperature and precipitation zhao et al 2015 to develop the qualitative relationships between drought and climate induced yield a multivariate regression method was selected to estimate the individual effects of different climate variables using climate variables as the independent variables and climate induced yield as the dependent variable the multivariate regression method based on historical data has been widely used and it can capture the net climate effects of combined climate variables e g bhatt et al 2014 chen et al 2015 prabnakorn et al 2018 li et al 2020 the results are shown in table 2 the effect of climatic factors on the maize yield varies among places as explained below there are about four types as shown in table 2 mainly depending on 1 temperature 2 temperature and precipitation 3 temperature and dryness wetness conditions and 4 temperature precipitation and dryness wetness conditions in qiqihar jiamusi mudanjiang and suihua the climate induced of maize mainly depends on temperature in jixi yichun heihe and daxinganling the climate induced of maize mainly depends on temperature and precipitation in harbin and daqing the climate induced of maize mainly depend on type 3 and 4 respectively apparently the climate induced yields of maize in the above nine areas were all affected by temperature in contrast precipitation only affected the climate induced yields of maize in four areas and dryness wetness conditions in two areas conversely it seems that temperature is the most important climatic factor in affecting the climate induced yields of maize in northeast china while precipitation and dryness wetness conditions are the second and third most important factors respectively drought is a complex phenomenon attributed to a combination of climatic factors represented by precipitation temperature and dryness wetness conditions even the change in dryness wetness conditions obtained from the multivariate regression model was not the most important factor affecting the yield of maize in northeast china it is expected to play a significant role in affecting the yield of maize in future because moisture availability is key to the growth of many crops including maize e g labudová et al 2016 liu et al 2018a 3 5 xwt of maize climate induced yield and drought as a correlation analysis cannot derive the interdecadal relationship between climate induced yield of maize and dryness wetness conditions this study applied the xwt to investigate such relationships between them for the first time fig 8 shows the cross wavelet power spectra of climate induced yield of maize and dryness wetness conditions in the selected nine areas at the eg stage at the eg stage a statistically significant positive correlation at the 95 confidence level was detected between the climate induced yield and dryness wetness conditions in heilongjiang province in harbin it shows a 3a inter annual signal from 2006 to 2009 fig 8 a in qiqihar it had a 2 4a signal from 2000 to 2009 fig 8 b in mudanjiang it shows a 2 3a signal over 2009 2012 fig 8 c in jiamusi jixi and daqing 2 4a signal were found during 2001 2012 2000 2010 and 2000 2009 respectively fig 8 d f in yichun it had 3 4a and 3a signals during 1990 1995 and 2007 2011 respectively fig 8 g in suihua it had a 2 3a signal from 2006 to 2010 fig 8 h in heihe it had 2 4a and 8a signals during 2000 2012 and 2002 2010 respectively fig 8 i similar results can be obtained through analyzing the cross wavelet power spectra of the climate induced yields of maize and dryness wetness conditions at the mg and lg stages fig s1 and s2 however there was no statistically significant correlation detected in harbin and suihua area on the scale of less than 8 signals compared with each area at the eg stage except yichun and jiamusi area at the mg stage and heihe and jixi area at the lg stage most areas show similar relationships between the climate induced yield and dryness wetness conditions at multiple inter annual scales from 1986 to 2016 in addition it is found that there were significant periodicities on a relatively large scale at the mg stage the cross wavelet power spectra show that the relationship between the climate induced yield of maize and dryness wetness conditions at different growth stages had obvious inter annual variability this study provides necessary qualitative information for studying the impact of climate change on crop production since the obvious decadal variability in drought and climate induced yield the decadal variability should be separated from the climate change signals when studying the impact of climate change on agriculture especially in the production prediction tian et al 2015 4 discussion 4 1 trends and periodicities of droughts periodicity and trend are two important characteristics of drought time series in this study it is found that most parts of this region showed decreasing trends and will present the trends of drying in future however the detected trends in different sub regions are not the same the patterns of dryness wetness conditions and the changing characteristics of each sub region are similar at the eg and mg stages the patterns of dryness wetness conditions may be related to the complex topography and large scale climate patterns as is known heilongjiang province has a wide range of southeast southwest or southerly winds throughout the whole year the barrier effects of greater khingan mountains lesser khingan mountains and changbai mountains on these prevailing winds form rich precipitation in the mountain areas while relatively less in the plain areas shu et al 2007 therefore these sub regions should be separately considered for regional water resources planning and management in addition climate change may be an important factor affecting the dryness wetness conditions in northeast china li et al 2017 found that precipitation in heilongjiang province showed a decreasing trend sun et al 2006 showed that the increase of temperature in northeast china is much larger than that in the whole mainland china the increase of temperature will cause a series of meteorological disasters e g drought and flood yu et al 2016 found that the annual mean temperature in heilongjiang province were 2 57 with an increasing trend of 0 35 decade over 1961 2013 in addition human activities also affect the dryness wetness conditions in northeast china marvel et al 2019 liu et al 2018b found that carbon dioxide emissions in northeast china showed an increasing trend and urbanization had a positive impact on carbon dioxide emissions during 1995 2014 the change of carbon dioxide emissions may lead to regional climate change because it is an indisputable fact of the climate warming due to the increase of carbon dioxide dong et al 2014 showed that the evapotranspiration increased in summer after farmland expansion in northeast china besides drought trends this study also examined the periodicity of dryness wetness conditions at different growth stages of maize by cwt showing that changes in dryness wetness conditions exhibited significant periodicities at multiple inter annual scales in addition it is found that there are some large scale periodicities at the mg and lg stages jiang et al 2008 found that there were multiple time scale characteristics of 2 3a 8 12a and 20 25a in the temperature of northeast china in recent 100 years fu et al 2018 evaluated the meteorological drought in heilongjiang province using the precipitation data of meteorological stations and found that the meteorological drought in each season had the periodic characteristics of 2 5a specifically the periodic characteristics of 22a and 32a on a relatively large scale were found in summer and autumn zhou et al 2020 analyzed the relationship between the temperature and large scale pattern in heilongjiang province using cross wavelet the results showed that arctic oscillation ao had significant influence on average temperature with the periodicity of 3a while pacific decadal oscillation pdo had a significant influence on average temperature with the periodicity of 3 4a therefore due to the periodicities of precipitation and temperature dryness wetness conditions described in this study also exhibited significant periodicities at multiple inter annual time scales previous studies e g liu et al 2018c fang et al 2019 himayoun and roshni 2019 also detected the periodic oscillatory behaviour in dryness wetness conditions at inter annual time scale due to changes in large scale climate patterns however to better understand this oscillatory behaviour of dryness wetness conditions in northeast china further studies are still needed 4 2 effects of drought on maize yield in general the effects of drought on maize yield are not the same at different growth stages in this study it is found that the climate yield of maize is more closely related to the dryness wetness conditions at the mg and lg stages but less related to that at the eg stage ji et al 2012 simulated the natural drought environment and carried out drought stress in the key growth period of spring maize in northeast china the results showed that the seedling stage of maize is not the critical stage of water demand and the maize after seedling stage is more affected by drought stress yang et al 2015 found that maize yield in sanjiang plain of heilongjiang province is most closely related to the dryness wetness conditions in july included at the mg stage in this study while that in songnen plain is more closely related to the dryness wetness conditions in august included at the lg stage in this study guo et al 2017 found that drought would only bring a slight impact on the yield loss in northeast china at the early stage of maize growth therefore it is particularly important to manage the drought effects on maize yield at the mg and lg stages the obtained results also show that the climate induced yield of maize has a positive correlation with dryness wetness conditions in the western part but a negative correlation in the eastern part of heilongjiang province generally maize is a drought resistant crop and can grow well even in some semi arid regions e g lian et al 2016 wu et al 2016 since the western part of heilongjiang province has a semi arid climate while the eastern part has a humid climate the different climatic regimes of the western and eastern parts of the province could be the main reason why opposite correlations are found between the climate induced yield of maize and dryness wetness conditions in both sides of the province in order to analyze the difference of spatial correlation between the climate induced yield and dryness wetness conditions in the east and west this study analyzed the reasons from the perspective of land use and urbanization taking daqing harbin jixi and mudanjiang as examples i e two in the east and two in the west the land use data of the study area in four phases i e 1980 1995 2005 2015 land use changes in a daqing b jixi c harbin and d mudanjiang during 1980 2015 are shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 a the arable land area increased the forest land area slightly increased and the grassland area decreased in daqing moreover the area of urban construction and rural housing increased zhang et al 2017 showed that the change of forest to grassland and arable land could lead to the decrease in temperature in heilongjiang province and the change of grassland to arable land could lead to the increase in temperature in heilongjiang province in addition liu et al 2018b found that carbon dioxide emissions in northeast china showed an increasing trend during 1995 2014 and urbanization had a positive impact on carbon dioxide emissions therefore the land use change and urbanization may cause the temperature increase in daqing and make the climate induced yield positively related to the dryness wetness conditions in different periods it can be seen from fig 9 b that the arable land area increased the forest land area slightly reduced the grassland area reduced and the area of urban construction and rural housing slightly increased in jixi therefore the temperature of jixi may increase however it can be seen from table 2 that precipitation is also the main factor affecting the climate induced yield in jixi due to the large amount of precipitation in the eastern part of heilongjiang province it may cause a negative correlation between the climate induced yield and dryness wetness conditions known from fig 9 c the arable land area and grassland area in harbin increased while the forest land area decreased thus land use change may slow down the temperature growth in harbin in recent years due to the large growth of urban construction and rural housing area and the level of urbanization has developed rapidly it may cause the different correlations between the climate induced yield and dryness wetness conditions in different periods in mudanjiang the arable land area and grassland area slightly increased while the forest land area slightly decreased fig 9 d moreover the urban construction and rural housing area basically remained unchanged therefore the land use change and urbanization may cause the temperature decrease in mudanjiang and make the climate induced yield negative related to the dryness wetness conditions in different periods the results in subsection 3 5 show that dryness wetness conditions at different growth stages have resulted in obvious inter annual changes in the climate induced yield of maize it is also found that compared with those at the eg and lg stages there were relatively large scale significant periodicities at the mg stage figs 8 s1 and s2 this may be caused by the same reason for the periodicities of dryness wetness conditions mentioned in subsection 4 1 moreover most area showed significant 3 4a correlations during 2000 2010 sun et al 2018 showed that the ao increased from 1990 to 2000 but showed decreasing trend after 2000 zhang et al 2017 showed that the cold flow over asia was stronger and the heat exchange between the north and the south was enhanced when the ao decreased leading to the temperature change in northeast china wang et al 2016 showed that pdo changed from warm phase to cold phase around 2000 and the phase change caused the decrease in temperature growth in northeast china zhou et al 2020 showed that ao had significant influences on average temperature with the periodicity of 3a and pdo had significant influences on average temperature with the periodicity of 3 4a therefore large scale climate patterns may be the main reason for the significant periodicity of 3 4a in heilongjiang province during 2000 2010 however the relevant effects on the climate induced yield of maize in northeast china should be further examined in future 4 3 litations and implications this study has investigated how regional climatic conditions and changes affected the maize yield in heilongjiang province besides precipitation temperature and dry wet conditions the maize yield is also dependent on other factors such as nitrogen fertilizers rezaei and lashkari 2019 solar radiation yang et al 2019 and agriculture management system casali et al 2018 nie et al 2018 found that both the effective precipitation and the water demand of maize during the growth period were generally decreasing in heilongjiang province it seems that more irrigation should be carried out during the maize growth period to maintain the maize yield of this province there should be further studies on the effects of supplementary irrigation on the maize yield in heilongjiang province the results of this study are based on 31 years of maize yield per unit land area from 1986 to 2016 it will be desirable if a longer dataset of maize yield is available although the hurst exponent is useful to predict the general trend of future droughts it cannot predict the severity or duration of future droughts therefore to ensure a stable maize yield in future it is advisable to consider implementing adequate crop management measures such as more effectively mitigate the impact of flooding and waterlogging to crop yield and cultivating excellent maize varieties that are more resistant to droughts it would be beneficial to develop a multi dimensional model to evaluate both climatic variables and other physical variables that will affect the maize yield moreover different regression models have been established for the nine selected areas in northeast china however these models may be region dependent the study area is located in the cold region and the models are applicable for other regions with different climatic characteristics beyond heilongjiang province relationship between drought and climate induced yield should be re established and the models may need more validations nevertheless the proposed regression models may have interpreted the individual effects of different climate variables on the yield of maize from the perspective of climatology 5 conclusions this study analyzes the spatiotemporal characteristics of dryness wetness condition in a specific period and firstly introduces cross wavelet analysis to explore the relationships between drought and climate induced yield of maize in northeast china the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 reof divides the dryness wetness conditions of maize into four sub regions at different growth stages at the eg stage there was a persistent drought in the western and southeastern parts but the drought trend eased slightly the central part presented the wetting trend while the northern part was in an unstable state with the alternation of wetness and dryness at the mg stage there was a wetting trend in the western part a drying trend in the central and southeastern parts and an unstable state in the northern part at the lg stage the western and eastern parts presented a trend of wetting while the southwestern and northern parts presented a trend of drying 2 the results of cwt showed that the variation of dryness wetness conditions included significant periodicities with multiple time scales 3 the persistence of hurst exponent change indicated that the future trend of most stations would be consistent with the current situation at the eg stage the east and south of this region would show a trend of wetting while the west and north would show a trend of drying at the mg stage most of this region would present the trend of drying at the lg stage most parts of this region would present the trends of drying 4 based on the results of cross wavelet analysis the climate induced yield of maize and dryness wetness conditions at different growth stages had obvious statistically significant interannual relationships climatic factors that affect the climate induced yield of maize in northeast china are first temperature second precipitation and third dryness wetness conditions this knowledge of the interannual variability can be useful for the future crop management of northeast china credit
