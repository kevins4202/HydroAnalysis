10975,accurate estimation of daily reference evapotranspiration et0 are vital for water resource management and irrigation decision making based on the public weather forecasts numerous models have been successfully used for daily et0 estimating while too many models available for selection which causes confusion regarding model selection for specific climate regions in this paper the estimating performances of six et0 equations using public weather forecast for a lead time of 1 7 days were compared for four main climatic region across china and then the most accurate equation was recommended for each climate region meanwhile the applicability of every equation was assessed in relation to four climates including subtropical monsoon climate cwa temperate continental climate dfc temperate monsoon climate dwa and mountain plateau climate hg the penman monteith forecast pmf equation which consisting of an adaptation of fao56 pm equation using temperature and weather type forecast as inputs provided the best et0 estimation performance in cwa and hg climates and the temperature penman monteith pmt equation using only the temperature data obtained the most accurate average results for the dwa and dfc climates the best and the second best estimation performance for each climate usually provided by pmf and pmt equations since they both have the same advantage of following the conceptual approach of the fao56 pm equation further the third and the fourth choice would be the hargreaves samani hs and the blaney criddle bc respectively while the thornwaite th and the mccloud mc yielded high errors and may not be applicable for et0 estimation for most climatic regions as a whole the pmf and pmt equations were better than the other equations and thus these two equations were recommended for daily et0 estimation for the near future at all climate regions across china keywords public weather forecast reference evapotranspiration estimation 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a fundamental element of the hydrologic cycle its reasonable estimation is important for the calculation of crop water requirements irrigation system design and water resource management et can be measured directly by field experiment but this approach is costly and laborious based on the above facts some mathematical models have been proposed for et estimation which relies on reference evapotranspiration et0 with the corresponding crop coefficient k c thus the precise computation of et0 is of vital importance for obtaining an accurate value for et jensen 1968 allen et al 2005 perera et al 2014 on the basis of input datum and procedures et0 calculating methods can be roughly classified as direct and indirect methods perera et al 2014 for the direct methods current and historical datum is used to calculate medium term or long term et0 by using artificial or computational neural net works anns or cnns or time series methods in terms of indirect methods the short term or medium term et0 is calculated by empirical or analytical models such as the penman monteith allen et al 1998 hargreaves hargreaves and samani 1985 or blaney criddle blaney and criddle 1962 equations with forecasted weather variables in terms of the direct methods there are two typical methods that use historical data for medium term or long term et0 calculation namely time series procedures and artificial or computational neural networks anns or cnns previous studies confirmed that the direct methods perform well in weekly or monthly et0 estimating by historical observed meteorological data tahir 1998 trajkovic et al 2003 landeras et al 2008 while further research focused on daily et0 estimation cai et al 2007 perera et al 2014 yang et al 2019 for the irrigation system operators and farmers irrigation scheduling is an important on farm practice which requires accurate short term daily et0 that varies with the weather perera et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 and the daily et0 estimated by the weather forecasts are of great value for irrigation decision making since the weather forecast message is the dynamic data that varies with the change of weather hence the direct procedure which uses the historical data as the model inputs might not be applicable in short term daily et0 estimating the hourly or daily weather variables are the input data for the indirect methods which are more suitable for daily estimation of et0 the empirical and analytical models are the most commonly used indirect methods such as the blaney criddle bc hargreaves samani hs mccloud mc and penman monteith luo et al 2014 perera et al 2014 xiong et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 according to the type of input weather data the weather datum can be categorized into numerical weather prediction nwp outputs and public weather forecasts the nwp outputs contain all the weather parameters needed for the calculation of indirect methods numerous studies reported that using the nwp outputs in et0 forecasting could produce reliable results duce et al 2000 perera et al 2014 however the nwp outputs are usually open for researchers but not for the public in some countries such as china and these outputs are also difficult for non professionals to analyze considering this fact it is difficult to apply the nwp outputs in practical use recently the public weather forecast for a lead time of up to 15 days was made available free for public use in china the performance of this public weather forecast had made substantial progress and has motivated the daily et0 estimation based on these data in china the public weather forecast is derived from nwp outputs which come from the global regional assimilation and prediction system grapes that was built by the meteorological department chen and xue 2004 xue 2005 considering the requirement of weather information for the general public nwp outputs were modified by the meteorologist in order to produce public weather forecasts that contained fewer but better weather variables including temperature weather type and wind scale cai et al 2007 predicted daily et0 using the public weather forecast message and results indicated the et0 predictions were appropriate to be used for real time irrigation management since the temperature forecast was the most accurately forecasted parameter luo et al 2014 employed the hargreaves samani hs equation with forecasted temperature to estimate et0 for lead time up to 7 days for 4 sites across china and obtained an accurate forecast outcome after that the blaney criddle bc and pm equations were adopted to estimate daily et0 using weather forecasts in no more than 8 regions in china xiong et al 2015 yang et al 2016 liu et al 2017 according to the et0 estimation results most of the approaches provided reasonable results using public weather forecast however these studies used only one model to estimate et0 for a specific area while lacking of model comparison caused confusion about whether this model is the best one for that region moreover some researchers have compared several equations for one location and determined the best one for that area zhang et al 2015 luo et al 2016 nevertheless duplicative work is still needed in these areas due to the lack of a generalization rule for spatial utilization to date approximately 50 et0 models have been developed lu et al 2005 liu et al 2017 and too many available models have caused great confusion regarding how to choose the proper model to estimate daily et 0 in different irrigation districts located in different climatic regions or climates this paper evaluates the estimation performance of 6 common used et0 equations by using public weather forecast in order to find the best one for the researcher and irrigation use in different climatic regions the objectives of this study are twofold 1 to compare the accuracy of et0 estimation using public weather forecast by these 6 equations for 4 main climate regions across china and 2 to recommend the most precise equation for daily et0 estimating for each climate region 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area the study area was within a wide range of climates across china the köppen climate classification was adopted for division of the climates in this work and previous work found that the köppen system of climate classification was suitable for disentangling the correlations between the fao56 pm and other temperature based models almorox et al 2015 based on the köppen system the study area was divided into four different climate types subtropical monsoon climate cwa temperate continental climate dfc temperate monsoon climate dwa and mountain plateau climate hg peel et al 2007 perera et al 2014 almorox et al 2015 a total of 61 weather stations were selected in these four climate regions and the amount of weather sites selected for the cwa dfc dwa and hg climate regions were 25 17 10 and 9 respectively the distribution of these stations across the different climates is shown in fig 1 the stations are located between latitudes 22 28 50 25 north and longitudes 79 93 130 28 east moreover the annual temperature sunshine duration relative humidity wind speed and elevation ranged within 1 4 23 8 c 0 90 4 79 m s 2 35 11 42 h 39 44 79 88 and 5 2 4801 0 m respectively the specific characteristics of the 61 weather sites is summarized in table 1 including latitude longitude elevation annual average temperature t mean annual average wind speed u 2 annual average sunshine duration sdun and annual average relative humidity rhmean 2 2 data daily et0 estimation for the near future required the public weather forecast message as input thus the public weather forecasts with lead times of 1 to 7 day for 61 weather stations in china during the period from january 1 2013 to december 31 2016 were gathered from weather china http www weather com cn the weather parameters included in the public weather forecast were maximum temperature minimum temperature weather type and wind scale the weather type forecast are qualitative data that contain seven types of weather conditions including sunny clear to overcast overcast rainy snow dust and haze and these forecasted weather type can be used for estimating solar radiation cai et al 2007 which plays a key role in et0 estimation by fao56 pm equation the wind scales are divided into 10 levels from 0 to 10 cma 2003 and each level can be transformed to wind speed at 2 m height allen et al 1998 cai et al 2007 which is needed for the et0 estimation of fao56 pm equation for the model calibration and performance evaluation the meteorological data for the same stations were collected from the china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc nmic cn for the period from january 1 1999 to december 31 2016 the weather parameters used from the daily meteorological data were air pressure wind speed relative humidity sunshine duration and minimum and maximum temperature further the meteorological dataset was divided into two parts one for model calibration january 1 1999 to december 31 2012 and the remainder for the comparison of et0 estimation by calibrated models january 1 2013 to december 31 2016 2 3 methodology both the temperature based and combination methods have been successfully used in et0 estimation in china and reliable performance was obtained luo et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 in this study six equations were adopted for et0 estimating including five temperature based equations and one combination equation the temperature based equation used only the temperature data for et0 calculation and the combination equation needed more than one weather variables as the inputs such as the fao56 penman monteith fao56 pm equation the fao56 pm equation was considered to the most appropriated method for et0 calculation allen et al 1998 cai et al 2007 perera et al 2014 and thus we modified it and obtained a new combination equation called the penman monteith forecast pmf for et0 estimation using weather forecast data however the limitation of the pmf was that it required several weather parameters as input and some of them were unavailable or low accuracy such as weather type forecast and wind scale forecast in this situation simpler model that relies on fewer inputs such as temperature based equation could be a great alternative the temperature forecasts appeared to be the most accurate parameter among all forecasted variables luo et al 2014 hence five temperature based equations which consisted of the hargreaves samani hs blaney criddle bc mccloud mc thornthwaite th and the temperature penman monteith pmt were employed in this study as they were also widely used around the world hu et al 2011 xu et al 2012 luo et al 2014 xiong et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 ren et al 2016 almorox et al 2018 2 3 1 penman monteith forecast equation the fao56 penman monteith fao56 pm equation is recommended by the fao and was considered as the sole standard approach for et0 calculation allen et al 1998 due to the lack of lysimeter measurement data the et0 calculated from the fao56 pm using full observed meteorological data has been used as the benchmark for the evaluation of estimated et0 the fao56 pm equation is allen et al 1998 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 is the daily reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 r n is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 t is the mean daily air temperature at a 2 m height c u 2 is the mean daily wind speed at a 2 m height m s 1 e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa δ is the slope of the vapor pressure versus temperature curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 the fao56 pm equation after proper modifications can also be used to estimate et0 using weather forecast data cai et al 2007 yang et al 2016 and thus this equation was modified and called pmf which was the only combination equation used in this study however public weather forecast data do not contain enough weather elements for pmf estimating and cai et al 2007 proposed an analytical method am that can be applied to convert the weather forecast data such as the weather type forecast into parameters that can be used by pmf previous studies reported that solar radiation r s played an important role in et0 calculation and showed largest impact on the accuracy of the estimated et0 arca et al 2004 perera et al 2014 therefore the first trial was conducted to obtain the r s the r s can be estimated by the weather type forecast while this forecast datum were qualitative data that cannot be directly used for the et0 calculation hence the am proposed by cai et al 2007 was adopted to convert the weather type forecast into quantitative datum the am was consists of eqs 2 4 as followed and table 2 showed the relationship between the weather type forecast and coefficient of sunshine duration the r s can be calculated as follows 2 n a n 3 n 24 π ω s 4 r s a s b s n n r a where n is the forecasted sunshine duration hour a is the coefficient of sunshine duration n is the daylight duration or maximum sunshine duration hours r s is the solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 r a is the zenith radiation mj m 2 day 1 a s b s is the fraction of extraterrestrial radiation reaching the soil surface on clear days n n and the recommendation values of a s and b s were 0 25 and 0 5 respectively allen et al 1998 cai et al 2007 daily saturation vapor pressure e can be assumed by the dew point temperature as follows 5 e o t dew 0 6108 exp 17 27 t d e w t d e w 237 3 where e is the daily saturation vapor pressure kpa t dew is the minimum temperature c thought t min is a good estimator of t dew for humid climate jensen et al 1990 allen et al 1998 t dew is usually lower than t min for other climate regions todorovic et al 2013 raziei and pereira 2013 almorox et al 2018 for humid climates t mean at should be used where the correction factor varied with the climate aridity of the station todorovic et al 2013 raziei and pereira 2013 with at ranging from 1 to 5 c and differently for arid to dry sub humid climates t min is not an adequate estimator of t dew but a correction of t min at with at ranging 1 to 3 c todorovic et al 2013 raziei and pereira 2013 ren et al 2016 in this study the trial and error procedure was used for each climate zone in order to obtain the t dew value that minimized rmse when comparing et0 estimated from the pmf or pmt equations with the estimates of the fao56 pm et0 the corrections of t dew are defined in table 3 for each climate zone across china the wind scale forecast cannot be directly used for calculation since this forecast data consisted of a qualitative observation as was the weather type forecast through the am method wind scale forecast can be converted to wind speed at a height of 2 m which is needed for pmf but the low accuracy of the forecasted wind speed led to a decline of et0 estimation zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 yang et al 2016 analyzed the performance of wind scale forecast for six stations across china and found that the values of forecasted wind speed were higher than those of observed for 24 48 108 43 which means there was system errors when transforming the wind scale forecast into wind speed the fao recommended that the wind speed can be assumed as the default value of 2 ms 1 when wind data are unavailable allen et al 1998 and this constant value was the average of wind speed for over 2000 weather stations found around the world many researchers found that the wind speed value of 2 ms 1 was suitable for most locations in different climate regions jensen et al 1990 allen et al 1998 trajkovic 2005 and this default value was adopted as the input of wind speed for pmf however for the arid and very windy hyper arid regions the local average value was adopted as a more appropriate alternative ren et al 2016 2 3 2 blaney criddle equation the blaney criddle bc equation was proposed for et0 estimation in america blaney and criddle 1962 and this equation was described as 6 e t 0 bc p 0 46 t 8 13 where et0 bc is the forecasted et0 mm day 1 t is the daily average temperature c p is the percentage of daily daytime hours out of total daytime hours of the whole year which is calculated by the latitude and julian day information 2 3 3 hargreaves samani equation the hargreaves samani hs equation is one of the most commonly used temperature based equations and it s established on the basis of the lysimeter data from california hargreaves and samani 1985 although the hs equation was developed for a sub arid climate reliable et0 results have been obtained in other climate area as long as the hs was calibrated the hs is expressed as 7 e t 0 h s 0 408 c r a t max t min e t max t min 2 17 8 where the et0 hs is the et0 provided by hs equation mm day 1 r a is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2day 1 t max and t min are the maximum and minimum air temperature respectively c the empirical coefficients c and e are initially set to 0 0023 and 0 5 respectively hargreaves and samani 1985 previous studies indicated that the accuracy of the hs computation result can be improved by calibrating the empirical coefficients of c and e in different climate regions since hs has regional variability hargreaves and allen 2003 gavilán et al 2006 hu et al 2011 the et0 values calculated by the fao56 pm was taken as the benchmark and these two coefficients were calibrated by the use of least square method 2 3 4 mccloud equation the mccloud mc equation was developed in florida and was applied for calculating the et0 of turf and golf courses mccloud 1995 the mc was described as 8 e t 0 m c k w 1 8 t where the et0 mc is the et0 provided by mc equation mm day 1 k and w are both default values which were recommended as 0 254 and 1 07 respectively alexandris et al 2008 and t is the daily mean temperature oc the coefficient of w and k were calibrated using a least square method to find the value that minimized the rmse when comparing estimated et0 by the mc and the fao56 pm et0 for each climate zones 2 3 5 thornthwaite equation the thornthwaite th was proposed in eastern america based on a local experimental dataset this equation assumed that there was no advection between dry and wet air and et0 was calculated by the monthly mean temperature considering the monthly average temperature might be lower than 0 c for some areas a modified form developed by willmott et al 1985 was adopted and expressed as thornthwaite 1948 willmott et al 1985 9 e t 0 t h 0 16 c 10 t e f i a c 415 85 32 24 t e f 0 43 t e f 2 t e f 0 c 0 c t e f 26 c t e f 26 c where e t 0 t h is the et0 provided by th equation mm day 1 i is a thermal index imposed by the local normal climatic temperature regime the exponent a is a function of i a 6 75 10 7 i 3 7 71 10 5 i 2 1 7912 10 2 i 0 49239 i is computed by i σ n 1 12 0 2 t n 1 514 t n is the monthly average temperature t ef is computed as t e f 0 5 k 3 t max t min n 24 n and k is the default value of 0 72 or 0 69 for the best et0 estimation pereira and pruitt 2004 n is the photoperiod for a given day to convert the estimates from a standard monthly to a daily time scale a correction factor c was used c n 360 the k values for tef was calibrated using a trial and error procedure to find the values that minimized the rmse when comparing et0 estimated with the th and the fao56 pm et0 and the values of best fit k were 0 71 0 68 0 69 0 73 for the hg dwa dfc and cwa climates respectively 2 3 6 temperature penman monteith equation the fao 56 pm equation that uses only the maximum and minimum air temperatures for et0 computation is called the temperature penman monteith equation pmt allen 1996 trajkovic et al 2003 yang et al 2019 it is worth mentioning that the model structure for both pmf and pmt were the same the only difference between them was the computation of solar radiation the solar radiation for pmt was estimated by temperature and calculated as follows 10 r s k r s t max t min 0 5 r a where r s is the solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 r a is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 day 1 t max and t min are the daily maximum and minimum temperatures respectively c and k rs is the adjustment coefficient and k rs 0 16 for interior locations and k rs 0 19 for coastal locations trajkovic 2003 moreover the k rs value was calibrated using a trial and error procedure to find the value that minimized the rmse when comparing estimated et0 with the pmt and the fao56 pm et0 and the correction of k rs were showed in table 4 for each climate zones the values of corrected k rs for cwa dfc and dwa climate zones were closed to the results which proposed by almorox et al 2018 for the different köppen climate types over the world 2 4 calibration method previous studies pointed out that the temperature equation has regional variability in different climatic zones and the accuracy of the equation can be improved after calibration hargreaves and allen 2003 luo et al 2014 feng et al 2017 since the fao 56 pm was considered as the sole standard approach for et0 calculation allen et al 1998 the calculated et0 from the fao 56 pm using observed datum was applied to calibrate all five temperature based equations including hs bc mc th and pmt both the hs and mc equations contain the parameters that varied with regional variability the c and e for the hs and the k and w for the mc respectively hence the least squares method lsm can be used to correct the parameters without changing the original structure of the hs and mc equations for the other three equations including bc th and pmt they were calibrated by the linear regression formula which was one of the simplest lsm trajkovic 2003 ding et al 2007 meanwhile due to lack of the lysimeter data the fao pm et0 was used as baseline for the model calibration using full observed data set the linear regression formula is as follows 11 e t 0 p m a b e t 0 t e m where et0 pm is calculated by fao 56 pm equation mm day 1 et0 tem is computed from the temperature based equation mm day 1 a and b are the correction coefficients and a is the et0 pm intercept of the regression line and b is the slope of the regression line that represents the average change in et0 pm for every change unit in et0 tem which means the values of b might indicate the tendency of under over prediction if the values are greater lower than one for the origin temperature based equation compare to the fao 56 pm equation 2 5 performance evaluation five statistical indices were adopted for evaluation including the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nmse ratio of mean rm and correlation coefficient r the mae was used to measure the deviation between the estimation and observed values the level of agreement between the estimation and observed values was measured using the rmse cai et al 2007 perera et al 2014 yang et al 2016 since the dimensions of forecasted weather variables were different it s difficult to compare their accuracy and thus the nmse was adopted and classified all variables into the same dimension so that their estimation accuracy can be compared intuitively the rm value was defined as the mean of the estimated value relative to the observed value and was used to quantify the bias this ratio might indicate over under prediction if the values are greater lower than one tomas burguera et al 2017 the r was employed to measure the correlation between the estimation and observed data an r value close to one illustrates goodness of fit between forecast and observed data traore et al 2015 yang et al 2016 these five statistical indicators have been widely used to assess the performance of et0 estimation in previous studies gavilán et al 2006 martinez and thepadia 2010 luo et al 2014 perera et al 2014 yang et al 2016 the statistical indices were calculated as follows 12 m a e i 1 n f i o i n 13 r m s e i 1 n f i o i 2 n 14 n m s e i 1 n f i o i 2 i 1 n o i 2 15 r m i 1 n o i f i i 1 n o i 2 16 r i 1 n f i f o i o i 1 n f i f 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where n is the number of observations fi and oi are respectively the i th observed and estimated values and f and o are respectively the average of fi and oi for the observation period 2 6 data processing the observed meteorological data were split into two parts one for the calibration of the temperature based equations january 1 1999 to december 31 2012 and the remainder for the comparison of et0 estimation by calibrated methods january 1 2013 to december 31 2016 then to assess the ability of estimating et0 by each equation when weather forecast were used the public weather forecast message january 1 2013 to december 31 2016 were inputted to the equation for et0 estimating which were cross compared for 4 main climates and then the most accurate equation was recommended for each climate region fig 2 shows the workflow of the et0 estimating in this study 3 results and discussion in this study both the public weather forecasts message and et0 estimation using public weather forecast were assessed as the input the accuracy of the temperature and weather type forecasts directly influenced the estimation performance of et0 thus they should be evaluated for the first then the performance of the daily et0 estimation obtained by the six equations were evaluated 3 1 forecasting performance for weather variables 3 1 1 temperature for the temperature based equations the air temperature forecasts were the only input factor which played a key role in et0 estimation additionally both the net long wave radiation and saturation vapor pressure were also computed from the maximum temperature t max and minimum temperature t min when comparing the five statistical indicators the nmse rm and r were appropriate for measure the accuracy of the forecasted weather variables as they reflected the bias and allowed perceiving the magnitude of the errors according to these three indicators the accuracy of t max and t min were declined with the increasing lead time for all climates for t max the average nmse rm and r for lead time 1 to 7 day ranged from 0 14 0 22 1 04 1 06 and 0 94 0 91 respectively for t min the average nmse rm and r varied between 0 11 0 22 1 00 1 02 and 0 98 0 95 respectively the box plots of statistical indices related to the t max and t min for each climate regions were shown in fig 3 in the aspect of t max the forecast values were higher than the observed values for all climates according to the rm indicating a tendency of over estimation of t max on the other hand for the t min the rm were slightly greater than but close to one suggesting the slightly over estimation of the t min the over estimation of both the t max and t min might probably result in over estimation of et0 by the temperature based methods on the basis of three indicators the accuracy of t min were slightly better than that of the t max for all climate regions and this outcome was consistent with the previous studies in china zhang et al 1999 luo et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 the reason for the lower precision of t max as compared to that of t min might be that the diurnal variation of t max is greater than t min which means it is more difficult to forecast t max due to its larger gradient compared with the forecast performance for different climate zones three indicators showed inconsistent results and it was hard to distinguish a climate zone that corresponded to highest and lowest forecast performance for the air temperature since the accuracy of temperature forecast might not be significantly correlated with climate zone 3 1 2 sunshine duration previous studies found that the sunshine duration sdun was the largest error source for et0 estimation among all forecasted weather variables perera et al 2014 yang et al 2016 for the pmf equation sdun was estimated by the weather type forecast since the weather type forecasts consisted of qualitative data they must be converted into the adjustment coefficient of sdun a for the calculation of sdun and then performance was assessed by comparing the estimated sdun with the observed values for lead times of 1 to 7 day the average nmse rm and r ranged between 0 55 0 68 0 91 1 13 and 0 46 0 23 respectively the rm values for cwa and dfc were substantially lower than one while reversed for hg and dfc climates and this results might be possibly lead to the over or under estimation of et0 for the corresponded climate region comparing the forecast performance of sdun and temperature in terms of three indicators it is obvious that the accuracy of sdun was much lower than that of the temperature the lower accuracy of sdun might be due to two main reasons 1 greater errors occurred when the weather type forecast was converted into sdun 2 the most important factor for sdun estimation was the adjustment coefficient of sdun which was generalized by the solar radiation information from beijing station that located in the cwa climate thus using the same adjustment coefficient for all regions lead to different degrees of errors without considering regional differences the forecast performance of sdun for the four climatic regions is presented in fig 3 the weather stations located in the dwa had the best prediction outcome and similar results were obtained by the other three climates though adjustment coefficient of sdun was derived from the beijing station which was located in cwa climate the prediction performance of sdun in cwa climate was rather modest suggesting the coefficient of each climate should be calibrated using a large number of the local sites 3 2 calibration of temperature based equation previous studies indicated that the performance of temperature based equation varied with the change of climate and showed that it is necessary to calibrate the model in order to improve the accuracy allen et al 1998 hargreaves and allen 2003 hu et al 2011 feng et al 2017 the et0 computed from the fao56 pm equation was used as the benchmark for the calibration of the temperature based equations over four climate zones the parameter corrections for the five equations by köppen class are presented in table 5 for the hs equation the corrected c in this study were 0 0022 0 0020 and 0 0020 respectively for the hg dfc and cwa climate regions which were close to the the value of c recommended as 0 0023 allen et al 1998 however for dwa climate much higher corrected c was obtained c 0 0042 similar results were found by almorox and grieser 2016 that the best fit coefficient c were 0 00218 0 00174 and 0 00358 respectively for the df cw and dw climates over the world the corrected c for both the df and cw climates were slightly lower than the 0 0023 but reversed for the dw climate the value of e recommended by allen et al 1998 was 0 50 and the corrected e in this study were 0 5433 0 5466 and 0 5227 respectively for the hg dfc and cwa climates and all of them were slightly higher than the 0 50 for dwa climate the corrected e was 0 2911 that drastically lower than the recommended value but closed to the value of e 0 26577 suggested by almorox and grieser 2016 for the dw climate overall results indicating that the inappropriately low value of c 0 0023 and high value of e 0 50 in the original hs equation might bring in large error for et0 estimation and thus the empirical coefficients c and e need to be corrected for different climate zones especially the dwa climate in terms of the mc equation the corrected w for the hg dwa dfc and cwa were 1 088 1 058 1 059 and 1 065 respectively the coefficient w for the dwa dfc and cwa were all lower than the recommended value of 1 07 while opposite result was found by hg and both the calibrated w and k for the hg were greater than the original values suggested that the mc equation tended underestimated et0 for this climate the corrected k were 0 3465 0 4055 0 3662 and 0 3228 respectively for the hg dwa dfc and cwa climates and the calibrated k for all four climates were higher than the 0 254 for the range of 27 60 above results suggested that it s necessary to correct the empirical coefficients k and w for different climate zones in order to minimize the system errors for the other three equations the bc th and pmt the best estimate of corrected a for the four climates were ranged between 1 0370 0 1900 0 5708 1 0524 and 0 0612 0 1277 respectively and the corrected values of b varied between 0 7450 0 9137 0 7361 0 8332 and 0 9558 1 0059 respectively trajkovic 2005 and ding et al 2007 calibrated the th and pmt equations and acquired the calibrated coefficients of a and b the values of a were 0 5650 and 0 013 respectively for the th and pmt the b values were 0 7842 and 0 9490 respectively and the corrected a and b in this study was close to those obtained by previous findings trajkovic 2005 ding et al 2007 if the a and b values are respectively close to zero and one it might be indicated a great goodness of fit between the original temperature based equation and fao56 pm equation therefore the greatest goodness of fit with the fao56 pm was found by pmt followed with bc and th for their origin version for bc and th equations at all climates the values of b were lower than one which indicating the tendency of over prediction for these equations compared to fao 56 pm equation in et0 estimating before calibration and thus the calibration for the temperature based equations were necessary further the b values for pmt were close to one might because the model structure for the pmt and fao 56 pm were the same after calibration these five temperature based equations can be used for et0 estimating 3 3 estimating performance of et0 based on weather forecast data figs 4 7 present the statistical indices for the average performance of the six equations for all climate regions for lead times of 1 to 7 days according to the four statistical indices the performance of the et0 estimation declined as the lead time increased for all equations and climates and this result might be due to the input variables as the accuracy of the temperature and weather type forecasts decreased with increasing lead time results showed that the rm values for the pmf pmt and hs were closed to target one for all climates varied in a short range from 0 95 to 1 00 suggesting the et0 by these three equations and et0 calculated by fao56 pm were statistically similar this results were similar with the previous studies that the pmt and hs tended to slightly under estimate daily pm et0 ren et al 2016 the values of rm for bc and th ranged from 0 91 1 02 and et0 bc and et0 th also under estimated compared with the pm et0 in hg and dwa climates while fitted well with pm et0 for dfc and cwa climates with rm ranging from 0 98 to 1 02 large deviation was found by mc that the rm ranged from 0 82 to 1 25 though the temperature were slightly over forecast most of the equations provided slightly underestimated results yang et al 2016 found that the temperature forecast was accurate enough for et0 estimating and the accuracy of et0 estimation declined no more than 1 when observed temperature data was replaced by the forecasted temperature meanwhile the estimation performance of pmf was better than most temperature based equations on the whole even if the weather type forecast deviated largely based on the above facts the accuracy of et0 estimation might be determined by the model structure in a large degree for the spatial analysis considering the climate classes table 6 presents the average statistical indices for the estimation performance of et0 provided by six equations for each climate region for the hg climate the lowest mae was found by the pmf and pmt and the highest r values were provided by three equations the pmf pmt and hs the rmse showed a clear rank in that pmf obtained the lowest rmse values followed by pmt bc and hs the values of rm for the pmt was perfectly fitted the target one and the pmf hs th and bc all tended to slightly under estimate the et0 while the mc deviated greatly considering all indicators pmf appeared as the optimal option followed by pmt hs and bc while mc and th were completely not applicable for this climate nevertheless there is still room for its improvement for the pmf equation as mentioned previously the performance of the forecasted sdun was poor for all climates which led to error in et0 estimation by the pmf the sdun was estimated from the coefficient of sdun which was derived from solar radiation data from the beijing station located in the cwa climate therefore better performance for the pmf might be expected if the coefficient of sdun was optimized by local data for each climate region in the dwa climate the mae and rmse presented similar results that the lowest values was obtained by pmt followed by pmf and hs except for the mc the average r values for all equations were similar and ranged from 0 86 to 0 89 the values of rm for all equations were lower than but closed to the target one except for the mc as a whole the pmt appeared to be the most accurate equation for the dwa climate followed with pmf hs and bc while the th and mc might not be applicable for dwa climate for this climate the estimation performance of pmt were better than that of the pmf indicating that using the forecasted temperature for solar radiation estimating lead to more accurate et0 results than those using the weather type forecast the climatic characteristics of the dwa is dry with little rainfall liu et al 2006liu et al 2006 and almorox et al 2015 recommend that the mc might not be suitable in semi arid or arid regions and this study supports the previous results even the mc equation was calibrated the th equation is based on an assumption that there was no advection between dry and wet air and this assumption is rare in sub arid or arid regions liu et al 2006 moreover the meteorological characteristics for both the hg and dwa was dry thus the under prediction of et0 by th for these two climate regions might be due to this assumption for the dfc climate all four indicators presented identical results in that the smallest error was found by pmt followed by hs pmf bc th and mc thus when all equations were compared the first and second choice for this climate would be pmt and hs respectively the accuracy of et0 estimation of pmt and hs were compared for inner mongolia of china across dfc and dwa climates and results showed that the pmt performed better than hs for most meteorological stations ren et al 2016 hence our study was consistent with the previous findings that the average performance of pmt was greater than that of hs for both the dfc and dwa climates and the reason might be the pmt has the same advantage of following the conceptual approach of the fao56 pm equation because variables lacking are replaced by the estimators ren et al 2016 for the cwa climate pmf provided the lowest errors in terms of the four indices followed by pmt hs and th while bc and mc performed the worst the above result indicated that the pmf appeared as the most accurate equation followed by pmt hs th bc and mc almorox et al 2015 pointed out that the solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit have a strong impact on et0 in humid regions while the temperature based equation did not take these two factors into consideration and hence had lower accuracy the cwa climate was influenced by the humid monsoon especially at the costal stations fuzhou xiamen shantou zhuhai ganyu shanghai and hangzhou and thus the pmf showed the greatest estimation performance for these locations as a whole the performance of pmf was better than that of the five temperature based equations which might be because the weather type forecast was included in the model calculation further reasons for the applicability of all five temperature based equations were detected the temperature data was the only input factor for all temperature based equations thus the estimation performance clearly reflected the quality of the model structure since identical input data was used in this study the capability of the pmt equation for et0 estimation using the public weather forecast were superior to the other four temperature based equations it is underlined that the best estimation of et0 for the dwa and dfc climates were given by the pmt which also performed well in cwa and hg climates compared with the estimation performance of the pmf results showed that using air temperature forecast for solar radiation estimating improved the accuracy in et0 estimates for dfc and dwa climates while reversed for the cwa climate the model structure of the pmt was similar with the fao56 pm equation and this might be a great advantage for other temperature based simple equations from a practical viewpoint since the weather type forecast and wind scale forecast were low accuracy using the pmt equation with the temperature forecast to estimate daily et0 was a great alternative our study strongly supported the previous findings proposed by ren et al 2016 and almorox et al 2018 that the pmt could be recommended for et0 calculation when weather data were unavailable or low accurate the hs equation was the second choice for the dfc climate and the third choice for both the cwa hg and dwa climates which indicated that the hs was suitable for most climate zones for et0 estimation almorox et al 2015 assessed 11 temperature based models for et0 estimation at 4362 climatological stations worldwide and results showed that the hs appeared as the most accurate approach for tropical arid temperate cold and polar climates while the th and mc performed the worst for the vast majority of climates for the north of china a few of temperature models were compared by liu et al 2006 including hs mc and th and results showed that et0 computed by hs exhibited goodness of fit with those from fao56 pm followed with mc and th the present study was in accordance with the above results which indicated that the hs performed well for most regions both in terms of et0 estimation and a primary reason for the high accuracy might be due to its robust model structure the reason why the other three temperature based equations were not suited for most climatic regions might be related to the model structure and the background conditions when the equations were originally proposed the mc equation was developed in florida and was applied for calculating the et0 of turf and golf courses mccloud 1955 and the coefficients k and w were generalized from local climatic conditions which consisted of the cwa climate and needed local calibration though the coefficients k and w were respectively calibrated for different climate regions that improved the accuracy of the et0 estimation by mc the mc equation still obtained poor performance compared to the other equations suggested the further research should focus more on how to improve the equations that behaved great and already validated worldwide such as the pmt pmf and hs equations in general the mc equation will not be recommended for the et0 estimation for the cwa dwa dfc and hg climates with or without calibration the bc equation was based on experimental data from america and some other countries and this equation would be the forth choice for most climates the calibration of bc gained little in terms of estimate accuracy indicating that the model structure optimization might be a good choice for bc the modified forms of bc such as the fao 24 bc obtained leading performance of the temperature base equations while this equation lost the key advantage of the temperature equation i e simplicity and fewer data demand liu et al 2017 the th equation was proposed based on experimental data from eastern america and the most important assumption for this equation was that there was no advection between dry and wet air however this assumption is rare in sub arid or arid regions liu et al 2006 the climatic characteristic for both the hg and dwa was dry and the forecasted et0 by th was lower than the benchmark for these two climate regions which might be due to its assumption it can be concluded that the th approach is not an ideal fit for the semi arid or arid areas and it would not be recommended for most climatic regions as the sole combination equation the pmf was the primary choice for the hg and cwa climates the second and the third option for the dwa and dfc climates respectively although the weather type forecast performance was worse than that of the temperature pmf produced reliable et0 estimation results for most climates by using the weather type forecast better results might be expected when local data for solar radiation are used to generalize the coefficient of sdun for each climate region unlike temperature based equations the et0 estimation performance by pmf was determined by three factors including model structure accuracy of temperature forecast and weather type forecast fig 8 shows the distribution of the 23 stations that obtained the greatest forecast performance in terms of rmse by pmf for forecasted sdun t max and t min the average rmse of the 61 stations for forecasted sdun t max and t min were 4 27 h 3 67 c and 2 70 c respectively when rmse of sdun was lower than 4 27 h there were 13 weather stations for which pmf gained the best performance and the rmse of the temperature forecasts for 69 of these 13 stations 9 13 was lower than the average level further 92 of these 13 stations 12 13 were located in the cwa it can be concluded that pmf might acquire ideal estimation results in the cwa when the temperature and sdun were accurately forecasted on the other hand when the rmse of sdun was larger than 4 27 h pmf provided the best performance for 10 stations and these stations were located in all four climates the accuracy of the temperature forecasts for 6 of these 10 stations was lower than the average level and these 6 stations were distributed in four climate zones for the other 4 stations 3 were located in the dfc and 1 was in the cwa in particular the pmf behaved the best for 5 stations in the dfc and the rmse of sdun for these 5 stations was higher than the average value suggesting that a better result might be expected for the dfc climate if the coefficient of sdun was optimized by a local dataset corresponding to the specific climatic regions 4 conclusions numerous et0 models have been developed for daily et0 estimating but various models have also caused great confusion regarding how to choose the most accurate model for different climatic regions this paper compares the accuracy of near future daily et0 estimation of six equations based on public weather forecast for four main climates across china and weather variables derived from public weather forecast that served as the inputs are also assessed the weather stations are classified according to the köppen climatic classification and a performance ranking of the six equations is provided for each climate the main conclusions are as follows by comparing the precision of all input weather factors the most accurate forecast was found by minimum temperature t min followed by maximum temperature t max and weather type the over estimation for both the t min and t max forecasts for most climates lead to the over estimation of daily et0 by the original temperature based equations and thus the model calibration were necessary in general the penman monteith forecast pmf equation provided the most accurate et0 estimation in cwa and hg climates and the temperature penman monteith pmt equation obtained the most accurate average results for the dwa and dfc climate zones the great estimation capability of the pmf and pmt might be because they both have the same advantage of following the conceptual approach of the fao56 pm equation moreover the third and the fourth choice would be the hargreaves samani hs and the blaney criddle bc respectively while the thomwaite th and the mccloud mc yielded high errors and may not be applicable for et0 estimation in most climatic regions as a whole the pmf and pmt were better than the other equations due to their robust model structure and they provided the most accurate et0 estimation for multiple climates the overall results could offer

10975,accurate estimation of daily reference evapotranspiration et0 are vital for water resource management and irrigation decision making based on the public weather forecasts numerous models have been successfully used for daily et0 estimating while too many models available for selection which causes confusion regarding model selection for specific climate regions in this paper the estimating performances of six et0 equations using public weather forecast for a lead time of 1 7 days were compared for four main climatic region across china and then the most accurate equation was recommended for each climate region meanwhile the applicability of every equation was assessed in relation to four climates including subtropical monsoon climate cwa temperate continental climate dfc temperate monsoon climate dwa and mountain plateau climate hg the penman monteith forecast pmf equation which consisting of an adaptation of fao56 pm equation using temperature and weather type forecast as inputs provided the best et0 estimation performance in cwa and hg climates and the temperature penman monteith pmt equation using only the temperature data obtained the most accurate average results for the dwa and dfc climates the best and the second best estimation performance for each climate usually provided by pmf and pmt equations since they both have the same advantage of following the conceptual approach of the fao56 pm equation further the third and the fourth choice would be the hargreaves samani hs and the blaney criddle bc respectively while the thornwaite th and the mccloud mc yielded high errors and may not be applicable for et0 estimation for most climatic regions as a whole the pmf and pmt equations were better than the other equations and thus these two equations were recommended for daily et0 estimation for the near future at all climate regions across china keywords public weather forecast reference evapotranspiration estimation 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a fundamental element of the hydrologic cycle its reasonable estimation is important for the calculation of crop water requirements irrigation system design and water resource management et can be measured directly by field experiment but this approach is costly and laborious based on the above facts some mathematical models have been proposed for et estimation which relies on reference evapotranspiration et0 with the corresponding crop coefficient k c thus the precise computation of et0 is of vital importance for obtaining an accurate value for et jensen 1968 allen et al 2005 perera et al 2014 on the basis of input datum and procedures et0 calculating methods can be roughly classified as direct and indirect methods perera et al 2014 for the direct methods current and historical datum is used to calculate medium term or long term et0 by using artificial or computational neural net works anns or cnns or time series methods in terms of indirect methods the short term or medium term et0 is calculated by empirical or analytical models such as the penman monteith allen et al 1998 hargreaves hargreaves and samani 1985 or blaney criddle blaney and criddle 1962 equations with forecasted weather variables in terms of the direct methods there are two typical methods that use historical data for medium term or long term et0 calculation namely time series procedures and artificial or computational neural networks anns or cnns previous studies confirmed that the direct methods perform well in weekly or monthly et0 estimating by historical observed meteorological data tahir 1998 trajkovic et al 2003 landeras et al 2008 while further research focused on daily et0 estimation cai et al 2007 perera et al 2014 yang et al 2019 for the irrigation system operators and farmers irrigation scheduling is an important on farm practice which requires accurate short term daily et0 that varies with the weather perera et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 and the daily et0 estimated by the weather forecasts are of great value for irrigation decision making since the weather forecast message is the dynamic data that varies with the change of weather hence the direct procedure which uses the historical data as the model inputs might not be applicable in short term daily et0 estimating the hourly or daily weather variables are the input data for the indirect methods which are more suitable for daily estimation of et0 the empirical and analytical models are the most commonly used indirect methods such as the blaney criddle bc hargreaves samani hs mccloud mc and penman monteith luo et al 2014 perera et al 2014 xiong et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 according to the type of input weather data the weather datum can be categorized into numerical weather prediction nwp outputs and public weather forecasts the nwp outputs contain all the weather parameters needed for the calculation of indirect methods numerous studies reported that using the nwp outputs in et0 forecasting could produce reliable results duce et al 2000 perera et al 2014 however the nwp outputs are usually open for researchers but not for the public in some countries such as china and these outputs are also difficult for non professionals to analyze considering this fact it is difficult to apply the nwp outputs in practical use recently the public weather forecast for a lead time of up to 15 days was made available free for public use in china the performance of this public weather forecast had made substantial progress and has motivated the daily et0 estimation based on these data in china the public weather forecast is derived from nwp outputs which come from the global regional assimilation and prediction system grapes that was built by the meteorological department chen and xue 2004 xue 2005 considering the requirement of weather information for the general public nwp outputs were modified by the meteorologist in order to produce public weather forecasts that contained fewer but better weather variables including temperature weather type and wind scale cai et al 2007 predicted daily et0 using the public weather forecast message and results indicated the et0 predictions were appropriate to be used for real time irrigation management since the temperature forecast was the most accurately forecasted parameter luo et al 2014 employed the hargreaves samani hs equation with forecasted temperature to estimate et0 for lead time up to 7 days for 4 sites across china and obtained an accurate forecast outcome after that the blaney criddle bc and pm equations were adopted to estimate daily et0 using weather forecasts in no more than 8 regions in china xiong et al 2015 yang et al 2016 liu et al 2017 according to the et0 estimation results most of the approaches provided reasonable results using public weather forecast however these studies used only one model to estimate et0 for a specific area while lacking of model comparison caused confusion about whether this model is the best one for that region moreover some researchers have compared several equations for one location and determined the best one for that area zhang et al 2015 luo et al 2016 nevertheless duplicative work is still needed in these areas due to the lack of a generalization rule for spatial utilization to date approximately 50 et0 models have been developed lu et al 2005 liu et al 2017 and too many available models have caused great confusion regarding how to choose the proper model to estimate daily et 0 in different irrigation districts located in different climatic regions or climates this paper evaluates the estimation performance of 6 common used et0 equations by using public weather forecast in order to find the best one for the researcher and irrigation use in different climatic regions the objectives of this study are twofold 1 to compare the accuracy of et0 estimation using public weather forecast by these 6 equations for 4 main climate regions across china and 2 to recommend the most precise equation for daily et0 estimating for each climate region 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area the study area was within a wide range of climates across china the köppen climate classification was adopted for division of the climates in this work and previous work found that the köppen system of climate classification was suitable for disentangling the correlations between the fao56 pm and other temperature based models almorox et al 2015 based on the köppen system the study area was divided into four different climate types subtropical monsoon climate cwa temperate continental climate dfc temperate monsoon climate dwa and mountain plateau climate hg peel et al 2007 perera et al 2014 almorox et al 2015 a total of 61 weather stations were selected in these four climate regions and the amount of weather sites selected for the cwa dfc dwa and hg climate regions were 25 17 10 and 9 respectively the distribution of these stations across the different climates is shown in fig 1 the stations are located between latitudes 22 28 50 25 north and longitudes 79 93 130 28 east moreover the annual temperature sunshine duration relative humidity wind speed and elevation ranged within 1 4 23 8 c 0 90 4 79 m s 2 35 11 42 h 39 44 79 88 and 5 2 4801 0 m respectively the specific characteristics of the 61 weather sites is summarized in table 1 including latitude longitude elevation annual average temperature t mean annual average wind speed u 2 annual average sunshine duration sdun and annual average relative humidity rhmean 2 2 data daily et0 estimation for the near future required the public weather forecast message as input thus the public weather forecasts with lead times of 1 to 7 day for 61 weather stations in china during the period from january 1 2013 to december 31 2016 were gathered from weather china http www weather com cn the weather parameters included in the public weather forecast were maximum temperature minimum temperature weather type and wind scale the weather type forecast are qualitative data that contain seven types of weather conditions including sunny clear to overcast overcast rainy snow dust and haze and these forecasted weather type can be used for estimating solar radiation cai et al 2007 which plays a key role in et0 estimation by fao56 pm equation the wind scales are divided into 10 levels from 0 to 10 cma 2003 and each level can be transformed to wind speed at 2 m height allen et al 1998 cai et al 2007 which is needed for the et0 estimation of fao56 pm equation for the model calibration and performance evaluation the meteorological data for the same stations were collected from the china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc nmic cn for the period from january 1 1999 to december 31 2016 the weather parameters used from the daily meteorological data were air pressure wind speed relative humidity sunshine duration and minimum and maximum temperature further the meteorological dataset was divided into two parts one for model calibration january 1 1999 to december 31 2012 and the remainder for the comparison of et0 estimation by calibrated models january 1 2013 to december 31 2016 2 3 methodology both the temperature based and combination methods have been successfully used in et0 estimation in china and reliable performance was obtained luo et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 in this study six equations were adopted for et0 estimating including five temperature based equations and one combination equation the temperature based equation used only the temperature data for et0 calculation and the combination equation needed more than one weather variables as the inputs such as the fao56 penman monteith fao56 pm equation the fao56 pm equation was considered to the most appropriated method for et0 calculation allen et al 1998 cai et al 2007 perera et al 2014 and thus we modified it and obtained a new combination equation called the penman monteith forecast pmf for et0 estimation using weather forecast data however the limitation of the pmf was that it required several weather parameters as input and some of them were unavailable or low accuracy such as weather type forecast and wind scale forecast in this situation simpler model that relies on fewer inputs such as temperature based equation could be a great alternative the temperature forecasts appeared to be the most accurate parameter among all forecasted variables luo et al 2014 hence five temperature based equations which consisted of the hargreaves samani hs blaney criddle bc mccloud mc thornthwaite th and the temperature penman monteith pmt were employed in this study as they were also widely used around the world hu et al 2011 xu et al 2012 luo et al 2014 xiong et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 ren et al 2016 almorox et al 2018 2 3 1 penman monteith forecast equation the fao56 penman monteith fao56 pm equation is recommended by the fao and was considered as the sole standard approach for et0 calculation allen et al 1998 due to the lack of lysimeter measurement data the et0 calculated from the fao56 pm using full observed meteorological data has been used as the benchmark for the evaluation of estimated et0 the fao56 pm equation is allen et al 1998 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 is the daily reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 r n is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 t is the mean daily air temperature at a 2 m height c u 2 is the mean daily wind speed at a 2 m height m s 1 e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa δ is the slope of the vapor pressure versus temperature curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 the fao56 pm equation after proper modifications can also be used to estimate et0 using weather forecast data cai et al 2007 yang et al 2016 and thus this equation was modified and called pmf which was the only combination equation used in this study however public weather forecast data do not contain enough weather elements for pmf estimating and cai et al 2007 proposed an analytical method am that can be applied to convert the weather forecast data such as the weather type forecast into parameters that can be used by pmf previous studies reported that solar radiation r s played an important role in et0 calculation and showed largest impact on the accuracy of the estimated et0 arca et al 2004 perera et al 2014 therefore the first trial was conducted to obtain the r s the r s can be estimated by the weather type forecast while this forecast datum were qualitative data that cannot be directly used for the et0 calculation hence the am proposed by cai et al 2007 was adopted to convert the weather type forecast into quantitative datum the am was consists of eqs 2 4 as followed and table 2 showed the relationship between the weather type forecast and coefficient of sunshine duration the r s can be calculated as follows 2 n a n 3 n 24 π ω s 4 r s a s b s n n r a where n is the forecasted sunshine duration hour a is the coefficient of sunshine duration n is the daylight duration or maximum sunshine duration hours r s is the solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 r a is the zenith radiation mj m 2 day 1 a s b s is the fraction of extraterrestrial radiation reaching the soil surface on clear days n n and the recommendation values of a s and b s were 0 25 and 0 5 respectively allen et al 1998 cai et al 2007 daily saturation vapor pressure e can be assumed by the dew point temperature as follows 5 e o t dew 0 6108 exp 17 27 t d e w t d e w 237 3 where e is the daily saturation vapor pressure kpa t dew is the minimum temperature c thought t min is a good estimator of t dew for humid climate jensen et al 1990 allen et al 1998 t dew is usually lower than t min for other climate regions todorovic et al 2013 raziei and pereira 2013 almorox et al 2018 for humid climates t mean at should be used where the correction factor varied with the climate aridity of the station todorovic et al 2013 raziei and pereira 2013 with at ranging from 1 to 5 c and differently for arid to dry sub humid climates t min is not an adequate estimator of t dew but a correction of t min at with at ranging 1 to 3 c todorovic et al 2013 raziei and pereira 2013 ren et al 2016 in this study the trial and error procedure was used for each climate zone in order to obtain the t dew value that minimized rmse when comparing et0 estimated from the pmf or pmt equations with the estimates of the fao56 pm et0 the corrections of t dew are defined in table 3 for each climate zone across china the wind scale forecast cannot be directly used for calculation since this forecast data consisted of a qualitative observation as was the weather type forecast through the am method wind scale forecast can be converted to wind speed at a height of 2 m which is needed for pmf but the low accuracy of the forecasted wind speed led to a decline of et0 estimation zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 yang et al 2016 analyzed the performance of wind scale forecast for six stations across china and found that the values of forecasted wind speed were higher than those of observed for 24 48 108 43 which means there was system errors when transforming the wind scale forecast into wind speed the fao recommended that the wind speed can be assumed as the default value of 2 ms 1 when wind data are unavailable allen et al 1998 and this constant value was the average of wind speed for over 2000 weather stations found around the world many researchers found that the wind speed value of 2 ms 1 was suitable for most locations in different climate regions jensen et al 1990 allen et al 1998 trajkovic 2005 and this default value was adopted as the input of wind speed for pmf however for the arid and very windy hyper arid regions the local average value was adopted as a more appropriate alternative ren et al 2016 2 3 2 blaney criddle equation the blaney criddle bc equation was proposed for et0 estimation in america blaney and criddle 1962 and this equation was described as 6 e t 0 bc p 0 46 t 8 13 where et0 bc is the forecasted et0 mm day 1 t is the daily average temperature c p is the percentage of daily daytime hours out of total daytime hours of the whole year which is calculated by the latitude and julian day information 2 3 3 hargreaves samani equation the hargreaves samani hs equation is one of the most commonly used temperature based equations and it s established on the basis of the lysimeter data from california hargreaves and samani 1985 although the hs equation was developed for a sub arid climate reliable et0 results have been obtained in other climate area as long as the hs was calibrated the hs is expressed as 7 e t 0 h s 0 408 c r a t max t min e t max t min 2 17 8 where the et0 hs is the et0 provided by hs equation mm day 1 r a is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2day 1 t max and t min are the maximum and minimum air temperature respectively c the empirical coefficients c and e are initially set to 0 0023 and 0 5 respectively hargreaves and samani 1985 previous studies indicated that the accuracy of the hs computation result can be improved by calibrating the empirical coefficients of c and e in different climate regions since hs has regional variability hargreaves and allen 2003 gavilán et al 2006 hu et al 2011 the et0 values calculated by the fao56 pm was taken as the benchmark and these two coefficients were calibrated by the use of least square method 2 3 4 mccloud equation the mccloud mc equation was developed in florida and was applied for calculating the et0 of turf and golf courses mccloud 1995 the mc was described as 8 e t 0 m c k w 1 8 t where the et0 mc is the et0 provided by mc equation mm day 1 k and w are both default values which were recommended as 0 254 and 1 07 respectively alexandris et al 2008 and t is the daily mean temperature oc the coefficient of w and k were calibrated using a least square method to find the value that minimized the rmse when comparing estimated et0 by the mc and the fao56 pm et0 for each climate zones 2 3 5 thornthwaite equation the thornthwaite th was proposed in eastern america based on a local experimental dataset this equation assumed that there was no advection between dry and wet air and et0 was calculated by the monthly mean temperature considering the monthly average temperature might be lower than 0 c for some areas a modified form developed by willmott et al 1985 was adopted and expressed as thornthwaite 1948 willmott et al 1985 9 e t 0 t h 0 16 c 10 t e f i a c 415 85 32 24 t e f 0 43 t e f 2 t e f 0 c 0 c t e f 26 c t e f 26 c where e t 0 t h is the et0 provided by th equation mm day 1 i is a thermal index imposed by the local normal climatic temperature regime the exponent a is a function of i a 6 75 10 7 i 3 7 71 10 5 i 2 1 7912 10 2 i 0 49239 i is computed by i σ n 1 12 0 2 t n 1 514 t n is the monthly average temperature t ef is computed as t e f 0 5 k 3 t max t min n 24 n and k is the default value of 0 72 or 0 69 for the best et0 estimation pereira and pruitt 2004 n is the photoperiod for a given day to convert the estimates from a standard monthly to a daily time scale a correction factor c was used c n 360 the k values for tef was calibrated using a trial and error procedure to find the values that minimized the rmse when comparing et0 estimated with the th and the fao56 pm et0 and the values of best fit k were 0 71 0 68 0 69 0 73 for the hg dwa dfc and cwa climates respectively 2 3 6 temperature penman monteith equation the fao 56 pm equation that uses only the maximum and minimum air temperatures for et0 computation is called the temperature penman monteith equation pmt allen 1996 trajkovic et al 2003 yang et al 2019 it is worth mentioning that the model structure for both pmf and pmt were the same the only difference between them was the computation of solar radiation the solar radiation for pmt was estimated by temperature and calculated as follows 10 r s k r s t max t min 0 5 r a where r s is the solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 r a is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 day 1 t max and t min are the daily maximum and minimum temperatures respectively c and k rs is the adjustment coefficient and k rs 0 16 for interior locations and k rs 0 19 for coastal locations trajkovic 2003 moreover the k rs value was calibrated using a trial and error procedure to find the value that minimized the rmse when comparing estimated et0 with the pmt and the fao56 pm et0 and the correction of k rs were showed in table 4 for each climate zones the values of corrected k rs for cwa dfc and dwa climate zones were closed to the results which proposed by almorox et al 2018 for the different köppen climate types over the world 2 4 calibration method previous studies pointed out that the temperature equation has regional variability in different climatic zones and the accuracy of the equation can be improved after calibration hargreaves and allen 2003 luo et al 2014 feng et al 2017 since the fao 56 pm was considered as the sole standard approach for et0 calculation allen et al 1998 the calculated et0 from the fao 56 pm using observed datum was applied to calibrate all five temperature based equations including hs bc mc th and pmt both the hs and mc equations contain the parameters that varied with regional variability the c and e for the hs and the k and w for the mc respectively hence the least squares method lsm can be used to correct the parameters without changing the original structure of the hs and mc equations for the other three equations including bc th and pmt they were calibrated by the linear regression formula which was one of the simplest lsm trajkovic 2003 ding et al 2007 meanwhile due to lack of the lysimeter data the fao pm et0 was used as baseline for the model calibration using full observed data set the linear regression formula is as follows 11 e t 0 p m a b e t 0 t e m where et0 pm is calculated by fao 56 pm equation mm day 1 et0 tem is computed from the temperature based equation mm day 1 a and b are the correction coefficients and a is the et0 pm intercept of the regression line and b is the slope of the regression line that represents the average change in et0 pm for every change unit in et0 tem which means the values of b might indicate the tendency of under over prediction if the values are greater lower than one for the origin temperature based equation compare to the fao 56 pm equation 2 5 performance evaluation five statistical indices were adopted for evaluation including the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nmse ratio of mean rm and correlation coefficient r the mae was used to measure the deviation between the estimation and observed values the level of agreement between the estimation and observed values was measured using the rmse cai et al 2007 perera et al 2014 yang et al 2016 since the dimensions of forecasted weather variables were different it s difficult to compare their accuracy and thus the nmse was adopted and classified all variables into the same dimension so that their estimation accuracy can be compared intuitively the rm value was defined as the mean of the estimated value relative to the observed value and was used to quantify the bias this ratio might indicate over under prediction if the values are greater lower than one tomas burguera et al 2017 the r was employed to measure the correlation between the estimation and observed data an r value close to one illustrates goodness of fit between forecast and observed data traore et al 2015 yang et al 2016 these five statistical indicators have been widely used to assess the performance of et0 estimation in previous studies gavilán et al 2006 martinez and thepadia 2010 luo et al 2014 perera et al 2014 yang et al 2016 the statistical indices were calculated as follows 12 m a e i 1 n f i o i n 13 r m s e i 1 n f i o i 2 n 14 n m s e i 1 n f i o i 2 i 1 n o i 2 15 r m i 1 n o i f i i 1 n o i 2 16 r i 1 n f i f o i o i 1 n f i f 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where n is the number of observations fi and oi are respectively the i th observed and estimated values and f and o are respectively the average of fi and oi for the observation period 2 6 data processing the observed meteorological data were split into two parts one for the calibration of the temperature based equations january 1 1999 to december 31 2012 and the remainder for the comparison of et0 estimation by calibrated methods january 1 2013 to december 31 2016 then to assess the ability of estimating et0 by each equation when weather forecast were used the public weather forecast message january 1 2013 to december 31 2016 were inputted to the equation for et0 estimating which were cross compared for 4 main climates and then the most accurate equation was recommended for each climate region fig 2 shows the workflow of the et0 estimating in this study 3 results and discussion in this study both the public weather forecasts message and et0 estimation using public weather forecast were assessed as the input the accuracy of the temperature and weather type forecasts directly influenced the estimation performance of et0 thus they should be evaluated for the first then the performance of the daily et0 estimation obtained by the six equations were evaluated 3 1 forecasting performance for weather variables 3 1 1 temperature for the temperature based equations the air temperature forecasts were the only input factor which played a key role in et0 estimation additionally both the net long wave radiation and saturation vapor pressure were also computed from the maximum temperature t max and minimum temperature t min when comparing the five statistical indicators the nmse rm and r were appropriate for measure the accuracy of the forecasted weather variables as they reflected the bias and allowed perceiving the magnitude of the errors according to these three indicators the accuracy of t max and t min were declined with the increasing lead time for all climates for t max the average nmse rm and r for lead time 1 to 7 day ranged from 0 14 0 22 1 04 1 06 and 0 94 0 91 respectively for t min the average nmse rm and r varied between 0 11 0 22 1 00 1 02 and 0 98 0 95 respectively the box plots of statistical indices related to the t max and t min for each climate regions were shown in fig 3 in the aspect of t max the forecast values were higher than the observed values for all climates according to the rm indicating a tendency of over estimation of t max on the other hand for the t min the rm were slightly greater than but close to one suggesting the slightly over estimation of the t min the over estimation of both the t max and t min might probably result in over estimation of et0 by the temperature based methods on the basis of three indicators the accuracy of t min were slightly better than that of the t max for all climate regions and this outcome was consistent with the previous studies in china zhang et al 1999 luo et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 the reason for the lower precision of t max as compared to that of t min might be that the diurnal variation of t max is greater than t min which means it is more difficult to forecast t max due to its larger gradient compared with the forecast performance for different climate zones three indicators showed inconsistent results and it was hard to distinguish a climate zone that corresponded to highest and lowest forecast performance for the air temperature since the accuracy of temperature forecast might not be significantly correlated with climate zone 3 1 2 sunshine duration previous studies found that the sunshine duration sdun was the largest error source for et0 estimation among all forecasted weather variables perera et al 2014 yang et al 2016 for the pmf equation sdun was estimated by the weather type forecast since the weather type forecasts consisted of qualitative data they must be converted into the adjustment coefficient of sdun a for the calculation of sdun and then performance was assessed by comparing the estimated sdun with the observed values for lead times of 1 to 7 day the average nmse rm and r ranged between 0 55 0 68 0 91 1 13 and 0 46 0 23 respectively the rm values for cwa and dfc were substantially lower than one while reversed for hg and dfc climates and this results might be possibly lead to the over or under estimation of et0 for the corresponded climate region comparing the forecast performance of sdun and temperature in terms of three indicators it is obvious that the accuracy of sdun was much lower than that of the temperature the lower accuracy of sdun might be due to two main reasons 1 greater errors occurred when the weather type forecast was converted into sdun 2 the most important factor for sdun estimation was the adjustment coefficient of sdun which was generalized by the solar radiation information from beijing station that located in the cwa climate thus using the same adjustment coefficient for all regions lead to different degrees of errors without considering regional differences the forecast performance of sdun for the four climatic regions is presented in fig 3 the weather stations located in the dwa had the best prediction outcome and similar results were obtained by the other three climates though adjustment coefficient of sdun was derived from the beijing station which was located in cwa climate the prediction performance of sdun in cwa climate was rather modest suggesting the coefficient of each climate should be calibrated using a large number of the local sites 3 2 calibration of temperature based equation previous studies indicated that the performance of temperature based equation varied with the change of climate and showed that it is necessary to calibrate the model in order to improve the accuracy allen et al 1998 hargreaves and allen 2003 hu et al 2011 feng et al 2017 the et0 computed from the fao56 pm equation was used as the benchmark for the calibration of the temperature based equations over four climate zones the parameter corrections for the five equations by köppen class are presented in table 5 for the hs equation the corrected c in this study were 0 0022 0 0020 and 0 0020 respectively for the hg dfc and cwa climate regions which were close to the the value of c recommended as 0 0023 allen et al 1998 however for dwa climate much higher corrected c was obtained c 0 0042 similar results were found by almorox and grieser 2016 that the best fit coefficient c were 0 00218 0 00174 and 0 00358 respectively for the df cw and dw climates over the world the corrected c for both the df and cw climates were slightly lower than the 0 0023 but reversed for the dw climate the value of e recommended by allen et al 1998 was 0 50 and the corrected e in this study were 0 5433 0 5466 and 0 5227 respectively for the hg dfc and cwa climates and all of them were slightly higher than the 0 50 for dwa climate the corrected e was 0 2911 that drastically lower than the recommended value but closed to the value of e 0 26577 suggested by almorox and grieser 2016 for the dw climate overall results indicating that the inappropriately low value of c 0 0023 and high value of e 0 50 in the original hs equation might bring in large error for et0 estimation and thus the empirical coefficients c and e need to be corrected for different climate zones especially the dwa climate in terms of the mc equation the corrected w for the hg dwa dfc and cwa were 1 088 1 058 1 059 and 1 065 respectively the coefficient w for the dwa dfc and cwa were all lower than the recommended value of 1 07 while opposite result was found by hg and both the calibrated w and k for the hg were greater than the original values suggested that the mc equation tended underestimated et0 for this climate the corrected k were 0 3465 0 4055 0 3662 and 0 3228 respectively for the hg dwa dfc and cwa climates and the calibrated k for all four climates were higher than the 0 254 for the range of 27 60 above results suggested that it s necessary to correct the empirical coefficients k and w for different climate zones in order to minimize the system errors for the other three equations the bc th and pmt the best estimate of corrected a for the four climates were ranged between 1 0370 0 1900 0 5708 1 0524 and 0 0612 0 1277 respectively and the corrected values of b varied between 0 7450 0 9137 0 7361 0 8332 and 0 9558 1 0059 respectively trajkovic 2005 and ding et al 2007 calibrated the th and pmt equations and acquired the calibrated coefficients of a and b the values of a were 0 5650 and 0 013 respectively for the th and pmt the b values were 0 7842 and 0 9490 respectively and the corrected a and b in this study was close to those obtained by previous findings trajkovic 2005 ding et al 2007 if the a and b values are respectively close to zero and one it might be indicated a great goodness of fit between the original temperature based equation and fao56 pm equation therefore the greatest goodness of fit with the fao56 pm was found by pmt followed with bc and th for their origin version for bc and th equations at all climates the values of b were lower than one which indicating the tendency of over prediction for these equations compared to fao 56 pm equation in et0 estimating before calibration and thus the calibration for the temperature based equations were necessary further the b values for pmt were close to one might because the model structure for the pmt and fao 56 pm were the same after calibration these five temperature based equations can be used for et0 estimating 3 3 estimating performance of et0 based on weather forecast data figs 4 7 present the statistical indices for the average performance of the six equations for all climate regions for lead times of 1 to 7 days according to the four statistical indices the performance of the et0 estimation declined as the lead time increased for all equations and climates and this result might be due to the input variables as the accuracy of the temperature and weather type forecasts decreased with increasing lead time results showed that the rm values for the pmf pmt and hs were closed to target one for all climates varied in a short range from 0 95 to 1 00 suggesting the et0 by these three equations and et0 calculated by fao56 pm were statistically similar this results were similar with the previous studies that the pmt and hs tended to slightly under estimate daily pm et0 ren et al 2016 the values of rm for bc and th ranged from 0 91 1 02 and et0 bc and et0 th also under estimated compared with the pm et0 in hg and dwa climates while fitted well with pm et0 for dfc and cwa climates with rm ranging from 0 98 to 1 02 large deviation was found by mc that the rm ranged from 0 82 to 1 25 though the temperature were slightly over forecast most of the equations provided slightly underestimated results yang et al 2016 found that the temperature forecast was accurate enough for et0 estimating and the accuracy of et0 estimation declined no more than 1 when observed temperature data was replaced by the forecasted temperature meanwhile the estimation performance of pmf was better than most temperature based equations on the whole even if the weather type forecast deviated largely based on the above facts the accuracy of et0 estimation might be determined by the model structure in a large degree for the spatial analysis considering the climate classes table 6 presents the average statistical indices for the estimation performance of et0 provided by six equations for each climate region for the hg climate the lowest mae was found by the pmf and pmt and the highest r values were provided by three equations the pmf pmt and hs the rmse showed a clear rank in that pmf obtained the lowest rmse values followed by pmt bc and hs the values of rm for the pmt was perfectly fitted the target one and the pmf hs th and bc all tended to slightly under estimate the et0 while the mc deviated greatly considering all indicators pmf appeared as the optimal option followed by pmt hs and bc while mc and th were completely not applicable for this climate nevertheless there is still room for its improvement for the pmf equation as mentioned previously the performance of the forecasted sdun was poor for all climates which led to error in et0 estimation by the pmf the sdun was estimated from the coefficient of sdun which was derived from solar radiation data from the beijing station located in the cwa climate therefore better performance for the pmf might be expected if the coefficient of sdun was optimized by local data for each climate region in the dwa climate the mae and rmse presented similar results that the lowest values was obtained by pmt followed by pmf and hs except for the mc the average r values for all equations were similar and ranged from 0 86 to 0 89 the values of rm for all equations were lower than but closed to the target one except for the mc as a whole the pmt appeared to be the most accurate equation for the dwa climate followed with pmf hs and bc while the th and mc might not be applicable for dwa climate for this climate the estimation performance of pmt were better than that of the pmf indicating that using the forecasted temperature for solar radiation estimating lead to more accurate et0 results than those using the weather type forecast the climatic characteristics of the dwa is dry with little rainfall liu et al 2006liu et al 2006 and almorox et al 2015 recommend that the mc might not be suitable in semi arid or arid regions and this study supports the previous results even the mc equation was calibrated the th equation is based on an assumption that there was no advection between dry and wet air and this assumption is rare in sub arid or arid regions liu et al 2006 moreover the meteorological characteristics for both the hg and dwa was dry thus the under prediction of et0 by th for these two climate regions might be due to this assumption for the dfc climate all four indicators presented identical results in that the smallest error was found by pmt followed by hs pmf bc th and mc thus when all equations were compared the first and second choice for this climate would be pmt and hs respectively the accuracy of et0 estimation of pmt and hs were compared for inner mongolia of china across dfc and dwa climates and results showed that the pmt performed better than hs for most meteorological stations ren et al 2016 hence our study was consistent with the previous findings that the average performance of pmt was greater than that of hs for both the dfc and dwa climates and the reason might be the pmt has the same advantage of following the conceptual approach of the fao56 pm equation because variables lacking are replaced by the estimators ren et al 2016 for the cwa climate pmf provided the lowest errors in terms of the four indices followed by pmt hs and th while bc and mc performed the worst the above result indicated that the pmf appeared as the most accurate equation followed by pmt hs th bc and mc almorox et al 2015 pointed out that the solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit have a strong impact on et0 in humid regions while the temperature based equation did not take these two factors into consideration and hence had lower accuracy the cwa climate was influenced by the humid monsoon especially at the costal stations fuzhou xiamen shantou zhuhai ganyu shanghai and hangzhou and thus the pmf showed the greatest estimation performance for these locations as a whole the performance of pmf was better than that of the five temperature based equations which might be because the weather type forecast was included in the model calculation further reasons for the applicability of all five temperature based equations were detected the temperature data was the only input factor for all temperature based equations thus the estimation performance clearly reflected the quality of the model structure since identical input data was used in this study the capability of the pmt equation for et0 estimation using the public weather forecast were superior to the other four temperature based equations it is underlined that the best estimation of et0 for the dwa and dfc climates were given by the pmt which also performed well in cwa and hg climates compared with the estimation performance of the pmf results showed that using air temperature forecast for solar radiation estimating improved the accuracy in et0 estimates for dfc and dwa climates while reversed for the cwa climate the model structure of the pmt was similar with the fao56 pm equation and this might be a great advantage for other temperature based simple equations from a practical viewpoint since the weather type forecast and wind scale forecast were low accuracy using the pmt equation with the temperature forecast to estimate daily et0 was a great alternative our study strongly supported the previous findings proposed by ren et al 2016 and almorox et al 2018 that the pmt could be recommended for et0 calculation when weather data were unavailable or low accurate the hs equation was the second choice for the dfc climate and the third choice for both the cwa hg and dwa climates which indicated that the hs was suitable for most climate zones for et0 estimation almorox et al 2015 assessed 11 temperature based models for et0 estimation at 4362 climatological stations worldwide and results showed that the hs appeared as the most accurate approach for tropical arid temperate cold and polar climates while the th and mc performed the worst for the vast majority of climates for the north of china a few of temperature models were compared by liu et al 2006 including hs mc and th and results showed that et0 computed by hs exhibited goodness of fit with those from fao56 pm followed with mc and th the present study was in accordance with the above results which indicated that the hs performed well for most regions both in terms of et0 estimation and a primary reason for the high accuracy might be due to its robust model structure the reason why the other three temperature based equations were not suited for most climatic regions might be related to the model structure and the background conditions when the equations were originally proposed the mc equation was developed in florida and was applied for calculating the et0 of turf and golf courses mccloud 1955 and the coefficients k and w were generalized from local climatic conditions which consisted of the cwa climate and needed local calibration though the coefficients k and w were respectively calibrated for different climate regions that improved the accuracy of the et0 estimation by mc the mc equation still obtained poor performance compared to the other equations suggested the further research should focus more on how to improve the equations that behaved great and already validated worldwide such as the pmt pmf and hs equations in general the mc equation will not be recommended for the et0 estimation for the cwa dwa dfc and hg climates with or without calibration the bc equation was based on experimental data from america and some other countries and this equation would be the forth choice for most climates the calibration of bc gained little in terms of estimate accuracy indicating that the model structure optimization might be a good choice for bc the modified forms of bc such as the fao 24 bc obtained leading performance of the temperature base equations while this equation lost the key advantage of the temperature equation i e simplicity and fewer data demand liu et al 2017 the th equation was proposed based on experimental data from eastern america and the most important assumption for this equation was that there was no advection between dry and wet air however this assumption is rare in sub arid or arid regions liu et al 2006 the climatic characteristic for both the hg and dwa was dry and the forecasted et0 by th was lower than the benchmark for these two climate regions which might be due to its assumption it can be concluded that the th approach is not an ideal fit for the semi arid or arid areas and it would not be recommended for most climatic regions as the sole combination equation the pmf was the primary choice for the hg and cwa climates the second and the third option for the dwa and dfc climates respectively although the weather type forecast performance was worse than that of the temperature pmf produced reliable et0 estimation results for most climates by using the weather type forecast better results might be expected when local data for solar radiation are used to generalize the coefficient of sdun for each climate region unlike temperature based equations the et0 estimation performance by pmf was determined by three factors including model structure accuracy of temperature forecast and weather type forecast fig 8 shows the distribution of the 23 stations that obtained the greatest forecast performance in terms of rmse by pmf for forecasted sdun t max and t min the average rmse of the 61 stations for forecasted sdun t max and t min were 4 27 h 3 67 c and 2 70 c respectively when rmse of sdun was lower than 4 27 h there were 13 weather stations for which pmf gained the best performance and the rmse of the temperature forecasts for 69 of these 13 stations 9 13 was lower than the average level further 92 of these 13 stations 12 13 were located in the cwa it can be concluded that pmf might acquire ideal estimation results in the cwa when the temperature and sdun were accurately forecasted on the other hand when the rmse of sdun was larger than 4 27 h pmf provided the best performance for 10 stations and these stations were located in all four climates the accuracy of the temperature forecasts for 6 of these 10 stations was lower than the average level and these 6 stations were distributed in four climate zones for the other 4 stations 3 were located in the dfc and 1 was in the cwa in particular the pmf behaved the best for 5 stations in the dfc and the rmse of sdun for these 5 stations was higher than the average value suggesting that a better result might be expected for the dfc climate if the coefficient of sdun was optimized by a local dataset corresponding to the specific climatic regions 4 conclusions numerous et0 models have been developed for daily et0 estimating but various models have also caused great confusion regarding how to choose the most accurate model for different climatic regions this paper compares the accuracy of near future daily et0 estimation of six equations based on public weather forecast for four main climates across china and weather variables derived from public weather forecast that served as the inputs are also assessed the weather stations are classified according to the köppen climatic classification and a performance ranking of the six equations is provided for each climate the main conclusions are as follows by comparing the precision of all input weather factors the most accurate forecast was found by minimum temperature t min followed by maximum temperature t max and weather type the over estimation for both the t min and t max forecasts for most climates lead to the over estimation of daily et0 by the original temperature based equations and thus the model calibration were necessary in general the penman monteith forecast pmf equation provided the most accurate et0 estimation in cwa and hg climates and the temperature penman monteith pmt equation obtained the most accurate average results for the dwa and dfc climate zones the great estimation capability of the pmf and pmt might be because they both have the same advantage of following the conceptual approach of the fao56 pm equation moreover the third and the fourth choice would be the hargreaves samani hs and the blaney criddle bc respectively while the thomwaite th and the mccloud mc yielded high errors and may not be applicable for et0 estimation in most climatic regions as a whole the pmf and pmt were better than the other equations due to their robust model structure and they provided the most accurate et0 estimation for multiple climates the overall results could offer a practical proposal for the selection of the proper approach for et0 estimation for each climate region across china acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national natural

and limited arable land resources and have good ecological social and economic benefits mercer and miller 1997 nair and garrity 2012 in recent years agroforestry management has been widely practised in the loess gully area of west shanxi to control soil erosion restore ecological balance and balance the conflicting demands of agriculture and forestry gao et al 2013 apple and maize are the main economic trees and food crops in the region but apple takes a long time to become productive which delays its economic benefits maize is commonly grown between young fruit trees to make the best of the existing land resources and to ensure a stable income yun et al 2012 however agricultural production in the loess gully area of west shanxi suffers from barren soil and sparse precipitation which is uneven in both spatial and temporal terms deng et al 2006 water competition between the components of the alley cropping system aggravates the shortage peng et al 2009 liu et al 2016 and restricts plant growth ultimately leading to poor yields to counter such adverse effects water and fertilizers need to be supplied at the right time and in the right amount to all the components that make up the intercropping system water and nutrients are the most important factors in agricultural growth and production and their reasonable combination can increase the efficiency of both and produce a synergistic interaction kiymaz and ertek 2015 du et al 2017a however excessive irrigation and fertilizers not only waste resources but also seriously affect the soil environment mcconnell et al 1988 many studies have shown that compared to the traditional regimes of fertilizer application and irrigation controlled release fertilizers and regulated deficit irrigation rdi not only boost yields but also ensure that water and fertilizers are used more efficiently shao et al 2008 xu et al 2018 regulated application of water and fertilizers in both monoculture or in alley cropping now attracts a great deal of research ierna and mauromicale 2012 elvio and rinaldi 2008 showed that in maize application of nitrogen n affected both yield and water use efficiency wue significantly compared with non fertilization and irrigation at 50 and 100 of crop evapotranspiration increased the yield significantly rafiee and kalhor 2016 suggested that water deficiency if at an appropriate level increases wue in maize and liu et al 2017 found that although application of n improved crop yields in alley cropping of wheat and summer maize significantly yields at a low dose of n differed little from those at a high dose the demand for soil water and nutrients also varies with different crops and planting methods and competition for resources is more intense in alley cropping systems with the increase in fruit tree growth years therefore only the judicious management of water and nutrients can improve the system s productivity gao et al 2014 however studies on such management in alley cropping involving fruit trees are limited so far and information on key technical parameters remains inadequate the status of soil moisture and nutrients and differences between component crops lead to competition for water nutrients and light in alley cropping systems xu et al 2014 which affects canopy structure and plant growth the competition for water and nutrients lowers the rate of photosynthesis and in turn yield thereby lowering the overall productivity of the alley cropping system reynolds et al 2007 bouttier et al 2014 judicious management of water and nutrients can lead to greater uptake by the component crops which promotes growth and increases the rate of photosynthesis thereby increasing the yield and enhancing the quality of products wang et al 2018 aboveground competition for light is likely between trees and understory crops in the sub humid region according to peng the competition between walnut plum and maize soybean was the main reason for the decline in crop yield in loess plateau of shanxi province peng et al 2009 however the trees that intercept the light also absorb water and nutrients and the correlation between crop growth and light does not prove that crop growth was limited by light friday and fownes 2002 daily dynamics of plant photosynthesis rate is the basic unit of material accumulation and physiological metabolism in plant production and is an important method of analyzing the influence of environmental factors on plant growth and metabolism plant photosynthesis is affected by the status of water and fertilizer levels in soil the measurement of plant photosynthesis can determine the response of plants to different water and fertilizer conditions and is an extension of the light competition in an alley cropping system studies on tree based intercropping systems have been confined mainly to interspecific relationships under rain fed conditions ling et al 2017 sun et al 2018a and studies on the mechanism of water use and on interspecific relationships under regulated application of water and fertilizers continue to be limited we hypothesized that reasonable water and fertilizer management would vary in their ability to increase photosynthetic efficiency of apple and maize leaves promote crop yield and water use in the alley cropping system to test this we monitored the indicators of photosynthesis growth yield and soil water under various water and fertilizer management systems in a typical young apple maize alley cropping system to determine 1 the variation patterns in photosynthetic physiological characteristics growth parameters of trees and crops and the yield of crops 2 the water consumption et and wue and their variation patterns and 3 optimum management of the alley cropping system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental site was at the shishanwan experimental base of the chinese national ecosystem observation and research station jixian county shanxi 36 00 36 13 n 110 31 110 56 e and part of the loess gully area the soil was quaternary aeolian loess slightly alkaline ph 7 9 and barren with less than 1 0 of organic matter the climate was temperate continental the annual averages of the key weather variables were as follows precipitation 575 9 mm of which 61 8 was received mostly from june to august potential evaporation 1723 9 mm frost free period about 170 days mean annual temperature 10 c and accumulated temperature 3357 9 c the soil was generally low in major nutrients with 0 5 g kg 1 of total n 57 mg kg 1 of available phosphorus p 125 mg kg 1 of available potassium k and 8 3 g kg 1 of organic matter the mean bulk density of the 0 60 cm soil layer was 1 26 g cm 3 2 2 experimental design the experiment was conducted using a typical local apple maize alley cropping system for three consecutive crop growing seasons in 2014 2016 the apple trees were planted in 2011 with 4 0 m 5 0 m spacing and an east west orientation the average tree heights were 2 2 2 5 and 2 8 m in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively the average north and south crown width of the 3 4 and 5 year old apple trees was 3 0 3 7 and 4 2 m respectively as the trees had not attained the bearing stage the yield of the alley cropping system was only that of maize and maize was sown on the 24th 10th and 15th of april in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively to lower the competition between apple and maize and to ensure proper growth of the trees over time the spacing for maize was widened each year to take into account the growing tree canopy the spacing was thus 0 35 m 0 40 m in 2014 9 rows 0 45 m 0 50 m in 2015 7 rows and 0 60 m 0 55 m in 2016 6 rows the experiments were conducted in a randomized block factorial design with three replicates and the treatments repeated at the same location each year the experimental treatments comprised three levels of irrigation and three levels of fertilization taking into account an appropriate range of soil moisture for apple and maize three levels of maximum irrigation were set expressed as a percentage of the field capacity fc of the top layer 0 60 cm of soil namely 50 w1 65 w2 and 85 w3 the measured fc was 23 4 kg kg 1 the three levels of n p2o5 k2o fertilizer 289 0 118 0 118 0 412 4 168 8 168 8 and 537 0 219 0 219 0 kg ha 1 were designated f1 f2 and f3 respectively were applied to the plots the f1 f2 and f3 treatments represented 70 100 and 130 of the locally applied fertilizer rate 412 4 168 8 168 8 kg ha 1 n p2o5 k2o respectively flood irrigation was applied in the experimental field by local farmers and water meters were installed to control the amount of water applied to each plot the fertilizer was evenly applied to the plots according to local fertilization habits and added to the soil along with irrigation hu et al 2013 the amount and time of fertilization and irrigation during 2014 2016 are shown in table 1 in total ten treatments including nine water and fertilizer coupling treatments and a rain fed and non irrigated treatment included as the control ck were conducted in the experiment there were 30 plots in total and each plot was 6 0 m 7 0 m the edge of the plot being 0 9 m from the tree line in 2014 and 1 0 m in 2015 2016 fig 1 bunds with a height of 0 3 m to reinforce and protect the surrounding area and minimize horizontal water movement were placed around the plots the inter space between plots was 2 0 m in order to minimize irrigation edge effects and maize was also planted at the buffer zone but not used for monitoring 2 3 irrigation level and water consumption 2 3 1 soil water content soil water content was measured via the gravimetric method from the surface to a depth of 60 cm at 10 cm intervals before sowing jointing heading grain filling and after harvesting sampling points were 0 5 1 5 2 5 3 5 and 4 5 m from the tree row fig 1 the soil bulk density was measured by taking samples of soil using a corer with 100 cm3 volume sample cores from the surface to a depth of 60 cm at 10 cm intervals before the plots were established soil water storage in the 60 cm depth profile was considered to be the total storage in all the sampled layers in the plot and was determined by the following formula sun et al 2018b 1 s w s m m s w g γ g c m 3 h m m where γ is soil bulk density and h is soil depth 2 3 2 irrigation the amount of irrigation was determined based on average monthly precipitation in the region and monthly water consumption of apple and maize sun et al 2006 irrigation was applied three times at the beginning of each of the three critical stages of maize namely jointing heading and grain filling soil moisture content was determined for each treatment before irrigation which was determined by the difference between the measured level and the target level of soil moisture the amount of irrigation was calculated using the equation for irrigating rain fed crops as follows man et al 2014 2 m 10 γ h θ w θ 0 where m is the amount of irrigation mm h is the depth of soil to be kept moist 60 cm θ w is the target gravimetric water content of soil θ 0 is the measured gravimetric water content of soil and γ is soil bulk density the levels of precipitation and details of irrigation are shown in fig 2 annual precipitation was 420 2 mm in 2014 85 3 mm in 2015 and 282 7 mm in 2016 by the standards formulated by shanxi institute of meteorological sciences 2014 was a year of waterlogging 2015 and 2016 were years of extreme drought 2 3 3 water consumption water consumption et during the growth of intercropped maize was estimated using the water balance approach as follows kang et al 2000 3 e t i p u r f δ w where et is measured in mm i is the irrigation amount mm p is the effective precipitation during the maize growing period mm u is the amount of groundwater mm r is the surface runoff mm f is the water loss by deep percolation mm and δw was calculated as change in soil water storage in the 0 60 cm soil profile from sowing to maturity mm u was considered zero because the groundwater table was 30 m below the surface r was assumed to be zero as irrigation water was protected by the 0 3 m high bunds and f was also taken as zero as the soil water content measurements in the 40 60 cm layer did not reach the fc at any sampling time point 2 4 growth and photosynthetic characteristics 2 4 1 height and leaf area index the height of maize plants at the grain filling stage was measured with a tape as the average of 5 plants in each plot the maize leaf area index lai of each plot was estimated with the help of a canopy analyzer lai 2200 plant canopy analyzer li cor lincoln ne usa and each plot set a monitoring point at a distance of 2 5 m from the tree row 2 4 2 photosynthesis indicators of photosynthesis were recorded on five cloudless days during the grain filling stage mid august of maize using a portable photosynthesis system li 6400 li cor inc lincoln ne usa the sampling sites were determined by sampling lines which were arranged between two fruit trees and perpendicular to the tree rows 0 5 1 5 and 2 5 m away from the tree row fig 1 measurements of 0 5 m 1 5 m and 2 5 m were carried out south of the nearest tree row which were denoted as section 0 1 0 m 1 0 2 0 m and 2 0 3 0 m respectively measurements were taken every 2 h from 09 00 to 17 00 h the net rate of photosynthesis pn and of transpiration tr in leaves at the height of the ear were measured in maize plants closest to the sampling line measurements of each leaf were taken three times and averaged mu et al 2010 for apple the 7th leaf from the base of a new branch and on the sunny side 1 5 2 0 m above the ground was selected to measure the indicators of photosynthesis three such leaves from each tree constituted a sample the leaf water use efficiency lwue μmol mmol 1 was determined with the following equation 4 l w u e p n t r where pn is the net rate of photosynthesis μmol m 2 s 1 and tr that of transpiration mmol m 2 s 1 2 5 yield and water use yield was determined as the grain yield gy of maize in each plot at harvest the wue g l 1 of the alley cropping system was taken as the ratio between the gy and et within the area under maize and was calculated as follows 5 wue 10 gy et where gy is the economic yield kg ha 1 and et is the water consumption mm of the alley cropping system irrigation water use efficiency iwue kg m ³ is the ratio of the gy to the amount of irrigation per unit area of intercropped maize and was calculated as follows 6 i w u e g y i where gy is the economic grain yield of maize kg ha 1 and i is the amount of irrigation m³ ha 1 2 6 data analysis the graphs were generated using origin ver 9 0 origin lab northampton ma usa analysis of variance and regression were carried out using spss ver 20 0 spss corp chicago usa and non linear multivariate regression analysis was performed using matlab ver 6 5 mathworks natick usa data on daily dynamics of apple and maize leaf photosynthesis characteristics for each year were analysed by two way anova the daily mean photosynthesis characteristics of apple and maize maize growth index gy iwue and wue for each year were tested by one way anova according to the least significant difference at p 0 05 non linear regression analysis was used to analyse the quantitative relationship between water and fertilizer and pn gy and wue in the regression analysis to eliminate the effects of dimension and self variation the data from each treatment were standardised taking into consideration the values for the years and all the treatments all the coded values of the different treatments after normalization are shown in table 2 3 results 3 1 photosynthesis 3 1 1 apple leaves the daily variation in the pn tr and lwue of apple leaves in all the treatments traced a bimodal curve fig 3 with one peak at 11 00 and another at 15 00 h and the lowest value at 13 00 h in terms of magnitude the pn was relatively low in 2015 by 2 73 25 17 compared to that in 2014 and by 4 19 46 89 compared to that in 2016 at a given level of irrigation the pn was generally higher under the f1 treatment compared with that of other fertilization treatments during 2014 2016 the daily variation in the tr of apple leaves traced a unimodal curve the values were generally higher in the mornings than in the afternoons and relatively stable during 11 00 13 00 h in every treatment at a given level of irrigation the minimal tr was observed in the f1 treatment at all times the daily lwue of apple reached its lowest value at 13 00 h and peaked at 15 00 or 17 00 h depending on the treatments in 2014 2016 the highest and lowest values of lwue were observed in f1 and f2 respectively and the maximum in the ck was 5 28 46 88 lower than that at the lowest fertilizer dose but 16 39 165 45 higher than that at the two higher doses at a given level of irrigation the lwue at different times of the day decreased gradually at higher doses of fertilizers fertilization and water fertilizer interactions had significant effects on the daily variation of pn and lwue the effects of irrigation and fertilization on tr only reached a significant level in 2016 and the interaction had no significant effect on the daily variation of tr 3 1 2 maize leaves the daily pn in maize traced a unimodal curve with a maximum value in the f1 groups fig 4 the minimum value of the pn was recorded in the f2 groups in the first two years and f3 groups in 2016 the peak value in different treatments in 2015 was 3 65 34 17 lower than that in 2014 and in 2016 during the 3 years the maximum value of maize pn was seen in f1 which is consistent with apple pn the daily variation in the tr of maize leaves traced a unimodal curve the value remained steady from 11 00 13 00 h in the test groups but peaked at 11 00 h in the ck and decreased rapidly thereafter at a given level of irrigation the maximum and minimum of maize tr were observed under f2 and f1 treatments respectively and the tr of f2 was 9 43 42 20 higher than that of f1 the lwue values of maize were higher in the afternoons and the lowest value was reached between 11 00 and 13 00 h in all the treatments whereas the lowest value in ck was at 11 00 h the daily peak was observed at 17 00 h at a given level of irrigation the maximum maize lwue was observed under f1 treatment fertilization and water fertilizer interactions had significant effects on the daily variation in pn and lwue the effects of irrigation and fertilization on tr only reached a significant level in 2016 and the interaction had no significant effect on the daily variation in tr 3 1 3 the average of photosynthesis indicators the daily average values of different indicators of photosynthesis under different treatments are shown in table 3 in 2014 2016 the daily average pn and lwue in apple leaf under f1 was significantly higher than those of other treatments and the largest value was observed in w3f1 the w2f2 and w3f1 treatments exhibited the maximum and minimum tr respectively at a given level of irrigation the daily average pn and lwue decreased and the daily average tr increased as the dose increased at a given dose pn and lwue were maximum at the highest level of irrigation and minimum at both intermediate and low levels irrigation and fertilization increased the pn in maize the daily values of which were 1 15 83 71 greater than those in the ck the maximum daily mean values of pn and lwue were observed under the w3f1 treatment in 2014 2016 with the same level of irrigation pn and lwue under w1 and w2 exhibited a decrease followed by an elevation with increased fertilization but tr showed an increase followed by a reduction whereas all the indicators under w3 treatment were gradually decreased with the same amount of fertilizer the pn increased with the level of irrigation tr showed the same pattern under f1 treatment but decreased gradually as the level of irrigation increased in the other fertilization groups and lwue followed a pattern that was the exact opposite of that followed by tr 3 1 4 correlation between distance to the tree and photosynthesis in maize pn tr and lwue showed a significant relationship to the distance between maize and the rows of apple we used the degree of slope to indicate the effect of interspecific competition on photosynthesis and the results are shown in table 4 in 2014 the slope of pn and tr to the distance between maize and the rows of apple was negative in the different treatments suggesting that pn and tr decreased with increasing distance however lwue increased with distance and the slope value indicated that the increase was substantially faster under the w3f1 than that in any other treatment in 2015 the relationship of the pn or the tr in maize to its distance from the tree rows was similar to that in 2014 and the decrease in tr was slower than that in 2014 the lwue was positively correlated to the distance in the f2 and f3 groups but negatively so in the f1 group as the decrease in pn was greater than that in tr in 2016 pn and tr in maize were significantly and negatively correlated to the distance but the correlation was stronger than that in the previous two years the decrease in pn and tr was even greater as the distance increased the rate of decrease of pn was greater by 179 91 than that in 2014 and by 228 91 than that in 2015 the rate of decrease of tr was 48 91 greater than that in 2014 and 237 23 greater than that in 2015 lwue was positively correlated to the distance and the strongest correlation was observed in the w3f1 treatment and the rate of increase of lwue peaked when the distance was 0 5 1 5 m 3 2 height leaf area index maize yield and water use the indicators of growth and the values of wue for maize are given in table 5 both plant height and lai decreased as the dose of fertilizer increased and attained their maximum values under w3f1 treatment maize yield increased with increased irrigation level but decreased with increased fertilizer dose the highest and lowest yields were seen in w3f1 and ck respectively and w3f1 being 6 15 14 42 greater than that in the ck in the three years except in 2015 grain yield was always significantly higher than that in ck but decreased over time being 20 80 31 51 lower during 2015 2016 than that in 2014 water consumption in the various treatments increased significantly by 3 93 82 85 compared to that in ck at a given level of irrigation water consumption decreased as the dose of fertilizer increased at a given dose of fertilizer water consumption increased with the level of irrigation water use both iwue and wue decreased as both irrigation and the dose of fertilizer increased the iwue at the lowest level of irrigation being maximum and substantially higher than that in any other treatment throughout the experiment in 2014 and 2016 the wue among all the treatments was the highest at the lowest dose but that in ck was even higher in 2015 overall water consumption was low and wue was high in ck and at the lowest level of irrigation but the yield was low in both 3 3 quantitative relationships in this study at a given level of irrigation pn was lower at the lowest fertilizer dose but increased as the dose increased although gy the economic yield and water use efficiency wue were lower at the higher doses at a given dose pn and gy increased as the level of irrigation increased but wue decreased table 5 the results of non linear multivariate regression between the level of irrigation or the dose of the fertilizer and the physiological parameters are shown in fig 5 maize showed efficient photosynthesis and the highest yield under w3f1 treatment various factors were normalized in the present study the positive value negative value and the strength of the coupling effect between the level of irrigation and dose of the fertilizer can be evaluated by the first order coefficient in the equation a positive interaction term shows a synergistic effect and a negative interaction term shows an antagonistic effect for both fertilization and irrigation xue et al 2008 throughout the experiment irrigation had a positive effect on pn and gy the fertilizer had a negative effect on both and the effect of fertilizer was greater than that of irrigation in 2014 2016 the water fertilizer interaction terms were negative for pn gy and wue indicating that the interaction had an antagonistic effect on these indicators irrigation had a negative effect on wue but the effect of fertilizer was positive and the influence of irrigation was greater than that of the fertilizer 4 discussion 4 1 photosynthesis and interspecies relationships 4 1 1 photosynthesis in both apple and maize pn tr and lwue showed characteristic patterns of variation during the day depending on the treatment in both crops pn and lwue were maximum when the dose was lowest a finding inconsistent with an earlier study involving a monoculture system in which chen et al 2013 found that the peak rate of photosynthesis was higher in maize plants at higher doses of n than that at lower doses and wang et al 2017 showed that the maximum value of pn in buckwheat was attained at intermediate doses of fertilizers such discrepancies may be due to the oversupply of fertilizer which reduced photosynthetic capacity of plant mesophyll cells whereas low doses promoted maize growth larger leaf areas covered the soil surface lowered the temperature and reduced water loss by evaporation therefore increased the pn and lwue the daily average values of pn and lwue in apple and maize were maximum under high irrigation 85 fc in 2014 2016 which indicated that adequate irrigation is an important basis for efficient photosynthesis lin et al 2012 tang et al 2017 in our study the tr in both species at the lowest level of irrigation was generally higher than that in the treatments with higher levels of irrigation which was different to that in previous studies using monoculture systems du et al 2017b suggested that in apple the tr at higher levels of irrigation was greater than that at lower levels of irrigation and that high levels of irrigation increased the tr of apple significantly the reason for this discrepancy may be attributed to a chain of events the low irrigation in the present study slowed down the growth of the fruit trees thereby lowering their crown density the lower density meant greater illumination and higher surface temperatures of the soil due to increased direct radiation the higher temperatures in turn led to greater transpiration generally irrigation and fertilizer application increased the pn in both apple and maize and maximum average daily values of pn and lwue were observed when the n p2o5 k2o was 289 0 118 0 118 0 kg ha 1 and the irrigation level was 85 of the fc indicating greater drought tolerance under that combination and full irrigation input can increase the stomatal conductance of leaves and the lowest fertilizer rate can improve the chlorophyll content so as to promote photosynthetic efficiency 4 1 2 interspecies relationship in maize both pn and tr decreased linearly with the increase in distance between maize plants and the tree line and the decrease in 2015 was less than that in the other two years table 4 this may have been due to the larger tree canopy which led to greater interception of sunlight by the trees and the differences in illumination levels were modulated by the differences in rainfall irrigation level and fertilizer dose this decreased pattern was inconsistent with the findings of previous studies gao et al 2013 revealed that the pn in maize increased as the distance from the trees increased in an apple soybean maize intercropping system the discrepancy was probably due to maize leaves in the ear position being affected much more by the interspecific shade and maize plants near the tree line received more light due to the uncropped strip on the tree row over time as the trees grew they proved more competitive and thus their negative effect on maize was greater making the interspecific competition more significant thereby reducing the yield of maize even more fig 5 in addition the lower rate in 2016 at which pn and tr in maize were reduced as the distance from the tree line increased was greater than that in 2014 and 2015 crop species need to be changed according to the increase in intercropping years in the fruit crop intercropping system therefore it is vital to select appropriate intercropping species to provide comprehensive benefits in the present study trees were small and produced no fruit maize faced less competition and its economic output was high in the first five years after this intercropping of trees with dwarf crops will be beneficial for extension of the canopy and root growth of fruit trees 4 2 growth and water use in this study the plant height and lai of maize in the f1 and f2 groups were greater than those in f3 group and the ck table 5 suggesting that excessive fertilization inhibits the growth and development of maize this may be due to excessive fertilization inhibiting root development of maize at the jointing stage when maize requires less fertilizer maize yield increased with the level of irrigation but decreased as fertilization increased we found that maximum irrigation combined with minimum fertilization resulted in a maximum yield of 10166 8 kg ha 1 7468 5 kg ha 1 and 7054 1 kg ha 1 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively however fapohunda and hossain 1990 showed that maize yields increased with increasing fertilizer application and gholinezhad et al 2009 found that sunflower yield increased at higher nitrogen application rates which were different to the results obtained in this study the reason for this discrepancy may be due to excessive fertilizer application in our study which inhibited root development in maize at the jointing stage when maize requires less fertilizer li et al 2009 a reduction in water absorbing areas and the capacity of plant roots tian et al 2016 and the minimum fertilization increased the photosynthetic capacity of maize mesophyll cells table 3 and fig 5 and promoted the reproductive growth of maize our study showed that et under the different treatments was significantly higher than that under the ck and increased with the level of irrigation but decreased as the dose increased which is why et was maximum at the lowest dose these results do not concur with the findings of lenka et al 2009 who found that et was maximum under high doses of n and minimum when no fertilizers were applied in a maize wheat cropping system in india a possible reason for this difference is that the lowest fertilizer application in this study promoted the crop canopy development thereby increasing et the effects of water and nutrients on et were generally similar to their effects on the leaf area index of maize table 5 water use efficiency wue decreased as irrigation and fertilization increased and the highest iwue observed was obtained with w1 treatment the wue was also highest under that treatment and in the ck which suggested that a suitable level of water deficit increased wue in maize ucar et al 2017 4 3 quantitative relationships nonlinear multivariate regression analysis was used to determine optimal water and fertilizer management we found that irrigation had a positive effect on pn and yield and fertilization had a negative effect and the effect of the fertilizer was greater than that of irrigation on these indicators fig 5 these results suggested that fertilization can increase the soil nutrient content data not shown and adequate soil water can increase nutrient availability and transfer a large portion of nutrients to aboveground parts with regard to water use irrigation has a greater impact than fertilization the reasons for this may be related to irrigation transferring nutrients from the soil or fertilizer to the above ground plant to promote the reproductive growth of crops li et al 2009 simultaneously irrigation promotes the growth and development of maize resulting in greater crown density and the consequent decrease in evaporation from the strips of soil between plants the main objective of intercropping involving fruit trees and annual crops in the loess region of west shanxi is to obtain higher economic returns from a unit area maximum irrigation 85 of the fc in the present study can effectively lower interspecific competition increase the efficiency of photosynthesis in both apple and maize and enhance biomass accumulation and yield moreover the 70 locally applied fertilizer rate was more effective in increasing water use in the alley cropping system than the other treatments probably because the demand for nutrients in the system had not reached a peak as the fruit trees were still young whereas farmers in the region always apply fertilizers in excess due to a lack of appreciation regarding nutrient requirements in alley cropping 5 conclusions fertilization and the water fertilizer interaction had significant effects on the daily variation in pn and lwue for both apple and maize the lowest fertilizer rate combined with highest amount of irrigation water resulted in the maximum daily average value of pn and lwue from 2014 to 2016 higher photosynthesis rates in groups with the lowest fertilizer rate can contribute to a higher yield of maize and the yields increased with increasing amount of irrigation under the lowest fertilizer rate the interspecies competition became more intense during the 3 year intercropping period but reasonable water and fertilizer regulation can alleviate this competition both the pn and tr of maize decreased as the distance of the crop from the rows of trees increased and the rate of this decrease became greater over time water consumption in the alley cropping system decreased as the fertilizer dose increased while wue decreased with an increase in both irrigation and fertilizer in addition excessive doses of the fertilizer did not alleviate the interspecific competition and in fact led to shorter maize plants with smaller lai and lower yield it is recommended that dwarf crops should be planted after intercropping for 5 years according to the change in photosynthetic index with intercropping years under different treatments finally the overall results clearly demonstrated that in order to obtain a higher yield in the apple maize alley cropping system and benefit local farmers during the heading stage and at the beginning of the grain filling stage the irrigation threshold should be 85 of the fc combined with 144 5 59 0 59 0 kg ha 1 n p2o5 k2o acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the fundamental research funds for the central

capacity fc and three different npk fertilization levels 289 0 118 0 118 0 412 4 168 8 168 8 and 537 0 219 0 219 0 kg ha 1 which were designated f1 f2 and f3 respectively in addition the rain fed neither irrigation nor fertilizer crop was included as the control ck the f1 significantly increased the net rate of photosynthesis pn and leaf water use efficiency lwue of both apple and maize for maize the effect of irrigation was greater than that of fertilizers on water use but smaller on growth indicators and yield the et of the alley cropping systems increased with the amount of irrigation but decreased as the dose of fertilizers increased growth and yield of maize increased when the amount of irrigation increased but were inversely related to fertilizer dose the canopy architecture appeared to be regulated through differential absorption of water and nutrients the pn and transpiration tr in maize decreased as the distance from the tree line increased and the extent of decrease grew over time suggesting greater interspecific competition it is recommended that dwarf crops should be planted after intercropping for 5 years according to the change in photosynthetic index with intercropping years under different treatments multiple regression analysis indicated the following regime to be optimal during the first 3 5 years of the intercropping in terms of the yield of maize and water use in the alley cropping system maximum watering 85 fc and minimum fertilization 289 0 118 0 118 0 kg ha 1 npk keywords agroforestry tree field crop intercropping photosynthesis characteristics water consumption water use efficiency 1 introduction agroforestry systems are increasingly considered as a sustainable land use that alleviate the conflicts between large populations and limited arable land resources and have good ecological social and economic benefits mercer and miller 1997 nair and garrity 2012 in recent years agroforestry management has been widely practised in the loess gully area of west shanxi to control soil erosion restore ecological balance and balance the conflicting demands of agriculture and forestry gao et al 2013 apple and maize are the main economic trees and food crops in the region but apple takes a long time to become productive which delays its economic benefits maize is commonly grown between young fruit trees to make the best of the existing land resources and to ensure a stable income yun et al 2012 however agricultural production in the loess gully area of west shanxi suffers from barren soil and sparse precipitation which is uneven in both spatial and temporal terms deng et al 2006 water competition between the components of the alley cropping system aggravates the shortage peng et al 2009 liu et al 2016 and restricts plant growth ultimately leading to poor yields to counter such adverse effects water and fertilizers need to be supplied at the right time and in the right amount to all the components that make up the intercropping system water and nutrients are the most important factors in agricultural growth and production and their reasonable combination can increase the efficiency of both and produce a synergistic interaction kiymaz and ertek 2015 du et al 2017a however excessive irrigation and fertilizers not only waste resources but also seriously affect the soil environment mcconnell et al 1988 many studies have shown that compared to the traditional regimes of fertilizer application and irrigation controlled release fertilizers and regulated deficit irrigation rdi not only boost yields but also ensure that water and fertilizers are used more efficiently shao et al 2008 xu et al 2018 regulated application of water and fertilizers in both monoculture or in alley cropping now attracts a great deal of research ierna and mauromicale 2012 elvio and rinaldi 2008 showed that in maize application of nitrogen n affected both yield and water use efficiency wue significantly compared with non fertilization and irrigation at 50 and 100 of crop evapotranspiration increased the yield significantly rafiee and kalhor 2016 suggested that water deficiency if at an appropriate level increases wue in maize and liu et al 2017 found that although application of n improved crop yields in alley cropping of wheat and summer maize significantly yields at a low dose of n differed little from those at a high dose the demand for soil water and nutrients also varies with different crops and planting methods and competition for resources is more intense in alley cropping systems with the increase in fruit tree growth years therefore only the judicious management of water and nutrients can improve the system s productivity gao et al 2014 however studies on such management in alley cropping involving fruit trees are limited so far and information on key technical parameters remains inadequate the status of soil moisture and nutrients and differences between component crops lead to competition for water nutrients and light in alley cropping systems xu et al 2014 which affects canopy structure and plant growth the competition for water and nutrients lowers the rate of photosynthesis and in turn yield thereby lowering the overall productivity of the alley cropping system reynolds et al 2007 bouttier et al 2014 judicious management of water and nutrients can lead to greater uptake by the component crops which promotes growth and increases the rate of photosynthesis thereby increasing the yield and enhancing the quality of products wang et al 2018 aboveground competition for light is likely between trees and understory crops in the sub humid region according to peng the competition between walnut plum and maize soybean was the main reason for the decline in crop yield in loess plateau of shanxi province peng et al 2009 however the trees that intercept the light also absorb water and nutrients and the correlation between crop growth and light does not prove that crop growth was limited by light friday and fownes 2002 daily dynamics of plant photosynthesis rate is the basic unit of material accumulation and physiological metabolism in plant production and is an important method of analyzing the influence of environmental factors on plant growth and metabolism plant photosynthesis is affected by the status of water and fertilizer levels in soil the measurement of plant photosynthesis can determine the response of plants to different water and fertilizer conditions and is an extension of the light competition in an alley cropping system studies on tree based intercropping systems have been confined mainly to interspecific relationships under rain fed conditions ling et al 2017 sun et al 2018a and studies on the mechanism of water use and on interspecific relationships under regulated application of water and fertilizers continue to be limited we hypothesized that reasonable water and fertilizer management would vary in their ability to increase photosynthetic efficiency of apple and maize leaves promote crop yield and water use in the alley cropping system to test this we monitored the indicators of photosynthesis growth yield and soil water under various water and fertilizer management systems in a typical young apple maize alley cropping system to determine 1 the variation patterns in photosynthetic physiological characteristics growth parameters of trees and crops and the yield of crops 2 the water consumption et and wue and their variation patterns and 3 optimum management of the alley cropping system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental site was at the shishanwan experimental base of the chinese national ecosystem observation and research station jixian county shanxi 36 00 36 13 n 110 31 110 56 e and part of the loess gully area the soil was quaternary aeolian loess slightly alkaline ph 7 9 and barren with less than 1 0 of organic matter the climate was temperate continental the annual averages of the key weather variables were as follows precipitation 575 9 mm of which 61 8 was received mostly from june to august potential evaporation 1723 9 mm frost free period about 170 days mean annual temperature 10 c and accumulated temperature 3357 9 c the soil was generally low in major nutrients with 0 5 g kg 1 of total n 57 mg kg 1 of available phosphorus p 125 mg kg 1 of available potassium k and 8 3 g kg 1 of organic matter the mean bulk density of the 0 60 cm soil layer was 1 26 g cm 3 2 2 experimental design the experiment was conducted using a typical local apple maize alley cropping system for three consecutive crop growing seasons in 2014 2016 the apple trees were planted in 2011 with 4 0 m 5 0 m spacing and an east west orientation the average tree heights were 2 2 2 5 and 2 8 m in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively the average north and south crown width of the 3 4 and 5 year old apple trees was 3 0 3 7 and 4 2 m respectively as the trees had not attained the bearing stage the yield of the alley cropping system was only that of maize and maize was sown on the 24th 10th and 15th of april in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively to lower the competition between apple and maize and to ensure proper growth of the trees over time the spacing for maize was widened each year to take into account the growing tree canopy the spacing was thus 0 35 m 0 40 m in 2014 9 rows 0 45 m 0 50 m in 2015 7 rows and 0 60 m 0 55 m in 2016 6 rows the experiments were conducted in a randomized block factorial design with three replicates and the treatments repeated at the same location each year the experimental treatments comprised three levels of irrigation and three levels of fertilization taking into account an appropriate range of soil moisture for apple and maize three levels of maximum irrigation were set expressed as a percentage of the field capacity fc of the top layer 0 60 cm of soil namely 50 w1 65 w2 and 85 w3 the measured fc was 23 4 kg kg 1 the three levels of n p2o5 k2o fertilizer 289 0 118 0 118 0 412 4 168 8 168 8 and 537 0 219 0 219 0 kg ha 1 were designated f1 f2 and f3 respectively were applied to the plots the f1 f2 and f3 treatments represented 70 100 and 130 of the locally applied fertilizer rate 412 4 168 8 168 8 kg ha 1 n p2o5 k2o respectively flood irrigation was applied in the experimental field by local farmers and water meters were installed to control the amount of water applied to each plot the fertilizer was evenly applied to the plots according to local fertilization habits and added to the soil along with irrigation hu et al 2013 the amount and time of fertilization and irrigation during 2014 2016 are shown in table 1 in total ten treatments including nine water and fertilizer coupling treatments and a rain fed and non irrigated treatment included as the control ck were conducted in the experiment there were 30 plots in total and each plot was 6 0 m 7 0 m the edge of the plot being 0 9 m from the tree line in 2014 and 1 0 m in 2015 2016 fig 1 bunds with a height of 0 3 m to reinforce and protect the surrounding area and minimize horizontal water movement were placed around the plots the inter space between plots was 2 0 m in order to minimize irrigation edge effects and maize was also planted at the buffer zone but not used for monitoring 2 3 irrigation level and water consumption 2 3 1 soil water content soil water content was measured via the gravimetric method from the surface to a depth of 60 cm at 10 cm intervals before sowing jointing heading grain filling and after harvesting sampling points were 0 5 1 5 2 5 3 5 and 4 5 m from the tree row fig 1 the soil bulk density was measured by taking samples of soil using a corer with 100 cm3 volume sample cores from the surface to a depth of 60 cm at 10 cm intervals before the plots were established soil water storage in the 60 cm depth profile was considered to be the total storage in all the sampled layers in the plot and was determined by the following formula sun et al 2018b 1 s w s m m s w g γ g c m 3 h m m where γ is soil bulk density and h is soil depth 2 3 2 irrigation the amount of irrigation was determined based on average monthly precipitation in the region and monthly water consumption of apple and maize sun et al 2006 irrigation was applied three times at the beginning of each of the three critical stages of maize namely jointing heading and grain filling soil moisture content was determined for each treatment before irrigation which was determined by the difference between the measured level and the target level of soil moisture the amount of irrigation was calculated using the equation for irrigating rain fed crops as follows man et al 2014 2 m 10 γ h θ w θ 0 where m is the amount of irrigation mm h is the depth of soil to be kept moist 60 cm θ w is the target gravimetric water content of soil θ 0 is the measured gravimetric water content of soil and γ is soil bulk density the levels of precipitation and details of irrigation are shown in fig 2 annual precipitation was 420 2 mm in 2014 85 3 mm in 2015 and 282 7 mm in 2016 by the standards formulated by shanxi institute of meteorological sciences 2014 was a year of waterlogging 2015 and 2016 were years of extreme drought 2 3 3 water consumption water consumption et during the growth of intercropped maize was estimated using the water balance approach as follows kang et al 2000 3 e t i p u r f δ w where et is measured in mm i is the irrigation amount mm p is the effective precipitation during the maize growing period mm u is the amount of groundwater mm r is the surface runoff mm f is the water loss by deep percolation mm and δw was calculated as change in soil water storage in the 0 60 cm soil profile from sowing to maturity mm u was considered zero because the groundwater table was 30 m below the surface r was assumed to be zero as irrigation water was protected by the 0 3 m high bunds and f was also taken as zero as the soil water content measurements in the 40 60 cm layer did not reach the fc at any sampling time point 2 4 growth and photosynthetic characteristics 2 4 1 height and leaf area index the height of maize plants at the grain filling stage was measured with a tape as the average of 5 plants in each plot the maize leaf area index lai of each plot was estimated with the help of a canopy analyzer lai 2200 plant canopy analyzer li cor lincoln ne usa and each plot set a monitoring point at a distance of 2 5 m from the tree row 2 4 2 photosynthesis indicators of photosynthesis were recorded on five cloudless days during the grain filling stage mid august of maize using a portable photosynthesis system li 6400 li cor inc lincoln ne usa the sampling sites were determined by sampling lines which were arranged between two fruit trees and perpendicular to the tree rows 0 5 1 5 and 2 5 m away from the tree row fig 1 measurements of 0 5 m 1 5 m and 2 5 m were carried out south of the nearest tree row which were denoted as section 0 1 0 m 1 0 2 0 m and 2 0 3 0 m respectively measurements were taken every 2 h from 09 00 to 17 00 h the net rate of photosynthesis pn and of transpiration tr in leaves at the height of the ear were measured in maize plants closest to the sampling line measurements of each leaf were taken three times and averaged mu et al 2010 for apple the 7th leaf from the base of a new branch and on the sunny side 1 5 2 0 m above the ground was selected to measure the indicators of photosynthesis three such leaves from each tree constituted a sample the leaf water use efficiency lwue μmol mmol 1 was determined with the following equation 4 l w u e p n t r where pn is the net rate of photosynthesis μmol m 2 s 1 and tr that of transpiration mmol m 2 s 1 2 5 yield and water use yield was determined as the grain yield gy of maize in each plot at harvest the wue g l 1 of the alley cropping system was taken as the ratio between the gy and et within the area under maize and was calculated as follows 5 wue 10 gy et where gy is the economic yield kg ha 1 and et is the water consumption mm of the alley cropping system irrigation water use efficiency iwue kg m ³ is the ratio of the gy to the amount of irrigation per unit area of intercropped maize and was calculated as

northampton ma usa analysis of variance and regression were carried out using spss ver 20 0 spss corp chicago usa and non linear multivariate regression analysis was performed using matlab ver 6 5 mathworks natick usa data on daily dynamics of apple and maize leaf photosynthesis characteristics for each year were analysed by two way anova the daily mean photosynthesis characteristics of apple and maize maize growth index gy iwue and wue for each year were tested by one way anova according to the least significant difference at p 0 05 non linear regression analysis was used to analyse the quantitative relationship between water and fertilizer and pn gy and wue in the regression analysis to eliminate the effects of dimension and self variation the data from each treatment were standardised taking into consideration the values for the years and all the treatments all the coded values of the different treatments after normalization are shown in table 2 3 results 3 1 photosynthesis 3 1 1 apple leaves the daily variation in the pn tr and lwue of apple leaves in all the treatments traced a bimodal curve fig 3 with one peak at 11 00 and another at 15 00 h and the lowest value at 13 00 h in terms of magnitude the pn was relatively low in 2015 by 2 73 25 17 compared to that in 2014 and by 4 19 46 89 compared to that in 2016 at a given level of irrigation the pn was generally higher under the f1 treatment compared with that of other fertilization treatments during 2014 2016 the daily variation in the tr of apple leaves traced a unimodal curve the values were generally higher in the mornings than in the afternoons and relatively stable during 11 00 13 00 h in every treatment at a given level of irrigation the minimal tr was observed in the f1 treatment at all times the daily lwue of apple reached its lowest value at 13 00 h and peaked at 15 00 or 17 00 h depending on the treatments in 2014 2016 the highest and lowest values of lwue were observed in f1 and f2 respectively and the maximum in the ck was 5 28 46 88 lower than that at the lowest fertilizer dose but 16 39 165 45 higher than that at the two higher doses at a given level of irrigation the lwue at different times of the day decreased gradually at higher doses of fertilizers fertilization and water fertilizer interactions had significant effects on the daily variation of pn and lwue the effects of irrigation and fertilization on tr only reached a significant level in 2016 and the interaction had no significant effect on the daily variation of tr 3 1 2 maize leaves the daily pn in maize traced a unimodal curve with a maximum value in the f1 groups fig 4 the minimum value of the pn was recorded in the f2 groups in the first two years and f3 groups in 2016 the peak value in different treatments in 2015 was 3 65 34 17 lower than that in 2014 and in 2016 during the 3 years the maximum value of maize pn was seen in f1 which is consistent with apple pn the daily variation in the tr of maize leaves traced a unimodal curve the value remained steady from 11 00 13 00 h in the test groups but peaked at 11 00 h in the ck and decreased rapidly thereafter at a given level of irrigation the maximum and minimum of maize tr were observed under f2 and f1 treatments respectively and the tr of f2 was 9 43 42 20 higher than that of f1 the lwue values of maize were higher in the afternoons and the lowest value was reached between 11 00 and 13 00 h in all the treatments whereas the lowest value in ck was at 11 00 h the daily peak was observed at 17 00 h at a given level of irrigation the maximum maize lwue was observed under f1 treatment fertilization and water fertilizer interactions had significant effects on the daily variation in pn and lwue the effects of irrigation and fertilization on tr only reached a significant level in 2016 and the interaction had no significant effect on the daily variation in tr 3 1 3 the average of photosynthesis indicators the daily average values of different indicators of photosynthesis under different treatments are shown in table 3 in 2014 2016 the daily average pn and lwue in apple leaf under f1 was significantly higher than those of other treatments and the largest value was observed in w3f1 the w2f2 and w3f1 treatments exhibited the maximum and minimum tr respectively at a given level of irrigation the daily average pn and lwue decreased and the daily average tr increased as the dose increased at a given dose pn and lwue were maximum at the highest level of irrigation and minimum at both intermediate and low levels irrigation and fertilization increased the pn in maize the daily values of which were 1 15 83 71 greater than those in the ck the maximum daily mean values of pn and lwue were observed under the w3f1 treatment in 2014 2016 with the same level of irrigation pn and lwue under w1 and w2 exhibited a decrease followed by an elevation with increased fertilization but tr showed an increase followed by a reduction whereas all the indicators under w3 treatment were gradually decreased with the same amount of fertilizer the pn increased with the level of irrigation tr showed the same pattern under f1 treatment but decreased gradually as the level of irrigation increased in the other fertilization groups and lwue followed a pattern that was the exact opposite of that followed by tr 3 1 4 correlation between distance to the tree and photosynthesis in maize pn tr and lwue showed a significant relationship to the distance between maize and the rows of apple we used the degree of slope to indicate the effect of interspecific competition on photosynthesis and the results are shown in table 4 in 2014 the slope of pn and tr to the distance between maize and the rows of apple was negative in the different treatments suggesting that pn and tr decreased with increasing distance however lwue increased with distance and the slope value indicated that the increase was substantially faster under the w3f1 than that in any other treatment in 2015 the relationship of the pn or the tr in maize to its distance from the tree rows was similar to that in 2014 and the decrease in tr was slower than that in 2014 the lwue was positively correlated to the distance in the f2 and f3 groups but negatively so in the f1 group as the decrease in pn was greater than that in tr in 2016 pn and tr in maize were significantly and negatively correlated to the distance but the correlation was stronger than that in the previous two years the decrease in pn and tr was even greater as the distance increased the rate of decrease of pn was greater by 179 91 than that in 2014 and by 228 91 than that in 2015 the rate of decrease of tr was 48 91 greater than that in 2014 and 237 23 greater than that in 2015 lwue was positively correlated to the distance and the strongest correlation was observed in the w3f1 treatment and the rate of increase of lwue peaked when the distance was 0 5 1 5 m 3 2 height leaf area index maize yield and water use the indicators of growth and the values of wue for maize are given in table 5 both plant height and lai decreased as the dose of fertilizer increased and attained their maximum values under w3f1 treatment maize yield increased with increased irrigation level but decreased with increased fertilizer dose the highest and lowest yields were seen in w3f1 and ck respectively and w3f1 being 6 15 14 42 greater than that in the ck in the three years except in 2015 grain yield was always significantly higher than that in ck but decreased over time being 20 80 31 51 lower during 2015 2016 than that in 2014 water consumption in the various treatments increased significantly by 3 93 82 85 compared to that in ck at a given level of irrigation water consumption decreased as the dose of fertilizer increased at a given dose of fertilizer water consumption increased with the level of irrigation water use both iwue and wue decreased as both irrigation and the dose of fertilizer increased the iwue at the lowest level of irrigation being maximum and substantially higher than that in any other treatment throughout the experiment in 2014 and 2016 the wue among all the treatments was the highest at the lowest dose but that in ck was even higher in 2015 overall water consumption was low and wue was high in ck and at the lowest level of irrigation but the yield was low in both 3 3 quantitative relationships in this study at a given level of irrigation pn was lower at the lowest fertilizer dose but increased as the dose increased although gy the economic yield and water use efficiency wue were lower at the higher doses at a given dose pn and gy increased as the level of irrigation increased but wue decreased table 5 the results of non linear multivariate regression between the level of irrigation or the dose of the fertilizer and the physiological parameters are shown in fig 5 maize showed efficient photosynthesis and the highest yield under w3f1 treatment various factors were normalized in the present study the positive value negative value and the strength of the coupling effect between the level of irrigation and dose of the fertilizer can be evaluated by the first order coefficient in the equation a positive interaction term shows a synergistic effect and a negative interaction term shows an antagonistic effect for both fertilization and irrigation xue et al 2008 throughout the experiment irrigation had a positive effect on pn and gy the fertilizer had a negative effect on both and the effect of fertilizer was greater than that of irrigation in 2014 2016 the water fertilizer interaction terms were negative for pn gy and wue indicating that the interaction had an antagonistic effect on these indicators irrigation had a negative effect on wue but the effect of fertilizer was positive and the influence of irrigation was greater than that of the fertilizer 4 discussion 4 1 photosynthesis and interspecies relationships 4 1 1 photosynthesis in both apple and maize pn tr and lwue showed characteristic patterns of variation during the day depending on the treatment in both crops pn and lwue were maximum when the dose was lowest a finding inconsistent with an earlier study involving a monoculture system in which chen et al 2013 found that the peak rate of photosynthesis was higher in maize plants at higher doses of n than that at lower doses and wang et al 2017 showed that the maximum value of pn in buckwheat was attained at intermediate doses of fertilizers such discrepancies may be due to the oversupply of fertilizer which reduced photosynthetic capacity of plant mesophyll cells whereas low doses promoted maize growth larger leaf areas covered the soil surface lowered the temperature and reduced water loss by evaporation therefore increased the pn and lwue the daily average values of pn and lwue in apple and maize were maximum under high irrigation 85 fc in 2014 2016 which indicated that adequate irrigation is an important basis for efficient photosynthesis lin et al 2012 tang et al 2017 in our study the tr in both species at the lowest level of irrigation was generally higher than that in the treatments with higher levels of irrigation which was different to that in previous studies using monoculture systems du et al 2017b suggested that in apple the tr at higher levels of irrigation was greater than that at lower levels of irrigation and that high levels of irrigation increased the tr of apple significantly the reason for this discrepancy may be attributed to a chain of events the low irrigation in the present study slowed down the growth of the fruit trees thereby lowering their crown density the lower density meant greater illumination and higher surface temperatures of the soil due to increased direct radiation the higher temperatures in turn led to greater transpiration generally irrigation and fertilizer application increased the pn in both apple and maize and maximum average daily values of pn and lwue were observed when the n p2o5 k2o was 289 0 118 0 118 0 kg ha 1 and the irrigation level was 85 of the fc indicating greater drought tolerance under that combination and full irrigation input can increase the stomatal conductance of leaves and the lowest fertilizer rate can improve the chlorophyll content so as to promote photosynthetic efficiency 4 1 2 interspecies relationship in maize both pn and tr decreased linearly with the increase in distance between maize plants and the tree line and the decrease in 2015 was less than that in the other two years table 4 this may have been due to the larger tree canopy which led to greater interception of sunlight by the trees and the differences in illumination levels were modulated by the differences in rainfall irrigation level and fertilizer dose this decreased pattern was inconsistent with the findings of previous studies gao et al 2013 revealed that the pn in maize increased as the distance from the trees increased in an apple soybean maize intercropping system the discrepancy was probably due to maize leaves in the ear position being affected much more by the interspecific shade and maize plants near the tree line received more light due to the uncropped strip on the tree row over time as the trees grew they proved more competitive and thus their negative effect on maize was greater making the interspecific competition more significant thereby reducing the yield of maize even more fig 5 in addition the lower rate in 2016 at which pn and tr in maize were reduced as the distance from the tree line increased was greater than that in 2014 and 2015 crop species need to be changed according to the increase in intercropping years in the fruit crop intercropping system therefore it is vital to select appropriate intercropping species to provide comprehensive benefits in the present study trees were small and produced no fruit maize faced less competition and its economic output was high in the first five years after this intercropping of trees with dwarf crops will be beneficial for extension of the canopy and root growth of fruit trees 4 2 growth and water use in this study the plant height and lai of maize in the f1 and f2 groups were greater than those in f3 group and the ck table 5 suggesting that excessive fertilization inhibits the growth and development of maize this may be due to excessive fertilization inhibiting root development of maize at the jointing stage when maize requires less fertilizer maize yield increased with the level of irrigation but decreased as fertilization increased we found that maximum irrigation combined with minimum fertilization resulted in a maximum yield of 10166 8 kg ha 1 7468 5 kg ha 1 and 7054 1 kg ha 1 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively however fapohunda and hossain 1990 showed that maize yields increased with increasing fertilizer application and gholinezhad et al 2009 found that sunflower yield increased at higher nitrogen application rates which were different to the results obtained in this study the reason for this discrepancy may be due to excessive fertilizer application in our study which inhibited root development in maize at the jointing stage when maize requires less fertilizer li et al 2009 a reduction in water absorbing areas and the capacity of plant roots tian et al 2016 and the minimum fertilization increased the photosynthetic capacity of maize mesophyll cells table 3 and fig 5 and promoted the reproductive growth of maize our study showed that et under the different treatments was significantly higher than that under the ck and increased with the level of irrigation but decreased as the dose increased which is why et was maximum at the lowest dose these results do not concur with the findings of lenka et al 2009 who found that et was maximum under high doses of n and minimum when no fertilizers were applied in a maize wheat cropping system in india a possible reason for this difference is that the lowest fertilizer application in this study promoted the crop canopy development thereby increasing et the effects of water and nutrients on et were generally similar to their effects on the leaf area index of maize table 5 water use efficiency wue decreased as irrigation and fertilization increased and the highest iwue observed was obtained with w1 treatment the wue was also highest under that treatment and in the ck which suggested that a suitable level of water deficit increased wue in maize ucar et al 2017 4 3 quantitative relationships nonlinear multivariate regression analysis was used to determine optimal water and fertilizer management we found that irrigation had a positive effect on pn and yield and fertilization had a negative effect and the effect of the fertilizer was greater than that of irrigation on these indicators fig 5 these results suggested that fertilization can increase the soil nutrient content data not shown and adequate soil water can increase nutrient availability and transfer a large portion of nutrients to aboveground parts with regard to water use irrigation has a greater impact than fertilization the reasons for this may be related to irrigation transferring nutrients from the soil or fertilizer to the above ground plant to promote the reproductive growth of crops li et al 2009 simultaneously irrigation promotes the growth and development of maize resulting in greater crown density and the consequent decrease in evaporation from the strips of soil between plants the main objective of intercropping involving fruit trees and annual crops in the loess region of west shanxi is to obtain higher economic returns from a unit area maximum irrigation 85 of the fc in the present study can effectively lower interspecific competition increase the efficiency of photosynthesis in both apple and maize and enhance biomass accumulation and yield moreover the 70 locally applied fertilizer rate was more effective in increasing water use in the alley cropping system than the other treatments probably because the demand for nutrients in the system had not reached a peak as the fruit trees were still young whereas farmers in the region always apply fertilizers in excess due to a lack of appreciation regarding nutrient requirements in alley cropping 5 conclusions fertilization and the water fertilizer interaction had significant effects on the daily variation in pn and lwue for both apple and maize the lowest fertilizer rate combined with highest amount of irrigation water resulted in the maximum daily average value of pn and lwue from 2014 to 2016 higher photosynthesis rates in groups with the lowest fertilizer rate can contribute to a higher yield of maize and the yields increased with increasing amount of irrigation under the lowest fertilizer rate the interspecies competition became more intense during the 3 year intercropping period but reasonable water and fertilizer regulation can alleviate this competition both the pn and tr of maize decreased as the distance of the crop from the rows of trees increased and the rate of this decrease became greater over time water consumption in the alley cropping system decreased as the fertilizer dose increased while wue decreased with an increase in both irrigation and fertilizer in addition excessive doses of the fertilizer did not alleviate the interspecific competition and in fact led to shorter maize plants with smaller lai and lower yield it is recommended that dwarf crops should be planted after intercropping for 5 years according to the change in photosynthetic index with intercropping years under different treatments finally the overall results clearly demonstrated that in order to obtain a higher yield in the apple maize alley cropping system and benefit local farmers during the heading stage and at the beginning of the grain filling stage

10977,modeling the effects of climate change on hydrology and crop yield provides opportunities for choosing appropriate crops for adapting to climate change in this study climate change impacts on irrigated corn and sorghum dryland rainfed sorghum and continuous fallow in the northern high plains of texas were evaluated using an improved soil and water assessment tool swat model equipped with management allowed depletion mad irrigation scheduling projected climate data 2020 2099 from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip 5 of 19 general circulation models gcms were used climate data were divided into four 20 year periods of near future 2020 2039 middle 2040 2059 late 2060 2079 and end 2080 2099 of the 21st century under two representative concentration pathway rcp emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 for irrigated corn median annual crop evapotranspiration et and irrigation decreased by 8 25 and 15 42 respectively under the climate change scenarios compared to the historical period 2001 2010 the median yield was reduced by 3 22 with exponentially decreases in the latter half of the 21st century for sorghum the reduction of median annual crop et ranged from 6 27 however the decline in the median annual irrigation was within 15 except for the 2060 2079 and 2080 2099 periods under rcp 8 5 scenarios with 30 and 49 reductions in median annual irrigation the median irrigated sorghum yield declined by 6 42 the median annual crop et of dryland sorghum decreased by 10 16 the reduction in median yield was within 10 of the historical dryland sorghum yield the decrease in median annual evaporation varied from 15 23 under future continuous fallow conditions the elevated co2 level of future climate scenarios was the primary factor for the decrease in the et and irrigation the reduction in future crop yield was mainly attributed to the shortening of the maturity period caused by increased future temperature keywords dryland fallow general circulation model gcm irrigation evapotranspiration yield 1 introduction increasing combustion of fossil fuels leads to the rise of atmospheric co2 concentration which traps heat and warms the earth s surface united states environmental protection agency usepa 2019 this warming effect is expected to considerably change the rainfall regimes and increase the frequency of extreme weather events such as flooding drought etc harrison et al 2014 in addition the increased co2 concentration will directly affect crop growth and development sreeharsha et al 2015 xu et al 2016 which will further alter food production and agricultural land use olesen and bindi 2002 the impacts of increasing co2 concentration and global warming on extreme climate events hydrology and crop production are worldwide concerns panagopoulos et al 2014 2015 stefanidis et al 2018 ye and grimm 2013 williams et al 2015 for example bourdages and huard 2010 reported a general increase in temperatures reduction in the duration of snow period and increase in most rainfall indicators and extremes under future climate conditions at 12 stations in ontario canada using the soil and water assessment tool swat model chen et al 2017 simulated that the reductions in crop evapotranspiration et were 12 and 20 for the middle and end of the 21st century respectively compared to the historical period 1994 2009 in the southern high plains of texas u s additionally araya et al 2015 found that simulated increases in co2 concentrations may contribute to small improvements in corn zea mays l yield during the middle of the 21st century in southwestern ethiopia using the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat and agricultural production systems simulator apsim models however associated increased air temperatures in the future might have substantial impacts on corn yield reduction the semi arid northern high plains nhp of texas is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the u s corn is the dominant irrigated crop grown in the region and several counties have reported the largest average corn yields in the nation national agricultural statistics service nass 2019 however corn is sensitive to water stress and generally requires large amounts of irrigation to supplement inadequate and unreliable rainfall in the nhp sorghum sorghum bicolor l is an alternative crop with less sensitivity to water stress and can maintain profitable yields under both irrigated and dryland rainfed conditions stewart et al 1983 however the effects of climate change are complex and uncertain and vary across regions and time periods therefore it is necessary to explore the potential changes in irrigation water use et and yields of the major crops under future climate scenarios in this region to mitigate any adverse impacts or to better manage the land use distribution for instance most general circulation models gcms simulated that the semi arid nhp would become hotter and drier than usual by the end of this century intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2007 which might further decrease water availability for crop production in this intensively irrigated agricultural region adhikari et al 2016 chen et al 2017 modala et al 2017 seager and vecchi 2010 therefore the projected future climate may pose challenges to both irrigated and dryland agriculture in this water limited environment barnett et al 2008 gober and kirkwood 2010 some climate change mitigation adaptation strategies consist of altering crop composition and changing land use regimes e g irrigated farming dryland farming and fallow which show the potential to increase the resilience of agricultural systems to future climate ipcc 2001 changes in land uses from water intensive crops such as corn to less water demanding crops may play a significant role in adapting to climate change rose et al 2012 however such studies are limited or lack representativeness due to the inadequate simulation of irrigation strategies that use management allowed depletion mad irrigation scheduling an approach used by producers and researchers in the nhp and in other arid and semi arid climates around the world callison 2019 evett et al 2011 gheysari et al 2009 merriam 1966 suarez rey et al 2000 a newly developed automatic irrigation method for simulating mad based irrigation scheduling in swat chen et al 2018a was used in this climate change study to more accurately represent irrigation management in this region this irrigation algorithm was extensively evaluated across five states in the southern great plains including texas kansas new mexico colorado and nebraska chen et al 2019a and the results showed the default plant water demand and soil water content automatic irrigation options in swat underestimated and overestimated the actual seasonal irrigation respectively when compared to the improved mad automatic irrigation method chen et al 2019a the impacts of climate change on hydrology and crop yield were heavily dependent on the types of gcm projections bellamy et al 2002 williams et al 2015 wu et al 2012a to better represent the variability of the future climate projected climate data from 19 gcms were used in this study the improved swat model equipped with the mad irrigation scheduling was used in all irrigation simulations the overall goal of this study was to evaluate the impacts of climate change on the water cycle and crop production under the land uses of corn sorghum and fallow in the nhp specific objectives of the study were to 1 quantify the effects of future climate change on hydrologic fluxes and crop yield under corn and sorghum land uses based on 19 gcm projections under two representative concentration pathway rcp emission scenarios of rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 during four 20 year periods of near future 2020 2039 middle 2040 2059 late 2060 2079 and end 2080 2099 of the 21st century with reference to the respective land use of the historical period 2001 2010 and 2 assess the impacts of long term continuous fallow on water partitioning under the eight projected future climate change scenarios 2020 2039 rcp 4 5 2040 2059 rcp 4 5 2060 2079 rcp 4 5 2080 2099 rcp 4 5 2020 2039 rcp 8 5 2040 2059 rcp 8 5 2060 2079 rcp 8 5 and 2080 2099 rcp 8 5 compared to the historical period 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located at the u s department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars conservation and production research laboratory cprl at bushland texas 35 2 n 102 1 w 1170 m above mean sea level in the nhp fig 1 the regional climate is classified as semi arid with an average annual rainfall and temperature of 496 mm and 14 1 c respectively agricultural production in this region is water limited with average evaporation exceeding average precipitation in each month stewart and stenier 1990 the annual standardized alfalfa reference et etrs is 1600 mm in the region the dominant soil is classified as pullman clay loam fine mixed superactive thermic torrertic paleustoll unger and pringle 1981 the major soil characteristics are listed in table s1 the primary land uses in this study area are irrigated corn irrigated sorghum dryland sorghum and continuous fallow the ogallala aquifer is the source of irrigation for crop production fig 1 2 2 improved swat model the swat model is a conceptual physically based hydrologic model arnold et al 1998 the primary model inputs of topography soil land use climate and management practices such as tillage fertilizer application irrigation etc are required recently chen et al 2018a developed and successfully evaluated an improved automatic irrigation algorithm to simulate mad based irrigation scheduling in swat the mad based algorithm more accurately simulated typical irrigation practices in the southern great plains region and outperformed the default auto irrigation functions in comparisons using field measured irrigation data chen et al 2019a the improved algorithm suspends irrigation after crop harvest and allows for a user defined depletion of plant available water to trigger irrigations the mad algorithm not only links irrigation scheduling to soil water holding properties but also to crop database parameters such as maximum rooting depth arcswat 2012 version 2012 10 2 19 revision 664 equipped with the mad auto irrigation algorithm was used for all simulations in this study the calibrated hydrologic and crop yield parameters for the study area were taken from chen et al 2018b in this study swat simulations for land uses of irrigated corn irrigated sorghum dryland sorghum and continuous fallow during 2000 2010 were used as the historical scenarios chen et al 2018b the first year 2000 was used to initialize the model in this study the single hru method was used which means only one hydrologic response unit hru was created to simulate different land uses under climate change scenarios more details about single hru method can be found in chen et al 2019b 2 3 bias corrections of gcm projections climate model data often require bias corrections when projected data are not in agreement with observed data figs s1 and s2 christensen et al 2008 teutschbein and seibert 2010 varis et al 2004 bias corrections use a transformation algorithm to adjust the gcm outputs the purpose is to identify the possible biases between observed and simulated climate variables which is the basis for correcting future gcm projections the bias correction method of distribution mapping is widely used to adjust the gcm projections johnson and sharma 2011 rojas et al 2011 sennikovs and bethers 2009 sun et al 2011 the idea of distribution mapping is to correct the distribution function of gcm simulated climate values to agree with the observed distribution function figs s1 and s2 a transfer function was developed to shift the occurrence distributions of precipitation and temperatures sennikovs and bethers 2009 this correction approach is also known by several other names found in the literature including quantile mapping boe et al 2007 déqué et al 2007 johnson and sharma 2011 sun et al 2011 probability mapping block et al 2009 ines and hansen 2006 statistical downscaling piani et al 2010 and histogram equalization rojas et al 2011 sennikovs and bethers 2009 projected daily precipitation maximum air temperature and minimum air temperature from 19 gcms for the 2000 2099 period were obtained from the downscaled coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip 5 climate and hydrology projections http gdo dcp ucllnl org reclamation 2013 gcm climate projections from rcp 4 5 moderate and rcp 8 5 severe emission scenarios were also considered rcp refers to radiative forcing pathway that describes an emission concentration by the year 2100 van vuuren et al 2011 there are four radiative forcing scenarios which are defined depending on the total radiative forcing in 2100 relative to 1750 table s2 rcp 8 5 is a rising scenario with very high greenhouse gas emission of 1350 ppm in 2100 riahi et al 2007 rcps 4 5 and 6 0 are stabilizing scenarios clarke et al 2007 fujino et al 2006 hijioka et al 2008 smith and wigley 2006 wise et al 2009 rcp 2 6 is a declining scenario with emissions that peak and decline before 2100 van vuuren et al 2006 2007 the gcms used in this study are listed in table 1 the spatial resolution of the gcm projection is 12 5 km 12 5 km the bias correction tool of cmhyd climate model data for hydrologic modeling was used to correct the bias in the downloaded climate data for the study area using the distribution mapping method rathjens et al 2016 the distribution function was used to correct the gcm simulated climate data for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 to approximate observed values for the 2000 2010 period the transfer functions derived from this work were further used to correct the distributions of precipitation and temperatures for the 2020 2099 period of rcp 4 5 and 8 5 2 4 scenario development and analysis bias corrected future climate projections from the 19 gcms were divided into four 20 year periods of 2020 2039 near future 2040 2059 middle of the 21st century 2060 2079 late of the 21st century and 2080 2099 end of the 21st century five years of data prior to the start of each period were used for swat model warm up for example 2015 2019 was used as the warm up period for the 2020 2039 simulation period with rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the eight future climate change scenarios simulated in this study were 2020 2039 rcp 4 5 2040 2059 rcp 4 5 2060 2079 rcp 4 5 2080 2099 rcp 4 5 2020 2039 rcp 8 5 2040 2059 rcp 8 5 2060 2079 rcp 8 5 and 2080 2099 rcp 8 5 in the swat model atmospheric co2 concentration can only be input as a single constant value for a given simulation run for the historical period 2001 2010 the default swat atmospheric co2 concentration of 330 ppm was used according to van vuuren et al 2011 the average co2 concentrations for 2020 2039 rcp 4 5 2040 2059 rcp 4 5 2060 2079 rcp 4 5 2080 2099 rcp 4 5 2020 2039 rcp 8 5 2040 2059 rcp 8 5 2060 2079 rcp 8 5 and 2080 2099 rcp 8 5 scenarios were 434 485 522 534 448 540 675 and 841 ppm respectively table 2 regarding the land uses in the climate change analysis the irrigated corn irrigated sorghum dryland sorghum and continuous fallow scenarios were considered and the detailed swat management operations of irrigated corn irrigated sorghum and dryland sorghum are given in table 3 the simulated average annual results for each land use scenario based on projected future climate data by each of the 19 gcms were averaged for the near future middle late and end of the 21st century and compared with the average 2001 2010 annual historical results for respective land use box plots were used to present the percentage or absolute changes between the simulated variables under eight future climate change scenarios and the historical period 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulated future climate of the study area the median annual precipitation projected by 19 gcms was decreased by 3 8 under eight future climate change scenarios when compared to the precipitation during the historical period 2001 2010 table 4 however a high degree of uncertainty existed in projected annual precipitation for example 12 gcms simulated a decrease in the annual precipitation with a range of 3 to 40 while 7 gcms projected an increase in the precipitation by 3 to 50 under the 2060 2079 rcp 8 5 scenario relative to the historical precipitation table 4 it is interesting to note that the precipitation during the growing season may to october was increased by 0 5 3 6 under the rcp 4 5 scenario fig s3 and changed from 1 2 to 2 2 under the rcp 8 5 scenario fig s4 generally the future precipitation is favorable to the summer crop production increasing co2 concentration in the future will trap heat and hence warm the earth surface which is expected to further influence the precipitation distribution usepa 2019 the median annual minimum air temperature increased by 1 0 1 6 1 9 2 0 0 9 2 2 3 2 and 4 5 under the 2020 2039 rcp 4 5 2040 2059 rcp 4 5 2060 2079 rcp 4 5 2080 2099 rcp 4 5 2020 2039 rcp 8 5 2040 2059 rcp 8 5 2060 2079 rcp 8 5 and 2080 2099 rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively compared to the historical minimum air temperature fig 2 a b the increase in median minimum air temperature during the growing season was even larger with the corresponding values of 1 1 2 0 2 3 2 5 1 4 3 2 4 7 and 6 1 figs s5 and s6 the median annual maximum air temperature also increased by 1 4 2 3 2 7 and 2 8 under the rcp 4 5 scenarios of 2020 2039 2040 2059 2060 2079 and 2080 2099 respectively relative to the historical maximum air temperature fig 2c those increases were 1 2 3 1 4 0 and 6 0 under the rcp 8 5 scenarios of 2020 2039 2040 2059 2060 2079 and 2080 2099 respectively fig 2d a slightly higher increase in median maximum air temperature during growing season was predicted compared to the annual increase value which varied from 1 4 to 3 0 and 1 4 to 6 1 under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively figs s7 and s8 the increases in temperatures were evident in the late and end of the 21st century with the highest increase for the 2080 2099 rcp 8 5 scenario which also had the highest estimated co2 concentration 841 ppm fig 2d table 2 in general the severe emission scenario rcp 8 5 had higher temperature increase level compared to the moderate emission scenario rcp 4 5 prolonged periods of high temperatures in the texas high plains have previously caused severe drought events in 2011 and 2012 claeys and inzé 2013 hoerling et al 2013 shafer et al 2014 also predicted that large parts of texas will experience longer droughts with the number of consecutive dry days increasing by up to 5 days by 2065 however when rainfall occurs it is likely to be more intense with a 10 15 increase in maximum 1 day precipitation amount 3 2 climate change impact on irrigated corn the simulated average annual crop et irrigation and yield during the historical period 2001 2010 was reported in table 5 chen et al 2018b the simulated median annual et of irrigated corn based on the 19 gcm projections decreased by 8 0 9 3 10 3 11 1 9 2 10 8 14 8 and 25 4 under the 2020 2039 rcp 4 5 2040 2059 rcp 4 5 2060 2079 rcp 4 5 2080 2099 rcp 4 5 2020 2039 rcp 8 5 2040 2059 rcp 8 5 2060 2079 rcp 8 5 and 2080 2099 rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively compared to the historical corn et fig 3 a b in addition all gcms simulated the reduction trends of et under eight climate change scenarios the elevated co2 concentration from the historical period of 330 ppm to 434 841 ppm of various future climate scenarios was the dominant factor for the reduction in the simulated et for corn in this study region crop stomatal apertures will close partially to hinder transpiration in response to increased co2 concentration leakey et al 2009 sreeharsha et al 2015 xu et al 2016 and the swat model is able to represent this crop response butcher et al 2014 wu et al 2012b the decline in the future median annual corn et resulted in reductions in the median annual irrigation water use ficklin et al 2009 the median annual irrigation water use for future corn production was reduced by 15 1 20 7 21 7 21 7 16 4 17 9 31 6 and 41 5 under the 2020 2039 rcp 4 5 2040 2059 rcp 4 5 2060 2079 rcp 4 5 2080 2099 rcp 4 5 2020 2039 rcp 8 5 2040 2059 rcp 8 5 2060 2079 rcp 8 5 and 2080 2099 rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively compared to the historical corn irrigation amount fig 3c d the decrease in the future corn irrigation was the highest under the 2080 2099 rcp 8 5 scenario with the highest co2 projection as compared to other future climate scenarios the simulated median irrigated corn yield decreased under all eight climate change scenarios these reductions were relatively smaller and varied from 2 6 7 1 under the rcp 4 5 scenarios for 2020 2039 2040 2059 2060 2079 and 2080 2099 periods relative to corn yield for the historical period fig 3e however median irrigated corn yield decreased exponentially for the latter half of the 21st century under rcp 8 5 scenarios with yield varying from 8 8 22 0 fig 3f cotterman et al 2018 also found that the simulated irrigated corn yields were relatively insensitive to the projected climate change scenarios for the first half of the 21st century through 2050 in the central high plains u s however the simulated irrigated corn yields showed a more pronounced decline towards the end of the century under rcp 8 5 scenario wang et al 2017 also simulated decreases in corn yields by 6 in the 2021 2050 period and 16 reductions in the 2061 2090 period in the st joseph river watershed in the eastern u s corn belt using swat the decrease in projected irrigated corn yield was mainly attributed to the shortening of the maturity period which was caused by the increase of future temperatures in the study area reduced maturity period could decrease time duration of corn to use solar radiation and assimilate co2 which adversely influences the accumulation of corn biomass and final yield araya et al 2017 cotterman et al 2018 islama et al 2012 bassu et al 2014 3 3 climate change impact on irrigated sorghum the simulated median annual et reductions of irrigated sorghum ranged from 6 0 to 10 1 fig 4 a and 6 6 to 27 3 fig 4b under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively compared to the historically irrigated sorghum et similar to irrigated corn swat simulated et reductions for all four periods and emissions scenarios due to the projected increase in co2 concentrations however the decline in the median annual irrigation water use of sorghum was within 15 relative to the historical irrigation amount except for the 2060 2079 and 2080 2099 periods under rcp 8 5 scenarios with 30 0 and 49 2 reductions in median annual irrigation fig 4c d a large variation in the simulated future irrigation for sorghum by 19 gcms was found which was primarily due to the relatively small seasonal irrigation amount of sorghum under the historical period 305 mm compared to the historical precipitation amount of 496 mm therefore the considerable variation of the future precipitation may greatly affect future irrigation water use of the less water demanding sorghum production a decline in irrigated sorghum yield was simulated for nearly all the gcm projections of the eight climate change scenarios when compared to the historical sorghum scenario fig 4e f similar to corn the major reason for the decline in the irrigated sorghum yield was the global warming effect and the associated early crop maturity in the study region sorghum requires 15 fewer heat units than corn to reach physiological maturity therefore the increase of temperatures led to reductions of irrigated sorghum yields that ranged from 6 2 to 18 6 and 8 1 to 42 4 under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively overall in view of the irrigated land uses future climate should play a key role in water saving however climate change will also present additional risks and challenges for crop production and food security 3 4 climate change impact on dryland sorghum and continuous fallow the decrease in simulated median annual et ranged from 10 to 16 for the eight climate change scenarios compared to the historical dryland sorghum et fig 5 a b under dryland conditions in the semi arid nhp region projected reduction in precipitation can have a crucial role in the water cycle and crop production fig 5c d the reduction in dryland sorghum median yield was within 10 of the historical dryland sorghum yield fig 5e f similar to the changes in projected precipitation simulated future dryland sorghum et and yield displayed decreased trends but with high uncertainties using the dssat model kothari et al 2017 also reported a reduction in irrigated sorghum yield by 6 and 8 and a decrease in dryland sorghum yield by 9 and 17 under future climate for the 2040 2070 period under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively compared to the historical period 1980 2010 at helms farm near halfway in the texas high plains as for the continuous fallow land use the future median annual evaporation decreased by 18 8 16 2 16 8 14 5 16 4 20 0 19 6 and 23 0 under the 2020 2039 rcp 4 5 2040 2059 rcp 4 5 2060 2079 rcp 4 5 2080 2099 rcp 4 5 2020 2039 rcp 8 5 2040 2059 rcp 8 5 2060 2079 rcp 8 5 and 2080 2099 rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively compared to the historical evaporation of the fallow land use fig 6 a b the reduction in median annual precipitation amount and the shift of precipitation distribution could be the dominant factors for the decreased future median annual evaporation in this region regarding percolation groundwater recharge the simulated median annual percolation increased by 91 9 95 4 100 2 110 6 102 9 150 9 118 2 and 167 2 under the corresponding climate change scenarios fig 6c d the large increase in the simulated future percolation also emphasized that there was an increase in the precipitation duration projected by the gcms zhang et al 2017 and others suggested that fallow is a possible adaptation strategy for the climate change where the agricultural land is left idle to accumulate soil moisture and recharge groundwater as a means of adapting to future dry conditions bradshaw et al 2004 howden et al 2007 verchot et al 2007 their climate change study also found future climate caused producers to shift cropland into fallow to deal with the decrease in future precipitation in the u s pacific northwest moreover according to a five year field experiment 2007 2012 in garden city kansas holman et al 2018 also recommended that the fallow period was beneficial for dryland winter wheat production therefore the occasional fallow may not only increase groundwater recharge but also enhance dryland crop production for the following year 4 conclusions an improved swat model assembled with a mad automatic irrigation function was used to explore the impacts of climate change on hydrology and crop production of irrigated corn irrigated sorghum dryland sorghum and continuous fallow land uses in the nhp bias corrected climate data using a distribution mapping method for four 20 year periods of near future 2020 to 2039 middle 2040 to 2059 late 2060 to 2079 and end 2080 to 2099 of the 21st century under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios according to 19 gcm projections were investigated in this study the future climate data projected that temperatures will increase significantly particularly during the crop growing season may to october the future annual precipitation will decrease by 3 8 and mainly in months of january and february the swat simulated results showed that median annual et and irrigation of corn land use was reduced by 8 25 and 15 42 respectively under the future climate change scenarios when compared to the historical period 2001 2010 low crop stomatal conductance due to elevated co2 concentration inhibited transpiration and hence reduced plant et the median annual et and irrigation reductions of irrigated sorghum ranged from 6 to 27 and 4 to 49 respectively the decrease in simulated median annual et ranged from 10 to 16 compared to the historical dryland sorghum et the future median annual evaporation decreased by 15 23 for the continuous fallow land use however a considerable increase in the median annual percolation by 92 167 was predicted the median irrigated corn and sorghum yields decreased by 3 22 and 6 42 relative to the historically irrigated corn and sorghum yields which mainly caused by the increase in temperatures and the associated curtailment of the maturity period however the reduction in dryland sorghum median yield was within 10 compared to the historical dryland sorghum yield the results from this study denoted that the historical or current climate was more appropriate for the irrigated sorghum production with less irrigation use and profitable yield however the irrigated corn showed less yield reduction potential and more irrigation water saving compared to the irrigated sorghum under the future climate under dryland conditions projected future precipitation will directly influence the water cycle and crop growth in general an increased amount of precipitation will become percolation and surface runoff rather than et for the future dryland land uses however the projected future climate is complex and uncertain this study provided an

10977,modeling the effects of climate change on hydrology and crop yield provides opportunities for choosing appropriate crops for adapting to climate change in this study climate change impacts on irrigated corn and sorghum dryland rainfed sorghum and continuous fallow in the northern high plains of texas were evaluated using an improved soil and water assessment tool swat model equipped with management allowed depletion mad irrigation scheduling projected climate data 2020 2099 from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip 5 of 19 general circulation models gcms were used climate data were divided into four 20 year periods of near future 2020 2039 middle 2040 2059 late 2060 2079 and end 2080 2099 of the 21st century under two representative concentration pathway rcp emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 for irrigated corn median annual crop evapotranspiration et and irrigation decreased by 8 25 and 15 42 respectively under the climate change scenarios compared to the historical period 2001 2010 the median yield was reduced by 3 22 with exponentially decreases in the latter half of the 21st century for sorghum the reduction of median annual crop et ranged from 6 27 however the decline in the median annual irrigation was within 15 except for the 2060 2079 and 2080 2099 periods under rcp 8 5 scenarios with 30 and 49 reductions in median annual irrigation the median irrigated sorghum yield declined by 6 42 the median annual crop et of dryland sorghum decreased by 10 16 the reduction in median yield was within 10 of the historical dryland sorghum yield the decrease in median annual evaporation varied from 15 23 under future continuous fallow conditions the elevated co2 level of future climate scenarios was the primary factor for the decrease in the et and irrigation the reduction in future crop yield was mainly attributed to the shortening of the maturity period caused by increased future temperature keywords dryland fallow general circulation model gcm irrigation evapotranspiration yield 1 introduction increasing combustion of fossil fuels leads to the rise of atmospheric co2 concentration which traps heat and warms the earth s surface united states environmental protection agency usepa 2019 this warming effect is expected to considerably change the rainfall regimes and increase the frequency of extreme weather events such as flooding drought etc harrison et al 2014 in addition the increased co2 concentration will directly affect crop growth and development sreeharsha et al 2015 xu et al 2016 which will further alter food production and agricultural land use olesen and bindi 2002 the impacts of increasing co2 concentration and global warming on extreme climate events hydrology and crop production are worldwide concerns panagopoulos et al 2014 2015 stefanidis et al 2018 ye and grimm 2013 williams et al 2015 for example bourdages and huard 2010 reported a general increase in temperatures reduction in the duration of snow period and increase in most rainfall indicators and extremes under future climate conditions at 12 stations in ontario canada using the soil and water assessment tool swat model chen et al 2017 simulated that the reductions in crop evapotranspiration et were 12 and 20 for the middle and end of the 21st century respectively compared to the historical period 1994 2009 in the southern high plains of texas u s additionally araya et al 2015 found that simulated increases in co2 concentrations may contribute to small improvements in corn zea mays l yield during the middle of the 21st century in southwestern ethiopia using the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat and agricultural production systems simulator apsim models however associated increased air temperatures in the future might have substantial impacts on corn yield reduction the semi arid northern high plains nhp of texas is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the u s corn is the dominant irrigated crop grown in the region and several counties have reported the largest average corn yields in the nation national agricultural statistics service nass 2019 however corn is sensitive to water stress and generally requires large amounts of irrigation to supplement inadequate and unreliable rainfall in the nhp sorghum sorghum bicolor l is an alternative crop with less sensitivity to water stress and can maintain profitable yields under both irrigated and dryland rainfed conditions stewart et al 1983 however the effects of climate change are complex and uncertain and vary across regions and time periods therefore it is necessary to explore the potential changes in irrigation water use et and yields of the major crops under future climate scenarios in this region to mitigate any adverse impacts or to better manage the land use distribution for instance most general circulation models gcms simulated that the semi arid nhp would become hotter and drier than usual by the end of this century intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2007 which might further decrease water availability for crop production in this intensively irrigated agricultural region adhikari et al 2016 chen et al 2017 modala et al 2017 seager and vecchi 2010 therefore the projected future climate may pose challenges to both irrigated and dryland agriculture in this water limited environment barnett et al 2008 gober and kirkwood 2010 some climate change mitigation adaptation strategies consist of altering crop composition and changing land use regimes e g irrigated farming dryland farming and fallow which show the potential to increase the resilience of agricultural systems to future climate ipcc 2001 changes in land uses from water intensive crops such as corn to less water demanding crops may play a significant role in adapting to climate change rose et al 2012 however such studies are limited or lack representativeness due to the inadequate simulation of irrigation strategies that use management allowed depletion mad irrigation scheduling an approach used by producers and researchers in the nhp and in other arid and semi arid climates around the world callison 2019 evett et al 2011 gheysari et al 2009 merriam 1966 suarez rey et al 2000 a newly developed automatic irrigation method for simulating mad based irrigation scheduling in swat chen et al 2018a was used in this climate change study to more accurately represent irrigation management in this region this irrigation algorithm was extensively evaluated across five states in the southern great plains including texas kansas new mexico colorado and nebraska chen et al 2019a and the results showed the default plant water demand and soil water content automatic irrigation options in swat underestimated and overestimated the actual seasonal irrigation respectively when compared to the improved mad automatic irrigation method chen et al 2019a the impacts of climate change on hydrology and crop yield were heavily dependent on the types of gcm projections bellamy et al 2002 williams et al 2015 wu et al 2012a to better represent the variability of the future climate projected climate data from 19 gcms were used in this study the improved swat model equipped with the mad irrigation scheduling was used in all irrigation simulations the overall goal of this study was to evaluate the impacts of climate change on the water cycle and crop production under the land uses of corn sorghum and fallow in the nhp specific objectives of the study were to 1 quantify the effects of future climate change on hydrologic fluxes and crop yield under corn and sorghum land uses based on 19 gcm projections under two representative concentration pathway rcp emission scenarios of rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 during four 20 year periods of near future 2020 2039 middle 2040 2059 late 2060 2079 and end 2080 2099 of the 21st century with reference to the respective land use of the historical period 2001 2010 and 2 assess the impacts of long term continuous fallow on water partitioning under the eight projected future climate change scenarios 2020 2039 rcp 4 5 2040 2059 rcp 4 5 2060 2079 rcp 4 5 2080 2099 rcp 4 5 2020 2039 rcp 8 5 2040 2059 rcp 8 5 2060 2079 rcp 8 5 and 2080 2099 rcp 8 5 compared to the historical period 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located at the u s department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars conservation and production research laboratory cprl at bushland texas 35 2 n 102 1 w 1170 m above mean sea level in the nhp fig 1 the regional climate is classified as semi arid with an average annual rainfall and temperature of 496 mm and 14 1 c respectively agricultural production in this region is water limited with average evaporation exceeding average precipitation in each month stewart and stenier 1990 the annual standardized alfalfa reference et etrs is 1600 mm in the region the dominant soil is classified as pullman clay loam fine mixed superactive thermic torrertic paleustoll unger and pringle 1981 the major soil characteristics are listed in table s1 the primary land uses in this study area are irrigated corn irrigated sorghum dryland sorghum and continuous fallow the ogallala aquifer is the source of irrigation for crop production fig 1 2 2 improved swat model the swat model is a conceptual physically based hydrologic model arnold et al 1998 the primary model inputs of topography soil land use climate and management practices such as tillage fertilizer application irrigation etc are required recently chen et al 2018a developed and successfully evaluated an improved automatic irrigation algorithm to simulate mad based irrigation scheduling in swat the mad based algorithm more accurately simulated typical irrigation practices in the southern great plains region and outperformed the default auto irrigation functions in comparisons using field measured irrigation data chen et al 2019a the improved algorithm suspends irrigation after crop harvest and allows for a user defined depletion of plant available water to trigger irrigations the mad algorithm not only links irrigation scheduling to soil water holding properties but also to crop database parameters such as maximum rooting depth arcswat 2012 version 2012 10 2 19 revision 664 equipped with the mad auto irrigation algorithm was used for all simulations in this study the calibrated hydrologic and crop yield parameters for the study area were taken from chen et al 2018b in this study swat simulations for land uses of irrigated corn irrigated sorghum dryland sorghum and continuous fallow during 2000 2010 were used as the historical scenarios chen et al 2018b the first year 2000 was used to initialize the model in this study the single hru method was used which means only one hydrologic response unit hru was created to simulate different land uses under climate change scenarios more details about single hru method can be found in chen et al 2019b 2 3 bias corrections of gcm projections climate model data often require bias corrections when projected data are not in agreement with observed data figs s1 and s2 christensen et al 2008 teutschbein and seibert 2010 varis et al 2004 bias corrections use a transformation algorithm to adjust the gcm outputs the purpose is to identify the possible biases between observed and simulated climate variables which is the basis for correcting future gcm projections the bias correction method of distribution mapping is widely used to adjust the gcm projections johnson and sharma 2011 rojas et al 2011 sennikovs and bethers 2009 sun et al 2011 the idea of distribution mapping is to correct the distribution function of gcm simulated climate values to agree with the observed distribution function figs s1 and s2 a transfer function was developed to shift the occurrence distributions of precipitation and temperatures sennikovs and bethers 2009 this correction approach is also known by several other names found in the literature including quantile mapping boe et al 2007 déqué et al 2007 johnson and sharma 2011 sun et al 2011 probability mapping block et al 2009 ines and hansen 2006 statistical downscaling piani et al 2010 and histogram equalization rojas et al 2011 sennikovs and bethers 2009 projected daily precipitation maximum air temperature and minimum air temperature from 19 gcms for the 2000 2099 period were obtained from the downscaled coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip 5 climate and hydrology projections http gdo dcp ucllnl org reclamation 2013 gcm climate projections from rcp 4 5 moderate and rcp 8 5 severe emission scenarios were also considered rcp refers to radiative forcing pathway that describes an emission concentration by the year 2100 van vuuren et al 2011 there are four radiative forcing scenarios which are defined depending on the total radiative forcing in 2100 relative to 1750 table s2 rcp 8 5 is a rising scenario with very high greenhouse gas emission of 1350 ppm in 2100 riahi et al 2007 rcps 4 5 and 6 0 are stabilizing scenarios clarke et al 2007 fujino et al 2006 hijioka et al 2008 smith and wigley 2006 wise et al 2009 rcp 2 6 is a declining scenario with emissions that peak and decline before 2100 van vuuren et al 2006 2007 the gcms used in this study are listed in table 1 the spatial resolution of the gcm projection is 12 5 km 12 5 km the bias correction tool of cmhyd climate model data for hydrologic modeling was used to correct the bias in the downloaded climate data for the study area using the distribution mapping method rathjens et al 2016 the distribution function was used to correct the gcm simulated climate data for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 to approximate observed values for the 2000 2010 period the transfer functions derived from this work were further used to correct the distributions of precipitation and temperatures for the 2020 2099 period of rcp 4 5 and 8 5 2 4 scenario development and analysis bias corrected future climate projections from the 19 gcms were divided into four 20 year periods of 2020 2039 near future 2040 2059 middle of the 21st century 2060 2079 late of the 21st century and 2080 2099 end of the 21st century five years of data prior to the start of each period were used for swat model warm up for example 2015 2019 was used as the warm up period for the 2020 2039 simulation period with rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the eight future climate change scenarios simulated in this study were 2020 2039 rcp 4 5 2040 2059 rcp 4 5 2060 2079 rcp 4 5 2080 2099 rcp 4 5 2020 2039 rcp 8 5 2040 2059 rcp 8 5 2060 2079 rcp 8 5 and 2080 2099 rcp 8 5 in the swat model atmospheric co2 concentration can only be input as a single constant value for a given simulation run for the historical period 2001 2010 the default swat atmospheric co2 concentration of 330 ppm was used according to van vuuren et al 2011 the average co2 concentrations for 2020 2039 rcp 4 5 2040 2059 rcp 4 5 2060 2079 rcp 4 5 2080 2099 rcp 4 5 2020 2039 rcp 8 5 2040 2059 rcp 8 5 2060 2079 rcp 8 5 and 2080 2099 rcp 8 5 scenarios were 434 485 522 534 448 540 675 and 841 ppm respectively table 2 regarding the land uses in the climate change analysis the irrigated corn irrigated sorghum dryland sorghum and continuous fallow scenarios were considered and the detailed swat management operations of irrigated corn irrigated sorghum and dryland sorghum are given in table 3 the simulated average annual results for each land use scenario based on projected future climate data by each of the 19 gcms were averaged for the near future middle late and end of the 21st century and compared with the average 2001 2010 annual historical results for respective land use box plots were used to present the percentage or absolute changes between the simulated variables under eight future climate change scenarios and the historical period 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulated future climate of the study area the median annual precipitation projected by 19 gcms was decreased by 3 8 under eight future climate change scenarios when compared to the precipitation during the historical period 2001 2010 table 4 however a high degree of uncertainty existed in projected annual precipitation for example 12 gcms simulated a decrease in the annual precipitation with a range of 3 to 40 while 7 gcms projected an increase in the precipitation by 3 to 50 under the 2060 2079 rcp 8 5 scenario relative to the historical precipitation table 4 it is interesting to note that the precipitation during the growing season may to october was increased by 0 5 3 6 under the rcp 4 5 scenario fig s3 and changed from 1 2 to 2 2 under the rcp 8 5 scenario fig s4 generally the future precipitation is favorable to the summer crop production increasing co2 concentration in the future will trap heat and hence warm the earth surface which is expected to further influence the precipitation distribution usepa 2019 the median annual minimum air temperature increased by 1 0 1 6 1 9 2 0 0 9 2 2 3 2 and 4 5 under the 2020 2039 rcp 4 5 2040 2059 rcp 4 5 2060 2079 rcp 4 5 2080 2099 rcp 4 5 2020 2039 rcp 8 5 2040 2059 rcp 8 5 2060 2079 rcp 8 5 and 2080 2099 rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively compared to the historical minimum air temperature fig 2 a b the increase in median minimum air temperature during the growing season was even larger with the corresponding values of 1 1 2 0 2 3 2 5 1 4 3 2 4 7 and 6 1 figs s5 and s6 the median annual maximum air temperature also increased by 1 4 2 3 2 7 and 2 8 under the rcp 4 5 scenarios of 2020 2039 2040 2059 2060 2079 and 2080 2099 respectively relative to the historical maximum air temperature fig 2c those increases were 1 2 3 1 4 0 and 6 0 under the rcp 8 5 scenarios of 2020 2039 2040 2059 2060 2079 and 2080 2099 respectively fig 2d a slightly higher increase in median maximum air temperature during growing season was predicted compared to the annual increase value which varied from 1 4 to 3 0 and 1 4 to 6 1 under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively figs s7 and s8 the increases in temperatures were evident in the late and end of the 21st century with the highest increase for the 2080 2099 rcp 8 5 scenario which also had the highest estimated co2 concentration 841 ppm fig 2d table 2 in general the severe emission scenario rcp 8 5 had higher temperature increase level compared to the moderate emission scenario rcp 4 5 prolonged periods of high temperatures in the texas high plains have previously caused severe drought events in 2011 and 2012 claeys and inzé 2013 hoerling et al 2013 shafer et al 2014 also predicted that large parts of texas will experience longer droughts with the number of consecutive dry days increasing by up to 5 days by 2065 however when rainfall occurs it is likely to be more intense with a 10 15 increase in maximum 1 day precipitation amount 3 2 climate change impact on irrigated corn the simulated average annual crop et irrigation and yield during the historical period 2001 2010 was reported in table 5 chen et al 2018b the simulated median annual et of irrigated corn based on the 19 gcm projections decreased by 8 0 9 3 10 3 11 1 9 2 10 8 14 8 and 25 4 under the 2020 2039 rcp 4 5 2040 2059 rcp 4 5 2060 2079 rcp 4 5 2080 2099 rcp 4 5 2020 2039 rcp 8 5 2040 2059 rcp 8 5 2060 2079 rcp 8 5 and 2080 2099 rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively compared to the historical corn et fig 3 a b in addition all gcms simulated the reduction trends of et under eight climate change scenarios the elevated co2 concentration from the historical period of 330 ppm to 434 841 ppm of various future climate scenarios was the dominant factor for the reduction in the simulated et for corn in this study region crop stomatal apertures will close partially to hinder transpiration in response to increased co2 concentration leakey et al 2009 sreeharsha et al 2015 xu et al 2016 and the swat model is able to represent this crop response butcher et al 2014 wu et al 2012b the decline in the future median annual corn et resulted in reductions in the median annual irrigation water use ficklin et al 2009 the median annual irrigation water use for future corn production was reduced by 15 1 20 7 21 7 21 7 16 4 17 9 31 6 and 41 5 under the 2020 2039 rcp 4 5 2040 2059 rcp 4 5 2060 2079 rcp 4 5 2080 2099 rcp 4 5 2020 2039 rcp 8 5 2040 2059 rcp 8 5 2060 2079 rcp 8 5 and 2080 2099 rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively compared to the historical corn irrigation amount fig 3c d the decrease in the future corn irrigation was the highest under the 2080 2099 rcp 8 5 scenario with the highest co2 projection as compared to other future climate scenarios the simulated median irrigated corn yield decreased under all eight climate change scenarios these reductions were relatively smaller and varied from 2 6 7 1 under the rcp 4 5 scenarios for 2020 2039 2040 2059 2060 2079 and 2080 2099 periods relative to corn yield for the historical period fig 3e however median irrigated corn yield decreased exponentially for the latter half of the 21st century under rcp 8 5 scenarios with yield varying from 8 8 22 0 fig 3f cotterman et al 2018 also found that the simulated irrigated corn yields were relatively insensitive to the projected climate change scenarios for the first half of the 21st century through 2050 in the central high plains u s however the simulated irrigated corn yields showed a more pronounced decline towards the end of the century under rcp 8 5 scenario wang et al 2017 also simulated decreases in corn yields by 6 in the 2021 2050 period and 16 reductions in the 2061 2090 period in the st joseph river watershed in the eastern u s corn belt using swat the decrease in projected irrigated corn yield was mainly attributed to the shortening of the maturity period which was caused by the increase of future temperatures in the study area reduced maturity period could decrease time duration of corn to use solar radiation and assimilate co2 which adversely influences the accumulation of corn biomass and final yield araya et al 2017 cotterman et al 2018 islama et al 2012 bassu et al 2014 3 3 climate change impact on irrigated sorghum the simulated median annual et reductions of irrigated sorghum ranged from 6 0 to 10 1 fig 4 a and 6 6 to 27 3 fig 4b under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively compared to the historically irrigated sorghum et similar to irrigated corn swat simulated et reductions for all four periods and emissions scenarios due to the projected increase in co2 concentrations however the decline in the median annual irrigation water use of sorghum was within 15 relative to the historical irrigation amount except for the 2060 2079 and 2080 2099 periods under rcp 8 5 scenarios with 30 0 and 49 2 reductions in median annual irrigation fig 4c d a large variation in the simulated future irrigation for sorghum by 19 gcms was found which was primarily due to the relatively small seasonal irrigation amount of sorghum under the historical period 305 mm compared to the historical precipitation amount of 496 mm therefore the considerable variation of the future precipitation may greatly affect future irrigation water use of the less water demanding sorghum production a decline in irrigated sorghum yield was simulated for nearly all the gcm projections of the eight climate change scenarios when compared to the historical sorghum scenario fig 4e f similar to corn the major reason for the decline in the irrigated sorghum yield was the global warming effect and the associated early crop maturity in the study region sorghum requires 15 fewer heat units than corn to reach physiological maturity therefore the increase of temperatures led to reductions of irrigated sorghum yields that ranged from 6 2 to 18 6 and 8 1 to 42 4 under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively overall in view of the irrigated land uses future climate should play a key role in water saving however climate change will also present additional risks and challenges for crop production and food security 3 4 climate change impact on dryland sorghum and continuous fallow the decrease in simulated median annual et ranged from 10 to 16 for the eight climate change scenarios compared to the historical dryland sorghum et fig 5 a b under dryland conditions in the semi arid nhp region projected reduction in precipitation can have a crucial role in the water cycle and crop production fig 5c d the reduction in dryland sorghum median yield was within 10 of the historical dryland sorghum yield fig 5e f similar to the changes in projected precipitation simulated future dryland sorghum et and yield displayed decreased trends but with high uncertainties using the dssat model kothari et al 2017 also reported a reduction in irrigated sorghum yield by 6 and 8 and a decrease in dryland sorghum yield by 9 and 17 under future climate for the 2040 2070 period under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively compared to the historical period 1980 2010 at helms farm near halfway in the texas high plains as for the continuous fallow land use the future median annual evaporation decreased by 18 8 16 2 16 8 14 5 16 4 20 0 19 6 and 23 0 under the 2020 2039 rcp 4 5 2040 2059 rcp 4 5 2060 2079 rcp 4 5 2080 2099 rcp 4 5 2020 2039 rcp 8 5 2040 2059 rcp 8 5 2060 2079 rcp 8 5 and 2080 2099 rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively compared to the historical evaporation of the fallow land use fig 6 a b the reduction in median annual precipitation amount and the shift of precipitation distribution could be the dominant factors for the decreased future median annual evaporation in this region regarding percolation groundwater recharge the simulated median annual percolation increased by 91 9 95 4 100 2 110 6 102 9 150 9 118 2 and 167 2 under the corresponding climate change scenarios fig 6c d the large increase in the simulated future percolation also emphasized that there was an increase in the precipitation duration projected by the gcms zhang et al 2017 and others suggested that fallow is a possible adaptation strategy for the climate change where the agricultural land is left idle to accumulate soil moisture and recharge groundwater as a means of adapting to future dry conditions bradshaw et al 2004 howden et al 2007 verchot et al 2007 their climate change study also found future climate caused producers to shift cropland into fallow to deal with the decrease in future precipitation in the u s pacific northwest moreover according to a five year field experiment 2007 2012 in garden city kansas holman et al 2018 also recommended that the fallow period was beneficial for dryland winter wheat production therefore the occasional fallow may not only increase groundwater recharge but also enhance dryland crop production for the following year 4 conclusions an improved swat model assembled with a mad automatic irrigation function was used to explore the impacts of climate change on hydrology and crop production of irrigated corn irrigated sorghum dryland sorghum and continuous fallow land uses in the nhp bias corrected climate data using a distribution mapping method for four 20 year periods of near future 2020 to 2039 middle 2040 to 2059 late 2060 to 2079 and end 2080 to 2099 of the 21st century under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios according to 19 gcm projections were investigated in this study the future climate data projected that temperatures will increase significantly particularly during the crop growing season may to october the future annual precipitation will decrease by 3 8 and mainly in months of january and february the swat simulated results showed that median annual et and irrigation of corn land use was reduced by 8 25 and 15 42 respectively under the future climate change scenarios when compared to the historical period 2001 2010 low crop stomatal conductance due to elevated co2 concentration inhibited transpiration and hence reduced plant et the median annual et and irrigation reductions of irrigated sorghum ranged from 6 to 27 and 4 to 49 respectively the decrease in simulated median annual et ranged from 10 to 16 compared to the historical dryland sorghum et the future median annual evaporation decreased by 15 23 for the continuous fallow land use however a considerable increase in the median annual percolation by 92 167 was predicted the median irrigated corn and sorghum yields decreased by 3 22 and 6 42 relative to the historically irrigated corn and sorghum yields which mainly caused by the increase in temperatures and the associated curtailment of the maturity period however the reduction in dryland sorghum median yield was within 10 compared to the historical dryland sorghum yield the results from this study denoted that the historical or current climate was more appropriate for the irrigated sorghum production with less irrigation use and profitable yield however the irrigated corn showed less yield reduction potential and more irrigation water saving compared to the irrigated sorghum under the future climate under dryland conditions projected future precipitation will directly influence the water cycle and crop growth in general an increased amount of precipitation will become percolation and surface runoff rather than et for the future dryland land uses however the projected future climate is complex and uncertain this study provided an overview of the impact of climate change on the water use and crop production under different land uses in the nhp to sustain the identification and development of climate adaptation strategies at

quality traits of rice grain were measured based on experimental results the relationships of water nitrogen yield and water nitrogen quality were simulated the principal components analysis method was adopted to identify the main traits based on which a comprehensive quality model of rice grain was established on this basis a multi objective quadratic model for supporting the use of both water and fertilizer was developed and solved by fuzzy goal programming under eight scenarios the framework combined principal component analysis with water nitrogen yield and water nitrogen quality models to establish a comprehensive quality model so that the amounts of both water and fertilizer could be optimized simultaneously different quality traits showed different responses to the changes in water consumption and nitrogen application rates and quadratic functions could well describe the relationships of water nitrogen yield and water nitrogen grain quality under the tested scenarios under different scenarios optimal allocation amounts of water and fertilizer were different the results showed that irrigation amount and fertilizer application rates could be adjusted within certain limits for improving crop yields and grain quality the optimal nitrogen application rate ranged from 80 to140 kg ha and the water consumption rate ranged from 5000 to 8000 m3 ha larger amounts of water and fertilizer inputs could be counter productive keywords quality function water and fertilizer coupling system optimization fuzzy goal programming scenario analysis rice grain 1 introduction rice is one of the three major food crops and over half of the population across the world uses rice as their main food ouyang et al 2005 china is one of the largest producers of rice from the perspectives of annual yields and planting areas rice is the staple food for more than 65 of the chinese people ma and yuan 2015 peng et al 2009 precise irrigation and fertilization can promote the growth of rice which is beneficial for both rice yields and grain quality with the improvements of living standards the quality of rice grain has become a major concern due to the increasing demands of consumers lisle et al 2000 grain quality depends on gene and external environment han et al 2004 factors such as cultivation measures weather conditions nutrient supply and trace elements have impacts on the quality of rice grain and the application rate of nitrogen fertilizer is one of the main factors peng et al 2009 thus optimizing the integrated use of water and fertilizer is necessary to promote crop productivity and grain quality a large number of experimental studies on deficit irrigation of rice have been reported wang et al 2017 ghosh et al 2004 previous results showed that controlled irrigation is in favor of water saving and yield improvement the development of controlled irrigation technologies is an effective way to improve water use efficiency and promote sustainable agricultural development peng et al 2010 in addition to irrigation nitrogen fertilizer is also an important factor to promote the growth and development of rice china is one of the largest producers and users of nitrogen fertilizer the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied to rice is 180 kg ha in china nearly doubles that of any other country jing et al 2007a the excessive fertilizer will not only waste resources damage soil fertility pollute the environment but also decrease the rice quality hanifzadeh et al 2017 many researches lay emphases on the coupling effects of water and fertilizer on rice das et al 2009 li et al 2013 woli et al 2010 these results show that the roles of nitrogen and water are not independent of each other hence studying the joint effects of water and fertilizer on rice growth is of great significance with the advancement of society people are concerned about the quality of crops in addition to the yields of crops leading to the necessity to pay more attention on the quality of rice grain however few researches have been reported to focus on the combined effects of water and fertilizer on the quality of rice grain therefore it is meaningful to research the relations among water consumption nitrogen fertilizer application and the quality of rice grain perez and juliano 2010 many studies have shown that improvements in rice quality may be accompanied by a decrease in rice yields liu et al 2013 it is necessary to handle the inverse relationships between rice yield and rice quality or in other words to improve the quality of the grain while ensuring the yields for this purpose some studies have focused on finding optimal irrigation and fertilization strategies for rice production through setting different experimental treatments zhang et al 2008 kinoshita et al 2017 perez et al 1996 however screening of optimal irrigation strategies from experiments was based on limited treatments which made the results heavily dependent on the experimental conditions and merely relatively optimal therefore an in depth study of the quantitative response relationships among water fertilizer rice yield and rice quality can help reveal a greater picture and thus achieve more integrated management many studies have quantitatively analyzed the correlations between rice yield water consumption irrigation water and fertilizer during the whole growth period these studies simulated the quantitative relationship between rice yield and stagewise water consumption through water and fertilizer production function wang et al 2017 in terms of rice quality some studies have analyzed the correlation among quality water and fertilizer but researches focusing on water nitrogen quality functions have not been reported establishing reasonable water nitrogen yield and water nitrogen quality functions through systematic and experimental research is an important theoretical basis and scientific premise for implementing optimized irrigation management measures that balance between yields and quality optimization is an effective technique to look for a combination of decision variables that allows the highest productivity under different scenarios initially many studies focused on the maximization of yields based on water production function subjecting to limited water resources only gu et al 2016 then optimal irrigation schedule can be calculated kisekka et al 2017 subsequently many researches focused on optimizing the use of both water and fertilizer based on the water nitrogen yield function cao et al 2010 however few studies considered the quality of rice when optimizing the use of water and fertilizer therefore it is significant to pursue a comprehensive management of water and fertilizer through optimization techniques based on water nitrogen quality function in addition optimization of water and fertilizer involves multiple conflicting objectives with various constraints and it can be described by multi objective programming models ghahraman and sepaskhah 2002 conventional researches usually considered the maximization of crop yields or the minimization of economic losses as objective functions to obtain optimal irrigation schedule through linear programming dynamic programming nonlinear programming and other optimization methods ren et al 2019 however consumer demand for production is close to saturation while demand for grain quality is improving progressively therefore both yield and grain quality should be considered as objectives to construct decision making model mo et al 2017 the aim of this study is to optimize water allocation and nitrogen application to maximize the yield and quality of rice under different scenarios the management goal is to improve the quality of rice through precise deficit irrigation and fertilizer application in spite of its incompatible relationships with rice yield this study entails the following elements 1 rice production experiments coupling water and fertilizer was conducted in northeast china 2 based on the experiment results modeling equations were established to simulate the responses of the yield and quality of rice grain to water consumptions and nitrogen applications during the whole growth period 3 comprehensive quality model of rice grain was established using the principal component analysis method and 4 the applications of water and fertilizer were optimized under different scenarios through multi objective quadratic programming model and the fuzzy goal programming method outputs of this study is anticipated to improve our knowledge of the combined effects of water and nitrogen on the yield and quality of rice and will have potential applications in precise irrigation management for high quality rice production 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the problem in the crop water and fertilizer coupling system the subsystems such as natural resources society economy and ecology are interrelated for example more irrigation water and higher fertilizer application generally result in higher yield and improved food security but it also leads to larger natural resource consumption and more ecological damage it should be realized that with more and more consumers attention paid to grain quality it is the quality rather than yield brings higher economic benefit accordingly in order to achieve optimal water and fertilizer allocations this study intends to find appropriate rates for water consumption and fertilizer application to satisfy yield and grain quality requirements under different scenarios the framework of the study is shown in fig 1 2 2 field experimentation 2 2 1 experimental site the experiments were conducted in the heilongjiang rice irrigation test center which is located in qing an county heilongjiang province of northeastern china latitude 45 63 n longitude 125 44 e the experiments lasted from may to september in 2014 this site has a cold temperate continental monsoon climate with annual precipitation of 577 mm evaporation of 770 mm mean temperature of 1 69 c mean sunshine duration of 2600 h and frost free period of 128 d 2 2 2 experimental design the experiments tested four modes of irrigation including controlled irrigation c1 intermittent irrigation c2 shallow wet irrigation c3 and flood irrigation c4 besides the experiments used four levels of nitrogen application including 135 kg ha n1 105 kg ha n2 75 kg ha n3 and non nitrogen fertilizer n4 i e ck each treatment was repeated three times there are thus a total of 48 plots with each being 100 m2 the tested rice variety was longqing rice no 3 which was transplanted on may 21th and the yield was measured on september 18th table 1 shows different irrigation modes the tillering period was divided into three stages the early stage is from the beginning of tillering to the emergence of leaf sheath of new tillers with 50 of plants the end stage is from 80 of the plants showed new tillering to 10 of the plants started jointing the rest is the middle stage 2 2 3 observations and measurements observation data included irrigation amount soil moisture height of water layer water discharge and yield besides ten grain quality indicators were used for each treatment five samples were collected to measure the quality indicators of rice the grain quality indicators included paddy rice weight brown rice weight milled rice weight brown rice rate amylose protein moisture content chalky kernel rate average length and length width ratio 2 3 model development 2 3 1 empirical model before data analysis the data were normalized and standardized data standardization is the indexation of statistical data the standardization of data mainly included two aspects chemotactic and dimensionless treatment chemotactic data treatment mainly addressed the diversity of data and the aim of dimensionless data processing was mainly to enhance comparability water nitrogen yield function and water nitrogen quality function during the whole growth period of rice were expressed in the quadratic form which can be obtained by regression the fitting formulation is expressed as y a k b k x 1 c k x 2 d k x 1 2 e k x 1 x 2 f k x 2 2 2 3 2 principal components analysis as an individual quality indicator can only reflect a single trait of rice rice grain quality is an integrated concept a comprehensive evaluation for rice grain quality is needed various methods of comprehensive evaluation have been used to get a precise result of rice grain quality the main methods encompass comprehensive index method techniques for order preference by similarity to ideal solution principal component analysis pca and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation among the above methods pca is a statistical approach to reconstitute several independent comprehensive indicators to replace original indicators the linear combination of the original variables is obtained through the rotation of spatial coordinates so as to simplify the multidimensional problem zhang and ma 2008 zhang 2009 based on this advantage the pca was adopted to evaluate the quality of rice grain specifically rice grain quality data were analyzed by pca using spss to build rice grain comprehensive quality rcq model based on the following procedure liu et al 2008 transform p variables x 1 x 2 x p of n samples to k k p comprehensive variables f 1 f 2 f k which is a linear combination of original variables among which comprehensive variables f 1 f 2 f k are called the first second and kth principal components and they can be expressed as follows 1 f 1 a 11 x 1 a 21 x 2 a p 1 x p f 2 a 12 x 1 a 22 x 2 a p 2 x p f k a 1 k x 1 a 2 k x 2 a p k x p take f 1 f 2 f k as independent variables then their corresponding variance contribution rates can be obtained and they are regarded as coefficients of independent variables to build the rcq model 2 3 3 multi objective water fertilizer optimization model based on fuzzy goal programming goal programming model is one of the methods to deal with multi objective programming problems moqp many researchers used it for fuzzy mathematical programming problem most of the previous studies focused on linear programming problem leung 2007 while few addressed fuzzy quadratic programming problem in the recent years fuzzy goal programming fgp approach has been introduced to solve moqp problems with several objectives such as yield and quality objectives the function describing the relationship among water consumption nitrogen application and grain quality was in quadratic form 2 3 3 1 model description classic multi objective quadratic programming problem can be described as lachhwani 2012 2 m a x m i z e z 1 x z 2 x z i x 3 where z i x c i x x t d i x i 1 2 k 4 subject to x s x r n a x b x 0 b r m x t d i x i 1 2 k is a strictly concave quadratic function on convex set of all its feasible solutions such that a relative maximum of z i x i 1 2 k over s and one of relative maximum of z i x is a global maximum lia 2009 in fuzzy programming the fuzzy goals are characterized by their associated membership functions membership for the ith fuzzy goal can be described as baky 2009 5 μ d i x 0 if d i x p p d i x p if 0 d i x p 1 if d i x 0 where the distance function d i with the unit weight can be calculated by 6 d i x z i z i x i 1 2 k this distance depends on x at x x ideal point in x space d i 0 and x x nadir point in x space z i x z i then the maximum value d i of d i x can be expressed as 7 d i z i z i and 8 p sup d i in mathematics sup is used to represent the upper bound i e the smallest upper bound when using the fgp the membership function of the highest degree is 1 so the flexible membership can be described as 9 p d i x p d i d i 1 and 10 z i z i x p d i p d i 0 i 1 2 k where d i 0 d i 0 describe the under and over deviational variables respectively and d i d i 0 based on fgp the multi objective quadratic

where λ represents the fuzzy achievement function consisting of the weighted under deviational variables the numerical weights w i 0 i 1 2 k represent the relative importance of achieving the aspired level of the respective fuzzy goals subject to the constraint set in the decision making situation the diagram of the proposed fgp model is shown in fig 2 2 3 3 2 model formulation model 14 maximize z

amount constraint 16 aims to control water consumption amount constraint 17 aims to ensure rice grain comprehensive quality constraint 18 aims to ensure rice yield 2 3 3 3 scenarios analysis the quality of rice grain in this paper was divided into several categories such as rice grain filling quality appearance quality nutrition quality and comprehensive quality scenarios 1 3 gave priority to two kinds of rice grain quality to find the optimal combinations of water and nitrogen and maximize these two kinds of rice grain quality scenarios 4 7 considered not only rice grain quality but also rice yield in which priority was given to one kind of grain quality to find optimal solutions scenario 8 took into account all quality indicators of the rice grain as well as the rice yield the scenarios are designed as follows 1 s1 maximize the rice grain filling and appearance quality 19 maximize z 1 x 1 x 2 z 2 x 1 x 2 2 s2 maximize the rice grain filling and nutrition quality 20 maximize z 1 x 1 x 2 z 2 x 1 x 2 z 3 x 1 x 2 3 s3 maximize the rice grain appearance and nutrition quality 21 maximize z 2 x 1 x 2 z 3 x 1 x 2 z 4 x 1 x 2 4 s4 maximize the grain comprehensive quality and yield of rice 22 maximize z 5 x 1 x 2 z 6 x 1 x 2 5 s5 maximize the grain filling and comprehensive quality and yield of rice 23 maximize z 1 x 1 x 2 z 5 x 1 x 2 z 6 x 1 x 2 6 s6 maximize the grain appearance and comprehensive quality and yield of rice 24 maximize z 2 x 1 x 2 z 5 x 1 x 2 z 6 x 1 x 2 7 s7 maxmize the grain nutrition and comprehensive quality and yield of rice 25 maximize z 3 x 1

data of rice water consumption nitrogen application rate and grain quality were standardized by max min method liao et al 2012 the results are showed in table 2 as can be seen from table 2 different rice grain quality traits have great differences among them paddy rice weight brown rice weight and milled rice weight have large coefficient of variation which are 0 96 0 93 and 0 96 respectively the results showed that there were significant differences among these three quality indexes in different treatments in comparison the variation coefficients of the other three indexes brown rice rate average length and chalky kernel rate are relatively small which are 0 36 0 42 and 0 49 respectively it indicates that these three indexes are relatively stable regression analysis was performed to describe relationship among water consumption nitrogen application and grain quality fitting results are displayed in table 3 and fig 3 fig 3 shows the relationship among nitrogen application water consumption and rice grain quality or yield fig 3 a k are paddy rice weight brown rice weight milled rice weight brown rice rate amylose protein moisture content chalky kernel rate average length and yield graphic trend indicates that rice traits increase or decrease with nitrogen application rate and water consumption the first kind of graphics is convex surface and the maximum values appear in the middle such as fig 3 a c and i the second kind of graphics is convex surface and the maximum values appear at borders such as fig 3 d g the third kind of graphic is concave surface and the minimum value appears in the middle such as fig 3 h the forth kind of graphics are not obvious convex or concave surface so that they cannot be simply described such as fig 3 e j and k due to partial regression coefficients in the equation have been standardized the absolute value of the partial regression coefficient in the equation can be used to judge the significant degree of each factor on the yield the positive and negative values of the coefficient can indicate the synergistic or antagonistic effect of each factor on the yield coefficients of x 1 and x 2 are positive values indicating synergistic effect is generated by nitrogen application rate and water consumption on rice traits and on the contrary are antagonism from table 3 it can be seen that antagonism effect is generated by nitrogen application rate on moisture content chalky kernel rate average length and length width ratio while other indicators contribute to the synergistic effect similarly antagonism effect is generated by water consumption on chalky kernel rate while other indicators are for the synergistic effect higher values of negative coefficients of x 1 2 and x 2 2 imply that too much nitrogen application rate and water consumption can inhibit development of rice grain quality and yield and most rice traits follow this rule which can be verified from table 3 absolute values of coefficients of x 1 x 2 can show the coupling effects of nitrogen application rate and water consumption on rice traits to test the results of the fitting model correlation coefficient r determination coefficient r 2 and significance f p are considered when p 0 05 the model can be considered as significant at the level of α 0 05 or the confidence reaches 95 when p 0 01 the model can be considered as significant at the level of α 0 01 or the confidence reaches 99 when p 0 001 it is considered that the model is significant at the level of α 0 001 or the confidence level reaches 99 9 thus most of fitting results are good except milled rice weight and amylose whose values of r and r 2 are small and moisture content whose value of p is high p 0 05 3 2 comprehensive quality model for rice grain statistic package for social science software was used to analyze the principal component of the ten quality traits of rice grain tables 4 and 5 describe the eigenvectors contribution rate and accumulation contribution rate of the principal components the result shows that the accumulation contribution rate of four principal components is 87 26 85 which can save and explain all information jolliffe 2011 the first principal component is grain filling index with the contribution rate is 35 51 indexes with higher load indexes including paddy rice weight brown rice weight and milled rice weight are all positive the second principal component is grain appearance index with the contribution rate is 23 77 and indexes with higher load including brown rice rate average length and length width ratio are all positive the third principal component is grain nutrition index 1 with the contribution rate being 17 99 including protein moisture content and chalky kernel rate protein is negative load with the coefficient being 0 58 moisture content and chalky kernel rate are positive loads whose coefficients are 0 72 and 0 83 respectively the fourth principal component is grain nutrition index 2 with the contribution rate being 10 the only amylose has high load and a coefficient of 0 72 according to the results in table 5 y i is principal components and dependent variable i

ranges of nitrogen application rate and water consumption which were set as standardized data 0 1 2 where 0 1 is experiment data scope and 1 1 2 is expansion value to get better optimized results similarly in constraints 50 and 51 standardized data 0 7 was used to ensure that the values of rice comprehensive quality and yield were not too small for guaranteeing of food security and economic

rate and water consumption data to original data we have x 81 106 65 kg ha 1 and x 82 5977 m 3 ha 1 the optimal solutions for the above formulation are shown in tables 7 and 8 and figs 4 and 5 tables 7 and 8 show the under variables decision variables and rice grain quality figs 4 and 5 describe the comparison results of rice grain quality and yield under different scenarios results in table 8 and figs 4 and 5 are relative values table 7 shows that the optimal water consumption interval is 5642 7252 m3 ha and the optimal nitrogen application rate is 81 00 130 95 kg ha s4 and s7 need higher nitrogen application rate of 130 95 and 139 05 kg ha s3 and s6 need lower nitrogen application rate of 85 00 and 81 00 kg ha s7 needs higher water consumption rate of 7252 m3 ha fig 4 a demonstrates nitrogen application rates under the eight scenarios the maximum value happened in s7 with the value being 1 03 the minimum value happened in s3 and s6 which took 0 62 the maximum value was 60 larger than the minimum value such results indicate that the improvements over grain nutrition comprehensive quality and rice yield would require higher nitrogen fertilizer application but the appearance quality of rice would not require too much nitrogen fertilizer for improvements fig 4 b demonstrates water consumption under the eight scenarios the maximum value took place in s7 with the value being 0 89 the minimum value happened in s1 with a value of 0 39 the maximum value was 128 larger than the minimum value the result shows that the improvements of grain nutrition comprehensive quality and yield of rice would require higher water consumption but the grain filling quality would not require much water to be improved fig 4 c demonstrates grain filling quality under the eight scenarios the maximum value happened in s1 with the value being 1 78 the minimum value took place in s7 with the value being 0 62 the maximum value was 187 larger than the minimum value according to fig 4 c it could be concluded that s1 s2 s5 and s8 could provide higher levels of grain filling quality fig 4 d demonstrates grain appearance quality under the eight scenarios the maximum value happened in s1 with the value being 1 70 the minimum value happened in s5 and the value was 1 13 the maximum value was 50 larger than the minimum value according to fig 4 d it could be concluded that s1 and s7 could provide higher levels of grain appearance quality fig 4 e and f demonstrates grain nutrition quality affected by protein moisture content chalking kernel rate and amylose under the eight scenarios the maximum value happened in s6 and the minimum value appeared in s1 according to fig 4 e and f it could be concluded that s2 s3 and s7 could provide higher levels of grain nutrition quality fig 4 g demonstrates grain comprehensive quality under the eight scenarios the maximum value happened in s3 and the value was 1 42 the minimum value happened in s7 and the value was 0 83 the maximum value was 71 larger than the minimum value according to fig 4 g it could be seen that s3 s5 and s6 could provide higher levels of grain appearance quality fig 5 demonstrates the rice yield under the eight scenarios the maximum value appeared in s4 whereas the minimum value appeared in s3 such results may be because of the high demands for rice yield under s4 according to fig 5 we can draw the conclusion that s4 can provide higher level of grain appearance quality 4 discussion this paper attempted to gain insights into the water nitrogen yield and water nitrogen quality relationships and thus to optimize water allocation and fertilizer application for supporting decision making under different scenarios the first part of this research was to establish functions of water nitrogen yield and water nitrogen quality based on quadratic models fitting results indicate that quadratic functions could well describe the relationships of water nitrogen yield and water nitrogen quality under most conditions although milled rice weight and amylose functions implied lower correlation and significance paddy rice weight brown rice weight and milled rice weight would increase firstly and then decrease with the increase of nitrogen application rate and water consumption this is because that these three quality traits all belong to yield composition and the photosynthesis of crops depends on the situation of water and fertilizer in soil water and fertilizer enhance or restrict the functions of each other and eventually affect the yields of crops wang et al 2018 due to a lack of water stoma of leaves are closed photosynthesis is blocked and photosynthesis level of leaves is weakened in severe drought this extremely unfavorable to the absorption and utilization of nutritional substances in rice root system and also affects the yield of rice when the soil water is insufficient a reasonable coupling model of water and fertilizer could be adopted to utilize nitrogen and water for an obvious synergistic effect within a certain range as well as an acceptable yield pan et al 2017 brown rice rate amylose chalky kernel rate and yield increase with nitrogen application rate indicating that higher nitrogen application rate plays a role in increasing these traits this is because the quality of rice is significantly affected by the coupling of water and fertilizer and the high yield and quality of rice can be guaranteed by better water fertilizer coupling modes chowdary et al 2004 management of water and fertilizer affects starch content and composition especially water and nitrogenous fertilizer the effects of water and nitrogenous fertilizer on starch are different due to the different structures of starch the irrigation effect of amylose and total starch content is greater than that of nitrogen application in contrast the effect of nitrogen application of amylose was greater than that of water application under the condition of guaranteed water supply increasing nitrogen fertilizer application would increase the bleeding intensity of rice and the content of amino acid in the injury liquid would also increase most traits of rice increase first and then decrease with water consumption thus it could be concluded that more water was not necessarily good for crop growth and quality improvement however amylose chalky kernel rate and length width ratio decrease with water consumption indicating that higher water consumption plays a role in decreasing these traits the absorption of water and nutrients by crops is an independent physiological process but the impacts of water and nutrients on crops are closely related and complex the availability of water affects the physicochemical properties and microbial activity of soil and the availability of nutrients in soil as well as the absorption and utilization of nutrients in plants too little water could not fully exert the fertilizer effect while too much water may cause fertilizer loss and crop yield reduction irrational fertilization can also lead to reductions of water use efficiency and crop yields the second part of this paper was the establishment of rice grain comprehensive quality model using the principal component analysis method grain filling quality grain appearance quality grain nutrition quality 1 and grain nutrition quality 2 were the 1st 4th principal component respectively using principal component analysis then the grain comprehensive quality was obtained many researchers have done similar work in other fields and the feasibility of this method was verified zhang and ma 2008 frati et al 2013 maji 2012 in this study principal component analysis was used to create a comprehensive model of rice grain quality in heilongjiang province and the comprehensive level of rice quality was expressed in a quantitative form so as to reduce the difference brought by single index on rice yield and quality meanwhile the quantitative expression method provided possible lines for the completion of the multi objective water fertilizer optimization model for rice based on fuzzy objective programming the third part of this paper was to optimize water and fertilizer allocation under eight scenarios using multi objective quadratic programming based on the results of the previous two parts the model was solved by fuzzy goal programming method if high grain filling quality and grain appearance quality were required nitrogen application rate and water consumption should be around 100 kg ha and 5500 m3 ha under s1 if high grain nutrition quality 1 is required nitrogen application rate and water consumption should be around 130 kg ha and 7000 m3 ha under s7 if high grain nutrition quality 2 and grain comprehensive quality is required nitrogen application rate and water consumption should be around 80 kg ha and 6000 m3 ha under s3 and s6 if high rice yield is required nitrogen application rate and water consumption should be around 130 kg ha and 6000 m3 ha such as s4 the optimized range of nitrogen application rate was 80 140 kg ha while that for water consumption was 5000 8000 m3 ha this indicates that irrigation and fertilizer application would be beneficial to crop growth and quality improvement within limits while large amounts of water and fertilizer could even be counter productive different combinations of water and fertilizer made differences in rice yield and rice grain quality with different market supplies and demands consumer preferences and water supply and demand producers can achieve individualized and diversified integrated management plans of water and fertilizer by means of goal based optimization and irrigation decision making the results of this study were basically the same as previous studies which could validate the optimization results of this paper for example believed that as long as soil water was controlled within a certain critical range the contents of protein amylose and brown rice under controlled irrigation were all lower than flood irrigation and the weight of polished rice and comprehensive palatability score were higher than basin irrigation indicating that proper water control could improve the quality of rice believed that moderate drought during the filling stage could improve the rate of whole rice and reduce chalkiness most studies lin et al 2006 believed that the amount of nitrogen fertilizer and the retrogradation of nitrogen fertilizer improved the milling quality of rice but it would make the appearance quality worse it improved the nutritional quality of rice and reduced the eating quality increased the brown rice weight white rice weight and white rice rate but also increased the chalky grain rate of rice 5 conclusions this paper established functions revealing water nitrogen yield and water nitrogen quality relationships of rice in the form of quadratic models paddy rice weight brown rice weight and milled rice weight increased first and then decreased with the nitrogen application rate and water consumption brown rice rate amylose chalky kernel rate and yield increased with the nitrogen application rate principal component eigenvector was used as coefficient of independent variables to establish linear relation equations for each principal component such as rice grain filling appearance and nutrition quality rice grain comprehensive quality model was established using the principal component analysis method the nitrogen application rate was higher under s4 and s7 being 130 95 and 139 05 kg ha respectively the nitrogen application rate was lower under s3 and s6 which was 85 00 and 81 00 kg ha respectively the highest water consumption at 7252 m3 ha took place under scenario 7 the yield was maximized under s4 and minimized under s3 table 9 acknowledgments this research was supported by the national key r d plan of china grant number 2016yfc0400107 and national natural science foundation of china

10978,nowadays attentions have been increasingly paid to the quality of grain in the production of rice a framework for understanding the effects of water and fertilizer on rice yield and grain quality was proposed through integrating techniques of experiment simulation and optimization firstly experiments with varied combinations of water and fertilizer were conducted during which ten quality traits of rice grain were measured based on experimental results the relationships of water nitrogen yield and water nitrogen quality were simulated the principal components analysis method was adopted to identify the main traits based on which a comprehensive quality model of rice grain was established on this basis a multi objective quadratic model for supporting the use of both water and fertilizer was developed and solved by fuzzy goal programming under eight scenarios the framework combined principal component analysis with water nitrogen yield and water nitrogen quality models to establish a comprehensive quality model so that the amounts of both water and fertilizer could be optimized simultaneously different quality traits showed different responses to the changes in water consumption and nitrogen application rates and quadratic functions could well describe the relationships of water nitrogen yield and water nitrogen grain quality under the tested scenarios under different scenarios optimal allocation amounts of water and fertilizer were different the results showed that irrigation amount and fertilizer application rates could be adjusted within certain limits for improving crop yields and grain quality the optimal nitrogen application rate ranged from 80 to140 kg ha and the water consumption rate ranged from 5000 to 8000 m3 ha larger amounts of water and fertilizer inputs could be counter productive keywords quality function water and fertilizer coupling system optimization fuzzy goal programming scenario analysis rice grain 1 introduction rice is one of the three major food crops and over half of the population across the world uses rice as their main food ouyang et al 2005 china is one of the largest producers of rice from the perspectives of annual yields and planting areas rice is the staple food for more than 65 of the chinese people ma and yuan 2015 peng et al 2009 precise irrigation and fertilization can promote the growth of rice which is beneficial for both rice yields and grain quality with the improvements of living standards the quality of rice grain has become a major concern due to the increasing demands of consumers lisle et al 2000 grain quality depends on gene and external environment han et al 2004 factors such as cultivation measures weather conditions nutrient supply and trace elements have impacts on the quality of rice grain and the application rate of nitrogen fertilizer is one of the main factors peng et al 2009 thus optimizing the integrated use of water and fertilizer is necessary to promote crop productivity and grain quality a large number of experimental studies on deficit irrigation of rice have been reported wang et al 2017 ghosh et al 2004 previous results showed that controlled irrigation is in favor of water saving and yield improvement the development of controlled irrigation technologies is an effective way to improve water use efficiency and promote sustainable agricultural development peng et al 2010 in addition to irrigation nitrogen fertilizer is also an important factor to promote the growth and development of rice china is one of the largest producers and users of nitrogen fertilizer the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied to rice is 180 kg ha in china nearly doubles that of any other country jing et al 2007a the excessive fertilizer will not only waste resources damage soil fertility pollute the environment but also decrease the rice quality hanifzadeh et al 2017 many researches lay emphases on the coupling effects of water and fertilizer on rice das et al 2009 li et al 2013 woli et al 2010 these results show that the roles of nitrogen and water are not independent of each other hence studying the joint effects of water and fertilizer on rice growth is of great significance with the advancement of society people are concerned about the quality of crops in addition to the yields of crops leading to the necessity to pay more attention on the quality of rice grain however few researches have been reported to focus on the combined effects of water and fertilizer on the quality of rice grain therefore it is meaningful to research the relations among water consumption nitrogen fertilizer application and the quality of rice grain perez and juliano 2010 many studies have shown that improvements in rice quality may be accompanied by a decrease in rice yields liu et al 2013 it is necessary to handle the inverse relationships between rice yield and rice quality or in other words to improve the quality of the grain while ensuring the yields for this purpose some studies have focused on finding optimal irrigation and fertilization strategies for rice production through setting different experimental treatments zhang et al 2008 kinoshita et al 2017 perez et al 1996 however screening of optimal irrigation strategies from experiments was based on limited treatments which made the results heavily dependent on the experimental conditions and merely relatively optimal therefore an in depth study of the quantitative response relationships among water fertilizer rice yield and rice quality can help reveal a greater picture and thus achieve more integrated management many studies have quantitatively analyzed the correlations between rice yield water consumption irrigation water and fertilizer during the whole growth period these studies simulated the quantitative relationship between rice yield and stagewise water consumption through water and fertilizer production function wang et al 2017 in terms of rice quality some studies have analyzed the correlation among quality water and fertilizer but researches focusing on water nitrogen quality functions have not been reported establishing reasonable water nitrogen yield and water nitrogen quality functions through systematic and experimental research is an important theoretical basis and scientific premise for implementing optimized irrigation management measures that balance between yields and quality optimization is an effective technique to look for a combination of decision variables that allows the highest productivity under different scenarios initially many studies focused on the maximization of yields based on water production function subjecting to limited water resources only gu et al 2016 then optimal irrigation schedule can be calculated kisekka et al 2017 subsequently many researches focused on optimizing the use of both water and fertilizer based on the water nitrogen yield function cao et al 2010 however few studies considered the quality of rice when optimizing the use of water and fertilizer therefore it is significant to pursue a comprehensive management of water and fertilizer through optimization techniques based on water nitrogen quality function in addition optimization of water and fertilizer involves multiple conflicting objectives with various constraints and it can be described by multi objective programming models ghahraman and sepaskhah 2002 conventional researches usually considered the maximization of crop yields or the minimization of economic losses as objective functions to obtain optimal irrigation schedule through linear programming dynamic programming nonlinear programming and other optimization methods ren et al 2019 however consumer demand for production is close to saturation while demand for grain quality is improving progressively therefore both yield and grain quality should be considered as objectives to construct decision making model mo et al 2017 the aim of this study is to optimize water allocation and nitrogen application to maximize the yield and quality of rice under different scenarios the management goal is to improve the quality of rice through precise deficit irrigation and fertilizer application in spite of its incompatible relationships with rice yield this study entails the following elements 1 rice production experiments coupling water and fertilizer was conducted in northeast china 2 based on the experiment results modeling equations were established to simulate the responses of the yield and quality of rice grain to water consumptions and nitrogen applications during the whole growth period 3 comprehensive quality model of rice grain was established using the principal component analysis method and 4 the applications of water and fertilizer were optimized under different scenarios through multi objective quadratic programming model and the fuzzy goal programming method outputs of this study is anticipated to improve our knowledge of the combined effects of water and nitrogen on the yield and quality of rice and will have potential applications in precise irrigation management for high quality rice production 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the problem in the crop water and fertilizer coupling system the subsystems such as natural resources society economy and ecology are interrelated for example more irrigation water and higher fertilizer application generally result in higher yield and improved food security but it also leads to larger natural resource consumption and more ecological damage it should be realized that with more and more consumers attention paid to grain quality it is the quality rather than yield brings higher economic benefit accordingly in order to achieve optimal water and fertilizer allocations this study intends to find appropriate rates for water consumption and fertilizer application to satisfy yield and grain quality requirements under different scenarios the framework of the study is shown in fig 1 2 2 field experimentation 2 2 1 experimental site the experiments were conducted in the heilongjiang rice irrigation test center which is located in qing an county heilongjiang province of northeastern china latitude 45 63 n longitude 125 44 e the experiments lasted from may to september in 2014 this site has a cold temperate continental monsoon climate with annual precipitation of 577 mm evaporation of 770 mm mean temperature of 1 69 c mean sunshine duration of 2600 h and frost free period of 128 d 2 2 2 experimental design the experiments tested four modes of irrigation including controlled irrigation c1 intermittent irrigation c2 shallow wet irrigation c3 and flood irrigation c4 besides the experiments used four levels of nitrogen application including 135 kg ha n1 105 kg ha n2 75 kg ha n3 and non nitrogen fertilizer n4 i e ck each treatment was repeated three times there are thus a total of 48 plots with each being 100 m2 the tested rice variety was longqing rice no 3 which was transplanted on may 21th and the yield was measured on september 18th table 1 shows different irrigation modes the tillering period was divided into three stages the early stage is from the beginning of tillering to the emergence of leaf sheath of new tillers with 50 of plants the end stage is from 80 of the plants showed new tillering to 10 of the plants started jointing the rest is the middle stage 2 2 3 observations and measurements observation data included irrigation amount soil moisture height of water layer water discharge and yield besides ten grain quality indicators were used for each treatment five samples were collected to measure the quality indicators of rice the grain quality indicators included paddy rice weight brown rice weight milled rice weight brown rice rate amylose protein moisture content chalky kernel rate average length and length width ratio 2 3 model development 2 3 1 empirical model before data analysis the data were normalized and standardized data standardization is the indexation of statistical data the standardization of data mainly included two aspects chemotactic and dimensionless treatment chemotactic data treatment mainly addressed the diversity of data and the aim of dimensionless data processing was mainly to enhance comparability water nitrogen yield function and water nitrogen quality function during the whole growth period of rice were expressed in the quadratic form which can be obtained by regression the fitting formulation is expressed as y a k b k x 1 c k x 2 d k x 1 2 e k x 1 x 2 f k x 2 2 2 3 2 principal components analysis as an individual quality indicator can only reflect a single trait of rice rice grain quality is an integrated concept a comprehensive evaluation for rice grain quality is needed various methods of comprehensive evaluation have been used to get a precise result of rice grain quality the main methods encompass comprehensive index method techniques for order preference by similarity to ideal solution principal component analysis pca and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation among the above methods pca is a statistical approach to reconstitute several independent comprehensive indicators to replace original indicators the linear combination of the original variables is obtained through the rotation of spatial coordinates so as to simplify the multidimensional problem zhang and ma 2008 zhang 2009 based on this advantage the pca was adopted to evaluate the quality of rice grain specifically rice grain quality data were analyzed by pca using spss to build rice grain comprehensive quality rcq model based on the following procedure liu et al 2008 transform p variables x 1 x 2 x p of n samples to k k p comprehensive variables f 1 f 2 f k which is a linear combination of original variables among which comprehensive variables f 1 f 2 f k are called the first second and kth principal components and they can be expressed as follows 1 f 1 a 11 x 1 a 21 x 2 a p 1 x p f 2 a 12 x 1 a 22 x 2 a p 2 x p f k a 1 k x 1 a 2 k x 2 a p k x p take f 1 f 2 f k as independent variables then their corresponding variance contribution rates can be obtained and they are regarded as coefficients of independent variables to build the rcq model 2 3 3 multi objective water fertilizer optimization model based on fuzzy goal programming goal programming model is one of the methods to deal with multi objective programming problems moqp many researchers used it for fuzzy mathematical programming problem most of the previous studies focused on linear programming problem leung 2007 while few addressed fuzzy quadratic programming problem in the recent years fuzzy goal programming fgp approach has been introduced to solve moqp problems with several objectives such as yield and quality objectives the function describing the relationship among water consumption nitrogen application and grain quality was in quadratic form 2 3 3 1 model description classic multi objective quadratic programming problem can be described as lachhwani 2012 2 m a x m i z e z 1 x z 2 x z i x 3 where z i x c i x x t d i x i 1 2 k 4 subject to x s x r n a x b x 0 b r m x t d i x i 1 2 k is a strictly concave quadratic function on convex set of all its feasible solutions such that a relative maximum of z i x i 1 2 k over s and one of relative maximum of z i x is a global maximum lia 2009 in fuzzy programming the fuzzy goals are characterized by their associated membership functions membership for the ith fuzzy goal can be described as baky 2009 5 μ d i x 0 if d i x p p d i x p if 0 d i x p 1 if d i x 0 where the distance function d i with the unit weight can be calculated by 6 d i x z i z i x i 1 2 k this distance depends on x at x x ideal point in x space d i 0 and x x nadir point in x space z i x z i then the maximum value d i of d i x can be expressed as 7 d i z i z i and 8 p sup d i in mathematics sup is used to represent the upper bound i e the smallest upper bound when using the fgp the membership function of the highest degree is 1 so the flexible membership can be described as 9 p d i x p d i d i 1 and 10 z i z i x p d i p d i 0 i 1 2 k where d i 0 d i 0 describe the under and over deviational variables respectively and d i d i 0 based on fgp the multi objective quadratic

where λ represents the fuzzy achievement function consisting of the weighted under deviational variables the numerical weights w i 0 i 1 2 k represent the relative importance of achieving the aspired

amount constraint 16 aims to control water consumption amount constraint 17 aims to ensure rice grain comprehensive quality constraint 18 aims to ensure rice yield 2 3 3 3 scenarios analysis the quality of rice grain in this paper was divided into several categories such as rice grain filling quality appearance quality nutrition quality and comprehensive quality scenarios 1 3 gave priority to two kinds of rice grain quality to find the optimal combinations of water and nitrogen and maximize these two kinds of rice grain quality scenarios 4 7 considered not only rice grain quality but also rice yield in which priority was given to one kind of grain quality to find optimal solutions scenario 8 took into account all quality indicators of the rice grain as well as the rice yield the scenarios are designed as follows 1 s1 maximize the rice grain filling and appearance quality 19 maximize z 1 x 1 x 2 z 2 x 1 x 2 2 s2 maximize the rice grain filling and nutrition quality 20 maximize z 1 x 1 x 2 z 2 x 1 x 2 z 3 x 1 x 2 3 s3 maximize the rice grain appearance and nutrition quality 21 maximize z 2 x 1 x 2 z 3 x 1 x 2 z 4 x 1 x 2 4 s4 maximize the grain comprehensive quality and yield of rice 22 maximize z 5 x 1 x 2 z 6 x 1 x 2 5 s5 maximize the grain filling and comprehensive quality and yield of rice 23 maximize z 1 x 1 x 2 z 5 x 1 x 2 z 6 x 1 x 2 6 s6 maximize the grain appearance and comprehensive quality and yield of rice 24 maximize z 2 x 1 x 2 z 5 x 1 x 2 z 6 x 1 x 2 7 s7 maxmize the grain nutrition and comprehensive quality and yield of rice 25 maximize z 3 x 1

data of rice water consumption nitrogen application rate and grain quality were standardized by max min method liao et al 2012 the results are showed in table 2 as can be seen from table 2 different rice grain quality traits have great differences among them paddy rice weight brown rice weight and milled rice weight have large coefficient of variation which are 0 96 0 93 and 0 96 respectively the results showed that there were significant differences among these three quality indexes in different treatments in comparison the variation coefficients of the other three indexes brown rice rate average length and chalky kernel rate are relatively small which are 0 36 0 42 and 0 49 respectively it indicates that these three indexes are relatively stable regression analysis was performed to describe relationship among water consumption nitrogen application and grain quality fitting results are displayed in table 3 and fig 3 fig 3 shows the relationship among nitrogen application water consumption and rice grain quality or yield fig 3 a k are paddy rice weight brown rice weight milled rice weight brown rice rate amylose protein moisture content chalky kernel rate average length and yield graphic trend indicates that rice traits increase or decrease with nitrogen application rate and water consumption the first kind of graphics is convex surface and the maximum values appear in the middle such as fig 3 a c and i the second kind of graphics is convex surface and the maximum values appear at borders such as fig 3 d g the third kind of graphic is concave surface and the minimum value appears in the middle such as fig 3 h the forth kind of graphics are not obvious convex or concave surface so that they cannot be simply described such as fig 3 e j and k due to partial regression coefficients in the equation have been standardized the absolute value of the partial regression coefficient in the equation can be used to judge the significant degree of each factor on the yield the positive and negative values of the coefficient can indicate the synergistic or antagonistic effect of each factor on the yield coefficients of x 1 and x 2 are positive values indicating synergistic effect is generated by nitrogen application rate and water consumption on rice traits and on the contrary are antagonism from table 3 it can be seen that antagonism effect is generated by nitrogen application rate on moisture content chalky kernel rate average length and length width ratio while other indicators contribute to the synergistic effect similarly antagonism effect is generated by water consumption on chalky kernel rate while other indicators are for the synergistic effect higher values of negative coefficients of x 1 2 and x 2 2 imply that too much nitrogen application rate and water consumption can inhibit development of rice grain quality and yield and most rice traits follow this rule which can be verified from table 3 absolute values of coefficients of x 1 x 2 can show the coupling effects of nitrogen application rate and water consumption on rice traits to test the results of the fitting model correlation coefficient r determination coefficient r 2 and significance f p are considered when p 0 05 the model can be considered as significant at the level of α 0 05 or the confidence reaches 95 when p 0 01 the model can be considered as significant at the level of α 0 01 or the confidence reaches 99 when p 0 001 it is considered that the model is significant at the level of α 0 001 or the confidence level reaches 99 9 thus most of fitting results are good except milled rice weight and amylose whose values of r and r 2 are small and moisture content whose value of p is high p 0 05 3 2 comprehensive quality model for rice grain statistic package for social science software was used to analyze the principal component of the ten quality traits of rice grain tables 4 and 5 describe the eigenvectors contribution rate and accumulation contribution rate of the principal components the result shows that the accumulation contribution rate of four principal components is 87 26 85 which can save and explain all information jolliffe 2011 the first principal component is grain filling index with the contribution rate is 35 51 indexes with higher load indexes including paddy rice weight brown rice weight and milled rice weight are all positive the second principal component is grain appearance index with the contribution rate is 23 77 and indexes with higher load including brown rice rate average length and length width ratio are all positive the third principal component is grain nutrition index 1 with the contribution rate being 17 99 including protein moisture content and chalky kernel rate protein is negative load with the coefficient being 0 58 moisture content and chalky kernel rate are positive loads whose coefficients are 0 72 and 0 83 respectively the fourth principal component is grain nutrition index 2 with the contribution rate being 10 the only amylose has high load and a coefficient of 0 72 according to the results in table 5 y i is principal components and dependent variable i

similarly in constraints 50 and 51 standardized data 0 7 was used to ensure that the values of rice comprehensive quality and yield were not too small for guaranteeing of food security and economic

7 and 8 show the under variables decision variables and rice grain quality figs 4 and 5 describe the comparison results of rice grain quality and yield under different scenarios results in table 8 and figs 4 and 5 are relative values table 7 shows that the optimal water consumption interval is 5642 7252 m3 ha and the optimal nitrogen application rate is 81 00 130 95 kg ha s4 and s7 need higher nitrogen application rate of 130 95 and 139 05 kg ha s3 and s6 need lower nitrogen application rate of 85 00 and 81 00 kg ha s7 needs higher water consumption rate of 7252 m3 ha fig 4 a demonstrates nitrogen application rates under the eight scenarios the maximum value happened in s7 with the value being 1 03 the minimum value happened in s3 and s6 which took 0 62 the maximum value was 60 larger than the minimum value such results indicate that the improvements over grain nutrition comprehensive quality and rice yield would require higher nitrogen fertilizer application but the appearance quality of rice would not require too much nitrogen fertilizer for improvements fig 4 b demonstrates water consumption under the eight scenarios the maximum value took place in s7 with the value being 0 89 the minimum value happened in s1 with a value of 0 39 the maximum value was 128 larger than the minimum value the result shows that the improvements of grain nutrition comprehensive quality and yield of rice would require higher water consumption but the grain filling quality would not require much water to be improved fig 4 c demonstrates grain filling quality under the eight scenarios the maximum value happened in s1 with the value being 1 78 the minimum value took place in s7 with the value being 0 62 the maximum value was 187 larger than the minimum value according to fig 4 c it could be concluded that s1 s2 s5 and s8 could provide higher levels of grain filling quality fig 4 d demonstrates grain appearance quality under the eight scenarios the maximum value happened in s1 with the value being 1 70 the minimum value happened in s5 and the value was 1 13 the maximum value was 50 larger than the minimum value according to fig 4 d it could be concluded that s1 and s7 could provide higher levels of grain appearance quality fig 4 e and f demonstrates grain nutrition quality affected by protein moisture content chalking kernel rate and amylose under the eight scenarios the maximum value happened in s6 and the minimum value appeared in s1 according to fig 4 e and f it could be concluded that s2 s3 and s7 could provide higher levels of grain nutrition quality fig 4 g demonstrates grain comprehensive quality under the eight scenarios the maximum value happened in s3 and the value was 1 42 the minimum value happened in s7 and the value was 0 83 the maximum value was 71 larger than the minimum value according to fig 4 g it could be seen that s3 s5 and s6 could provide higher levels of grain appearance quality fig 5 demonstrates the rice yield under the eight scenarios the maximum value appeared in s4 whereas the minimum value appeared in s3 such results may be because of the high demands for rice yield under s4 according to fig 5 we can draw the conclusion that s4 can provide higher level of grain appearance quality 4 discussion this paper attempted to gain insights into the water nitrogen yield and water nitrogen quality relationships and thus to optimize water allocation and fertilizer application for supporting decision making under different scenarios the first part of this research was to establish functions of water nitrogen yield and water nitrogen quality based on quadratic models fitting results indicate that quadratic functions could well describe the relationships of water nitrogen yield and water nitrogen quality under most conditions although milled rice weight and amylose functions implied lower correlation and significance paddy rice weight brown rice weight and milled rice weight would increase firstly and then decrease with the increase of nitrogen application rate and water consumption this is because that these three quality traits all belong to yield composition and the photosynthesis of crops depends on the situation of water and fertilizer in soil water and fertilizer enhance or restrict the functions of each other and eventually affect the yields of crops wang et al 2018 due to a lack of water stoma of leaves are closed photosynthesis is blocked and photosynthesis level of leaves is weakened in severe drought this extremely unfavorable to the absorption and utilization of nutritional substances in rice root system and also affects the yield of rice when the soil water is insufficient a reasonable coupling model of water and fertilizer could be adopted to utilize nitrogen and water for an obvious synergistic effect within a certain range as well as an acceptable yield pan et al 2017 brown rice rate amylose chalky kernel rate and yield increase with nitrogen application rate indicating that higher nitrogen application rate plays a role in increasing these traits this is because the quality of rice is significantly affected by the coupling of water and fertilizer and the high yield and quality of rice can be guaranteed by better water fertilizer coupling modes chowdary et al 2004 management of water and fertilizer affects starch content and composition especially water and nitrogenous fertilizer the effects of water and nitrogenous fertilizer on starch are different due to the different structures of starch the irrigation effect of amylose and total starch content is greater than that of nitrogen application in contrast the effect of nitrogen application of amylose was greater than that of water application under the condition of guaranteed water supply increasing nitrogen fertilizer application would increase the bleeding intensity of rice and the content of amino acid in the injury liquid would also increase most traits of rice increase first and then decrease with water consumption thus it could be concluded that more water was not necessarily good for crop growth and quality improvement however amylose chalky kernel rate and length width ratio decrease with water consumption indicating that higher water consumption plays a role in decreasing these traits the absorption of water and nutrients by crops is an independent physiological process but the impacts of water and nutrients on crops are closely related and complex the availability of water affects the physicochemical properties and microbial activity of soil and the availability of nutrients in soil as well as the absorption and utilization of nutrients in plants too little water could not fully exert the fertilizer effect while too much water may cause fertilizer loss and crop yield reduction irrational fertilization can also lead to reductions of water use efficiency and crop yields the second part of this paper was the establishment of rice grain comprehensive quality model using the principal component analysis method grain filling quality grain appearance quality grain nutrition quality 1 and grain nutrition quality 2 were the 1st 4th principal component respectively using principal component analysis then the grain comprehensive quality was obtained many researchers have done similar work in other fields and the feasibility of this method was verified zhang and ma 2008 frati et al 2013 maji 2012 in this study principal component analysis was used to create a comprehensive model of rice grain quality in heilongjiang province and the comprehensive level of rice quality was expressed in a quantitative form so as to reduce the difference brought by single index on rice yield and quality meanwhile the quantitative expression method provided possible lines for the completion of the multi objective water fertilizer optimization model for rice based on fuzzy objective programming the third part of this paper was to optimize water and fertilizer allocation under eight scenarios using multi objective quadratic programming based on the results of the previous two parts the model was solved by fuzzy goal programming method if high grain filling quality and grain appearance quality were required nitrogen application rate and water consumption should be around 100 kg ha and 5500 m3 ha under s1 if high grain nutrition quality 1 is required nitrogen application rate and water consumption should be around 130 kg ha and 7000 m3 ha under s7 if high grain nutrition quality 2 and grain comprehensive quality is required nitrogen application rate and water consumption should be around 80 kg ha and 6000 m3 ha under s3 and s6 if high rice yield is required nitrogen application rate and water consumption should be around 130 kg ha and 6000 m3 ha such as s4 the optimized range of nitrogen application rate was 80 140 kg ha while that for water consumption was 5000 8000 m3 ha this indicates that irrigation and fertilizer application would be beneficial to crop growth and quality improvement within limits while large amounts of water and fertilizer could even be counter productive different combinations of water and fertilizer made differences in rice yield and rice grain quality with different market supplies and demands consumer preferences and water supply and demand producers can achieve individualized and diversified integrated management plans of water and fertilizer by means of goal based optimization and irrigation decision making the results of this study were basically the same as previous studies which could validate the optimization results of this paper for example believed that as long as soil water was controlled within a certain critical range the contents of protein amylose and brown rice under controlled irrigation were all lower than flood irrigation and the weight of polished rice and comprehensive palatability score were higher than basin irrigation indicating that proper water control could improve the quality of rice believed that moderate drought during the filling stage could improve the rate of whole rice and reduce chalkiness most studies lin et al 2006 believed that the amount of nitrogen fertilizer and the retrogradation of nitrogen fertilizer improved the milling quality of rice but it would make the appearance quality worse it improved the nutritional quality of rice and reduced the eating quality increased the brown rice weight white rice weight and white rice rate but also increased the chalky grain rate of rice 5 conclusions this paper established functions revealing water nitrogen yield and water nitrogen quality relationships of rice in the form of quadratic models paddy rice weight brown rice weight and milled rice weight increased first and then decreased with the nitrogen application rate and water consumption brown rice rate amylose chalky kernel rate and yield increased with the nitrogen application rate principal component eigenvector was used as coefficient of independent variables to establish linear relation equations for each principal component such as rice grain filling appearance and nutrition quality rice grain comprehensive quality model was established using the principal component analysis method the nitrogen application rate was higher under s4 and s7 being 130 95 and 139 05 kg ha respectively the nitrogen application rate was lower under s3 and s6 which was 85 00 and 81 00 kg ha respectively the highest water consumption at 7252 m3 ha took place under scenario 7 the yield was maximized under s4 and minimized under s3 table 9 acknowledgments this research was supported by the national key r d plan of china grant number 2016yfc0400107 and national natural science foundation of china

10979,the direct root zone irrigation system is a new technique to deliver water directly to the root zone of grapevines at specific irrigation rates and delivery depths the response of vitis vinifera l cv cabernet sauvignon to direct root zone deficit irrigation was investigated in a commercial vineyard with loamy sand soil in the semi arid lower columbia basin of southcentral washington state usa three irrigation rates and three delivery depths were compared for effects on grape yield and crop water use efficiency during three consecutive growing seasons furthermore we investigated the influence of irrigation rate on grape quality and used an in situ root imaging system for root phenotyping under different delivery depths for two years results showed that delivery depth had no significant effect on grape yield and crop water use efficiency however increases in delivery depth from 30 cm to 90 cm resulted in 60 70 decreased root number and 46 59 decreased root length in the upper soil profile 0 60 cm moderate irrigation rates 35 less water use on average improved crop water use efficiency by 14 23 and only reducing grape yield 15 18 per individual grapevine without sacrificing grape quality or inducing early defoliation for the first two years surprisingly no significant reduction of grape yield was found in the third year which can be attributed to cooler and wetter weather and potentially vine acclimation to the direct root zone irrigation strategy we conclude that direct root zone deficit irrigation could be a convenient and efficient subsurface irrigation method to improve crop water use efficiency without reducing grape quality under seasonal drought future studies should compare the economic and environmental returns of direct root zone deficit irrigation with other traditional irrigation strategies under different environmental conditions to optimize the direct root zone deficit irrigation method keywords subsurface irrigation water delivery depth root phenotyping grape yield fruit quality water use efficiency 1 introduction washington state has witnessed a rapid expansion of the grape and wine industry in recent decades becoming the second largest premium wine producer in the united states behind california in 2016 washington state had more than 900 wineries and nearly 70 wine grape varieties produced with cabernet sauvignon being the top produced grape variety accounting for 26 of total production washington state wine commission usa 2017 grape production in southcentral washington relies on supplemental irrigation because of its arid steppe climate with around 200 mm of annual rainfall resulting in natural water deficits for crop production elsner et al 2010 however water for vineyard irrigation now faces potential limits related to unstable climate patterns and multiple competing demands from food production and municipal development costa et al 2007 du et al 2015 iglesias and garrote 2015 leib et al 2006 schultz and stoll 2010 applying efficient irrigation strategies is vital to improve water use efficiency for wine grape production in southcentral washington and in many dry winegrowing regions worldwide such as southern mediterranean europe costa et al 2016 fraga et al 2018 malek et al 2018 deficit irrigation which imparts adequate water stress on grapevines has proven an effective and sustainable management tool in vineyards to achieve balance between vegetative and reproductive growth preserve yield and water and improve fruit composition and water use efficiency both for wine and juice grapes acevedo opazo et al 2010 ayars et al 2017 chaves et al 2007 costa et al 2007 fereres and soriano 2007 intrigliolo et al 2012 medrano et al 2015 van leeuwen et al 2009 shellie 2014 shellie and bowen 2014 stout et al 2017 when properly implemented deficit irrigation can benefit water conservation efforts in water limited regions fereres et al 2003 applying deficit irrigation through subsurface drip irrigation sdi has gained wider acceptance for woody perennial crops in recent years due to its advantages in water saving and fruit production fereres and soriano 2007 zhang et al 2017 along with improved irrigation equipment and scheduling tools ayars et al 2015 recent studies showed that sdi results in greater water use efficiency without altering grape composition pisciotta et al 2018 and provides the potential to change the structure and composition of groundcover vegetation which alters root associated fungal communities and lowers the negative effects from soil borne pathogens vukicevich et al 2018 however there are some disadvantages associated with current sdi systems which need to be addressed for example excessively localized sdi causes smaller wetting patterns and enhances water infiltration which may reduce crop root zones lamm et al 2007 woody perennial crops with smaller rooting structures may hamper avoidance of diurnal water stresses even if the root zones are well watered moreover buried drip lines are hard to monitor and repair and are susceptible to clogging with soil and debris as well as chewing damage by burrowing rodents payero et al 2005 sdi also has high initial investment for installation and maintenance costs optimizing irrigation rate and delivery depth is crucial for sdi to enhance plant growth yield and quality of produce and minimize impacts from detrimental crop soil and climatic factors ayars et al 2015 cancela et al 2016 lamm and trooien 2003 precision use of irrigation water can help regulate water stress in grapevines and achieve high quality grapes for premium wine production deloire et al 2004 pellegrino et al 2005 delivering water to the ideal depth is beneficial to ensure an accessible water source for grapevine growth decrease water loss through evaporation and restrict weed growth for reducing herbicide use coolong 2013 thompson et al 2009 shrestha et al 2007 which are crucial for sustainable and organic viticulture however studies on the effects of deeper delivery depth on grape production are limited because of difficulties in installation accessibility and maintenance by using buried drip lines lamm et al 2007 understanding root development is essential to support improvement of efficient sdi while managing grapevine growth and grape production roots provide structural support absorb water and mineral nutrients and serve as sensors of water stress which affect aboveground growth and grape composition previous studies showed that grapevines with deep root systems kept favorable water status during harsh summers savi et al 2018 and produce grapes with stable quality tomasi et al 2015 smart et al 2006 reported that approximately 80 of grapevine roots lie within the upper 1 m of the soil profile although vitis vinifera roots are capable of reaching depths of more than 6 m and even deeper rooting may occur in water limited environments root development in grapevines depends on soil type and the water supplied to the soil deloire et al 2004 although sdi may limit crop rooting due to a small volume of wetted soil lamm and trooien 2003 it provides a possibility to encourage deep rooting by adjusting water amount and delivery depth verification of which requires periodic root observations traditional destructive methods such as coring trenching and excavating have been largely used for root observation postma et al 2014 however those methods destroy root structure or interfere with the development of the root system special techniques are required for in situ observation of roots especially for perennial crops and fruit trees pierret et al 2005 to the best of our knowledge studies on non destructive in situ observation of root growth in grapevine under sdi are lacking to address the aforementioned issues we introduced a new type of subsurface irrigation system termed the direct root zone irrigation drz system which delivers water directly into the root zone through vertical pvc tubes drz not only can offer flexible choices for irrigation rates and delivery depths in established commercial vineyards without installing and removing buried drip lines but also provides possibilities for adjusting application based on grape variety climate condition and soil types across the growth stages of grapevines i e from small young seedlings to large older vines additionally a non destructive minirhizotron technique was used for direct and periodic observation of grapevine roots buckland et al 1993 we hypothesized that delivering water directly into the lower root zone sustains grape yield and quality while improving crop water use efficiency and that increased delivery depth influences root distribution without reducing grape yield using the drz system the objectives of this study were to 1 provide proof of concept by testing the efficacy of the drz system to save water and improve crop water use efficiency and 2 improve our understanding on root growth and distribution under subsurface irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description plant material and irrigation system this study was conducted from the 2015 to 2017 growing seasons in a commercial vineyard of eight year old cabernet sauvignon in the red mountain american viticultural area ava near benton city washington 46 16 59 n 119 26 33 w 228 m a s l vines were own rooted and planted with a spacing of 1 8 m between vines and 2 5 m between rows the orientation of vineyard rows is north to south vines were supported by a three wire trellis with vertical distances of 100 cm 140 cm and 180 cm between soil surface and each wire soil on the experimental site is of the aridisol order and classified as a hezel loamy fine sand 0 40 cm

agweathernet statewide system agweathernet at washington state university 2018 located near the vineyard in benton city wa approximate 1 km from the study site the drz system was installed in the vineyard before the 2015 growing season in a design shown in fig 1 two surface drip lines were installed in each row one was used for surface fertigation and another one was used as part of drz system the vertical distances were 60 cm between the drip line and the soil surface and 40 cm between the drip line and bottom wire of trellis a 25 4 mm diameter hole was bored vertically to a depth of 30 60 and 90 cm respectively approximately 40 cm on either side of the base of each vine and beneath the trellis wire and suspended irrigation dripline a length of pvc tube schedule 40 20 mm inner diameter was inserted into each hole for water delivery with a 40 cm length above ground each section of pvc tube was pre cut to length to reach the desired depth and split about 15 cm from the lower end to allow sufficient water passage into the soil a cap for each pvc tube was previously drilled to allow passage of 30 cm length of 6 35 mm diameter feeder line which connects the main horizontal drip line with a pressure compensating drip emitter ceta antelco housed at the upper end of the pvc tube the cap was then secured over the upper end of the tube to prevent airborne dirt or debris from fouling the emitter the flow rate of each compensating emitter was 2 l hour with two delivery tubes per vine providing each vine with 4 l hour of water over the designated treatment amount and time 2 2 experimental design the experimental design was a split plot design in a randomized complete block design with three blocks irrigation rate was applied as the first factor to whole plots forming a complete block then subsurface delivery depth was applied as the second factor to sub plots within the whole plots within each block irrigation rates were designed based on crop evapotranspiration for grapevines etc eto kc the reference crop grass evapotranspiration eto was calculated using penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and the data were collected through an automated weather station operated by the washington agweathernet statewide system mentioned above data of monthly eto are shown in table 1 the average crop coefficient for cabernet sauvignon kc 0 5 from bud break to harvest was developed in our treatment plots based on previous studies conducted in southcentral washington evans et al 1993 keller et al 2016 three levels of irrigation rates in our study were designated as high rate 0 6 etc moderate 0 45 etc and low 0 3 etc irrigation amounts in each year are shown in table 2 three subsurface delivery depths were 30 cm 60 cm and 90 cm below the soil surface each treatment plot involved 15 vines with 5 vines in each of contiguous rows 5 vines 3 rows measurements were taken on the three central vines from central rows in each of the treatment plots with twelve buffer vines alongside to avoid the interference from neighboring treatments 2 3 irrigation scheduling irrigation was applied from bud break to postharvest in each year all fertilizers were applied through the surface fertigation between bud break and fruit set in each year to avoid an interaction effect between subsurface delivery depth and fertilization on grape production and root distribution deficit irrigation began at fruit set and was applied through the drz system the irrigation scheduling was determined by the vineyard manager according to soil moisture content and long standing guidelines used to meet commercial production goals the irrigation interval was between 3 6 days depending on weather conditions in general vines were irrigated when soil water content reached below 4 1 mm at 20 cm 11 1 mm at 40 cm and 12 1 mm at 60 cm of soil depth monitored by enviroscan probes sentek technologies australia installed in commercial plots near our treatment plots

midday stem water potential measurements water status of single vines was determined by midday stem water potential ψstem md measurements mccutchan and shackel 1992 using the pressure bomb method scholander et al 1965 three central vines in the middle rows of each treatment plot were selected for measurement one leaf on the east side of each vine was covered with a plastic bag inside an aluminum foil exterior envelope and allowed to equilibrate for an hour prior to sampling to prevent overheating by the sun and to equilibrate with the stem water potential by avoiding further natural transpiration from the leaf which alters the resultant pressure reading choné et al 2001 the encased leaf was detached from the vine by severing the petiole with a razor blade then quickly removed from the bag and inserted into a pressure chamber 3000 series soilmoisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa leaf samples were pressurized with nitrogen gas to the point of sap movement from the cut petiole pressures were measured in bars then converted to mega pascals measurements were taken at three key stages of grapevine development fruit set veraison and harvest during the growing seasons in 2016 and 2017 a total of 9 leaf samples one leaf sample from each of 9 different vines were measured per treatment per sampling date 2 6 root phenotyping to compare effects of water delivery depth on root number and length in shallow soil 0 60 cm three vines from each treatment of delivery depth at the high irrigation rate were selected for in situ root imaging the schematic of the in situ root imaging system is shown in fig 2 transparent acrylic tubes which were 80 cm long with inner diameter of 6 35 cm were installed at an angle of 15 to the vertical and 30 cm from the vine trunk which allows observation of roots within a 60 cm depth the exposed top 8 10 cm of the root tubes was covered with silver tape and sealed with rubber caps to avoid disturbance from light on root growth root

computer and ci 600 software https cid inc com support ci 600 software calibration by inserting the root imager in a white calibration tube and pressing the calibration button in the ci 600 software was performed each time the root imager was connected to the tablet computer before root imaging to ensure image quality and color accuracy as per the manufacturer s instructions after calibration the root imager was inserted into each root tube with collapsible measuring rods connected to adjust its position each scan of roots at a certain depth provided a nearly 360 degree image which was manually saved under identified folders in a tablet computer for further phenotypic analysis the size of each root image was 19 6 cm wide and 21 5 cm long with approximately 0 8 cm overlap of adjacent images to ensure the entire root area of interest was scanned root images were taken at three phenological stages fruit set veraison and harvest in 2016 and 2017 root images were imported and analyzed

categorized through software based on date root tube number and window images were categorized by depth from the surface within the same root tube each root image was imported into a window and three continuous windows were created per root tube window alignment was done by using the window alignment tool to remove the overlapped area before mapping the roots total root number and length were automatically calculated by manually adding or editing points to create lines based on root images and all data were exported into an excel spreadsheet for statistical analyses 2 7 grape yield and quality dates for grape harvest were chosen by technical staff of the commercial vineyard during this study harvest took place between 56 and 61 days after veraison depending on the year at harvest each vine was harvested by hand and weighed on site within each treatment block 2 3 clusters of grapes from each of three central vines in the same treatment plot were pooled packaged on ice and delivered immediately to a nearby commercial laboratory ets laboratories walla walla wa usa for quality analyses titratable acidity and tss brix were determined on a fourier transformed mid infrared analyzer using an iso 17025 accredited technique tannin and anthocyanins were extracted using a proprietary wine like extract briefly grapes were lightly macerated no broken seeds 15 ethanol was added and the mixture heated to extract wine like levels of tannin analysis of grape extracts was performed using an agilent 1290 hplc with the method described by waterhouse et al 1999 tannin is reported as catechin equivalents and anthocyanins as malvin equivalents 2 8 crop water use efficiency grape yield and total water use amount during the active growth period in each year were considered to

respectively between the stages of flowering and veraison average temperature was approximately 2 0 c higher in 2015 than in 2016 and 2017 and both the average maximum and minimum temperatures around stages of flowering and fruit set were significantly higher 3 0 c 4 0 c in 2015 than in other two years the highest annual eto was in 2015 and the lowest annual eto was in 2017 1255 3 mm and 1064 5 mm respectively table 1 3 2 phenology to map the development of vines over the course of the study all data are reported as the average of all treatments with an assumption that the irrigation system had no effect on vine phenology table 2 bud break was 12 days earlier in 2015 and 13 days earlier in 2016 compared to 2017 which had later bud break likely due to cooler winter and lower spring temperatures however higher temperatures that occurred from july to august in 2017 compared to 2015 and 2016 table 1 likely shortened the differences in doy for veraison 2 days and 8 days earlier in 2015 and 2016 respectively across three year study period numbers of days from the date of bud break to the date of harvest were similar with 173 170 and 168 days in total in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively 3 3 midday stem water potential based on our preliminary data data not shown and the previous study with related measurements at this location espinoza et al 2017 delivery depth showed no significant effect on water status in grapevine changes in ψstem md under different irrigation rates with the same delivery depth 60 cm were reported in fig 3 overall ψstem md decreased with the extension of deficit irrigation with the most negative readings occurring at harvest in 2016 grapevines had significantly higher values of ψstem md under high irrigation rate than under moderate and low irrigation rates across all three phenological stages changes in ψstem md showed rapidly once treatments were applied at fruit set with 12 and 39 declines at moderate and low irrigation rates respectively compared to the high irrigation rate moreover differences in ψstem md became more significant at veraison 13 and 45 declines at moderate and low rates respectively occurring with higher daily temperatures around this stage although significant differences in ψstem md existed between moderate and low irrigation rates at fruit set and veraison no significant difference was found between these two irrigation rates at harvest the stage with increased rainfall and decreased daily temperature fig 3 in 2017 mean values of ψstem md decreased with reduced irrigation rate however no statistical difference of ψstem md was found between different irrigation rates at each of the three key phenological stages measured fig 3 3 4 root phenotyping representative raw and mapped root images were selected to show root distributions of cabernet sauvignon grapevines around each root tube at a 0 60 cm soil depth under three water delivery depths fig 4 decreased root density was observed with the increase in delivery depth from fig 4a to c root image analyses showed that rapid increases in root number and length occurred between the stages of fruit set and veraison and no significant increase in both root number and length was found from veraison to harvest in both years fig 5 increases in delivery depth from 30 cm to 90 cm decreased total root number 60 and total root length 46 at harvest in 2016 likewise total root number decreased 70 and total root length decreased 59 at harvest in 2017 no difference in total root number or length was found between different delivery depths at fruit set in both years except for total root number in 2017 where there was 45 decrease in root number at the 90 cm delivery depth compared to the 30 cm delivery depth no significant difference in total root number and length was found between 30 cm and 60 cm delivery depths in our study fig 5 3 5 grape yield and quality grape yields under different irrigation rates and water delivery depths were compared within each year fig 6 decreases in irrigation rate resulted in decreased grape yield per vine during the first two years of study fig 6a b under the same treatment level e g high irrigation rate 30 cm delivery depth grape yields both in 2016 and 2017 were generally higher than in 2015 compared to the high rate of irrigation within the first two years the moderate rate 34 36 decreased water use and low rate 51 53 decreased water use resulted in 15 18 and 22 27 yield declines respectively however irrigation rate had no significant influence on grape yield in 2017 fig 6c no significant difference in yield was found between different delivery depths and no interaction effect was found between irrigation rate and delivery depth on grape yield within each year since no significant effect of water delivery depth and no interaction effect were found on grape yield we specifically investigated the influence of irrigation rate using the drz system on four grape qualitative parameters in 2016 and 2017 fig 7 the grape quality parameters measured were variable between different years and partially affected by irrigation rate values of tss were significantly affected by irrigation rate in both years and grapes at the low irrigation rate had higher brix values in both years although the difference became statistically insignificant between moderate and low rates in 2017 fig 7c d in 2016 the highest tss value was 28 6 brix at low irrigation rate combined with the highest total anthocyanins at 1480 mg l 1 and the lowest titratable acidity at 4 9 g l 1 fig 7 a c g in addition mean values of total anthocyanins increased and titratable acidity decreased with decreasing irrigation rate although no statistical difference was found in 2017 fig 7a b g h no significant difference in tannin content was observed across the two growing seasons fig 7e f with the exception of tss no significant differences in grape quality parameters were found in 2017 fig 7b d f h 3 6 crop water use efficiency wuec was generally higher at the lowest irrigation rate and decreased with increasing irrigation rate table 3 increases in wuec from high to moderate rates became more significant in 2016 and 2017 23 and 39 increases respectively than in 2015 14 increase the first year for our treatment application likewise increases in wuec from high to low rates were more significant in 2016 and 2017 37 and 62 increases respectively than in 2015 34 increase no difference was found between delivery depths within each growing season across the three years of study table 3 in addition no interaction effect between irrigation rate and delivery depth was found on wuec during this study 4 discussion this study supports the potential application of drz for sustaining grape yield with reduced water supply in a semi arid climate no significant difference in yield was found across all treatments in 2017 which could be attributed to cooler and wetter weather lanari et al 2014 reported that increased rainfall and decreased temperature alleviated soil water scarcity which diminished the influence of deficit irrigation on grape yield grapevines had the lowest yield in 2015 which was probably due to not only the extremely dry growing season but also the variation in air temperature lower temperature around bud break may have decreased the flower size and proportion of flowers that set fruit resulting in decreased yields as reported by keller et al 2010b meanwhile higher daytime temperatures around the flowering stage might also be detrimental to fruit set and ovule fertility resulting in lower yield kliewer 1977 pagay and collins 2018 recovery of grape yield in 2016 could be ascribed to normal weather condition sadras et al 2017 pointed out the resilience of grapevine yield after experiencing yield reduction however the physiological rationales behind it are not well explained and require further investigation midday stem water potential ψstem md has proven to be a robust and practical measurement of water stress and closely related to physiological responses at the leaf e g stomatal conductance and whole plant levels shackel 2011 vines under increasing water deficit resulted in a gradual increase in plant water stress fereres and soriano 2007 which was observed in our study earlier basal leaf abscissions after veraison only occurred under the lowest irrigation rate in 2016 which could be ascribed to either the insufficient water supply for minimum daily water demand in grapevines or uneven water distribution by sdi that triggered chemical signaling from roots in dry zone for defoliation pisciotta et al 2018 significant decreases in ψstem md were found with decreased irrigation rates during the 2016 growing season which were in accordance with changes in grape yield however no significant difference was found at each of three phenological stages examined in 2017 which was likely due to high rainfall before fruit set savi et al 2018 also found that increased ψstem md was accompanied by increases in rainfall which interfered the effect of irrigation treatment grapevine phenology is influenced by weather conditions jones and davis 2000 van leeuwen and darriet 2016 based on a long term study on vitis vinifera l grapevine phenology tomasi et al 2011 found that decreased average temperatures early in the year delayed bud break and increased maximum temperature between fruit set and pre veraison advanced the date of veraison we found similar patterns in our study lower average temperatures from january to may in 2017 prolonged the date of bud break however higher maximum temperatures in july and august helped accelerate the date of veraison to the average for southcentral washington deficit irrigation was not applied until the end of june in 2017 which shortened the period of water stress in grapevine from fruit set to veraison and thus likely diminished the treatment effects on grape production due to the significant influences of early water deficit on vigor control and berry development of red wine grapes keller 2010a munitz et al 2017 in previous studies on grapes and on other crops subsurface water delivery depth varied and did not exceed a soil depth of 45 cm barth 1999 bhattarai et al 2008 camp et al 1999 jordan et al 2014 lanier et al 2004 machado et al 2003 martínez gimeno et al 2018 pisciotta et al 2018 however roots could reach depths below 1 m smart et al 2006 and functional rooting depth for water uptake is highly variable in grapevines with deeper roots for accessing to water deeper in the soil profile from fruit set to harvest karakis et al 2018 thus starting to deliver the water directly into the lower functional root zone at fruit set may maximize crop water use efficiency and promote water conservation this study extended the delivery depth to 90 cm deep soil and found decreases in root number and length within the top 60 cm of soil with increased delivery depth suggesting a deep root system might have developed below 60 cm of soil for water acquisition deep rooting permits plants to access deeper sources of soil water allowing vines to avoid severe water stress during periods of high temperatures and lack of rainfall savi et al 2018 besides recovery of the grape yield in 2016 from the previous year could be also attributed to the development of the root system for water and nutrient acquisitions according to a previous study on concord grape in southcentral washington stout et al 2017 however we did not find a significant effect of delivery depth on grape yield or water status in grapevines within each year of our study which might be explained by two reasons either with frequent irrigation most roots tend to concentrate near the point of water delivery for available irrigated water machado et al 2003 or vertical water drainage in loamy sand soil diminishes the differences in soil water content between subsoils below different water delivery depths where deep roots take groundwater to compensate for water deficit in grapevines van leeuwen et al 2004 future work should examine water and root distributions deeper in the soil profile decreased irrigation rates through drz enhanced or at least sustained grape quality over two years of our study additionally moderate irrigation rate seems more favorable for sugar accumulation in berries with minimum yield loss which is in accordance with previous studies acevedo opazo et al 2010 deloire et al 2004 van leeuwen et al 2009 lower brix values in 2017 could be attributed to higher temperatures after veraison which reduced accumulation of soluble sugars in berries kuhn et al 2014 moreover deficit irrigation has been proven as a useful tool to regulate moderate water stress in grapevine which helps accumulate some secondary metabolites to improve grape and wine quality teixeira et al 2013 many studies have reported higher contents of tannins and anthocyanins in red wine grapes e g vitis vinifera l cv cabernet sauvignon and merlot under moderate water deficit casassa et al 2015 kennedy et al 2002 van leeuwen et al 2009 sivilotti et al 2005 however efficiency of this regulation is largely affected by environmental variation downey et al 2006 teixeira et al 2013 which was also found in our study no significant difference in contents of tannins and total anthocyanins under different irrigation rates in 2017 was probably due to increased total rainfall before fruit set higher temperature and increased diurnal temperature fluctuation in the late growing season which decreased water deficit in grapevines and restricted synthesis of phenolics cohen et al 2008 koundouras et al 2006 titratable acidity which strongly influences juice stability positively correlated with irrigation rate in 2016 however lower acidity with no statistical difference was found in the following year which is also possibly due to decreased water deficit mirás avalos and intrigliolo 2017 nadal and arola 1995 many studies on different crops have shown the improvement of water use efficiency through sdi ayars et al 2015 lamm and trooien 2003 machado and oliveira 2005 mo et al 2017 pisciotta et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 however the relevant research on grapevine is still limited and needs to be expanded in our study improvement of wuec was achieved with around 35 water saving while minimizing yield loss under variation in weather conditions proving the efficacy of the drz system on optimization of water use as a novel type of sdi system no difference in wuec was found between delivery depths which can be attributed to the traits of loamy sand soil and limitations of current drz systems increased delivery depth may not significantly reduce the soil evaporation and the current drz system may not efficiently reduce water drainage or improve the lateral water distribution within the root zone of grapevine in hezel loamy fine sand enhancement of the drz system could be achieved by improving the design to adjust the position and angle of insertion for water delivery tubes to increase the irrigated area and water availability within root zone of grapevines and by amortizing the expense for utilizing the drz system through improved grape quality reduced water fungicide and herbicide use and use of system components with a longer lifespan and lower price additionally the longevity of the system and the economic and environmental returns should be clearly evaluated over a long term study e g 10 years and the efficiency of drz system should be compared with other traditional irrigation systems under different environmental conditions which will better define the optimum scenarios for adoption of the drz strategy 5 conclusions this study proposed a novel subsurface drip irrigation system termed direct root zone irrigation drz which sustained grape production with 35 less water use in vineyards on a loamy sand soil in an arid environment this irrigation system can help enhance water management in vineyards by delivering water directly to the root zone of grapevines with flexible choices for irrigation rate and delivery depth moreover the drz system provides a potential to encourage deep rooting which may help grapevines access water from deeper soil depths to better perform during drought depending on soil type design of the current drz system could be improved to enhance water availability in the root zone of grapevines and to increase overall profitability moreover future studies should compare the efficiency and longevity of drz system with other traditional irrigation systems under different environments to better define the optimum conditions and economic and environmental returns for successful adoption of the drz strategy acknowledgements this research was supported by washington state department of agriculture specialty crop

10979,the direct root zone irrigation system is a new technique to deliver water directly to the root zone of grapevines at specific irrigation rates and delivery depths the response of vitis vinifera l cv cabernet sauvignon to direct root zone deficit irrigation was investigated in a commercial vineyard with loamy sand soil in the semi arid lower columbia basin of southcentral washington state usa three irrigation rates and three delivery depths were compared for effects on grape yield and crop water use efficiency during three consecutive growing seasons furthermore we investigated the influence of irrigation rate on grape quality and used an in situ root imaging system for root phenotyping under different delivery depths for two years results showed that delivery depth had no significant effect on grape yield and crop water use efficiency however increases in delivery depth from 30 cm to 90 cm resulted in 60 70 decreased root number and 46 59 decreased root length in the upper soil profile 0 60 cm moderate irrigation rates 35 less water use on average improved crop water use efficiency by 14 23 and only reducing grape yield 15 18 per individual grapevine without sacrificing grape quality or inducing early defoliation for the first two years surprisingly no significant reduction of grape yield was found in the third year which can be attributed to cooler and wetter weather and potentially vine acclimation to the direct root zone irrigation strategy we conclude that direct root zone deficit irrigation could be a convenient and efficient subsurface irrigation method to improve crop water use efficiency without reducing grape quality under seasonal drought future studies should compare the economic and environmental returns of direct root zone deficit irrigation with other traditional irrigation strategies under different environmental conditions to optimize the direct root zone deficit irrigation method keywords subsurface irrigation water delivery depth root phenotyping grape yield fruit quality water use efficiency 1 introduction washington state has witnessed a rapid expansion of the grape and wine industry in recent decades becoming the second largest premium wine producer in the united states behind california in 2016 washington state had more than 900 wineries and nearly 70 wine grape varieties produced with cabernet sauvignon being the top produced grape variety accounting for 26 of total production washington state wine commission usa 2017 grape production in southcentral washington relies on supplemental irrigation because of its arid steppe climate with around 200 mm of annual rainfall resulting in natural water deficits for crop production elsner et al 2010 however water for vineyard irrigation now faces potential limits related to unstable climate patterns and multiple competing demands from food production and municipal development costa et al 2007 du et al 2015 iglesias and garrote 2015 leib et al 2006 schultz and stoll 2010 applying efficient irrigation strategies is vital to improve water use efficiency for wine grape production in southcentral washington and in many dry winegrowing regions worldwide such as southern mediterranean europe costa et al 2016 fraga et al 2018 malek et al 2018 deficit irrigation which imparts adequate water stress on grapevines has proven an effective and sustainable management tool in vineyards to achieve balance between vegetative and reproductive growth preserve yield and water and improve fruit composition and water use efficiency both for wine and juice grapes acevedo opazo et al 2010 ayars et al 2017 chaves et al 2007 costa et al 2007 fereres and soriano 2007 intrigliolo et al 2012 medrano et al 2015 van leeuwen et al 2009 shellie 2014 shellie and bowen 2014 stout et al 2017 when properly implemented deficit irrigation can benefit water conservation efforts in water limited regions fereres et al 2003 applying deficit irrigation through subsurface drip irrigation sdi has gained wider acceptance for woody perennial crops in recent years due to its advantages in water saving and fruit production fereres and soriano 2007 zhang et al 2017 along with improved irrigation equipment and scheduling tools ayars et al 2015 recent studies showed that sdi results in greater water use efficiency without altering grape composition pisciotta et al 2018 and provides the potential to change the structure and composition of groundcover vegetation which alters root associated fungal communities and lowers the negative effects from soil borne pathogens vukicevich et al 2018 however there are some disadvantages associated with current sdi systems which need to be addressed for example excessively localized sdi causes smaller wetting patterns and enhances water infiltration which may reduce crop root zones lamm et al 2007 woody perennial crops with smaller rooting structures may hamper avoidance of diurnal water stresses even if the root zones are well watered moreover buried drip lines are hard to monitor and repair and are susceptible to clogging with soil and debris as well as chewing damage by burrowing rodents payero et al 2005 sdi also has high initial investment for installation and maintenance costs optimizing irrigation rate and delivery depth is crucial for sdi to enhance plant growth yield and quality of produce and minimize impacts from detrimental crop soil and climatic factors ayars et al 2015 cancela et al 2016 lamm and trooien 2003 precision use of irrigation water can help regulate water stress in grapevines and achieve high quality grapes for premium wine production deloire et al 2004 pellegrino et al 2005 delivering water to the ideal depth is beneficial to ensure an accessible water source for grapevine growth decrease water loss through evaporation and restrict weed growth for reducing herbicide use coolong 2013 thompson et al 2009 shrestha et al 2007 which are crucial for sustainable and organic viticulture however studies on the effects of deeper delivery depth on grape production are limited because of difficulties in installation accessibility and maintenance by using buried drip lines lamm et al 2007 understanding root development is essential to support improvement of efficient sdi while managing grapevine growth and grape production roots provide structural support absorb water and mineral nutrients and serve as sensors of water stress which affect aboveground growth and grape composition previous studies showed that grapevines with deep root systems kept favorable water status during harsh summers savi et al 2018 and produce grapes with stable quality tomasi et al 2015 smart et al 2006 reported that approximately 80 of grapevine roots lie within the upper 1 m of the soil profile although vitis vinifera roots are capable of reaching depths of more than 6 m and even deeper rooting may occur in water limited environments root development in grapevines depends on soil type and the water supplied to the soil deloire et al 2004 although sdi may limit crop rooting due to a small volume of wetted soil lamm and trooien 2003 it provides a possibility to encourage deep rooting by adjusting water amount and delivery depth verification of which requires periodic root observations traditional destructive methods such as coring trenching and excavating have been largely used for root observation postma et al 2014 however those methods destroy root structure or interfere with the development of the root system special techniques are required for in situ observation of roots especially for perennial crops and fruit trees pierret et al 2005 to the best of our knowledge studies on non destructive in situ observation of root growth in grapevine under sdi are lacking to address the aforementioned issues we introduced a new type of subsurface irrigation system termed the direct root zone irrigation drz system which delivers water directly into the root zone through vertical pvc tubes drz not only can offer flexible choices for irrigation rates and delivery depths in established commercial vineyards without installing and removing buried drip lines but also provides possibilities for adjusting application based on grape variety climate condition and soil types across the growth stages of grapevines i e from small young seedlings to large older vines additionally a non destructive minirhizotron technique was used for direct and periodic observation of grapevine roots buckland et al 1993 we hypothesized that delivering water directly into the lower root zone sustains grape yield and quality while improving crop water use efficiency and that increased delivery depth influences root distribution without reducing grape yield using the drz system the objectives of this study were to 1 provide proof of concept by testing the efficacy of the drz system to save water and improve crop water use efficiency and 2 improve our understanding on root growth and distribution under subsurface irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description plant material and irrigation system this study was conducted from the 2015 to 2017 growing seasons in a commercial vineyard of eight year old cabernet sauvignon in the red mountain american viticultural area ava near benton city washington 46 16 59 n 119 26 33 w 228 m a s l vines were own rooted and planted with a spacing of 1 8 m between vines and 2 5 m between rows the orientation of vineyard rows is north to south vines were supported by a three wire trellis with vertical distances of 100 cm 140 cm and 180 cm between soil surface and each wire soil on the experimental site is of the aridisol order and classified as a hezel loamy fine sand 0 40 cm soil depth 80 sand 17 silt and 3 clay 0 56 total carbon 0 056 total nitrogen based on soil chemical analysis weather data were recorded through an automated weather station operated by the washington agweathernet statewide system agweathernet at washington state university 2018 located near the vineyard in benton city wa approximate 1 km from the study site the drz system was installed in the vineyard before the 2015 growing season in a design shown in fig 1 two surface drip lines were installed in each row one was used for surface fertigation and another one was used as part of drz system the vertical distances were 60 cm between the drip line and the soil surface and 40 cm between the drip line and bottom wire of trellis a 25 4 mm diameter hole was bored vertically to a depth of 30 60 and 90 cm respectively approximately 40 cm on either side of the base of each vine and beneath the trellis wire and suspended irrigation dripline a length of pvc tube schedule 40 20 mm inner diameter was inserted into each hole for water delivery with a 40 cm length above ground each section of pvc tube was pre cut to length to reach the desired depth and split about 15 cm from the lower end to allow sufficient water passage into the soil a cap for each pvc tube was previously drilled to allow passage of 30 cm length of 6 35 mm diameter feeder line which connects the main horizontal drip line with a pressure compensating drip emitter ceta antelco housed at the upper end of the pvc tube the cap was then secured over the upper end of the tube to prevent airborne dirt or debris from fouling the emitter the flow rate of each compensating emitter was 2 l hour with two delivery tubes per vine providing each vine with 4 l hour of water over the designated treatment amount and time 2 2 experimental design the experimental design was a split plot design in a randomized complete block design with three blocks irrigation rate was applied as the first factor to whole plots forming a complete block then subsurface delivery depth was applied as the second factor to sub plots within the whole plots within each block irrigation rates were designed based on crop evapotranspiration for grapevines etc eto kc the reference crop grass evapotranspiration eto was calculated using penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and the data were collected through an automated weather station operated by the washington agweathernet statewide system mentioned above data of monthly eto are shown in table 1 the average crop coefficient for cabernet sauvignon kc 0 5 from bud break to harvest was developed in our treatment plots based on previous studies conducted in southcentral washington evans et al 1993 keller et al 2016 three levels of irrigation rates in our study were designated as high rate 0 6 etc moderate 0 45 etc and low 0 3 etc irrigation amounts in each year are shown in table 2 three subsurface delivery depths were 30 cm 60 cm and 90 cm below the soil surface each treatment plot involved 15 vines with 5 vines in each of contiguous rows 5 vines 3 rows measurements were taken on the three central vines from central rows in each of the treatment plots with twelve buffer vines alongside to avoid the interference from neighboring treatments 2 3 irrigation scheduling irrigation was applied from bud break to postharvest in each year all fertilizers were applied through the surface fertigation between bud break and fruit set in each year to avoid an interaction effect between subsurface delivery depth and fertilization on grape production and root distribution deficit irrigation began at fruit set and was applied through the drz system the irrigation scheduling was determined by the vineyard manager according to soil moisture content and long standing guidelines used to meet commercial production goals the irrigation interval was between 3 6 days depending on weather conditions in general vines were irrigated when soil water content reached below 4 1 mm at 20 cm 11 1 mm at 40 cm and 12 1 mm at 60 cm of soil depth monitored by enviroscan probes sentek technologies australia installed in commercial plots near our treatment plots the distance was less than 10 m each irrigation set was delivered for 20 h encompassing the nighttime period water amounts were reduced to desired rates through battery powered controllers 11000 l series galcon kfar blum israel and quantified by small mechanical water meters d l jerman co hackensack nj usa after harvest two more rounds of full irrigation 24 h of irrigation with a rate of 4 l h

break of the following growing season irrigation amounts received per vine under different treatments during different periods of phenological stages in each year are shown in supplemental table 1 2 4 phenology observations of phenological stages of grapevine for all treatments were recorded according to the bbch scale for bud break stage 09 flowering stage 65 fruit set stage 71 and veraison stage

midday stem water potential measurements water status of single vines was determined by midday stem water potential ψstem md measurements mccutchan and shackel 1992 using the pressure bomb method scholander et al 1965 three central vines in the middle rows of each treatment plot were selected for measurement one leaf on the east side of each vine was covered with a plastic bag inside an aluminum foil exterior envelope and allowed to equilibrate for an hour prior to sampling to prevent overheating by the sun and to equilibrate with the stem water potential by avoiding further natural transpiration from the leaf which alters the resultant pressure reading choné et al 2001 the encased leaf was detached from the vine by severing the petiole with a razor blade then quickly removed from the bag and inserted into a pressure chamber 3000 series soilmoisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa leaf samples were pressurized with nitrogen gas to the point of sap movement from the cut petiole pressures were measured in bars then converted to mega pascals measurements were taken at three key stages of grapevine development fruit set veraison and harvest during the growing seasons in 2016 and 2017 a total of 9 leaf samples one leaf sample from each of 9 different vines were measured per treatment per sampling date 2 6 root phenotyping to compare effects of water delivery depth on root number and length in shallow soil 0 60 cm three vines from each treatment of delivery depth at the high irrigation rate were selected for in situ root imaging the schematic of the in situ root imaging system is shown in fig 2 transparent acrylic tubes which were 80 cm long with inner diameter of 6 35 cm were installed at an angle of 15 to the vertical and 30 cm from the vine trunk which allows observation of roots within a 60 cm depth the exposed top 8 10 cm of the root tubes was covered with silver tape and sealed with rubber caps to avoid disturbance from light on root growth root images were taken using the ci 600 in situ root imager cid bio science camas wa usa at a dpi of 300 with three images taken along the length of each tube the root imager was operated using a tablet computer and ci 600 software https cid inc com support ci 600 software calibration by inserting the root imager in a white calibration tube and pressing the calibration button in the ci 600 software was performed each time the root imager was connected to the tablet computer before root imaging to ensure image quality and color accuracy as per the manufacturer s instructions after calibration the root imager was inserted into each root tube with collapsible measuring rods connected to adjust its position each scan of roots at a certain depth provided a nearly 360 degree image which was manually saved under identified folders in a tablet computer for further phenotypic analysis the size of each root image was 19 6 cm wide and 21 5 cm long with approximately 0 8 cm overlap of adjacent images to ensure the entire root area of interest was scanned root images were taken at three phenological stages fruit set veraison and harvest in 2016 and 2017 root images were imported and analyzed by using rootsnap image analysis software version 1 3 2 25 cid bio science camas wa usa software was installed on a computer with a multi touch lcd screen allowing tactile root tracing images were categorized through software based on date root tube number and window images were categorized by depth from the surface within the same root tube each root image was imported into a window and three continuous windows were created per root tube window alignment was done by using the window alignment tool to remove the overlapped area before mapping the roots total root number and length were automatically calculated by manually adding or editing points to create lines based on root images and all data were exported into an excel spreadsheet for statistical analyses 2 7 grape yield and quality dates for grape harvest were chosen by technical staff of the commercial vineyard during this study harvest took place between 56 and 61 days after veraison depending on the year at harvest each vine was harvested by hand and weighed on site within each treatment block 2 3 clusters of grapes from each of three central vines in the same treatment plot were pooled packaged on ice and delivered immediately to a nearby commercial laboratory ets laboratories walla walla wa usa for quality analyses titratable acidity and tss brix were determined on a fourier transformed mid infrared analyzer using an iso 17025 accredited technique tannin and anthocyanins were extracted using a proprietary wine like extract briefly grapes were lightly macerated no broken seeds 15 ethanol was added and the mixture heated to extract wine like levels of tannin analysis of grape extracts was performed using an agilent 1290 hplc with the method described by waterhouse et al 1999 tannin is reported as catechin equivalents and anthocyanins as malvin equivalents 2 8 crop water use efficiency grape yield and total water use amount during the active growth period in each year were considered to quantify crop water use efficiency wuec medrano et al 2015 wuec was calculated as wuec grape yield per ha total water use amount in kg ha 1 mm 1 irrigation plus rainfall from bud break to harvest 2 9 statistical analyses data were analyzed separately by year a two way analysis of variance anova was used to compare treatment effects on grape yield and crop water use efficiency and one way anova was used to compare effects of single treatment on midday stem water potential grape quality and root phenotyping comparisons of irrigation treatment groups were performed with tukey s hsd test at p value

data from 2015 to 2017 are reported in table 1 variability in the total rainfall is shown over the three years with the highest amount in 2017 222 5 mm and lower and similar amounts between 2015 192 3 mm and 2016 199 9 mm rainfall before bud break was significantly higher in 2017 121 4 mm than in 2015 49 8 mm and 2016 66 5 mm table 2 and was extremely limited during the summer across all three years of the study table 1 the hottest year was 2015 with 0 8 c and 2 2 c higher in annual temperature compared to 2016 and 2017 respectively average temperature before bud break was approximately 3 5 c lower in 2017 than in 2015 and 2016 however average temperature around bud break a week before plus a week after this stage 14 days was 5 1 c and 1 5 c lower in 2015 than in 2016 and 2017 respectively between the stages of flowering and veraison average temperature was approximately 2 0 c higher in 2015 than in 2016 and 2017 and both the average maximum and minimum temperatures around stages of flowering and fruit set were significantly higher 3 0 c 4 0 c in 2015 than in other two years the highest annual eto was in 2015 and the lowest annual eto was in 2017 1255 3 mm and 1064 5 mm respectively table 1 3 2 phenology to map the development of vines over the course of the study all data are reported as the average of all treatments with an assumption that the irrigation system had no effect on vine phenology table 2 bud break was 12 days earlier in 2015 and 13 days earlier in 2016 compared to 2017 which had later bud break likely due to cooler winter and lower spring temperatures however higher temperatures that occurred from july to august in 2017 compared to 2015 and 2016 table 1 likely shortened the differences in doy for veraison 2 days and 8 days earlier in 2015 and 2016 respectively across three year study period numbers of days from the date of bud break to the date of harvest were similar with 173 170 and 168 days in total in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively 3 3 midday stem water potential based on our preliminary data data not shown and the previous study with related measurements at this location espinoza et al 2017 delivery depth showed no significant effect on water status in grapevine changes in ψstem md under different irrigation rates with the same delivery depth 60 cm were reported in fig 3 overall ψstem md decreased with the extension of deficit irrigation with the most negative readings occurring at harvest in 2016 grapevines had significantly higher values of ψstem md under high irrigation rate than under moderate and low irrigation rates across all three phenological stages changes in ψstem md showed rapidly once treatments were applied at fruit set with 12 and 39 declines at moderate and low irrigation rates respectively compared to the high irrigation rate moreover differences in ψstem md became more significant at veraison 13 and 45 declines at moderate and low rates respectively occurring with higher daily temperatures around this stage although significant differences in ψstem md existed between moderate and low irrigation rates at fruit set and veraison no significant difference was found between these two irrigation rates at harvest the stage with increased rainfall and decreased daily temperature fig 3 in 2017 mean values of ψstem md decreased with reduced irrigation rate however no statistical difference of ψstem md was found between different irrigation rates at each of the three key phenological stages measured fig 3 3 4 root phenotyping representative raw and mapped root images were selected to show root distributions of cabernet sauvignon grapevines around each root tube at a 0 60 cm soil depth under three water delivery depths fig 4 decreased root density was observed with the increase in delivery depth from fig 4a to c root image analyses showed that rapid increases in root number and length occurred between the stages of fruit set and veraison and no significant increase in both root number and length was found from veraison to harvest in both years fig 5 increases in delivery depth from 30 cm to 90 cm decreased total root number 60 and total root length 46 at harvest in 2016 likewise total root number decreased 70 and total root length decreased 59 at harvest in 2017 no difference in total root number or length was found between different delivery depths at fruit set in both years except for total root number in 2017 where there was 45 decrease in root number at the 90 cm delivery depth compared to the 30 cm delivery depth no significant difference in total root number and length was found between 30 cm and 60 cm delivery depths in our study fig 5 3 5 grape yield and quality grape yields under different irrigation rates and water delivery depths were compared within each year fig 6 decreases in irrigation rate resulted in decreased grape yield per vine during the first two years of study fig 6a b under the same treatment level e g high irrigation rate 30 cm delivery depth grape yields both in 2016 and 2017 were generally higher than in 2015 compared to the high rate of irrigation within the first two years the moderate rate 34 36 decreased water use and low rate 51 53 decreased water use resulted in 15 18 and 22 27 yield declines respectively however irrigation rate had no significant influence on grape yield in 2017 fig 6c no significant difference in yield was found between different delivery depths and no interaction effect was found between irrigation rate and delivery depth on grape yield within each year since no significant effect of water delivery depth and no interaction effect were found on grape yield we specifically investigated the influence of irrigation rate using the drz system on four grape qualitative parameters in 2016 and 2017 fig 7 the grape quality parameters measured were variable between different years and partially affected by irrigation rate values of tss were significantly affected by irrigation rate in both years and grapes at the low irrigation rate had higher brix values in both years although the difference became statistically insignificant between moderate and low rates in 2017 fig 7c d in 2016 the highest tss value was 28 6 brix at low irrigation rate combined with the highest total anthocyanins at 1480 mg l 1 and the lowest titratable acidity at 4 9 g l 1 fig 7 a c g in addition mean values of total anthocyanins increased and titratable acidity decreased with decreasing irrigation rate although no statistical difference was found in 2017 fig 7a b g h no significant difference in tannin content was observed across the two growing seasons fig 7e f with the exception of tss no significant differences in grape quality parameters were found in 2017 fig 7b d f h 3 6 crop water use efficiency wuec was generally higher at the lowest irrigation rate and decreased with increasing irrigation rate table 3 increases in wuec from high to moderate rates became more significant in 2016 and 2017 23 and 39 increases respectively than in 2015 14 increase the first year for our treatment application likewise increases in wuec from high to low rates were more significant in 2016 and 2017 37 and 62 increases respectively than in 2015 34 increase no difference was found between delivery depths within each growing season across the three years of study table 3 in addition no interaction effect between irrigation rate and delivery depth was found on wuec during this study 4 discussion this study supports the potential application of drz for sustaining grape yield with reduced water supply in a semi arid climate no significant difference in yield was found across all treatments in 2017 which could be attributed to cooler and wetter weather lanari et al 2014 reported that increased rainfall and decreased temperature alleviated soil water scarcity which diminished the influence of deficit irrigation on grape yield grapevines had the lowest yield in 2015 which was probably due to not only the extremely dry growing season but also the variation in air temperature lower temperature around bud break may have decreased the flower size and proportion of flowers that set fruit resulting in decreased yields as reported by keller et al 2010b meanwhile higher daytime temperatures around the flowering stage might also be detrimental to fruit set and ovule fertility resulting in lower yield kliewer 1977 pagay and collins 2018 recovery of grape yield in 2016 could be ascribed to normal weather condition sadras et al 2017 pointed out the resilience of grapevine yield after experiencing yield reduction however the physiological rationales behind it are not well explained and require further investigation midday stem water potential ψstem md has proven to be a robust and practical measurement of water stress and closely related to physiological responses at the leaf e g stomatal conductance and whole plant levels shackel 2011 vines under increasing water deficit resulted in a gradual increase in plant water stress fereres and soriano 2007 which was observed in our study earlier basal leaf abscissions after veraison only occurred under the lowest irrigation rate in 2016 which could be ascribed to either the insufficient water supply for minimum daily water demand in grapevines or uneven water distribution by sdi that triggered chemical signaling from roots in dry zone for defoliation pisciotta et al 2018 significant decreases in ψstem md were found with decreased irrigation rates during the 2016 growing season which were in accordance with changes in grape yield however no significant difference was found at each of three phenological stages examined in 2017 which was likely due to high rainfall before fruit set savi et al 2018 also found that increased ψstem md was accompanied by increases in rainfall which interfered the effect of irrigation treatment grapevine phenology is influenced by weather conditions jones and davis 2000 van leeuwen and darriet 2016 based on a long term study on vitis vinifera l grapevine phenology tomasi et al 2011 found that decreased average temperatures early in the year delayed bud break and increased maximum temperature between fruit set and pre veraison advanced the date of veraison we found similar patterns in our study lower average temperatures from january to may in 2017 prolonged the date of bud break however higher maximum temperatures in july and august helped accelerate the date of veraison to the average for southcentral washington deficit irrigation was not applied until the end of june in 2017 which shortened the period of water stress in grapevine from fruit set to veraison and thus likely diminished the treatment effects on grape production due to the significant influences of early water deficit on vigor control and berry development of red wine grapes keller 2010a munitz et al 2017 in previous studies on grapes and on other crops subsurface water delivery depth varied and did not exceed a soil depth of 45 cm barth 1999 bhattarai et al 2008 camp et al 1999 jordan et al 2014 lanier et al 2004 machado et al 2003 martínez gimeno et al 2018 pisciotta et al 2018 however roots could reach depths below 1 m smart et al 2006 and functional rooting depth for water uptake is highly variable in grapevines with deeper roots for accessing to water deeper in the soil profile from fruit set to harvest karakis et al 2018 thus starting to deliver the water directly into the lower functional root zone at fruit set may maximize crop water use efficiency and promote water conservation this study extended the delivery depth to 90 cm deep soil and found decreases in root number and length within the top 60 cm of soil with increased delivery depth suggesting a deep root system might have developed below 60 cm of soil for water acquisition deep rooting permits plants to access deeper sources of soil water allowing vines to avoid severe water stress during periods of high temperatures and lack of rainfall savi et al 2018 besides recovery of the grape yield in 2016 from the previous year could be also attributed to the development of the root system for water and nutrient acquisitions according to a previous study on concord grape in southcentral washington stout et al 2017 however we did not find a significant effect of delivery depth on grape yield or water status in grapevines within each year of our study which might be explained by two reasons either with frequent irrigation most roots tend to concentrate near the point of water delivery for available irrigated water machado et al 2003 or vertical water drainage in loamy sand soil diminishes the differences in soil water content between subsoils below different water delivery depths where deep roots take groundwater to compensate for water deficit in grapevines van leeuwen et al 2004 future work should examine water and root distributions deeper in the soil profile decreased irrigation rates through drz enhanced or at least sustained grape quality over two years of our study additionally moderate irrigation rate seems more favorable for sugar accumulation in berries with minimum yield loss which is in accordance with previous studies acevedo opazo et al 2010 deloire et al 2004 van leeuwen et al 2009 lower brix values in 2017 could be attributed to higher temperatures after veraison which reduced accumulation of soluble sugars in berries kuhn et al 2014 moreover deficit irrigation has been proven as a useful tool to regulate moderate water stress in grapevine which helps accumulate some secondary metabolites to improve grape and wine quality teixeira et al 2013 many studies have reported higher contents of tannins and anthocyanins in red wine grapes e g vitis vinifera l cv cabernet sauvignon and merlot under moderate water deficit casassa et al 2015 kennedy et al 2002 van leeuwen et al 2009 sivilotti et al 2005 however efficiency of this regulation is largely affected by environmental variation downey et al 2006 teixeira et al 2013 which was also found in our study no significant difference in contents of tannins and total anthocyanins under different irrigation rates in 2017 was probably due to increased total rainfall before fruit set higher temperature and increased diurnal temperature fluctuation in the late growing season which decreased water deficit in grapevines and restricted synthesis of phenolics cohen et al 2008 koundouras et al 2006 titratable acidity which strongly influences juice stability positively correlated with irrigation rate in 2016 however lower acidity with no statistical difference was found in the following year which is also possibly due to decreased water deficit mirás avalos and intrigliolo 2017 nadal and arola 1995 many studies on different crops have shown the improvement of water use efficiency through sdi ayars et al 2015 lamm and trooien 2003 machado and oliveira 2005 mo et al 2017 pisciotta et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 however the relevant research on grapevine is still limited and needs to be expanded in our study improvement of wuec was achieved with around 35 water saving while minimizing yield loss under variation in weather conditions proving the efficacy of the drz system on optimization of water use as a novel type of sdi system no difference in wuec was found between delivery depths which can be attributed to the traits of loamy sand soil and limitations of current drz systems increased delivery depth may not significantly reduce the soil evaporation and the current drz system may not efficiently reduce water drainage or improve the lateral water distribution within the root zone of grapevine in hezel loamy fine sand enhancement of the drz system could be achieved by improving the design to adjust the position and angle of insertion for water delivery tubes to increase the irrigated area and water availability within root zone of grapevines and by amortizing the expense for utilizing the drz system through improved grape quality reduced water fungicide and herbicide use and use of system components with a longer lifespan and lower price additionally the longevity of the system and the economic and environmental returns should be clearly evaluated over a long term study e g 10 years and the efficiency of drz system should be compared with other traditional irrigation systems under different environmental conditions which will better define the optimum scenarios for adoption of the drz strategy 5 conclusions this study proposed a novel subsurface drip irrigation system termed direct root zone irrigation drz which sustained grape production with 35 less water use in vineyards on a loamy sand soil in an arid environment this irrigation system can help enhance water management in vineyards by delivering water directly to the root zone of grapevines with flexible choices for irrigation rate and delivery depth moreover the drz system provides a potential to encourage deep rooting which may help grapevines access water from deeper soil depths to better perform during drought depending on soil type design of the current drz system could be improved to enhance water availability in the root zone of grapevines and to increase overall profitability moreover future studies should compare the efficiency and longevity of drz system with other traditional irrigation systems under different environments to better define the optimum conditions and economic and environmental returns for successful adoption of the drz strategy acknowledgements this research was supported by washington state department of agriculture specialty crop
